Footnotes
CHIEF KIMOSABI forwardly placed into the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, advanced quickly on that rival and lodged an inside bid far turn,
held a narrow advantage into the stretch, expanded that margin a bit with the other two members of the first flight coming wide into the lane, showed the
way past the furlong marker by a diminishing amount, was bumped soon after by MO CREDO who was carried in by a lugging FLASHBACK WIND,
outdueled that pair to the wire to prevail in game fashion. MO CREDO took command past the wire the first time, stretched that advantage out the middle
half, allowed the winner the inside early in the far turn to lose the advantage, battled on through that bend while getting out and carrying FLASHBACK WIND
five wide into the lane, was in turn pushed in by that rival to soundly bump with the winner past the furlong marker, narrowly gained the nod for the place
while between foes at the wire. FLASHBACK WIND unhurried early, advanced into contention on the outside early in the final turn, carried out five wide by
the runner up turning for home, lugged in past midstretch pushing that rival into the winner with a sound bump the result, outkicked in the final strides to
narrowly miss. I'M A FLASHY KID chased the runner up early, fell back before a half, not a threat to the top three in the drive in finishing up evenly.
PROUDTOWN broke alertly, fell back off the pace, failed to muster a rally. RICKY BOBBY last away, trailed throughout in failing to threaten. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF FLASHBACK WIND AGAINST MO CREDO
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE FINAL TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
GUILTY AGAIN broke on top, dueled in the two path up the backstretch and through the early part of the turn, maintained a daylight advantage through the
stretch while being kept to task. HOT LE ROY raced closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, could do little with the
winner the final furlong, clearly second best. ROCK ON COWBOY fell back along the inside into the turn, moved out and came four wide for the drive, along
for the show with some mild, belated interest down the middle of the strip. CAEUS IN PASADENA away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner for
three furlongs and began to weaken. SHANGHAI BROTHER broke a step slow, raced back, ranged up closer to briefly race in contention late in the final
turn then flattened out through the stretch.

Footnotes
I'M A SPECIAL STAR broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, roused into the lane when clear and maintained a daylight
advantage to the wire under continued steady handling. LOUISIANA HERO broke back, checked up soon after, continued back into the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be getting to his entrymate. WAR SONG in the second group while racing off the inside,
three wide through most of the turn, dropped inside for the drive,improved to race closest to the winner past the sixteenth marker, caught late for the second
spot. YES BAB fell back off the pace, continued back turn off the inside, angled out to be four wide into the stretch while inside the runner up, failed to match
strides with that one to the wire while improving position a bit. JONATHAN WHO hesitated at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, remained back
into the turn, loomed a threat four wide late in the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker then flattened out to lose several positions late. MAKATI
PHIL broke back, lodged an early move to reach closest to the winner while four wide early in the turn, gave way in the drive. JAZZ IT UP forwardly placed
early while rank along the inside, began a steady fade along the rail before three furlongs. ADIOS YANKEE chased the winner early, began a steady retreat
after a quarter.

Footnotes
FORT BONZ in mid pack early along the inside, moved closer into the far turn, behind traffic through much of that bend while continuing to save some
ground, got through a large opening past the furlong marker, edging clear late under firm handling. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST forwardly placed from the
start, advanced and challenged four wide into the stretch, continued to vie upper stretch, came in under a repeated right handed stick to bother DRAFT
CHOCE inside the furlong marker causing that one to check up, drew clear of that one for the second spot while unable to get to the winner. DRAFT
CHOICE stalked the leader off the inside, challenged that one midway on the final turn, three wide into the stretch, bothered, checked up when
CUSTOMIZE QUEST drifted in, did not recover. BLAZING CHARLIE dwelt at the start spotting the field several lengths, raced back, rallied four wide out of
the final turn, improved position well out in the strip while not a threat to the top three. UNBRIDLED PULPIT void of speed, continued back final turn,
between foes into the stretch, picked off some tiring rivals while also not a serious threat. CORN SOUP broke on top, set the pace along the inside through
some comfortable fractions, caved in when headed by DRAFT CHOICE in the final turn. KILLINGSWORTH in mid pack early, was finished after a half.
MAJESTIC SOCIETY four wide in the first turn when with the main body, steadily faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
THROUGH THE STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF DRAFT CHOICE AGAINST CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
CREOLE BABY narrowly outbroke rivals, set a pressured pace up the backstretch and into the turn, lengthy stretch duel, inched away past the furlong
marker then had enough left late to hold the runner up safe in the final strides. ROUX BANDIT pressed the issue early in the two path, raced on equal terms
with the winner into the stretch, continued to duel, fell back a bit with a furlong remaining, coming back late to miss. TAKENFORGRANTED last to leave,
void of speed for a half, dropped inside for the drive, improved up the rail to annex the show, not a serious threat to the top two. TIME TO SLEEP also well
back off the early pace, four wide into the stretch, improved a bit, outkicked for the show spot. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE with the early leaders while
between horses, shuffled back early in the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. OUR STARLET prompted the issue early inside,
also was shuffled back to lose position while along the inside with three furlongs remaining, weakened through the lane. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT forced the
issue three wide for a half, was appearing to tire in mid stretch when she ducked out, continued to weaken to the wire.

WILD MALLORY sprinted clear soon after an alert break, set all the pace by daylight, enough left to hold the rest safe in the late going. HARRIET'S DREAM
chased the winner off the inside, continued to be that one's closing pursuer into the straight, made little progress until late when carving into the advantage
in the waning strides. SUMMERTIME BANDIT went one paced throughout, could do little with the runner up late, managed to save the show. PUZZLING
PRIORITY one paced while along the inside, continued to save ground into the lane, not enough for the show late. ROARING QUINN last to leave, was
never a threat. STELLA'S SURPRISE was also finished early, well beaten. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

SPECIAL CONNECTION with the early while between foes into the first turn, showed the way onto and up the backstretch, headed from the outside in the
second turn, fell a bit further upper stretch, battled back and put a head back in front with a furlong remaining, edged clear late under steady handling.
SAVVY SHIPMAN within striking distance along the inside, shifted out late in the final turn, three wide for the drive, up late for the runner up position.
SNOWBALL behind the first flight, advanced far turn, put a head in front midway on that bend, extended that advantage a bit when straightened for home,
hung the final furlong to lose not only the lead but to be caught for the second spot. TECATE TIME lacked early foot, continued back while saving ground
second turn, moved out a bit for the drive, lacked necessary closing response. CATCAKE lunged just prior to the break to rock back and be away slowly,
continued to race back while outside, also failed to muster a rally when called on into the stretch. SMOK'N RITA pressed the issue early, was finished after a
half.

Footnotes
BITSY C C LIL GIRL never far back off the inside, ranged up three wide to challenge the two leaders late in the turn, quickly clear past the furlong marker,
as she pleased late in expanding that advantage to win ridden out. JUST A WIN in the second flight off the inside, roused for the drive, rallied to be in time
for the place, no threat to the winner. TWO PUNCH FIST broke alertly, narrowly set early pace, dueled turn closest to the inside, proved no match for the
winner in chasing that one past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. EASY IS GOOD void of speed off the inside, displayed a mild, belated amount
of interest to improve position, not a serious threat. CAESAR'S CALPURNIA lacked speed outside, four wide through the turn, made little impact through the
stretch. SONGS DISCREET CAT last away, moved up to race in mid pack along the inside, saved ground to no avail in lacking a closing response. D'LADY
FIRED UP broke in good order, pressed the issue early, dueled through the turn in the two path, gave way in the drive. DOUBLE APPEAL broke back and
was always outrun while racing outside.
