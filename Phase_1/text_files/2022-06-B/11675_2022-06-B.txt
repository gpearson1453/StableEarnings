Footnotes
MAYOR REMO stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, moved up two wide around the far turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole and
drew off under a drive. OCTOBER TIME settled off the pace while racing three wide, bid three deep nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was clearly second
best in the lane. DRUM AND DRUMMER was in range inside, went two wide around the far turn, lacked the needed rally and bested the rest. TAPATERM
failed to menace while racing two wide. FORTY FLASH set a clear pace inside, gave way near the five-sixteenths pole and retreated inside. WAR
FEATHER was outrun inside.

Footnotes
STAR JUANCHO tracked the pace inside down the backstretch, angled three wide entering the turn, cruised up to the lead near the quarter pole and drew
off through the lane. VINNIE VAN GO dueled inside of COMPLEX SYSTEM to the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner from there but stayed
on willingly to hold the place. JETTIN OUT saved ground off the pace, tipped out in midstretch and bested the rest. LOUD N PROUD chased the pace four
wide and lacked the needed rally. PALADIO failed to menace while racing two wide. COMPLEX SYSTEM dueled two wide, continued on the left lead in the
lane and wilted. BERHANU broke awkwardly and trailed inside.

UNCORK THE BOTTLE saved ground in range, steadily gained inside of the pacesetter in the lane, took the lead late and just held off the runner-up. MR
TITO'S settled off the early pace, raced four wide around the turn, could make little progress while still on the left lead to the sixteenth pole, finally switched
over near that marker, surged outside and just missed. AIN'T WASTING TIME set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, led until
deep stretch but could not hold off rivals on either side. CHUCKY was fractious in the gate, pressed the pace three wide, could not quite keep pace in upper
stretch but churned on through the wire. HIERRO chased the pace two wide and faded through the lane. TONE FEELIN trailed in the four path. THIS RACE
