Footnotes
SPECIAL FREEDOM tracked Some is Nine down the backstretch while racing two wide, took command near the three eighths pole, was asked through the
upper stretch and drew off to be well clear while racing near the rail under steady pressure. HEIDI T stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch,
made a three wide bid through the far turn, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and was no match for the winner late. EMBRACE THE WHINNY
settled off the early pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, raced towards the outside through the stretch run and had not enough for the top pair.
EMMA DEVINE chased the early pace from the outside, moved in to race near the rail through the turn, angled four wide through the upper stretch and had
no late rally. SOME IS NINE was sent along to set the early pace, raced near the inside and weakened through the stretch run. MARTHARITA was
unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide through the far turn, was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. BLESS AND
HONOR was slow early on to race at the back of the pack, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
BOAT'S A ROCKIN was keen early on to set the pace while racing well, was asked through the upper stretch and held well to remain clear under strong
handling. TOE CURLIN' KISS settled off the early going, made an advance through the far turn, rallied between traffic while racing four wide and got up for
the place position. ATREYU settled off the early going, made a good three wide bid near the quarter pole, raced near the five path late and kept on to the
wire. SUPER E was unhurried early on to race near midpack, raced near the inside near the quarter pole, raced four to three deep in the drive and had not
enough. RESIDENT LIBERAL dropped back off the early going, raced between rivals near the three eighths pole, made a five wide bid and closing run.
SPEED GAME dropped back soon after the break, was a bit rank early, checked in the early going, moved up through the far turn, raced six wide into the
upper stretch and moved up. CAPTAIN THUNDER stalked the pace from the outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile while racing four wide.
POSTERITY was slow early on, raced four to five wide in the stretch run and had no response. BELTWAY BOB raced off the early pace, checked near the
three eighths pole, raced four wide through the far turn, shifted out and lacked a rally. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) raced three wide near the seven eighths
pole, moved up down the backstretch and faded in the drive. BREVARD PLACE failed to sustain a bid. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU was forwardly placed to
lay up close in the early stages and tired while racing near the rail.

Footnotes
FRIGHTLAND pressed Grand Master nearing the three eighths pole, took command and was clear late under a steady hand ride the final eighth of a mile.
GRAND MANNER showed good early speed to set the pace, was challenged near the three eighths pole while racing near the inside and was no match for
the winner. COVERT KAT stalked the early pace, raced two to three wide and raced along for third. QAADER was slow early, raced six wide near the three
sixteenths pole, raced near the outside in the stretch and had no final run. SURPRISE HELLO dropped back early on, raced along the inside around the far
turn and had no late rally. SAM LORDS settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. JAHEZ was
forwardly paced to lay up close early on and tired while racing near the inside.

Footnotes
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE was allowed to settle off the early going, moved up along the inside in the far turn through the stretch, made a good rail bid and
proved best under strong encouragement. SUE LOVES BARBADOS settled to the middle of the pack early on, angled five to six wide through the drive and
finished willingly to the wire. PRINCE PERE stalked the pace while racing two wide, experienced traffic through the stretch run, raced three wide while
racing between rivals and moved up. BENNY HAVENS was slow early, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled six wide and closed belatedly.
MONSTER MASON dropped back early on, raced three wide around the turn, swung five to six wide and moved up. ACE NINE NINE settled off the pace,
made a good rail bid in the drive but had not enough late. HELLO AMIGO raced three deep near the quarter pole, angled widest through the lane and never
was a factor. PREMIERE CHOICE showed good early speed to duel early on and faded while racing four wide. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN dueled for the early
while inside, took over in upper stretch, briefly spurted clear, failed to contain threats past mid stretch and weakened. GRAND SKYLARK moved up three
wide between foes mid turn, chased and faded. AL LOVES JOSIE dropped back early, raced towards the inside and had no response. DATHOSS was
forwardly placed from the outside, raced four wide near the quarter pole and tired.

DESHACKLED stalked the dueling pair, moved up three wide through the far turn to challenge, dug in late and proved best under strong pressure. DIVINE
PROPORTION settled off the early duel, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire. SILENT SERVICE dueled for
the early lead while racing two wide and weakened the final furlong. HAIR OF THE DOG dropped back early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole,
raced three to four wide in the drive and had no late rally. SNOW CANDY was off a step slow, raced near the inside around the far turn, shifted out four wide
and never threatened. THE CAIRO KID dueled for the early lead and faded along the inside.
