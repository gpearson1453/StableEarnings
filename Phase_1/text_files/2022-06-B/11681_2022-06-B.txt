LUVLUV settled three then four wide early, raced two wide into the far turn, angled out at the five-sixteenths pole, came five wide into the stretch, drew
alongside the leader at the eighth pole and dug in late to edge the runner-up. ECHOSMITH (IRE) sped to the front in the two path, took pressure early on
the backstretch before moving clear at the five-eighths, challenged again on the far turn, responded when called upon and shook free at the five-sixteenths
pole, received the challenge from LUVLUV with a furlong remaining and yielded grudgingly in the end. SYNTHESIS pulled a bit three then four wide on the
first turn, stalked the top pair from outside to the far turn, went three then four wide on that turn as well, finished evenly down the lane and held the show.
TRUTH SEEKER broke out trailed four then five wide on the first turn, went two wide into the second bend then eased out to the four path leaving the turn,
lacked room behind rivals at the quarter pole, tipped to the outside and needed to find more late. SECRET TOUCH brushed the gate and came away a bit
slow, stalked three wide early then applied some pressure early on the backstretch, lost touch with the leader at the five-eighths pole, challenged again into
the far turn, could not keep up late on the bend and chased three wide into the lane and weakened. COMRADERY (IRE) broke a bit slow from outside, went
two then three wide on the first turn, raced a bit off the rail into the far turn, eased out to the three path and weakened.

Footnotes
ROSE GIRL chased the top pair from outside, bid three then four wide on the turn, carried a short lead into the final furlong and gamely prevailed. THE
REIGN SONG showed brief speed between rivals then chased the top pair to the turn, went two to three wide around the bend, rallied from inside and got
up for second. COCKTAIL PRINCESS dueled for command three deep then outside a rival, vied between on the turn then three wide into the stretch, fought
back into the final sixteenth and got edged for the place. ONE SMOKIN MOON tracked off the inside, came four wide into the lane and lacked a bid. YO YO
MAMA broke a bit slow and got bumped twice at the start, drifted out into a rival and checked at the seven-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch and
lacked a rally. CAANFOOLERY broke in and bumped rival twice leaving the gate, got carried wide early on the turn, entered the stretch five wide and was
not a factor. SHE'S SO FANCY sent for the front from inside, vied for command to the five-eighths pole, chased the top pair to the stretch and faded.
