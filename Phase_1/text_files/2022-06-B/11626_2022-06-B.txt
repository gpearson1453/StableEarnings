and lasted. PASSWORD PROTECTED , a forward factor in the three path around the turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch, closed and switched to
his left lead late. BILLINGSGATE , steadied when forced in by the winner soon after the start, stalked the pace two wide on the turn, shifted to the three path
in upper stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. DUDE AND JUMPER showed speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and
weakened. SCHOOLYARD BULLY was not a factor. NO MONEY DOWN , shuffled back soon after the break, was not a factor. CHAUFFEUR was outrun.

Footnotes
DREAM HAPPY vied outside a rival then went clear into the turn, set a rated pace off the inside around the turn, wandered outward a bit entering the lane,
was quickly righted and held firm while kept to task. MUGSY MALONE , three wide stalking the early pace, came four wide for the drive and kept on well to
the wire. BROTHER CONWAY forced the issue two wide, shifted in for the drive and continued with effort. WINSTON'S GOLD chased off the rail and lacked
a bid. UNCOMMON VALOR broke a step slow, raced off the pace, came four wide fro the drive and lacked a serious kick. DISPUTED NOTION , urged
inside contesting the early pace, saw the winner get away leaving the far turn, stayed with willing pursuit to upper stretch then gave way. HOWARD'S ROCK
failed to keep pace and faltered.

Footnotes
GERRYS GEM saved ground around the turn, disputed the pace inside ILLUMINATO throughout, drifted out late and narrowly prevailed.
BELIEVEINROCKNROLL bore in leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside the winner, drifted out in the drive and just missed.
CALLYOURIGHTBACK lacked speed, was five deep turning for home, rallied and drifted in late. BIG DADDY D R , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate,
raced inside horses through the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. GORUN lacked speed, raced in the three path turning for home and came up empty.
GALWAY LAD hugged the inner rail on the turn and weakened through the stretch. BOURBONONTHEROCKS , no factor, steadied between horses in
upper stretch. WATERMELON CRUSH was outrun. An objection by the rider of BOURBONONTHEROCKS against CALLYOURIGHTBACK for alleged
interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
ALBERTANO settled off the inside and off of a contested pace, responded when called upon nearing the far turn, rolled up four wide to engage rivals from
the outside leaving the three eighths, shook clear under a drive in upper stretch, drifted in past the furlong grounds, remained on his left lead until late and
prevailed. UNCLE JEROME bid between foes early on and dueled, inherited the inside past the five eighths, disputed the issue into the far turn, dropped
back some near the five sixteenths, shifted out in upper stretch and came back in solid fashion between runners to gain the place. JASONTAKESLONG
tracked four wide outside foes past the seven eighths, bid three deep approaching the far turn, dueled leaving the three eighths, fought on to the inside of
the winner heading towards the lane and gave way grudgingly. GHOSTLIGHTER led three wide early then was joined by a pair of rivals to his inside around
the first turn, dueled then held a short lead between runners heading to the far turn, failed to contain the winner past the three eighths, gave willing pursuit
into the lane then faded. KRUG dropped in early and got a nice stalking spot off of a contested pace, eased out under pressure past the five sixteenths,
chased three wide into the lane and gave way. CAPTAIN CARDO , off the pace, angled out near the three eighths, came four wide for the drive but lacked a
bid. AXXERATOR broke inward, rushed up to the inside of foes into the first turn, dueled through about a half mile, dropped back and attempted to get out
leaving the far turn then faltered.

Footnotes
BLUE COLLAR BOOM , rated back leaving the backstretch, eased out to the three path on the turn, gained command entering the stretch, was briefly put to
the whip in mid stretch and eagerly pulled away under a hand ride. TAKE CHARGE TOO sprinted cleaer leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn, finished willingly but was no match for the winner. QUINCANNON circled foes on the turn, was four deep approaching the stretch, remained
outside horses and passed tired ones. LUV YA BYE BYE came out at the break, was a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn, angled out for the
drive and retreated. FILIGREE , lightly bumped leaving the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn and was outrun. WE GOT LUCKY , slow to begin,
raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. EYE'N A DEAL broke slowly and was outrun. SWEET STREET , shuffled back after a slow
start, was outrun.

Footnotes
SAMUI SUNSET rated off the early pace, edged up while saving ground leaving the far turn, eased out and bid between foes near the quarter pole, dueled
between runners heading to mid stretch, spurted away while a bit erratic, wandered outward late and was fully extended while getting the bob. AMERICAN
D'ORO stalked in the clear, bid three deep nearing the lane, battled outside rivals past mid stretch, was floated out inside the final furlong, came back with
one final surge and just missed. WICKED PRANKSTER cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by rivals approaching the stretch, dueled
past mid stretch then faded late. SONIC SPEED , in the clear leaving the three eighths, came under pressure three wide while in range past the five
sixteenths but lacked a legitimate finish. DR. FERBER settled off the pace, angled out around the final turn and offered a mild run. RISING PERRY , three to
four wide, failed to kick on under pressure past the three eighths and gave way.

BOWIE TWO STEP , deftly rated back from between horses approaching the half mile pole, stalked the pace around the turn, moved to the four path in
upper stretch, closed resolutely outside horses and was up approaching the finish. POP POP SUSI bore out leaving the starting gate, was taken to the inner
rail after springing clear approaching the half mile pole, remained along the rail and gave way late. MR. MOSLEY , in the three path around the turn, chased
the pace in a willing effort. DR RAGS saved ground around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and was not a factor. MR. FIBONACCI , outrun,
raced along the inner rail around the turn. SLOE GIN BIZ saved ground on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. PAN FOR GOLD , two wide on the turn,
was outrun. BOUBOLINO , along the rail throughout, was outrun.

Footnotes
THE WOLFMAN prompted the pace to the inside of ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG), drew on even terms mid turn, gained a slim lead past the three
sixteenths, dug in tenaciously through the final furlong and held firm after an extended drive. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) sped to a short early lead outside
the winner, dueled head to head from the five sixteenths to inside the sixteenth marker and continued on gamely to the wire. MUTAKAAMIL hopped slightly
at the break, regrouped and edged up four wide heading into the turn, chased the top pair from the three eighths pole to deep stretch but failed to follow
through. E J'S REVENGE , inside rivals pursuing the pace, dropped back mid turn,, shifted out and came back on in willing fashion while missing the show.
SHOULDA HAD IT broke slowly, saved ground into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. ELLAS MY LOVE , three wide chasing the dueling leaders, raced
between runner mid turn and came up empty. AMEN CORNER , sluggish away, angled five to six wide for the drive and lacked a bid. CHRISATUDE , off
the pace, raced seven wide outside foes in upper stretch and failed to menace.

E. P. MILTON rated forwardly, advanced between runners approaching the stretch, reeled in the leader while under asking in mid stretch, spurted clear,
switched over to his left lead and prevailed. PLAYING GOLD , in the clear early on, angled four wide then moved up between runners near mid stretch,
continued progress under pressure past the sixteenth pole, drew alongside the winner in deep stretch and just missed. STORM TRAPPE vied inside a rival
early, drifted out a bit as the leader kicked away near the far turn, regrouped to pursue and came back between runners late. LAMARKABLE broke slowly,
saved ground into the lane, worked outward through the final furlong and closed between foes. HINDENBURG , four wide with pursuit, kept on with effort
between rivals. GLASTONBURY vied outside a foe then burst away leaving the far turn, held a long lead off the inside into the lane, came in and hit the rail
near the quarter pole, lost the lead with a furlong to go and weakened late. CALL ME A DREAMER , off the pace while saving some ground, worked
outward in the lane, moved up some past the sixteenth marker but was out kicked between horses. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON , three wide early, angled
out to be widest through the lane and had a belated gain. HOOKEAI was outrun.
