Footnotes
BIG BAND LUZZIANN was away alertly taking command on the rail entering the first turn, well rated down the backside, opened up entering the stretch and
was never challenged. KITTEN'S ROMANCE went four wide into the first turn, stalked outside of horses through the backstretch, rallied willingly through the
stretch but could not challenge for the win. STREGA chased the leader just outside through both turns, roused entering the stretch but could not gain on the
leader and levelled off while still holding onto third. SPIDER BELLE rated mid pack while on the rail, lost some ground through the second turn, angled
outside through the stretch showing some interest late. WINYAH BAY was near the rear throughout, asked on the final turn and offered no response.
BOSSALINA was between horses after the break, allowed to settle behind horses while saving ground through the backside and never factored.

Footnotes
STRIBLING showed good early speed from the inside to set the early pace, responded strongly near the three sixteenths pole and was well clear late under
steady handling while continuing to race near the rail. MAMMOTH SPRING was coaxed along in the early going, raced two wide through the far turn, took
aim near the three sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner while racing off inside. AORISTOS stalked the pace, was hard ridden near the three
eighths pole, raced three wide through the upper lane and kept on to the wire. WAR DOCTOR stalked the early going down the backstretch, raced near the
rail at the quarter pole and had no late rally. KATZISALLIHOPEFOR settled off the early going, raced four wide through the far turn and lacked a bid. BOLD
DIAMONDS BFF broke awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of the ground at the start, saved ground and never threatened.

POULIN IN O T was a step slow on the break but quickly recovered to split horses while taking the lead at the half mile pole, opened up through the turn
and was never threatened drawing away convincingly at the end. BOSS HOLIDAY broke sharp to take command, surrendered the lead at the half mile pole
and chased the winner afterwards offering little challenge but still remaining a clear second. SOONER LUNAR was between horses through the backstretch
and turn ,battled willingly with an outside foe down the lane to rebid in the final stages and reclaim the show. TREJO was away alertly outside, lost ground
through the turn while racing three wide ,roused entering the stretch to briefly gain third but levelled out the final sixteenth. FOREST STAR broke inwards
bumping an inside rival, was squeezed then had to be steadied and never reached contention after that.

Footnotes
HATMAKER HOLIDAY pressed MItzi while racing just to the outside of her, led narrowly near the quarter pole and edged clear late under strong handling
while racing near the three path. MEET THE SOPRANO was off a step slow, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted four wide through the upper
stretch and finished well to get up for the place position late. SWIRLING DANCER tracked the top pair down the backstretch while racing three wide and
kept on in the stretch run. MITZI broke sharply to the outside, angled in while being coaxed along the rail to show good early foot weakened in the final
stages. SILENT SCARLET settled off the early pace, raced near the inside into the lane and had no late rally. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH was off slowly, raced
three to four wide in the drive and lacked a bid. MAJESTIC HORIZON broke awkwardly, settled near the back of the pack early, raced towards the outside
around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
LUCKMAN rated kindly mid pack while three wide on both turns, loomed to the lead outside of horses while confidently handled entering the stretch and was
hand ridden to the wire. BELENTIME was away alertly to set a soft pace, surrendered the lead down the backside, was shuffled back through the final turn
on the rail, angled outside for the stretch run and rebid through the lane to capture second place. MYSTIFIED stalked the leaders throughout the early
stages, headed the leader while between horses at the five sixteenths pole only to be quickly overtaken by the eventual winner down the stretch then fading
late to lose second. I AM RESILIENT was near the rear in the early stages while saving ground, angled to the four path around the final turn and showed
some interest through the stretch for a minor share. ROBITAILLE hopped at the start to trail early, was roused entering the final turn and passed tiring foes
through the stretch. BROKE AN BROKEN set slow fractions early while on the rail, was collared at the five sixteenths pole offering no resistance and
backed through the field. BAYTOWN ELVIS saved ground throughout but was never involved.

HELL BENT settled off the early pace, moved up five wide while working between traffic to finish strongly and edge clear late under strong encouragement.
LONG POND was off the early pace, made an advance through the upper stretch, waited for racing room near the three sixteenths pole and rallied well late
while racing three wide. READY HERO stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced four wide near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. TOURIST'S
DREAM stalked the pace, moved up six wide through the upper stretch to challenge and flattened out in the drive. UNILATERAL was off slowly, raced near
the back of the pack early on, was three wide through the far turn, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and moved up late. BENLION dropped
back early on, angled widest through the lane and had not enough in the drive. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL settled off the early going, raced near the inside
around the far turn, angled six to seven wide through the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN was forwardly placed to lay
up close early, was four wide into the upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. MAD DOG N JOE stalked the pace from the inside down the
backstretch, was blocked briefly near the quarter pole, altered in, blocked near the three sixteenths pole, angled out and had not enough late. CHANCEL
pressed the pace from the inside and weakened in the drive while racing near the rail. HIGH HEAT pressed the early going and weakened while three wide
in the final stages. JUST START ME UP experienced traffic near the quarter pole, lost ground and never was a factor. PRINCE OF THIEVES was slow early
on, angled wide through the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
MEYER took a stalking position early, began reeling in the pacesetter at the three eighths pole and was hard ridden in the stretch to finally get past a
stubborn foe in the final sixteenth. BOHEMIAN BOY was well rated setting all the fractions and gave way grudgingly on the rail in the final sixteenth.
RELIABILITY was three wide going into the first turn, rated mid pack down the backstretch and rallied mildly through the final turn and stretch but could not
challenge the top two. CANADIAN PHAROAH broke out at the start, rated near the back in the early stages and finished evenly to get a small share.
ARGENTIUM trailed throughout and passed a stopping foe entering the stretch. GANCHO chased the speed on the rail, began fading at the three eighths
pole and had nothing left down the lane.

Footnotes
SOUPER RIVER pressed the early leader down the backstretch, had a narrow lead nearing the quarter pole and responded well in the drive to prove best
under strong handling while racing two to three wide;. PERFECT CRIME was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up five to six wide through the
upper stretch and finished well to get up for the place position late. GALVASTON stalked the pace, moved up three wide through the far turn to challenge
and kept on to the wire. GOZILLA settled off the early going, raced three wide between foes in the drive and kept on willingly to the wire. COMMANDER
JOE was put in tight quarters early on by Mr Crowley, tracked the pace from the inside and had no final response. NEWPORT AGENT was off the early
pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and lacked a final bid. CALL MY BANKER dropped back early, moved up four wide through the far turn,
fanned six wide through the upper stretch and had no response. MR CROWLEY was sent along from the outside, angled to rail early, set the early pace and
weakened in the stretch run while continuing to race near the rail.
