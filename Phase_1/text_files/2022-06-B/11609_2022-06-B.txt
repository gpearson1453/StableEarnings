Footnotes
MYSTIC TWIST sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
MOTITO fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly almost unseating the rider, saved ground through the turns, checked for racing room into the stretch, then
angled out and could not gain. GEARED UP mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, then flattened in the lane. HIDDEN SPRINGS
passed a tiring rival, outside. TUNED UP chased the pace and faded after a half.

SUMMER BOSS sprinted away from the field quickly, increased his margin to the stretch, then lasted under steady pressure. GOODTIME ARTIE unhurried
in the early going, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late.
BREWING STORM well placed, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. SOK
FURY well placed, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and faded. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN was never involved.
