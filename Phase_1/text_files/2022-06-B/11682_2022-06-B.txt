with the leader at the quarter pole and gave way at the eighth pole.

Footnotes
COOL CATOMINE was in the four path into the first turn then move in to the two path to track the leaders down the backstretch and the final turn went
between horses by the sixteenth pole to prove best. FREDONIAN was hard to load, was in the three path in the first turn, tracked the leaders from the three
path move out to the four path to make a bid on the final turn drew even at the eighth pole but couldn't fight off inside rival and was second best. KNIGHTS
KEY was in the six path into the first turn, prompted to be placed off the pace down the backstretch made a bid on the final turn to take the lead into upper
stretch but was caught at the sixteenth pole but held show. FLAMIN FIRE sprinted to the lead from the inside to the final turn then was headed at the three
furlong pole fought gamely to the eighth pole and weakened. MAJOR KONG was in the five path into the first turn and void of speed to the final turn and
improved late. FRONT PAGE never a threat. HOLY SPIRIT was in the four path into the first turn, was allowed to settle on the backstretch then dropped
back on the turn and was distanced.
