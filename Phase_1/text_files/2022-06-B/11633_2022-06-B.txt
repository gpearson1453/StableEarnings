Footnotes
BRYNS MARK sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with something left. DIABOLICAL FIRE lacked
early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid. BEACH RUNNER broke sharply to
chase the winner while racing four-wide and gradually gave way. STORMY DAME settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and lacked
the needed rally. PERFECT IMAGE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. JOJO'S GIRL was off a step

Footnotes
HENRY ON THE RUN chased the pace of MISSISSIPPI MUSIC while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, opened
a clear lead, drifted out slightly and held off the closing SOUTHWESTERN HOPE by a diminishing margin. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE was pinched back at
the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out with a sixteenth to run and finished full of run to be gaining on the winner late.
QUIEN ES was away in good order to be reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, checked nearing the wire from the winner
drifting out and SOUTHWESTERN HOPE closing from the outside and finished well. FULL OF DRIVE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. DESERT DANGER lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. ILIKEROLLIN raced off
the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. MISSISSIPPI MUSIC sprinted clear soon after the start, increased his
lead through the turn and weakened through the final furlong. SILVER PONZI broke in the air, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach
contention. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF QUIEN ES IN THE CLOSING YARDS AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SHIO was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin with a furlong to
run and was fully extended to hold the closing SWEET RIVER BAINES safe late. SWEET RIVER BAINES settled off the leaders early, checked nearing the
quarter, angled out five-wide through the turn and rallied in tandem with CAIRO KING late. CAIRO KING raced unhurried early, advanced six-wide through
the turn and finished with good late energy. MORO APPEAL disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. HESA
PROSPECTOR pressed the pace while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half. GATOR VINDICATION dueled for the lead while racing four-wide
and weakened after going three furlongs.
