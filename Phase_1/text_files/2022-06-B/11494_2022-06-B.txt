Footnotes
I SAY I PLAY was rated three to four wide early, angled in entering the far turn, advanced on the in side on the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole
when the front runner drifted in, continued to close well to get up in time under mild urging. COURT AND SPARK vied for the lead on the inside, made a bid
to shake clear on the turn, came three wide into the drive, drifted in nearing the sixteenth marker and was caught late. ESPRESSO CALIENTE was settled
on the inside and lacked the needed winning bid while saving ground throughout, bested rest. SHADOW BOAT was reserved early, three wide by the
quarter pole, angled out in the drive and offered a belated rally for the minor rewards. GET A VALENTINE vied for the lead three wide and weakened by the
quarter pole. SCREEN STAR tracked the pace three wide and weakened. VITESSE failed to menace. CAUSE OF ACTION showed little.

BUFF AND SHINE was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, drew out leaving the turn under strong crop urging, then lost the crop leaving the
sixteenth pole while well clear. DOUBLE TIME BAY was well placed early and made a mild bid on the turn two wide but could not sustain that bid while
being clearly second best. NOTEWORTHY tracked the pace and was four wide on the turn and weakened, bested rest. KNOCKDOWN KID tracked the
pace between rivals and weakened. JUST DIVINE was bumped at the start and then was outrun early, not a threat. JEKYLL ISLAND chased the pace five
wide and stopped.

Footnotes
MY FRIEND FRANK tracked the early pace and was three wide on the backstretch, made a three to four wide on the turn and into the lane, hit the front
nearing the furlong marker and edged away to prove best under a drive. DRAMATIZED set the pace while clear and removed form the rail, was headed
nearing the furlong marker and could not go with the winner while saving the place award. BEACH TRAFFIC was settled early while four to three wide,
advanced three to four wide on the turn and loomed boldly leaving the turn, then threw head at the three sixteenths and lugged in leaving the furlong marker
and had no late kick. THE TRAIN chased the pace three wide and had no rally. MINE TO HOLD chased the pace on the inside and weakened. RIPPOLINO
lacked a rally. ESKENFORTIME failed to menace. SIX CIDER chased the pace between horses and tired. JOZANI R V F showed little.

MADE TO HUSTLE set the pace on the inside and dug in gamely in the stretch and held sway late to prove best under a drive. TAK E LADY stalked the
winner throughout, made a three wide bid leaving the turn and was gaining late but could not get to that rival, clearly second best. PANDORAS CHARM was
allowed to settle early, saved ground entering the stretch and had no rally while besting the rest. IDES OF MARCH chased the early pace and swung out
four wide for the drive and was empty. PRINCESS EMMA JO chased the early pace in between horses and weakened. SOCIAL EXCLUSION chased the
pace five wide and weakened. LUNA FORTUNA lacked a rally. NINJA PRINCESS was through early and eased, walked off.

Footnotes
FILLE D'ESPRIT prompted the pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and then was roused to draw clear, then
was kept to pressure to the sixteenth marker while still clear, then gave a celebratory fist pump at the wire after proving best. CINNABUNNY was well placed
on the inside, eased out nearing the quarter pole and came four wide to make a bid, could not go with the winner while finishing willingly to be second best.
KAYLASAURUS was rated along four wide early, then angled in to be two to three wide on the turn while advancing, swung out five wide for the drive but
had no kick while getting up for the show award. HEY MAMALUKE set a pressured pace on the inside, dueled for command by the quarter pole and
weakened. PRODIGY DOLL was settled early on the inside and lacked a rally. DECO STRONG chased the pace four wide and weakened.

NY TRAFFIC stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to gain a short advantage by the quarter pole, then shook clear leaving the turn,
then wandered a bit and BEREN came back to go on almost even terms by the sixteenth pole, then responded under right handed crop urging late to edge
away. BEREN dueled for the early lead on the inside, then fell off the pace leaving the turn, came again in the furlong grounds to go on even terms with the
winner by the sixteenth pole but was outfinished late, second best. DONTMESAWITHME was allowed to settle early, came six wide into the lane and rallied.
THREES OVER DEUCES was reserved early, advanced and was five wide by the quarter pole, angled in leaving the three sixteenths, then was in traffic by
the furlong marker and offered a late rally. LOST IN NEWYORK was bumped after the start, then tracked the early pace in between rivals, bumped with
STUDIO B around the five eights marker, then was two to three wide on the turn and faded. JUMPMASTER was allowed to settle early, made a five wide
move on the turn but came up empty in the final furlong. SIR ALFRED JAMES was reserved early, swung out four wide for the drive and had no rally.
STUDIO B was bumped and had to check in between rivals around the five eighths marker, lost and iron, got foot back into iron on the turn and weakened
on the inside in the drive. PICTOR dueled for the lead three wide and folded.

Footnotes
AWESOME PAL was well rated early, made a flour wide move on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and edged
away to prove best under a drive. MIZ CHAPLIN pressed the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command and then kept on
willingly but could not go with the winner while saving the place award. GOLDEN LAW was with the early pace between rivals, then was shuffled back on
the turn, shifted out leaving the three sixteenths and rallied. POLISHED GEM set the pressured pace on the inside, then was two wide into the lane and
weakened. CHARGE THROUGH was well placed and on the inside on the turn but came up empty in the drive. LIKEUONLYPRETTIER was reluctant to
load, broke in the air, trailed.

Footnotes
FRANK N DUCKY set a pressured pace while racing off the inside, shook clear leaving the turn and drifted out through the lane and held sway late to prove
best under a drive. KATZ ME AT NOON pressed the early pace and made a three to four wide bid on the turn, then was carried out in the drive and was
gaining late on the far outside. SECOND LINE DAVID chased the early pace on the inside, then was shuffled back by the quarter pole, then offered a late
rally on the inside to just miss the place. IRON CLASH was allowed to settle early, made a two wide bid leaving the turn but needed more late. ORASHI
stalked the early pace and was five wide on the turn and weakened. HAPPY GUY was allowed to settle early, was three wide by the quarter pole and had
no rally. JACK BE NIMBLE prompted the early pace and was four wide on the turn and weakened.
