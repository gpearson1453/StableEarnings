threat to the winner. DON'T MAKE ME BEG stalked the pace pulling, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and

TRAVELLER set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY
stalked the pace on the outside in the early going, angled in and tracked that one through the second turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled
three wide for clear racing room and edged up for the place. AMBUSHED never far back, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest
into the stretch and edged up for the show. CROWLEY'S WAR well placed, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the
lane, lugged in under right hand urging and weakened the final furlong. LONGSHANKS well placed, held position two and three wide through the second
turn, angled four wide into the stretch and had no rally. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was never involved.

Footnotes
SILVER TOKEN unhurried in the early going, moved into the turn on the two path, was pushed in slightly, pinching back a rival, then angled four and five
wide, made a steady gain, and edged up late. AMERICAN CHAOS set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then was no
match late for the winner and held the place safe. LEGIO allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, then lacked
the needed late kick. NO DRAMA lost his path at the start, then was forced to check and steady into the turn, hitting the rail, angled four wide into the stretch
and got up for a share. OVER IT chased the pace off the rail, gained position on the two path through the turn, then faded the final furlong. MR
EVERYTHING well placed, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. KIANG vied for the early lead
on the outside and faded into the stretch. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE well placed, held position inside through the turn, came through and faded. DORISTO
unsettled in the gate, drifted in through the turn and faded.
