Footnotes
BRAVO BRAVO settled off the pace inside, came out in upper stretch, took aim and made a steady bid, edged past in the final sixteenth. AWESOME
FAMILY switched out early, stalked two to three wide, edged closer turning for home, struck the lead just past the three-sixteenth, was overtaken nearing
the sixteenth and outfinished. HATCHET CREEK tracked from outside, went three wide on the turn, shifted inside rival in upper- to mid-stretch, was no
match for the top pair. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH settled at the rear, saved ground racing inside to the top of the stretch then angled six deep, ran on.
CHOPPER sped clear to dictate terms racing just off the rail, weakened in the stretch. GOLDENPENCE went two to three wide on the turn and failed to
rally.

Footnotes
DOM CAETANO (ARG) tracked inside early, switched out early up the backstretch, moved out further from two to four wide on the far turn commencing a
rally, took aim and gained steadily to get up late. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN set the pace racing just off the rail, was pressured early up the backstretch,
edged clear late on the far turn, came out in late stretch to hook up with a challenger but was outfinished. THE LAST OPTION exchanged a light bump just
after the break, stalked three wide through the first turn, was well-positioned three then four wide within striking distance on the far turn, came out in late
stretch and lacked the needed late kick. MANGO TREE pressed the pace four then three wide early, edged to a narrow advantage early up the backstretch
forcing the issue, continued to chase three wide into the far turn, moved in a path late on that bend then weakened in the stretch. MAXIMUS IMAGE was
bumped at the start, raced mid-pack four wide early, asked for a bit more three to four deep on the far turn but failed to rally. PISTOL BOX raced just off the
rail and inside a rival toward the rear early, went two to three deep on the far turn, was never near enough to threaten. LEMON BLITZ bumped the outside
rival at the start then bumped with the inner foe, was caught three wide on the first turn racing off the leaders, shifted in heading up the backstretch, saved
ground on the far turn but made no bids. IRISH MAJOR raced outside well back of the leaders five wide early, went four wide on the far turn, was not a
factor.

Footnotes
WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY tracked from inside, saved ground till the quarter pole then angled out three wide, took aim, steadily gained and got up late.
GET THEM DIGITS was coaxed forward at the break and shifted in, tracked the pacesetter two to three wide, moved past that one to take charge at the
three-eighths, was engaged late and outfinished but clear of the rest. FLASHFIRE hopped at the start, stalked two to three wide, moved between rivals late
on the far turn, evened out in the drive. LARK was caught outside foes six then five wide on the first turn, managed to get a bit nearer the rail racing
mid-pack tracking in behind foes four then three wide on the far turn, moved further in coming to the quarter pole to advance inside rivals and kept on in the
lane. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN settled three wide early, shifted in heading up the backstretch, advanced inside a rival along the rail late on the far turn,
angled out four wide just past the quarter pole then moved out a further path or two in upper stretch for room, was gaining but too late. JIM AND JIM settled
in the two path toward the rear early, moved out and went three to four wide on the far turn, advanced past rivals while swinging six wide into upper stretch
and ran on. GRUMPA stalked four wide early, moved nearer the inside up the backstretch but had to come back out four deep for room on the far turn,
weakened in the stretch. CONCOCTION raced three wide between foes through the first turn, switched outside heading up the backstretch, went five wide
on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. CHARLIE'S BEACH saved ground and was not a factor. SKIPSHOT AGAIN sped clear five wide into the first turn,
moved in a bit later on that bend racing three deep then two wide into the backstretch, was overtaken three furlongs from home, dropped back and faded.
DUE TO TIME MALFUNCTION HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SIRCORRI tracked in behind, bid along the inside at the quarter pole, was put to left-handed urging in the stretch, drifted out and bumped a rival two times
before edging clear. CRANKSHAFT set the pace racing off the rail, dueled with an inside challenger in upper stretch, was bumped two times by that one
and steadied. NYOMAN stalked the pace, asked for more by the five-sixteenths going three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. HIGH HERO
raced just off the inside and was not a threat. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF CRANKSHAFT AGAINST SIRCORRI ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
OMAHA RED set the pace racing off the rail, was engaged in a duel turning for home, headed briefly in the stretch, drifted out a bit through the lane, dug in
and turned back that challenger. COMISKEY PARK bumped a rival at the start, pressed three wide, dueled through the lane taking a brief and narrow lead
and drifting out a bit, was outfinished. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS tracked in behind inside on or just off the rail and lacking room, came out a bit in upper stretch,
fought on to hold show honors. TWIRLING ROSES was bumped at the break, stalked from outside three to four wide, was ridden a bit about the three
eighths, shifted inside a rival at the three-sixteenths, missed show honors. VIOLENT GIGI was relatively close racing last but one, went three to four wide on
the turn, failed to rally. LOOK AWAY trailed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ON A TOUR tracked inside, tipped out a couple paths turning for home, edged clear under steady handling. APRIL'S GEM set the pace racing just off the
fence and facing outside pressure, was outkicked for the win and just held the place. WINDY CITY GIRL tucked in two wide heading into the first turn,
advanced two then three wide on the far turn, kept on but missed second. NOFANSINTHESTANDS settled well back three to four wide, swung seven wide
into upper stretch and was gaining but too late. KIMBERLY FRANCES raced four wide into the first turn, moved in a bit heading to the far turn going three
then four wide on that bend, came out further turning for home and bumped a rival, moved out from behind rivals in mid-stretch and ran on. LAUNCH AWAY
settled well back, advanced inside into upper stretch and went evenly lacking the needed late kick. KITTEN ROCKS pressed the pace three wide, weakened
in the stretch. RARE ACTION ATTACK failed to rally after racing three to four wide through both turns. IRISH HALO stalked in behind three wide, drifted six
wide leaving the far turn, faded. I LOVE TO RACE was fractious in the gate, raced up close to the pace four to five wide, began to weaken on the far turn,
was bumped at the top of the stretch and faded. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

going two then four wide on that bend, took aim and drove past. LAUDA SPEED set the pace inside on or just off the rail, was outkicked but second best.
COYOTE ROAD bumped with a rival at the shifted in and was in tight heading up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, advanced inside for show
honors. LITTLE KANSAS steadied at the start, advanced outside four to six wide on the turn and improved. RACE DRIVER was bumped at the start,
pressed the pace two wide, faded. IWILLPERSEVERE went three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. GET HAMMERED dropped back between
rivals two to three wide and was not a threat.

Footnotes
RUSSIAN MAFIA was unhurried trailing along the inside, fanned eight wide turning for home, launched a furious rally while drifting in several paths and
drove past. LET'S CRUISE set the pace racing off the rail, was outkicked by the winner and saved the place. BELLAGAMBA (ARG) broke a bit awkwardly,
settled inside, came out three wide past the five-sixteenths and wider still in upper stretch, gained late but missed the place. FATE FACTOR tucked in
behind heading to the first turn, tracked inside, saved ground on the far turn, had room inside to bid up the rail in upper stretch but was outkicked and
needed more. CURLY RUTH stalked the pace three wide, lacked the needed late kick. I HEAR YOU tucked in two wide mid-pack tracking off the leaders,
moved out three then four wide on the far turn, failed to rally in the drive. YLIKEDIS raced off the leaders three wide early, moved out five wide later on the
far turn, failed to menace. YOUENS stalked mid-pack four wide, drifted seven wide turning for home and came up empty. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION
OPENING QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED AND THE MILE TIME WAS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BLAZEN ROAD was a bit restless in the gate, moved forward between runners late up the backstretch then exchanged a couple bumps and eased back off
the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, took the lead in late stretch and prevailed. AHEADOFTHEGAME was in just a hair tight at the break, raced just
off the leaders two to three wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch, gained steadily but too late. DUST DANCER broke in the air, angled outside rivals
then advanced rapidly outside, dueled three wide on the turn, moved clear, was outkicked and lost the place. MISTER CHARMING settled well back inside,
saved ground on the turn, came out a bit in the stretch and gained late. ASTI SKY dueled outside a rival early, exchanged a couple bumps near the half,
then dueled inside a foe into the turn racing just off the fence, weakened. BUREAU broke inwardly, raced three to four wide, swung five deep into upper
stretch, failed to rally. INDIAN SIGN dueled inside, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
DYNABLUE settled inside off the pace, fanned six wide turning for home, drifted in while driving to the fore and drew away without much urging. CO
CONSPIRATOR moved forward and shifted in heading into the first turn setting the pace, went two wide on that bend and on the far turn, was overtaken in
mid-stretch but held second. FROOME (IRE) settled well back shifting to the rail early, angled five wide coming past the quarter pole, ran on but missed the
place. DEORA STORE was forwardly-placed and shifted to the rail entering the first turn, tracked inside, lacked room in behind about the half, kept on in the
lane but needed more. KANITHAPPEN exchanged light contact at the start, was forwardly-positioned into the first turn, taken back and switched out three
wide about the six and one-half, went three to four wide on the far turn making a bid but could not sustain the effort. MADELYNS HEAT settled racing off the
inside, came into upper stretch five to six wide and ran on mildly. DELFT BLUE exchanged a light bump and was in just a bit tight at the start, raced
three-wide mid-pack advancing between foes coming to the half, continued two to three wide on the far turn, had no rally for the stretch run. POWER
THROUGH was forwardly-placed three wide into the first turn, was within range four to five deep on the far turn but empty for the drive. TOWN AGENDA
failed to threaten. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION ONE-MILE TIME WAS HAND-TIMED.
