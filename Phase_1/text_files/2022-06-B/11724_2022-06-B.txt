Footnotes
ALLSTAR MAGIC within striking distance while racing inside, inched closer just off the rail turning for home, in a bit tight between the leaders nearing the
furlong marker, split that pair soon after, drove clear under steady handling. MISS MIRACLE GIRL pressed the issue early three wide, dueled through the
turn in the two path, could not match the winner late, narrowly gained the nod for the second spot at the wire. SLIDE with the pace out of the chute while
between foes, continued to vie up the backstretch,dueled through the turn inside the runner up, held a narrow advantage a furlong out, also proved no
match for the winner late, narrowly missed the place. ALHAMBRA PALACE in the second flight up the backstretch off the inside, continued to stalk through
the turn, lacked a closing punch when called on for the drive while widest through the stretch. LA JAZZ fell back on the outside after three furlongs, failed to
respond in the drive. OUR LADY'S PRAYER flashed brief speed along the inside, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
SPELLBINDING moved outside and settled off the two leaders, continued to stalk that pair in the run up the backstretch, ranged up three wide to challenge
turning for home, took over, clear under steady handling. ISOLATION dueled up front into the first turn, angled in while alternating onto the backstretch,
continued to help set the pace into the far turn closest to the inside, offered little resistance to the winner when that one challenged entering the stretch,
proved determined late to persevere for the runner up position. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE broke alertly, allowed the pace to go into the first turn, moved
closer four wide late in the final bend, could not get to the winner the final furlong while outkicked for the place. MY LITTLE JEN alternated up front outside
the runner up until a quarter remained then began to weaken. MALARTACH fell back to trail after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
threat. KICK N KISS raced one paced in mid pack for six furlongs, had little for the drive. AMELIA MADELYN broke inward and a step slow, was never a
threat.

Footnotes
KING OF THE TESTO broke on top, raced with the pace while between horses into the first turn, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn in the two
path, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late while kept to pressure. TURN ON
THE MAGIC five wide when forwardly placed into the first turn, remained within striking distance on the outside the middle half, roused three wide turning for
home, made little progress on the winner past the furlong marker, coming late. SOCIAL AFLEET dueled up front inside the winner along the rail, could not
keep up with that one in the drive nor contain the runner up, saved the show. GENTRIFIED headed up the second flight along the inside, lacked a closing
response to finish up evenly down the lane. AKHNAS four wide into the first turn between horses, fell back to trail onto the backstretch, came five wide for
the drive, failed to produce a rally. HERE COMES MAGIC remained back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
PRIZELESS away in good order, dueled into the turn in the two path, edged clear in hand late in the bend, expanded that lead under a right then left handed
crop, remained clear late. SMOOTH COLLIERY behind the leaders along the inside, continued to save ground turn, could do little with the winner the final
furlong, edged clear for the place. HALF OURS N STORMY broke sharp, showed the way early, dueled with the winner early turn along the inside, could not
keep pace into the stretch, finished up best of the rest. HEZA PRIORITY went one paced while three wide, lacked closing response. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR
fell back to trail after the start, made little impact. AFLEET ASCENT last to leave, tired while racing three wide. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS
HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA RIDGE bumped, shuffled back at the break to be last away, behind the first flight up the backstretch, moved closer along the inside turn, knifed
out and challenged the leader in the two path into the stretch, quickly clear, held that same rival safe late under steady handling. OAK HILL SOLUTION
broke out to bump the winner, was straightened to race with the pace out of the chute, garnered a larger advantage by early in the turn, failed to go with the
winner when that one cleared upper stretch, remained inside and was trying to get back to that foe late. PLAY MASTER lacked early foot, saved ground
through the turn, shifted out for the drive, staged a mild rally to be clear of the others, not a threat to the top two. KANNON WITH A K dueled up front while
racing outside the runner up, could not match that one from midway on the turn, continued to weaken through the stretch. PAC THE PULPIT in the second
flight off the inside, asked along three wide turn, came up empty for the stretch run. SADIE'S GROOM lacked early foot, failed to menace. K R TARGET
broke through the gate prior to the start, raced forwardly and off the inside up the backstretch, appeared to get out in the turn, fell well back, jogged in. HALF
MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

MISSHEARTBREAKER broke sharp, set the pace up the backstretch, in hand late in the turn, clear into the lane, roused, held the runner up safe late.
FIRED UP TIGER pressed the winner early, chased that rival in the two path out of the turn, fell back a bit a furlong out, getting back to that one late. MS.
PRIESTLY in mid pack while along the inside, steered out three wide entering the stretch, was along for the show while not a threat to the top pair.
CALIFORNIA CALI one paced while saving ground, remained inside stretch, lost the show late. SOUVENIR CHANNEL void of speed, displayed a mild
amount of late interest to improve position a bit. EXPECT A DANCER forwardly placed early, began to steadily fade before three furlongs. ROYCE'S GIFT

HIGH CRUISE away in good order, set a pressured pace along the inside, shook clear turning for home while in the two path and under a right handed crop,
enough left to hold off the runner up in the waning strides. FREE INDEED lacked early foot, three wide out of the turn, set down, made a late push outside to
be closing the gap on the winner. POST CLOSE broke back, raced in the second flight inside, continued to save ground into the lane, lacked a winning
response late. COMMON LAW CAT pressed the winner from between horses for just over a half then weakened gradually through the stretch. GREELEY'S
DEALER last away, trailed well back most of the way along the inside, never menace. DRIED PEPPER pressed the issue up the backstretch three wide,
began to tire turn, four wide into the stretch, continued to back up.

Footnotes
MO BELLA broke sharp, showed the way out of the chute, dueled into the turn closest to the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear into the stretch,
maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to pressure. LA DANTA behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground turn
while improving, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that rival late, clearly second best. ZEEROCK back off the pace and the
inside, roused three wide into the lane, angled in steadily past midstretch, up late for the show while not a threat to the top two. GRACE'S VISION in the
second flight while racing off the inside up the backstretch, between foes and outside the runner up into the lane, lacked a significant closing response,
caught late for the show. PEPPER POINT last away, move dup steadily, closest late in the turn in the three out to four path, flattened out in the drive.
KASENS TRIBE void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while four wide out of the turn. GOODBYE ROSIE moved up outside the winner to press
that one early, dueled early turn then gave way late in the bend. BISTINEAU BELLE broke back, remained always back in failing to threaten.
