FICHI , two wide prompting the winner around the turn, faded in the drive and drifted in near the eighth pole. M'LADY THATCHER bore out leaving the
starting gate, saved ground around the turn in a striking position, swung outside in upper stretch and lacked a rally. RAISE YOUR GAME advanced three
deep leaving the turn then weakened in the drive. QUEEN OF CLASS , pinched leaving the starting gate, raced near the inner rail around the turn, angled
out in upper stretch then drifted very wide in mid stretch. HEARD rushed up three deep leaving the backstretch and faltered turning for home.

Footnotes
INSIDE STUNT rated four wide outside rivals while within range, circled five wide under pressure and advanced into the lane, shifted out a bit nearing mid
stretch, closed in under right handed asking, overtook the lead inside the sixteenth pole and went clear at the wire. H R H JELLYBEAN moved up between
foes to dispute the pace heading to the turn, dropped in and dueled with FLASH IS BACK around the turn, spurted away under a drive leaving the three
sixteenths, dug in when confronted then gave way grudgingly while just saving the place. NEVER SATISFIED rated off the pace and off the inside, gathered
steam four wide mid turn, moved up between foes in upper stretch, waited briefly, eased and closed gamely to gain. ONE TEN broke slowly, lagged back,
came off the inside leaving the far turn, angled eight wide into the stretch and closed nicely. UNCLE ROAMIE cleared in the opening strides and set the
early pace, relinquished the lead to a pair of foes into the turn and dropped back some, came back towards the inside into the lane, eased out and made
progress past mid stretch then flattened out. REMEMBERING WILBUR chased between foes, angled out nearing mid stretch but lacked a solid kick. FOMO
, five to six wide, moved up into the lane, was lightly steadied near the three sixteenths, corrected and churned on. GALLANT GEORGE had speed inside,
steadied off heels as a rival backed up into him near the turn, regrouped to make a run between runners nearing mid stretch, steadied in some traffic and
kept on with some interest. VIOLENT ROCK saved ground off the early pace, steadied off of a rival nearing the turn, stayed inside into the lane but came up
empty. GOLD GUY settled well back, saved ground into the lane, angled out and had some belated action. HAMPDEN LANE chased off the rail, swung out
and faded. FLASH IS BACK bid three deep into the turn, dueled outside H R H JELLYBEAN around the turn to upper stretch, failed to kick on past the three
sixteenths and weakened. An objection by the rider of FOMO against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN JOE eagerly moved up towards the rail and engaged the leader into the backstretch, prompted under confident handling, took over nearing
the three eighths, spurted away past the five sixteenths, was guided off the rail and opened up under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under
steady hand asking through the final seventy yards and held firm. TREASURE TROVE broke slowly, settled off the pace and off the inside, came under a
ride mid way on the final turn, circled four wide into the stretch, straightened away and chased the winner home in game fashion. MONEY RIDE cleared
early while two wide, was hooked from his inside and took pressure through the backstretch run, ceded the lead leaving the far turn, stayed on to pursue to
mid stretch then faded. CARIBBEAN (AUS) , well placed inside, was put to pressure leaving the far turn but failed to respond. BENANDJOE , three deep
tracking the leaders, failed to go on while under a drive past the five sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
ROYNE , patiently rated in mid pack for six furlongs, eased out entering the far turn, was poised in the three path in upper stretch, advanced under confident
handling, took command near the sixteenth pole and edged away on his own. WHO'S COUNTING saved ground around the first two turns, moved out to the
two path entering the final turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, finished gamely and just faded late. IN EFFECT stalked the pace, circled foes three wide
on the final turn and finished evenly. FERMAT lacked speed, moved out on the final turn, was six deep in upper stretch and offered a late rally. BELTWAY
BOB was well back early, swung to the five path in upper stretch, raced inside FERMAT and rallied mildly. NICKY BEAR , outside horses, lacked a rally.
BRAVE DEACON was not a factor. BENNY HAVENS chased the pace and was steadied when lacking room leaving the final turn. PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH ,
four wide entering the first turn, sprinted clear on the backstretch, hugged the inner rail on the far turn and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RATIONALMILLENNIAL chased the pace two wide, moved up between rivals mid turn, eased out continuing progress past the three sixteenths, kept on
grinding under right handed asking and forged past STOPWATCHSONNY in the final yards to prove best. STOPWATCHSONNY dueled three then two
wide between rivals, took a short lead entering the lane, spurted clear under a drive inside the three sixteenths, remained clear past the sixteenth pole then
failed to last. MEJORAMIGA chased the embattled leaders while four to five wide, edged up past mid stretch to loom, churned on and slowly gained.
KOBE'S GIRL was sent up early and gained command, dueled inside rivals into the turn, ceded to STOPWATCHSONNY into the lane, stayed on willingly
past the eighth pole then faded. LOTTACLASS LILSASS , off the pace, was hustled along two to three wide around the turn, moved up some in mid stretch
then flattened out late. SUPERIORITY drifted out at the break, corrected and found herself off the lead and well off the inside, was under pressure four wide
leaving the three eighths, came about six wide for the drive but failed to muster up a run. EXCUSEMEMISSMARGOT broke slowly then edged up with some
speed to track inside, dropped back a bit mid turn, angled out and faded. NINE MAST , four then three wide outside rivals, forced the issue to the quarter
pole then gave way. LADY KALAMATA , in close at the break, dropped in early and was outrun.

Footnotes
MARGIE'S HEAVEN showed speed outside PROPER ATTIRE, gained the lead approaching the stretch, was set down approaching mid stretch and drew
away under pressure. MOODY WOMAN lacked speed, circled horses on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch, remained on her left lead and
rallied. ANOTHER WOMAN , fractious in the starting gate, rated behind horses early, worked between foes leaving the turn, moved to the six path near the
eighth pole and passed tired rivals. AWAY TO RETURN broke slowly, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and failed to rally. BEHIND THE COUCH ,
brushed by MY MY GIRL at the start, chased the pace three deep around the turn and weakened. MY MY GIRL brushed BEHIND THE COUCH when
coming out at the break, floated six wide turning for home and faded. PROPER ATTIRE stumbled leaving the starting gate, was sent to the lead leaving the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MR. D'ANGELO lagged back off the early pace, edged up between runners near the half mile marker, angled out to advance into the lane, shifted out to be
about six wide, closed under pressure and outside rivals past mid stretch, kept on grinding under pressure and forged ahead in the final yards. THE GREY
WIZARD (IRE) broke slowly then steadied soon after, regrouped and settled well back while outside a rival, made steady progress while four wide leaving
the far turn, came under pressure soon after and advanced five wide outside runner nearing the lane, moved to a short lead with a furlong remaining, dueled
between horses through the final seventy yards, kept on gamely but wasn't quite good enough. CALL ME PLUCKY relaxed off the pace and off the rail,
edged up four wide past the three eighths, bid between horses entering the lane, battled inside the top pair past the sixteenth marker then was out finished.
NEOTROPIC , off the pace while saving ground, eased out and moved up four wide behind rivals into the lane, chased past mid stretch but lacked the
needed finish. AMENDED , in the clear saving ground, stayed inside to make some progress into the lane, checked when shut off near the three sixteenths,
swung out and continued with interest. CONSULTANT rated off the rail while not far back, moved closer after a half mile, bid three wide between horses
with a quarter to go, failed to kick on in mid stretch and gave way. LA HARA (IRE) cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, met bids approaching the
stretch, vied past the three sixteenths then weakened. TAKE PROFIT prompted the pace two wide, stayed in range past the three eighths, pursued into the
lane and gave way. TAPWOOD saved ground under rating, took closer order into the far turn, lacked a kick leaving the three furlong pole and weakened.
