GOTTAGETITBACK sent hard pressed the pace dueling inside of rival on the turn shaking clear in upper stretch digging in gamely to widen late. INDIAN
EMPIRE a step slow through the turn raced five then six wide down the lane getting up late to salvage place. REBEL ROYAL chased the pace racing inside
to upper stretch angling out four wide mid stretch bidding willingly late. REGAL HOLIDAY hustled along pursued through the turn angling to mid track in mid
stretch going all out to wire. EASTBOUND N DOWN pressured the pace dueling through the turn ceding in upper stretch wearing down late. K P SILVER
BULLET slow early lost ground to upper stretch posing no menace in the seven path. MOONZANO played no factor. EXECUTIVE PRIZE was never
involved. HEY SACH dipped down tossing the rider at the break, walked off.
