Footnotes
HEAVENLY GAZEBO broke sharply to gain a clear advantage just after the start, disputed the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, then edged forward in
the final stages under firm left handed encouragement. COAL TOWN ROAD bobbled while exchanging brushes at the start, was urged to force the pace
outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, continued to press the issue to late stages but was outfinished. LEAD OFF tracked off the first flight along
the inside, saved ground on the turn, tipped off the inside entering the stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. EL JEFE COBB,
reserved last early, switched out four wide while being urged to advance to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. COINCIDENTAL made brief
pursuit of the leaders three wide into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

BIG BOY MCCOY broke readily, vied for command between foes in the opening stages, then continued gamely inside a rival into the stretch and edged
forward in late stages to prevail under left handed encouragement. R VOO'S TABOO joined the pace three wide racing through the backstretch, pressed the
issue outside the eventual winner into upper stretch to gain the advantage late but was outfinished. WILDCAT HAGRID was rated off the first flight from out
of striking distance racing to the turn, swung out four wide entering upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. DYNAMOMETER,
urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch. BURN BOSS broke awkwardly and trailed
throughout. FINAL VISION WAS FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE, NECESSITATING HIS LATE SCRATCH.

BRAHMS IS WHO tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to the turn, made a steady advance in that path nearing upper stretch, then,
took over leaving the furlong marker under firm encouragement and was taken in hand late once the issue was decided. BOOZIN AT BOZOS, off slowly,
was settled last along the inside on the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and displayed some belated interest to prevail for the place
honors. WINNING MANDATE sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, held sway on a narrow margin to upper stretch but
yielded once headed leaving midstretch. IMPULSUS, off a bit slowly, tipped off the inside early to track the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing
into the turn but came up empty in the drive. ARNOLD'S PATSY angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the turn
and faded into upper stretch. DA BEST WIFE EVER, between foes in the opening stages, was rated off the second flight nearing the turn and faded from
contention early.

Footnotes
PEARLE DE VEENE was settled well off the field along the inside racing to the turn, gradually gathered momentum nearing upper stretch, split foes racing
past the furlong marker, then tipped three wide in the closing stages to narrowly prevail in time under firm hand urging. CHA came under firm urging in the
opening stages disputing the pace between rivals through the backstretch, was headed nearing upper stretch, but kept on grudgingly inside foes to regain
the advantage between calls late to just miss. ELSIE'S KID attended the pace three wide between foes under light rating in early stages, pressed the issue
in that path through the turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch, continued to duel between foes leaving midstretch but weakened late.
INTHEMISTYMOONLITE, forwardly placed four wide prompting the leaders to the turn, steadily faded nearing upper stretch. BIG BLUE NOTE angled to the
inside in early stages prompting the pacesetter into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

SENSE OF FLURRY was rated three wide between foes tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the far turn, swung out four
wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, shifted inwards under pressure racing through the lane contesting the issue outside
STRABELLA to the wire but just edged that foe in time under firm handling. The latter was rated between foes in second flight to the backstretch, angled
inwards racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, came through inside foes nearest the rail to challenge for command midstretch, then
contested the issue to the wire while just failing to contain the winner. NORDIC QUEEN, forwardly placed three racing just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leader between foes into the far turn and emptied out in the drive. AMARETTO DI AMORE sprinted to the lead
racing a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, maintained the advantage through the far turn to upper stretch but gave out once headed by the top pair
leaving midstretch. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT was settled last racing to the backstretch, shifted four wide midway through the backstretch commencing an
early advance on the leaders, gained on the pacesetter to challenge three deep for command nearing upper stretch but quickly came up empty entering the
lane. VOODOO FIRE tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening half, was shuffled out of close quarters racing into the far turn and gave
way.

HARD ATTACK was rated tracking the leaders three deep in second flight from out of striking distance in the opening half, was prompted to make a steady
advance in that path racing into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to narrowly prevail between foes in that path on the wire under firm
handling. TWO BY TWO angled inwards racing to the first turn to track the pace between foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing
into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. A ROSE FOR RAVEN sped to the lead while angling to
the inside racing into the first turn, dictated the pace to the far turn, resisted a rival's challenge nearing upper stretch, drifted out contesting the issue
grudgingly past the furlong marker but was collared by the top pair late. SOUL COAXING, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter in the
opening half, advanced to press the issue racing through the far turn, dueled for command to midstretch but flattened out late. DEVIL VISION ducked in at
the start breaking a bit slowly, was settled las to th far turn and, never gained contention. THICK HAZE angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of
the second flight in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn and faded in the drive.

EMERALD PRINCESS broke sharply, forced the pace outside a rival in early stages, shook clear entering the turn, steadily forged a commanding
advantage racing through the stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. PRINCESS LIVIA, off slowly while being cut off at the start, was prompted to a
position along the inside in early stages, continued under light rating racing just off the second flight on the turn, then came through inside foes racing into
the stretch to prevail for the place honors in late stages. COST A FORTUNE came through close quarters at the start to gain terms with the pacesetter along
the inside prompting that rival into the turn, shifted off the rail losing terms with the winner entering the bend and faded between rivals late. LATER DAYS
veered out at the start crossing the path of PRINCESS LIVIA, was righted, then urged three wide pursuing the leader into the turn but gave way nearing the
lane. BIRDIE BE GONE dropped out early.

Footnotes
SHI O'SHI, off a step slowly, was rated off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, tipped out three wide in upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to wrest the advantage under firm handling. SWEET HONOR vied for command between foes through the backstretch into the turn,
steadied out of tight quarters midway through the bend, angled four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a solid second effort to edge a rival for
the place honors. TAILORBESWIFT, prominent outside foes from the break, pressed the issue three wide into the turn to strike the front, shifted inwards
pressing the pace outside a rival into upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage in upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. JAGGED ARROW
was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn and gave way nearing midstretch. BONITA RAPIDS settled outside foes racing to the
turn and failed to threaten. DIVA DE KELA WAS SCRATCHED AFTER THE POST PARADE ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE VETERINARIAN
AND A CONSOLATION DOUBLE WAS CALCULATED.
