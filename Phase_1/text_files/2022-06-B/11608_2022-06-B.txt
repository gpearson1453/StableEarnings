GLOBAL NATION was well rated and on the inside on the turn, was blocked leaving the turn and awaited room, angled out leaving the furlong marker and
closed full of run once clear and got up late to prove best under a mild drive. AUCHINCRUIVE was reluctant to load, reserved early and advanced four wide
on the turn, came five wide into the lane, closed well on the outside and gained the place award on the wire. YANKEE EMPIRE chased the early pace and
made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, led by the sixteenth pole but was caught in deep stretch. KHAKI JACK dueled for the early lead three wide,
then made a two wide bid leaving the turn and stayed on but yielded late. BUMMER was settled early, then was three wide on the turn, shifted out in the
lane and had a belated rally. ARTIE CHILLER was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. GREY QUEST stalked the pace four wide,
made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole and then was empty. MY WALLY dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. THAT'S MY
BOI TOY failed to menace.

MISTER GARY set the early pace while clear on the inside, then was given a few right handed pops leaving the furlong marker and responded well, then
was kept to mild crop urging late to prove much the best. PEAKY BLINKERS chased the early pace and made a mild bid three wide on the turn, but proved
to be no match for the winner, while battling gamely for thr place award. MY MAN GEORGIO was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn and
made a four wide bid leaving the turn but could not sustain that bid while finishing evenly late. RUN LEA RUN was settled early and on the inside on the turn
and weakened.

the furlong marker and rallied late. QUEEN LUCKY was settled early and was three wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and had a belated rally.
