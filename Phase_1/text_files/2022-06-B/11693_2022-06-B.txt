Footnotes
CAJUNS GOLDEN POND kicked clear in final furlong after setting the pace in tandem and gaining sole command along the backstretch. AWESOME
THUNDER rallied mildly to secure the place honors after chasing the pacesetting duo from a wide stance. SMOOTH OPERATOR settled behind the field
through the first turn, was roused nearing the final bend and close with a rush to earn the show. GRAYDAR'S DREAM rushed from outset to share early
command as the inner rival of two abreast but faded in crucial stages. VICTORY STRIPE tucked behind the pacesetting duo to save ground, gave chase to
frontrunners along the backstretch and failed to produce a closing rally.

Footnotes
MY CITY GIRL showed reserve through the first bend, advanced position along the backstretch, rated one even terms for the lead at upper stretch and got
up in time for the score. SILVER POM POM stalked the early pace from a three path pose, gained brief command along the backstretch, latched into a
stretch duel at upper stretch, then was nipped at wire. DO ME A FAVOR hustled away from outset and disputed the early pace from a two path stance,
rated three wide at upper stretch, but proved no match for top pair in final sixteenth. SEXY RAGS came up empty in the final furlong after saving ground
early and trekking the two path into the homestretch. SWEET STORMY ELLE flashed early foot while trekking an inside path, led the field through the first
turn, relished command along the backstretch and faded in the late strides. GOSPEL GINA travelled widest of all around the opening turn while giving chase
to frontrunners from mid pack and faded in the crucial stages.

EVENING STORM proved best in the stretch duel after pressing the early pace from a three wide pose. ROSE OF EKITA was unhurried throught he
opening half, then closed with fury by angling out at upper stretch to earn the place honors. LEMONS IS GONE stalked the early pace from a three path
pose, split foes and gained the slightest of advantages near the quarter pole, rated close up along the inside at upper stretch but was edged in the stretch
duel. GUAPA CHICA failed to sustain the bid after rushing from to gain first command and lead the field along the backstretch from a two path stance. SEXY
SOCKS hustled from outset to establish a ground saving stance, maintained an inside line throughout but steadily faded.

CANEY'S GHOST showed reserve through the opening half while trekking three wide, closed the gap on the leaders along the backstretch with a four wide
move nearing the quarter pole, gained command at upper stretch, and finished under a stiff drive to secure the score. WRITTEN PERMISSION stalked the
early pacesetters from a three wide stance, advanced on the leaders along the backstretch, tucked to the inside at upper stretch and proved second bet in
the end. TROY OUNCE held on to the show after leading the field early from a ground saving trip. TOTALLY TIGER settled into second flight while saving
ground, angled out at upper stretch but came up empty in the homestretch. TIMELY REPLY faded rapidly in closing quarter after trekking the two path and
pressing the pace through the opening bends and along the backstretch. FORT KNOX tucked to inside, saved ground throughout, and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CASINO QUEEN broke alertly, gained command shortly before the first call, trekked two wide through the opening bend, widened the margin along the
backstretch, and held off the late charge of rallying rival in the final sixteenth. YAK ATTACK was unhurried and trailed the field through the first turn, was
roused along the backstretch, then closed with a rush and just missed the victory. SHE'S SHINEY pressed the early pace from an inside stance and finished
willingly to hold the show. GREEN EYED BELLE lacked a needed rally after settling into mid pack and chasing the frontrunners from a two path pose.
GRAYDAWN DAY rushed from outset to establish a ground saving stance then lost ground to front runners and trailed the field after being cutoff at the head
of the first turn near the nine sixteenths pole.

THETRUTHISTHETRUTH stalked the early pace from a three wide stance, was given the queue inside the quarter pole and circled rivals three wide at
upper stretch before kicking clear in final sixteenth. JUSTABOUTRIGHT was unhurried from outset and chased the frontrunners through the first turn,
advanced along the backstretch, gained command between calls and led at upper stretch, but was outfinished in final strides. LUCKILY pressed the early
pace from between rivals, gave way to front runners along the backstretch, then rallied back to earn the show. DAAHERACHEL rushed from outset and
gained first command, took a ground saving journey, but was overtaken in the late strides. AFLEET OKIE failed to menace after tucking to rail and saving
ground. C. F. SHELAUH trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CATALE STORM showed reserve along the backstretch before rallying three wide through the bend and digging in to prove best in the stretch duel. GOOD
JUDGMENT rushed from outset and set the pace in tandem as the inner most rival, had command at upper stretch then locked into a three way tretch duel
and turned his head at the sixteenth pole before being nipped at wire. EUROBOND was forced to settle for the show after trekking the two path and rating
up front through the opening quarter and into upper stretch. ZCAT'S CHATAIN gave chase to rivals around the bend while travelling the three path and
lacked a needed rally in the homestretch. MR. SHAPOOR settled into second flight shortly after the start then lost ground to front runners by travelling
widest of all around the turn. TIME TO FIGHT came up empty after giving chase from the second flight and trekking the two path around the turn. PICTURE
ME CLASSY broke alertly and rated close up along the backstretch before tucking to save ground around the bend and eclipsing in the final furlong.

TAG ME hopped at the break, travelled widest around opening turn, joined the pacesetters along the backstretch, gained command inside the quarterpole,
led at upper stretch, drifted out inside the sixteenth pole and held off the late charging rival for the score. TRUE DOMINUS was unhurried through the
opening quarter, tucked to rail around the first turn, angled out the three wide at upper stretch, responded well to urging and was gaining on the leader
before checking inside the sixteenth pole. SWAY BACK WHEN showed reserve in the early stages before closing the gap on front runners at the midway
point then rated close up four wide at upper stretch and was outfinished in final sixteenth. DOYOUKNOWMYNAME failed to sustain bid after setting the
early pace from an inside stance. PUPPY POWER faded rapidly inside the half pole after breaking alertly and contending for early command. TAKING
ENERGY steadily weakened after rushing from outset and pressing the pace from a two wide pose.

Footnotes
WHIP rushed from outset to set the early pace in tandem from a two path stance, was headed while trekking around the closing bend, and came back in
final sixteenth for the score. ZIP TIE hustled from the start to press the pace as the widest of three abreast around the opening bend, maintained that stance
along the backstretch, established a slight advantage around the final turn, then was outdueled in the closing strides. CRAZY LOVER was unhurried through
the opening turn, travelled wide and rallied mid track to earn the show. KYEMBEA travelled widest of all in the early stages, closed gap on the front runners
along the backstretch, but failed to produce a closing rally. OKIE FREEZE displayed hustle from outset and led the field from an inside stance through the
opening turn before tiring in the crucial stages of contest. HALLOWED RIVER lacked a needed rally after settling into second flight and saving ground. J.
CAT WEST was last away and trailed the field through the opening half before improving placing with late interest. EVAN'S ENVY showed reserve through
the opening half and trekked the two patha round the first bend, tucked to save ground inside the quarter pole, and failed to menace. TIZ STRONG steadily
faded after giving chase from between rivals around the opening turn.

Footnotes
PROUD MOMENTS finished under a stiff drive for the score after showing reserve through the opening turn, circling rivals along the backstretch and gaining
command through the closing bend. JOHN ALLEN travelled wide at first call while looming boldly, advanced on pacesetter along the backstretch, led inside
the quarter pole, then was outdueled in homestretch. MEAN CANNON was unhurried early, advanced along the backstretch with a three wide move, rated
on heels of front runners at upper stretch and earned the show with late interest. OKLAHOMA LINE trekked four wide in the early going while stalking the
pacesetter, tucked to inside around the closing bend, was within striking distance at head of stretch, but was outfinished in final sixteenth. HOODOO
BROWN tucked to rail shortly after start to save ground around opening turn, rated close up at head of final bend, then broke stride near the eighth pole and
lost chance at a closing bid. MAYFAIR HEIGHTS chased rivals from a wide pose and lost ground to front runners by doing so. MAJOR SHIPMAN lacked a
needed rally to end a three wide stalking journey. ALARM SYSTEM was unhurried, travelled wide, and failed to threaten. INTERACTIF MOMENT steadily
retreated after pressing the opening pace from a two path stance. GONNA GETCHA flashed early foot and led the field through the first call before fading
rapidly inside the quarter pole.
