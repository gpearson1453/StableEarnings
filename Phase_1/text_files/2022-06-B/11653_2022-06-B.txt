Footnotes
THE KAT'S BACK stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the pacesetters three wide entering the
final turn, assumed command entering the lane and quickly drew clear as much the best. OUREVELADY unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
launched her bid two wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail to get up for the place in deep stretch.
LASTING LIGHT away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run to the final
turn, took control entering the turn but was quickly tackled by THE KAT'S BACK, was no match for that rival leaving the turn, and was outfinished late for the
place. BAKZONE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response in the lane when called upon. OMBRE' ROSE broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of LASTING LIGHT entering
he first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the turn,
and weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
ARCH PRINCE away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, raced into a
stalking trip four wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three out from the rail through the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the
drive to get up in time. BLACK METAL broke sharply and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail in the run through the stretch the first time,
continued to set a pressured pace from the inside of MCMURPHY in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and closed willingly from along
the rail in the drive to just miss. PAY MY WAY settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the lane the first time, held a
stalking trip from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, and finished four wide in the
drive to get up for a share late. MCMURPHY away well and rushed up to press the pace from the outside of BLACK METAL entering the first turn, continued
to force the issue from the outside of that rival into the second turn, tracked the pacesetter in the run to the final turn, before reengaging that rival through
the turn, but faded in the late stages while unable to match strides with his pace rival in the lane. BODEGA unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact.

TIMELESS SHRUG away alertly and tracked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, slipped through at the rail to battle for the lead
from the inside of HEART OF TEXAS in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and battled determinedly from just off the rail in the drive to
prevail. HEART OF TEXAS broke sharply and raced to the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to just miss. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed steadily four wide in the lane to just miss. SNOWSHOES away well and
tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon. HEREVERYWISH stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, maintained her position
in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. GIFTED GREY stalked the leader through the
stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, struggled to hold her position in the run down the backstretch, and had nothing to offer over the final

HE'S RELENTLESS stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained a stalking trip in the run down the
backside while racing three wide , continued three wide into the final turn while commencing his bid, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the
drive to prevail over a very stubborn STEAL HOME. STEAL HOME away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the lane the first time,
dictated the pace through the second turn while continuing to save ground at the rail, battled through the final turn from the inside of BAKLANE, shook off
that challenge entering the lane, and fought on gamely one out from the rail in the drive to just miss. ONE FIFTY ONE broke sharply and was taken in hand
and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide through the final turn, and found
his best stride late from along the rail in the drive to get up for a share. BAKLANE away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while
racing one out from the rail, collared the pacesetter two wide in the run to the final turn, battled gamely through the final turn from the outside of STEAL
HOME. but faded in the late going. YOUNG VIGILANTE settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time,
commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. GUNS N AMMO settled off the early pace

RIMFIRE away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide from between rival in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from the outside of JOSE JOSE
while battling for the lead through the final turn, and got the better of that stubborn rival late while inching clear. JOSE JOSE broke sharply and vied for the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and gave
way grudgingly late in a solid effort, while holding off a late surge by REMARKABLE ANGEL to hold the place. REMARKABLE ANGEL chased the leaders
three wide into the first turn, forced the issue two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished with late interest two
wide in deep stretch to just miss the place. EDDIE WHO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced well behind the field in the run down the
backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing best of all two wide in the drive.
BAKKEN OVERDRIVE chased the leaders six wide into the first turn, held a tracking trip five wide entering the backstretch, continued five wide into the final
turn, but faded over the final furlong after the wide trip. STORMY BLUE ducked in sharply at the start and unseated his rider. STORMY BLUE walked off the
track under his own power following the race.

NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE away alertly and tracked the leader from along the rail entering first turn, slipped through along the rail to battle for the lead
entering the final turn, opened a clear advantage through the turn, and was never seriously threatened late. QUALITY COMMAND broke sharply and raced
to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, battled into the final turn from the outside of NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE entering the final turn, and while
no match for the winner over the final furlong, finished gamey three wide in the drive to prove second best. DRILL BABY DRILL away well and tracked the
leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to garner a share.
HAPPYTOMAKEYOURDAY stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive. LUNAR NEW YEAR unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid two wide entering
the final turn, and finished with some late interest five wide in the drive. REMARKABLE GIRL stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the

FLICKER DANCE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, tipped
four wide leaving the turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to get up in time. SOUTHERN LASS away alertly and tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, battled through the final turn from the outside of SAVER THE KISS, took the lead into the
stretch and just failed to last. SAVER THE KISS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace into the
backstretch, battled through the final turn from the inside, of SOUTHERN LASS, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, and came up
empty late while holding on for a share. BEST ONE YET unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and improved
her position over the final furlong without seriously threatening. SUNBURNT settled off the early pace while racing four wide entering the backstretch, rallied
one out from the rail entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. CLASSY LEGACY away well and settled mid pack while saving ground at
the rail entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.
