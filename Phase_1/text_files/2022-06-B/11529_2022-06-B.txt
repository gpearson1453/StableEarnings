Footnotes
FLINTMORE sat off the pace early on, sent to join the top pair at the half-mile pole, driven four wide into the stretch and inched away and held over the
runner-up. IRISH PROPHET raced in range in the two path, coaxed along into the far turn, lacked room around the bend then angled out into the stretch
and further out at the top of the lane, closed well and kept gaining to the wire. PITTSBURGH controlled the pace on the inside, pressured from outside into
the far turn, responded and moved clear again, drifted out a bit at the quarter pole, led two wide into the stretch, clung to a narrow advantaged with a furlong
remaining, lost command in midstretch and stayed on to the wire. LORD SHELDON went four wide on the first turn then angled down to the two path,
remained off the rail then eased out and came five wide into the stretch and gained a minor award. RIO KING broke slow and got forced out leaving the
gate, settled on the inside, angled four wide leaving the far turn, lost his path in upper stretch, steered inward and could not rally. BALDORO veered out
leaving the gate, got floated five wide briefly early on the first turn then angled down to the three path, angled down to the inside at the back, swung six wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. KAWAZAKI (IRE) stalked in the two path, bid outside the leader entering the far turn, lost touch around the bend then
steadied when the leader came out a bit nearing the quarter pole, re-bid three deep in the stretch but weakened in deep stretch. LIL BRO COOP stalked
along the inside, had to pause when running up on the heels of the leader leaving the backstretch, put in a rail bid at the top of the stretch but weakened in
the late stages.

Footnotes
CINNAMON CAT broke a step slow, chased three deep early, rounded the bend three wide, gave chase through the lane and kept to task under right and
left-handed urging, closed in the final sixteenth and reeled in the runner-up to drive past late. TOO BOSSY sprinted clear and crossed over to the inside,
inched away around the turn, padded the lead in upper stretch, continued clear into the final sixteenth and got run down by the winner late. REAL FIRE
pressed from inside early, chased two wide around the bend and failed to launch a bid in the stretch run. SPOOKY LADY broke a step slow, chased along
the inside to the stretch and never responded to urging. ROSES N GOLD was off slow to begin, trailed along the inside into the turn, raced a bit off the rail
into the stretch, moved out in the lane but failed to menace. CHARLOTTE HARBOR broke a step slow, chased between or two wide into the turn, lost
ground and drifted out to the four path and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
STONE SILENT brushed the gate but still came away quickly, sprinted clear to take control, saved ground through the turn, drew away in upper stretch and
held safely under urging. TOM'S REGRET stumbled badly leaving the gate, drifted out and brushed past the half-mile pole, rounded the turn three wide,
altered around ROUSING JEWEL into the stretch, then finished willingly for the place honors. E Z PHARIS was off a bit slow from inside but recovered
quickly and was forwardly placed, drifted out and bumped ROUSING JEWEL at the five-sixteenths pole, lacked the needed response in the drive but held
the show. DANCING MO brushed with TOM'S REGRET leaving the gate, dropped back early, went two wide into the turn, moved to the rail then angled out
leaving the bend, steered out further in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ROUSING JEWEL away quickly in the beginning, closest in pursuit from the two
path into the turn, got bumped by E Z PHARIS at the five-sixteenths pole, jumped the track three wide into the stretch and weakened. PADDLE ON POLLY
was off a bit slow from outside, chased outside TOM'S REGRET and brushed with that rival past the half-mile pole, navigated the turn four wide and tired.

ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) forwardly placed outside a rival, took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leader past the eighth pole, took over with a
sixteenth remaining and lasted over VIRULENTE (FR). VIRULENTE (FR) stalked outside a rival, rounded the turn two then three wide, rallied three deep in
the final sixteenth and missed. FLUENT set the pace up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, led clear into the stretch, challenged past the
eighth pole, relinquished the lead nearing the sixteenth marker and flattened to third. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL got bumped leaving the gate, stalked on the inside
then tipped two wide around the turn and failed to rally in the lane. BONITA LEONA broke in and bumped rival at the start, raced up close on the inside,
saved ground to the stretch and weakened. TRAVEL SMART off slow to begin, trailed on the inside to the stretch and was not persevered with.

angled down to the three path around that turn, rallied to the front past the eighth pole and drew clear. BEIGNET vied three deep into the first turn then
chased the leader outside rivals, raced in the two path on the far turn, put in mild bid between rivals in the lane and gained second. SO SOFTLY bumped

the stretch, challenged approaching the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and got edged for second. NO PEOPLE vied between into the first
turn then chased while remaining between foes, angled to the inside on the far turn and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. WORTHINESS bumped at
the start, stalked along the rail then inside a pair of rivals, got put in a bit tight and lost some ground into the far turn, moved off the rail around the bend and
weakened. CLASSIC REWIND threw her head and dwelt at the start, went three wide into the first turn then angled to the inside, saved ground to the stretch
and never got involved. CATALON was off slow to begin, pulled early in the two path, steered out on the backstretch, went four then three wide on the far
turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
AMY C (GB) in range off the rail then three deep into the turn, got forced out crossing over the dirt, straightened out and rallied to collar the leader nearing
the eighth pole and drove clear. ELLIE ARROWAY set the pace under pressure early then cleared nearing the turn, led two wide into the stretch, headed by
the winner at the eighth pole, yielded the front but stayed on to prove second best. HAVANA LOVE (IRE) pressed from outside while in hand then dropped
back a bit to a stalking position, raced three wide into the turn, drifted out crossing over the dirt, kept on through the final furlong and held the show.
SENSIBLE CAT stalked the pace from inside down the hill, moved out a bit then cut back to the inside and needed to find more in deep stretch. BELLA D
dropped back early, went four deep into the turn, got forced out seven to eight wide crossing the dirt and could not rally. OLE SILVER took a slight hop at
the start, tracked two wide between rivals on the turn, entered the lane three wide and weakened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED
THAT HAVANA LOVE (IRE) SHIFTED OUT INTO THE PATH OF AMY C (GB), FORCING THAT RIVAL INTO THE PATH OF BELLA D CROSSING OVER
THE DIRT, BUT THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
PRIVATE MISSION stalked off the inside, applied pressured leaving the backstretch, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared leaving the far turn and
held well under right then left handed urging and steady handling late. BLUE STRIPE (ARG) pulled a bit into the first turn, moved to the inside around that
bend, tipped out and took aim two then three wide into the stretch, finished well but could not get to the winner. VARDA tracked three to four wide around
both turns, finished willingly through the drive but got outkicked for the place honors. LADY MYSTIFY sprinted clear from inside, showed the way up the
backstretch, took pressure at the seven-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, lost touch with the winner leaving the far turn and
weakened. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE drifted out around the first turn while trailing early, went two wide into the second bend, came four wide into the drive
and was not a factor. BYE BYE BERTIE got crowded between rivals shortly after the start, steered to the inside then moved off the rail on the clubhouse
turn, chased four then three wide on the second bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) pulled and became rank early, rated on the inside up the backstretch, chased two wide into the stretch, tipped out and bid three deep
with a furlong remaining and inched ahead while drifting in a bit to prove best in the end. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) pressed from outside, challenged around
the far turn, led into the stretch, was overtaken at the sixteenth pole and stayed on for second. TIZ PLUS set the pace on the inside under pressure, dueled
along the rail on the second bend, lost command into the stretch, fought into the furlong grounds and flattened late but held the show. SWORD ZORRO
(IRE) got bumped leaving the gate, steadied off heels early, moved inside to settle off the pace, angled out in the stretch and gained a minor award but still
needed to find more. PLANETARIO (BRZ) shifted in and bumped rival leaving the gate, quickly moved to the inside, tipped out on the first turn, swung out
into the stretch and failed to rally. SEVEN CHARMS tossed his head and got bumped on both sides at the start, pulled early from off the rail, traveled in the
two path then spun three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
PYEONG CHANG cleared from outside and crossed over, took pressure from outside on the turn, responded well and maintained the lead over TOM
BOMBADIL through the lane and would not let that rival by. TOM BOMBADIL chased from inside then went up outside the pacesetter into the turn, bid two
wide around the bend, kept the pressure on through the lane but could not summon the needed late kick to get by the winner. FUNKENSTEIN dropped back
early, trailed well off the rail into the turn, rounded the bend five wide and was along for the show. PRINCE MAGICIAN away well in the beginning, checked
off heels early, chased two to three wide around the turn and improved position in the lane. STAR ENTRY tracked in range outside a pair of rivals, exited the
turn four wide and lacked a rally. ME MACHO stumbled leaving the gate, chased on the inside from off the pace to the stretch and weakened. THIRSTY
ALWAYS bumped with TEXAS LONHRO at the start, showed speed to up close early then got forced in by the leader and had to steady briefly, chased
between rivals then three wide into the stretch and faded. TEXAS LONHRO bumped at the start, sat off the pace outside a rival, went four wide into the turn,
trailed three wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTELY ZERO vied between rivals for command then moved to the inside on the turn, fought two wide into the stretch, battled with TAHOMA down
the lane and proved best in the final sixteenth. TAHOMA stalked well off the rail, bid four then five wide outside the top trio on the turn, fought with
ABSOLUTELY ZERO in the lane but was bested in deep stretch. PURE FIRE tracked along the inside then two wide into the stretch, tipped out at the top of
the lane and summoned a mild rally. POP D'ORO broke a bit slow then lost his path at the start, navigated the turn five wide and finished evenly late to earn
the a minor award. SALTA raced up close four then three deep on the backstretch, vied between rivals while four wide leaving the turn, could not keep up
entering the final furlong and flattened late. CASTLEKNOCK showed early speed inside a trio of rivals then ceded control past the half-mile pole, chased
along the rail to the stretch and lacked a late bid. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING vied three deep early then fought outside the winner into the turn, vied between
three wide leaving the bend and weakened. GOOD N THIRSTY stumbled a bit leaving the gate, chased two to three wide around the bend and weakened.
SMOKEM HOWARD was off a bit slow to begin, trailed five then four wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BANG FOR YOUR BUCK brushed rival early then began to pulled hard into the first turn, settled inside then steered outside rivals and moved into range on
the backstretch, urged four then three wide on the far turn, rallied from outside and drove past late. NOLONGERAHOBBY raced up close outside the leader,
dueled around the far turn in the two path, carried a short lead into the stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and got caught by the closing winner late.
MAMBA COOL was a bit fractious in the gate, got shuffled between rivals early, waited for room behind rivals on the far turn, angled three wide into the
lane, moved out in upper stretch, rallied and finished a game third. MOBOU stalked in the two path early, went three then two wide around the far turn,
tipped out in the stretch and failed to summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. WORSE READ SANCHEZ settled off the pace, went between rivals and
had to wait when boxed in on the second turn, steered out in upper stretch and needed to find more late. SQUARE CAT rated on the inside, roused with
three furlong remaining, stayed inside to the stretch, tipped out a bit in the lane but lacked room midstretch, found a clear path and but failed to regain
momentum. TIZLIGHTNING sped to the front and took control of the rail, dueled around the far turn and weakened in the lane. SO I'M TOLD broke in, got
brushed by rival and became hard to ride early, went three deep on the far turn then four wide into the lane, jumped the track in upper stretch and could not
regain momentum. IF ID TOLD YOU broke slow and got forced in leaving the gate, raced outside a rival at the back early, swung five wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. MINISTER SHANE was off slow to begin, raced three wide in mid-pack early, traveled four then three wide on the far turn and had
little left for the drive.
