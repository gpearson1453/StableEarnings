STUDYLONGSTDYWRONG set the pace on the outside, held sway to the late going, then edged further ahead under steady pressure. ROGERS GINGER
rushed up to stalk the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and hung. GERRYS MAGIC
MAP never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the lane, drifted in and lacked the needed late kick. GOVERNOR
ATWOOD vied for the early lead on the inside, dropped back through the turn, came through inside and flattened out. NO ME DIGAS dropped back quickly
and was no factor.

was outfinished. GOOD ON YA well placed, gained position inside through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, angled out when clear, then closed
willingly and lacked the needed late kick. RIO ABAJO tracked the pace, angled out three wide into the turn and moved to position, bid on that path into the
