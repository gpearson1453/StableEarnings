Footnotes
FROBISHER BAY rated off the early pace, shifted out to the three path leaving the backstretch, angled in to the rail at the head of the stretch and kicked
away after finding running room along the rail. LONESOME CAT sat in striking distance from the five path, fanned five wide leaving the final turn, and got up
late for second. NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE led the field through the backstretch, was under attack nearing the quarter pole, and weakened in the final
sixteenth. OUR DANDY'S BOY saved ground from rail, angled out to the three path at the quarter pole, and flattened out late stretch. ANELLO sat just off
the pacesetter while three to four wide, lodged a bid nearing the quarter pole, and came up empty for the drive. ACE OF DIAMONDS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MARIA'S SONG settled outside early, swept the lead nearing the quarter pole, and opened up through the stretch. HE'S CRIMSON CODE raced at the back
of the pack, and closed gradually through the stretch, and was along with time for place honors. PAULIE WALNUTS dropped back leaving the backstretch,
and rallied late for show. PULL THE PIN sent for speed, pressed the pace from the three path, and evened out through the stretch. EXHI KID sat just off the
pace between rivals, and faded. KEEP YOUR COOL raced wide leaving the backstretch, and lacked a response when called upon. HERE COMES
BARNEY vied inside, took pressure leaving the backstretch and gave way inside. BURNING LOVE chased inside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
FRAN FROM PERU chased outside leaving the backstretch, drove four wide off the final turn, rallied through stretch and got up in time. LANA'S PRETTY
GIRL well placed early, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, rallied inside of FRAN FROM PERU, was wore down and held on to share place with
LASKA. LASKA sat in range from the four path, bid steadily into the stretch and improved position finishing on the wire at the same time as LANA'S
PRETTY GIRL. NO MORE RINGS lagged early, drifted out in the final turn, and showed interest late. THE RIVER GREY showed the way leaving the chute
under a snug hold and gave way into stretch. SAVYSKYE saved ground from the rail, lodged a bid and failed to threaten in drive. BLANCA raced wide
through the backstretch, was carried wide in the final turn, and retreated. THIS TIME SWEETIE prompted the early pace from the three path, and wilted.

VIVIEN'S CHARM chased outside, came under urging at the head of the stretch, gained the lead into the stretch and kicked clear. SUGAR MOON unhurried
away, sat in striking distance, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, was headed into the lane and was rundown mid stretch and held sway. MIDNIGHT
TAKE trailed early, rallied steadily into stretch and earned show. JODEAN angled quickly to the rail, swung out at the head of the stretch, closed gradually
and was bested late. CORDILLERA bumped leaving the gate, and lodged a mild late bid. JAGEN stalked from the four path, rallied between foes at the
head of the lane, checked mid stretch, and yielded. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI hustled away, launched a bid at the three sixteenth pole then shifted out
abruptly, and gave way soon after. MOON AMOUR offered little. ALPINE ROAD contested the pace inside of KENTUCKY ROLL, was brushed at the head
of the lane, and faded steadily into stretch. KENTUCKY ROLL dueled for the lead, was unable to keep pace with the field near the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
BARE BACK JACK attended the pace from just off the rail, dueled inside of FIRST PRINCE entering the lane, and edged away. FIRST PRINCE vied for the
early lead between rivals, dueled leaving the final turn, was unable to move on with BARE BACK JACK into the stretch, and held for place. RYANWATER
saved ground early, gained closer order, was brushed in traffic at the head of the lane then closed steadily for show. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND raced five
wide leaving the backstretch, and bid belatedly. PADDYSDAYCHARM pressed the pace outside, dropped back in the far turn, and flattened through the
drive. TANGERINE TAXI lagged early, raced wide off the final turn, and lodged a mild bid. DURITZ lacked early speed, bid nearing the quarter pole and was
unable to improve position through stretch. ADMIRAL VANNGO settled outside, circled into the lane, and failed to threaten. BON PRIX chased four wide
through the backstretch, and faded into stretch. BONANZA CREEK lagged early, and chased to no avail. COZY BEAR saved ground inside, and lacked a
bid. EXILED set a pressured pace between rivals, was unable to keep pace with the field and tired.
