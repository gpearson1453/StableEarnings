COLEMAN CREEK made the lead out of the gate, drew clear of the field into the turn and through the stretch, but just held on for a wire to wire win.
WILTON was mid pack early on, made a bid in the turn, closing fast down the lane from the four path, and just missed at the wire. WILLACY was in
contention early, racing around the three path, then made a bid from around the turn to get up for show in a blanket finish. HARD CANDY was near the front
early, racing three wide, made a bid on the turn but faltered in late stretch. BIG WAVE JAMES had no early foot, racing wide throughout, then rallied down
the lane but it was not enough. AFFRAY chased the pace early on, from the rail but flattened out down the lane. JERSEY JOE pressed the pace, two wide
and dropped back in the turn. LIONS NOT SHEEP was near the back, three wide and no menace. GEM DANCER trailed the field all the way and was no
factor.

TWENTYTWENTYREDO chased the pace while four wide, then rallied at the top of the stretch, gained command at the eighth pole then drew off to prove
best in the end. VENUS ISLAND raced while three wide, then made a gamely bid in upper stretch and was closing willingly in the end. TWO ANGELS set
the pace along the rail, cleared the turn, was in a hard drive down the lane but gave way in the end. CONTEMPO GRAY chased the pace while two wide,
made a mild bid on the turn then flattened out in the final furlongs. SMOKEY ANN was away from the gate a step slow, then ran off a bit rank into a wall of
horses and was through early. BESSIE'S SONG was quick to bid along the rail, then dropped back on the turn and never fired.

Footnotes
SERBIAN SAILOR was unhurried early, racing in the two path, angled out around the far turn, closing willingly, but drifting very wide in the stretch to get up
for the win in a driving finish. SECRET SURVIVOR was allowed to settle, three wide, steadily gaining from the backstretch, then gained command in late
stretch but was outfinished at the wire. OAK HILL SOLUTION pressed the pace early from the two path, made a bid, but hung late, holding on for show.
LEVEL made the lead, fighting off foes around the turn and faltered in late stretch. RAMSHACK was near the front coming out of the gate, racing along the
rail, jumped a shadow in the first turn, and ran evenly throughout. HAMMERSCHMIDT trailed the field all the way until passing a tiring rival in late stretch.
TWIST OF FATE stalked the pace, three wide then tired and dropped back in the stretch.

SHIRLEY'S TEMPLE was allowed to settle in the early goings, racing wide from the outside, and started a bid going into the far turn, closing steadily,
running down the opposition and drawing away from the field for the win. OUR IRIS ROSE made the lead, fighting off foes until late stretch, then gave way
grudgingly but held on to second. ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) was in contention early, racing three wide, then rallied down the lane but could not pass the
leaders. LADY COMMISSIONER got off slow and had no early foot, racing along the rail, then rallied down the lane, but it was not enough. LAVENDER
(IRE) stalked the pace, two wide and flattened out in the stretch drive. LADY GWEN was near the back racing along the inside but only offered an even
effort. BRANDONS BABE trailed early on, angled out in the stretch and passed a tiring rival. GOTTA SEE RED chased the pace early, along the inside, but
tired and was through after a half.

Footnotes
BLING ME THE MONEY made the lead by the half mile pole, fighting off foes briefly going into the turn, then hit another gear and surged ahead, drawing
away from the field to win easily. SWEET TAPIN MORO had no early foot, angling in to the inside and saving ground early on, then closed willingly, up the
rail to be second best today. HEDARESTHEDEVIL chased the pace, three wide, offered a bid in the stretch drive and got up for show. ASTA LAVISTA
HONEY was near the back early, angled out into the turn, and rallied four wide down the lane but it was not enough. GOLD CAPO pressed the pace early,
vying for the lead briefly down the backstretch but not quite able to get it and flattened out in the stretch drive. SINGING DIXIE was mid pack early, racing on
the inside, then angled out, three wide down the lane and failed to repond. JUST HANGIN RIDGE had no early speed, running four wide and never fired.
STORMIN HANK broke sharp out of the gates, taking the lead briefly, then dropped back in the stretch drive.
