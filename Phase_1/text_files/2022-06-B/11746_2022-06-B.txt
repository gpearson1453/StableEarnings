Footnotes
UNMARKED MONEY was bumped at the start, forwardly placed to lay up close early on, was hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced three to four
wide in the stretch run and drove clear late. SUWANNEE CHICK settled off the early going, made an advance through the far turn, made a good bid from
the outside in the drive and got up for the place position late. BASHFUL MARIE stalked the early pace, raced near the inside near the quarter pole,
continued her bid from the inside in the stretch run and kept on willingly to the wire. WHAT A KNOCKOUT dropped to the back of the pack early on, raced
five wide through the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. TEA'S DREAM was quick to begin to set the early pace, raced well clear into the
upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. HOLLYWOOD HONEY was unhurried early on, swung five to six wide through the upper stretch, angled in
and had no late response. BACKSPARK settled off the early pace, was four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid.

SMOOTH PEBBLE showed good early speed to set all the pace and held gamely in the drive to be clear under steady pressure. SUNNYMEDE DREAM
was bumped at the break, settled off the early going, raced towards the inside through the far turn, moved up two to three wide in the lane and slowly closed
in on the leader to finish second best. ASTERS D'ORO tracked the early leader down the backstretch while racing two wide, raced four deep in the lane and
had not enough late. INFLUENCING stalked the pace, raced three to four wide in the drive and had no final winning bid. PROMISE ME broke in sharply at
the start, bumped with rival, stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch and weakened in the drive. JEFF'S ANGEL settled off the early pace,
raced towards the inside near the quarter pole, eased out through the stretch and had no rally. IMAHONKYTONKGIRL was off slowly, raced off the early
pace, lost ground and raced far back.

Footnotes
MOTATAABEQ settled off the early pace, was patiently ridden down the backstretch, eased up through the far turn, raced three wide in the lane to split foes
and forge clear late under strong handling. POSEIDEN was rated down the backstretch while under a narrow lead, raced four wide into the upper stretch
and finished willingly to the wire. IT'S FATE was rated along down the backstretch while racing near the inside, challenged for the lead nearing the eighth
pole and weakened. SWIFT KID settled off the early pace, made a quick move near the half mile pole from the inside, continued to race near the inside in
the stretch and was empty in the drive. DIVINE CONTROL was unhurried early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted three to four wide in the
stretch run and had no rally. OVERPRAISE stalked the early pace and weakened in the drive while racing four wide.

Footnotes
TALKIN TIPSY was coaxed along early, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and finished gamely to edge clear under strong encouragement.
TALK MUCH sprinted clear early on, was challenged through the far turn, dug in and held well to be second best. STRAWBERRY POINT was off a step
slow, hustled along early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT was slow early on, raced five wide
through the upper stretch and moved up in the drive to improve position. BYZANTINE EMPIRE was coaxed along early, raced near the inside through the
far turn and lacked a bid. FIRST IKIGAI was off slowly, raced four to five wide in the stretch run and weakened. OPEN SKY hopped at the break, was
hustled from the outside, raced two to three wide through the upper lane and never was a factor.

CHIQUIRIN was allowed to settle early on, advanced through the far turn, made a good rail bid in the drive and just up under strong handling. AMERICAN
DOLLAR dueled for the early lead, raced just off the inside in the drive, led deep stretch and just missed in a game effort. ABSOLUTIST stalked the pace,
made a good outside bid in the stretch run to finished willingly to the wire. NOT A DANCE was coaxed along early, moved up three wide between rivals and
near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. MANUKA BOBBY dueled for the early lead while racing two wide and weakened a bid late. AS DE ORO
COCO dropped back early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. DAVID'S CUPID was unhurried early, raced four wide and

Footnotes
RASMALAI was quick to begin to set the early pace from the inside, dug in inside the eighth pole and held under strong handling. LOVIN MAKES CENTS
stalked the pace, raced along the inside through the far turn, continued from the inside in the stretch and got up for the place position late. BELLA
ROMANCE was bumped at the break, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out four wide and rallied late. MORE MUCHO dropped back early
on, made an advance through the far turn, raced five wide through the upper stretch and moved up. GREGS POSSE was coaxed along early, challenged
near the eighth pole and weakened a bit in the final stages. HIGH ARABIAN was slow early on, made an outside bid in the drive and had not enough. LA
BRODY was bumped at the break, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no rally. FOXY AUSTIN was forwardly placed to lay up close early on
and faded while racing three to four wide.

Footnotes
SOCIALLONGDISTANCE stalked the duel down the backstretch, moved up through the far turn to take command, raced two to three deep in the drive and
drove clear late under steady handling. CHEF MENTEUR dueled for the early lead down the backstretch while racing two wide and held the place position
in the drive. SUNSPOT stalked the dueling pair down the backstretch, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and flattened out. STONE AGE settled off
the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. RAGING WHIRLWIND was slow early on, angled six wide
through the upper lane and never was a factor. GREAT JUNIOR dueled for the early lead along the inside and gave way. JAQUE MATE COCO raced far
back and never threatened.
