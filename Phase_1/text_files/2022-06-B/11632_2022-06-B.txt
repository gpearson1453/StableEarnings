Footnotes
AUTUMN ASPEN tracked the leader up the backstretch then launched a three wide bid midway around the turn, took over the lead from GOLD MAKER
approaching the eighth pole and held clear under a driving finish. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO was allowed to settle off the early pace and raced two wide
around the turn, shifted out wider and given cue upper stretch, gathered momentum under steady pressure and produced a solid finish. CALL THE SHOTS
was forwardly placed in the opening quarter then weakened upon entering the turn, angled out and hustled up at the head of the lane, sustained steady
response and secured a share. GOLD MAKER sped to the lead at the start and set the pace, held clear around the turn then got collared by the winner
approaching the eighth pole and gave way. READY TO GET LOUD chased after the leader in early stages, continued bid around the turn then weakened in
the lane. BLUSHING SCARLETT saved ground along the rail around the turn, cut the corner into the lane and steadily weakened.

PREGAME applied pace pressure to LUCKY DUDE around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up two wide to engage rival for the lead
approaching the quarter pole, vied in upper stretch then kicked clear under a driving finish. ARISTOCAT raced three wide around the first turn then settled in
good position off the top pair, tracked the pace to the far turn then began to edge up closer near the quarter pole, came under a drive at the head of the
lane, showed response but could not reach the winner and settled for second best. KEEN CONTENDER was unhurried and raced in the back, came under
a ride three wide around the turn, ran on four wide in the lane and failed to threaten the top pair. LUCKY DUDE held a slim lead around the first turn and set
a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with PREGAME at the quarter pole, continued to battle for command in upper stretch then gave way.

LIL MISS HOT MESS tracked the leader under slight restraint in early stages, let out a notch and advanced to a slim lead at the quarter pole, came three to
four wide into the lane and pulled away in hand. STERN rated just off the second flight heading into the turn, given cue two wide at the head of the lane and
gained second best. JOPLIN tracked the pace near the inside in early stages, hustled up three wide upper stretch and secured a share. PRINCESS TRINA
set the pace into the turn, got collared by the winner at the quarter pole then faded in the lane. AND I KNOW saved ground into the lane and failed to
respond. HARLONS COMMISION raced three wide in contention around the turn then faded.

CASEYS MEMORY stalked the embattled duo up the backstretch, raced two wide around the far turn then launched a three wide bid upper stretch, took
over the lead from OPLIN a furlong out and finished clear. KWIK tracked the pace through early stages, given cue four wide at the head of the lane and
finished second best. OPLIN dueled outside of ZIGGY up the backstretch and into the far turn, shook clear at the quarter pole and led the way into upper
stretch then got collared by the winner at the furlong marker. MOON IN THE SKY was unhurried and raced in the back, launched a bid upper stretch and
improved position. ZIGGY dueled inside of OPLIN around the first turn and continued up the backstretch, could not match strides with rival at the quarter
pole then faded a furlong out. SEAZAN settled two wide in early stages, hustled up three wide around the far turn and failed to move on. WACO KID rated
inside through early stages, saved ground around the far turn and failed to respond when called upon. CHISMOSO failed to move into contention.
MONSTER RIVER raced near midpack up the backstretch and into the far turn then retreated.

Footnotes
RIDE RICHIE RIDE broke alertly, quickly cleared the field from the outside and angled in, set the pace by a clear advantage around the turn, came under
firm pressure along the inside in the stretch run, dug in gamely, turned back bids and held firm. CODETOWIN saved ground and picked up the pace midway
around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, roused forward into close contention but could not get to the winner and held place. HAVE A PLAN stalked the
leader in the opening quarter then launched a three wide bid around the turn, sustained steady response into the lane and secured a share. CALCULATING
KING saved ground around the turn, continued inside bid into the lane and needed more for impact. NEWS BOX chased three to four wide around the turn
and failed to rally in the lane. CAPTAIN DON was slow into stride at the start, raced in the back then came five wide into upper stretch and never
threatened. AMERICAIN JOEY hustled along three wide around the turn then gave way. HOLDING FAST raced off the pace then wide into the lane and
never menaced.

Footnotes
SNAPY GAL dueled outside of KELA'S TURN up the backstretch and continued to battle heads apart into the stretch run, dug in gamely under firm handling
and edged away in late stages. KELA'S TURN dueled inside of SNAPPY GAL in opening stages, continued to duel for the lead around the turn, fought back
gamely from the inside into the final furlong then failed to match strides approaching the final sixteenth. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE tracked the embattled pair in
early stages, launched a three wide bid midway around the turn, stayed on three wide into the lane and held show. BOSSY MOMENT raced near midpack
into the turn, hustled along four wide into the lane and just missed show. PEGGY RULES lacked speed and raced in the back, shifted out four wide in upper
stretch and lacked a rally. SABRIA raced in range in the opening quarter, failed to advance under pressure around the turn and gave way. MY GOLDEN
DAY saved ground around the turn, cut the corner into the lane and failed to move on.
