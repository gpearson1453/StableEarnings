Footnotes
GULFSTREAM WAY pressed the pace two wide, bid entering the lane, dueled through upper stretch before gaining an advantage approaching the furlong
grounds, and drew clear. DARK TIMBER set the pace inside of a pressing GULFSTREAM WAY, battled with that bidding foe in upper stretch, got headed
approaching the furlong pole, flopped back to his left lead leaving that junction, yielded, but lasted for place. RED KNOBS bumped with an inner rival at the
start, tugged to an inside stalking position early on, but only managed to chase the top pair through the lane while dueling with an outer FLAGS UP for
show, and prevailed via a tight photo finish. FLAGS UP chased three wide, vied for show along with an inner RED KNOBS through the final furlong, but just
missed. SPEND BENJAMINS saved ground while tracking the pace from midpack, then stayed on two wide and between horses in the final furlong, but
failed to reach a minor share. SWIFT TAP bumped squarely with an outer foe at the start, raced four wide while off of the pace and outside of foes, and
lacked a rally through the lane. BERNIE LOMAX tucked two wide down the backstretch while off of the pace, tracked from between horses around the turn,
but made little impact. KEEN HEIR was outrun.

Footnotes
TRAVERSE vied two wide early on before clearing her inner counterpart entering the turn, showed the way along the inside shortly after, met MISSED
OPPORTUNITY's bold bid turning for home, dueled entering the lane, gamely shook narrowly clear leaving the three sixteenths pole, and maintained an
advantage thereafter. MISSED OPPORTUNITY stalked along the inside while in the two path down the backstretch, shifted three wide and outside of the
leaders entering the turn, loomed a danger while inching closer in hand approaching the five sixteenths pole, bid turning for home, dueled entering the lane,
but delayed her lead change in upper stretch, did so after briefly failing to keep pace with her inner counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, kept on
thereafter to sustain the battle, but failed to re-gain even terms. CANDY KICK took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, inched closer before
swinging five wide entering the lane, and stayed on to reach a minor share. LADY TERRA broke a step slowly while last away, took the turn in the three
path while far back, improved inside of foes while shifting inwardly in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly through the final furlong. MERCI ROAD vied along
the inside early on, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, came under urging to keep pace turning for home, but tired through the final furlong. WHY SHE
DEW DAT got hung out in the four path around the turn while off of the pace, fanned six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. MCMANSION tracked
four wide, was coaxed in hopes of gaining approaching the five sixteenths pole, but lacked a response entering the lane, and tired in upper stretch. CAMI
CAT stalked three to two wide into the turn, but was outmoved by an outer foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, and faded in upper stretch. GIN N SIN
saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. YELLOW CREEK ROAD trailed in the three to four path around the turn, and never got involved.
EXAGGERATED HUMOR chased from midpack in the two path, but weakened approaching the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
NAVAL AVIATOR hesitated a bit at the start while breaking slowly, settled off of the pace in the three path, gained in the five path around the far turn to bear
down on the leading trio turning for home, bid outside of them entering the lane, dueled before gaining a narrow advantage approaching the furlong
grounds, and held from game inner rivals. NEPOTISM stalked outside of the pace setter and from the three path, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole
as a pair of outer rivals loomed a danger, sparred with them through upper stretch, but was outkicked approaching the final furlong, fought on resiliently
thereafter, and regained place. JUST CALL RAY tracked from midpack along the inside around the first turn, smoothly tipped outside of leading foes down
the backstretch, ranged up outside of the leading pair while in the four path around the far turn, produced a bid entering the lane as an outer NAVAL
AVIATOR did the same, battled between a pair of rivals through the lane, but was bested by them. SOUTHERN PASSAGE got antsy in the gate awaiting
the start, then shook his head while breaking towards the back of the pack, settled far back in the four path around the first turn, commenced a gain in the
three path and between horses turning for home, rallied to gain fourth in pursuit of the leading trio entering the final furlong, and stayed on to narrow the gap
late. CARMICHAEL set the pace in the two path, showed the way from pressing foes around the far turn, but yielded inside of a trio of bidding rivals at the
quarter pole. COUSIN LARRY laid off of the pace in the two path, tracked the main group around the far turn, but tired through the lane. NOTARY trailed
early on, gained in the four path and between horses into the far turn, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, but failed to sustain a bid. MOON DOG
tracked from midpack in the four path around the first turn, but was through after a half mile. TOMA TODO stalked along the inside, but weakened entering
the far turn. DOCTOR NASH tracked two wide, but weakened in the five path entering the far turn.

Footnotes
SUNNY RIVER set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals leaving the chute, inched ahead to a clear margin entering the turn, showed the way in hand
around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch as TAKE A STAND produced a bid, dueled gamely before coming out again and bumping that foe off stride at
the furlong grounds, exchanged brushes while holding an advantage in the final furlong, and shook free of her outer counterpart approaching the wire. TAKE
A STAND stalked two to three wide and between horses around the turn, emerged from the group to bid for the lead outside of SUNNY RIVER entering the
lane, got herded outwardly by that foe approaching the three sixteenths pole while commencing a duel, then took a substantial bump from her inner
counterpart at the furlong pole causing her to flop back to her left lead, then fought on through the final furlong while exchanging brushes, but was kept at
bay. SCENT OF ROYALTY broke slowly while last away, got hung out in the five path around the turn while off of the pace, stayed on in upper stretch while
hanging on her left lead, changed over entering the final furlong while bidding for show, and secured that posiion. EIVISSA stalked along the inside, chased
outer leaders through upper stretch while managing show, but yielded in the final furlong. NECK ON THE NILE saved ground off of the pace around the
turn, shifted two wide passing the quarter pole, but lacked a kick between horses. JAG WARRIOR vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed
to keep pace with her inner counterpart while under a drive into the turn, then faded between horses turning for home. DONTGETABOVURAISIN took the
turn in the four path and between horses while off of the pace, and failed to menace. LADY COMMANDER rated at the rear early on, and never got
involved. CATCH MAGIC tracked three wide down the backstretch, gained four wide into the turn, inched closer outside of TAKE A STAND to be within
striking range turning for home, but failed to match rallying strides entering the lane, and weakened passing the quarter pole. FEVER DREAMING chased
from midpack four wide, but was done early, and eased through the lane. COCOA COLADA vied three wide, but weakened at the half mile pole, and eased.
FOLLOWING A RIDER'S OBJECTION OF TAKE A STAND VS SUNNY RIVER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH-RUN; SUNNY RIVER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
HAPPY JACK tracked four wide, then three wide at the five sixteenths pole, grinded away at the clear leader's margin in the final furlong while hanging on
his left lead, produced a bid leaving the sixteenth pole as an outer OSBOURNE did the same, led shortly after, and kept his outer counterpart at bay.
OSBOURNE broke half a beat slowly, tracked in midpack three to four wide around the turn before being floated five wide entering the lane, then sustained
a grinding rally in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong, bid in the final sixteenth with an inner HAPPY JACK to outkick, but was fended off.
PEACEFUL WATERS set a clear pace, held sway through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but was worn down by a pair of foes in the final
sixteenth. TEJANO TWIST broke a step slowly and was last away, trailed the field early on, moved out of last approaching the turn in the three path, swung
six wide entering the lane, and sustained a rally outside of foes to reach a minor share. MONEY SUPPLY tracked along the inside, but checked while being
shuffled behind RAYMOND when that foe tucked to the rail approaching the five sixteenths pole, lacked a rail opening entering the lane, shifted three wide
at the three sixteenths pole, and chased from between horses therafter. PRAYFORPEACE tracked in midpack two wide and between horses around the
turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid among foes. OPEN ROAD saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BLUE KENTUCKY was
void of early speed, checked mildly behind rivals at the half mile pole, took the turn three wide, and made little impact. AMICABLE was hung four wide while
at the rear of the field around the turn, tipped six wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. RAYMOND chased the clear leader two wide and from between
horses, tucked to the rail at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to progress entering the lane, and weakened through the final furlong. MY CRAZY
NEIGHBOR laid off of the pace two wide and between horses into the turn, but faded at the three furlong pole. MEAN JAKEY stalked three wide and
between horses, then two wide at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened entering the lane.

IMPROBABLE JOURNEY set the pace, drew off in upper stretch, and lasted from an outer rallying rival late. WOODLINE tracked two wide, shifted five wide
entering the lane, stayed on, sustained a rally after flopping back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth, surged to produce a late bid at the wire, but ran
out of ground. EMBRACE tucked from the five path to the three path into the turn while far back, shifted to the six path in midstretch, and stayed on late.
APPEAL DENIED broke a step slowly and trailed early on, checked when the rider shied from an outer foe into the turn, took the bend in the four to five path
before swinging eight wide entering the lane, and stayed on. GOLDEN LUNA prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, but failed to keep pace
with his inner counterpart entering the lane, and faded. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN stalked along the inside, bid for place at the furlong grounds, but faltered.
RUM 'N TONIC broke outwardly and hindered a foe at the start, took the turn in the two path while off of the pace, and made little impact. MY GRASS IS
BLUE was bumped an bothered by an inner rival at the start, got hung in the five path while off of the pace around the turn, fanned seven wide entering the
lane, and failed to factor. WARRIOR ROAD broke slowly and never got involved. STIRDATPOT prompted the pace three wide, but weakened entering the
lane. BAR ON THE BEACH broke a step slowly at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside under firm restraint, shifted to the four path entering the
turn while still under a snug hold, shifted six wide entering the lane, and tired.
