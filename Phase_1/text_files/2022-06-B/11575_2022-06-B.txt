INTREPID WARRIOR stalked the early leader, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
MARVEL was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and with a bid from the five path in mid stretch was second best. SLIGO CALLING set the pace
but was headed on the far turn and leveled off. GOGO GABRIEL was off slow, trailed the field on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch
had no impact. JUSTALITTLEHYPER was up close early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

WILD RIVER WOLF tracked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch was
kept to task. BAHAMIAN DUDE set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and vied through the stretch but was no match for the winner. PAPERBACK
HERO forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but had nothing left. READY AT DAWN was unhurried early, raced evenly on the turn and from the six
path at the top of the stretch needed more. PATIO PARTY was off slow, trailed the field on the turn and rallied late. EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY was off slow and
saved ground on the turn but dropped back through the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON BAHAMIAN DUDE AGAINST WILD RIVER WOLF
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.
