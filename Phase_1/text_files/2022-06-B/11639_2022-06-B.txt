Footnotes
SONG PARODY broke very fast, showed the way in the two path through the turn, responded well when shaken up into upper stretch, came under a
right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging. RECOGNIZE chased the pace three wide through the turn, pursued the
winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while just able to get the place. LADY MINE stumbled badly at the start, established a good
position towards the front, saved ground around the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch and just missed the place while able to get the show.
GAMBLING GIRL was urged along between foes early, dropped back into the turn, moved from three to four wide early on that bend, was carried five wide
around the five-sixteenths, found her best stride while outside in the stretch and finished well but was too late for the trifecta. E Z TOLL chased the pace on
the far outside, dropped from six to five wide leaving the backstretch, moved to the three path midway through the turn then the two path around the
five-sixteenths and came up empty. SWEET LIBERTY was hustled from the start, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, moved from the two
to three path early on the turn, lugged out four wide around the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. AMANDA'S FOLLY checked while pinched back
between foes after the start, climbed some while a bit green early, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch and was no factor. BET OF THE CENTURY was fractious in the gate, chased the early pace between horses, dropped from five to four wide leaving
the backstretch, raced outside while remaining in the four path through the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and retreated.

Footnotes
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS coaxed from the gate, showed the way rated along the inside patiently handled, cut the corner into upper stretch and was roused
straightened away, dug in stubbornly under threat from a pair and prevailed by a head on the wire. RHEAUME tracked the pace along the inside from the
pocket, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with NEW GINYA to issue a challenge
through the final furlong surged home late and was ultimately denied at the end. NEW GINYA saved ground in pursuit from mid pack and was patiently
handled until set down when tipped out five wide into upper stretch, rallied willingly outside latching on the top pair in the late stages but was ultimately
repelled at the finish. I'M FINE just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. MASTEROF THE TUNES got taken in hand and steadied three wide into the first turn off the heels of PREPOSTEROUS as that rival
crossed directly in front, chased briefly two wide into the backstretch before going three wide with six furlongs to go, advanced on the front at the
three-eighths and came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. INFRINGEMENT
saved ground near at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.
PREPOSTEROUS broke outwards a step under coaxing from the gate and was corrected, raced four wide into the first turn and quickly tucked three wide
forcing MASTEROF THE TUNES to steady off her heels, attended the leader to the outside in the two path down the backstretch and remained on hold until
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
EMINENT VICTOR settled in third position while well behind the leading duo, moved closer under coaxing while two then three wide around the turn, was
roused near the five-sixteenths, gained fast inside of the runner-up coming to the quarter-pole, bobbled while taking a short lead at the three-sixteenths,
battled with the runner-up under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under
strong urging. OAKHURST was slowest into stride, settled at the rear of the field, moved closer in the two path early on the turn, shifted three then four wide
while roused late on that bend, gained fast outside of the winner coming to the quarter-pole, made an outside bid in upper stretch, fought under a
right-handed crop into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop just after the jockey of the winner did outside the sixteenth-pole and missed while
clear for the place. BREEZE EASY (GB) went to the front, was pressure to her inside by LAKOTA SPIRIT through the opening quarter, showed the way in
hand, raced inside around the turn, was set down into upper stretch, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, kept on well in the final furlong but was
outfinished while far clear for third. LAKOTA SPIRIT was sent hard from the gate, pressed the early pace on the inside of the leader, backed off then moved
out coming to the three-quarter pole, stalked outside from that point, vied in the two path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and was used up.

Footnotes
KEEN DANCER hustled from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the inside through the turn, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out a furlong from home to the outside and rallied to arrive on the scene inside the final
sixteenth and was up in the very last jump to score. MADAME ROSE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take command a
sixteenth from home, dug in tussling with DARN THAT SONG to her outside and was nailed on the wire and forced to settle for the place honors. DARN
THAT SONG five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and fought on
to the finish but was out-gamed in the final jumps. LADY YELLEN showed the way in hand just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the sixteenth marker and weakened in the late stages. N Y FANCY hustled
from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. DANCING
ROSALIE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. JET SET JULIET stumbled badly
at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FINGAL'S CAVE pressed the early pace on the inside, was eased back outside the five-eighths then switched to the outside, made a bid outside of the
leader leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path around the turn, was given her cue inside the three-eighths, took the lead at the quarter-pole, drew away
under the crop into the final furlong, was placed under a hand-ride outside the sixteenth-pole then eased up significantly in the final sixteenth while much the
best. GRINGOTTS settled off the pace, saved ground under urging around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and safely secured the place.
CAPTIVATING CARA was urged along while off the pace, dropped back in the three path around the turn and came up empty while able to get the show.
PONCHO SONG settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path around the turn and failed to threaten. FREDDYMO FACTOR settled on the outside,
dropped back four wide around the turn and had nothing left. BANKERS DAUGHTER set the pace under pressure from her inside, moved clear outside the
five-eighths, was challenged again leaving the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the
quarter-pole and stopped abruptly then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

WITH BELLS ON just off the inside tracking the spurting away leader in closest aim, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home and took over command near the sixteenth marker, dug in under late threat and just held on
to prevail. CHIROMANTE (IRE) away well, was taken in hand and wrangled back early tossing her head in protest before settling along the inside near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy shying in when being shown
the crop to the right side nearing the sixteenth pole, got shown the crop again to the right side and shied in more severely forcing BEACHFRONT BID to be
taken in hand forty yards from home to her inside and was also taken in hand herself from the quick darting shy and missed for it all at the end due to it.
FELICITY three then two wide in pursuit from near the rear, remained patiently handled until set down angled six wide into upper stretch and closed well
outside to secure the show honors in the final jumps. BEACHFRONT BID saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly loosely between foes when CHIROMANTE shied in a sixteenth from home,
dug in and was forced to be taken in hand inside the final forty yards when CHIROMANTE again shied inwards, this time more dramatically and was bested
for the show honors at the end. GET RESPECT four then three wide out of the dog legged chute, advanced quickly to take command into the backstretch
and spurted away in hand crossing to the inside, settled into a comfortable rhythm on hold until placed to coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. LIBRETTO (IRE) just off the pace
tracking along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. VAGARIES
(IRE) just off the inside tracking the front from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. DOLCE SERA three then two wide in pursuit, got pushed along three furlongs from home and angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch
but trailed throughout. There was a Stewards' inquiry as well as a claim of foul by the rider of BEACHFRONT BID alleging interference against
CHIROMANTE in deep stretch. After review it was determined that CHIROMANTE has interfered with BEACHFRONT BID and as a result CHIROMANTEA
was disqualified from second and placed fourth before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
BRAZILLIONAIRE was coaxed to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms while inside around the turn, responded well when asked
at the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop nearing the furlong marker, was placed under a hand-ride
coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best. MOPED DENNIS was taken in hand early then moved out while reserved off the pace, came under
some urging while three then four wide around the turn, moved out while asked for his best in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. GINNSU
WARRIOR was well placed just off the pace, saved ground early on the turn, shifted to the two path while asked at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive
into upper stretch and weakened but just held the show. GHOSTLYPRINCE bumped with a rival at the start, settled in a good position down the backstretch,
went around most of the turn in the two path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths then dropped to the rail while eyeing and inside run, paused behind
horses nearing the quarter-pole then paused a bit again while altering out over heels into upper stretch, raced under a drive into the final furlong and lacked
the needed kick then just missed the show. VOCALIZE broke out and bumped with a foe, was rated just off the pace while tugging keenly at the bit, went
three then four wide while let out around the turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. AMEDEUS MUSIC dropped back early then settled at the rear, was
urged along in the two path around the turn and failed to threaten. SIXTY THREE S dropped back early on the inside then fell well behind after a half-mile,
saved ground around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. COUSIN ANDREW stalked the pace on the outside while pulling hard under
restraint, was asked while two then three wide around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
GERRYMANDER led early on before being displaced from the front six and a half furlongs from home as JUJU'S MAP took over to her outside, settled in
behind that rival in the two path tracking and patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out to swing four wide into upper stretch
seizing command straightened away for home, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. SHAHAMA bobbled at the start getting away last, chased four then
three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over narrow and brief command spinning three wide at the quarter pole, got headed
straightened away, chased the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. JUJU'S MAP three wide in aim early on, advanced to take over
command with six and a half furlongs to run tucking to the two path once clear of GERRYMANDER, showed the way safely in front before being engaged
into the turn by SHAHAMA, had that rival whittle away at her lead to get on near even terms with five-sixteenths to go and was put to coaxing at that station,
yielded the front under a left handed crop when taking the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened to the finish. VENTI VALENTINE four to five wide
early on, chased three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, tipped four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
GRAND JOURNEY went five then four wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path around the turn, gained the
lead outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held with a diminishing margin under strong urging. JACK THE CAT angled in early, went
three wide around the first turn, settled outside towards the rear, departed the backstretch between foes, moved closer while two then three wide around the
far turn, swung five into the stretch, chased under a left-handed crop on the inside of TAKAFUMI into the final furlong then switched to a right-handed crop,
got the crop near the face of his outside foe, came out slightly and jostled with that opponent late, battled between horses to the wire and narrowly earned
the place. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) was a bit recalcitrant behind the gate, raced between foes in the four path into the first turn then tossed his head while taken
up, continued around the opening bend in the three to four path, settled off the pace, went three wide early on the far turn then shifted five wide, came
seven wide into upper stretch, lugged in a bit under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, had the rider of JACK THE CAT get the whip close to his
face and possibly make light contact, jostled with that rival late and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. BIG AGENDA saved ground
while in hand around the first turn, was rated off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused four wide
into the stretch, chased the winner to the wire and finished willingly to just miss the trifecta. BATTALION angled in early, raced in the two path while between
horses around the first turn, settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and improved position.
ARTEMUS BRIDGE saved ground towards the rear, moved to the two path before the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, moved further out
outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. MO READY went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked under heavy threat late on the far
turn, lost the lead to the winner outside the quarter-pole and tired. AMERICAN LINCOLN traveled around the opening bend in the two path, settled at the
rear, was roused three wide on the far turn then carried six wide into the stretch, moved in around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. HIEROGLYPHICS
rounded the first turn in the three path, was rated on the outside, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and
lacked the needed response. SMILE BRYAN went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was
roused late on that bend, turned into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF TAKAFUMI CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST JACK THE CAT AND THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY. FOLLOWING THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, JACK THE CAT WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH

Footnotes
BUSY MORNING forwardly placed four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn and remained patiently handled just in
behind the duel, got set down tipped three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, then drew clear under a drive to
prevail. QUEEN OF LIES dueled from the two path with QUICK POWER NAP to her outside, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, got displaced from the front in tandem with her main pace rival by the top one and kept on to
continue the head to head fracas to get a neck over her pace foe on the wire for the place honors. QUICK POWER NAP dueled three then two wide getting
set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was displaced from the front in concert with the aforementioned foe by the
eventual winner near the eighth pole, continued the duel through to the finish with QUEEN OF LIES but was ultimately bested for the place honors while
preserving the show. WRITERS ROOM just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing tucked inside at the three-eighths,
cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild belated bid to the finish. LEM ME DRINK three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position to the wire. SUCCULENT broke in at the start bumping REGAL
REBEL, chased three then two wide, came under coaxing tucked inside three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals
in the stretch. WINE GODDESS four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no
rally. REGAL REBEL got bumped at the start by SUCCULENT, who broke inwards, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
continued along the inside into upper stretch and tired. SWEET FURY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the
turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. GLOCCA MORRA four paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
HIKARU chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths and trailed.
