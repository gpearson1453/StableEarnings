Footnotes
YES SIR ROBERT set the pace from the outset, was in the three path into lane, repelled a bid down the lane and cleared in the final stages. MY MAN
FLINTSTONE stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but repelled in the late stages. SKYSCANNER chased
the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. MUY CARO raced back early on, was on the
inside into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. STORM ADVISORY chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the
stretch drive. MASON A. P. bobbled at the start and was never a factor. AREYOUTALKINGTOME was done early. TWOBIRDSONESTONE trailed the field
throughout.

Footnotes
LOVE OF MY HEART stalked four wide, quickly ranged up to the leading trio at the five sixteenths pole, gained an advantage at the quarter pole, and kicked
clear in upper stretch. BOMBDIGGITY prompted the pace three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as an outer LOVE OF MY HEART forced
her hand, drifted inwardly while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, causing her to get outkicked by the aforementioned foe, then changed leads
approaching the final furlong, tired in the closing stages as a pair of outer rivals menaced for place, but just lasted from those foes to the wire.
MAKESCENTSTOUS tracked the leading trio from the three path around the turn, split tiring foes in midstretch, stayed on to produce a late bid for place, but
missed. SYLVIA Q lost her hind footing at the start while breaking last, trailed in the two path around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, hung on
her left lead through upper stretch, yet produced a good late kick after changing over inside the final furlong, attempted a bid for place outside of a pair of
foes at the wire, but ran out of ground. QUEENGOL dueled for the lead along the inside, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes approaching the lane, and
gave way in upper stretch. ALBERTA SUN dueled for the lead two wide, but was also outkicked by a pair of outer bidders nearing the stretch, and yielded
after shifting out passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
BADGEBALL broke a bit outwardly and brushed a rival at the start, stalked three wide, pressed entering the turn, vied outside of ENGRAVE turning for
home, got floated to the five path entering the lane before dueling through upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage in the final furlong, then was steered
outwardly to create separation with his inner counterpart at the sixteenth pole, flopped back to his left lead in the process, and edged clear. ENGRAVE
prompted the pace two wide, led from between horses at the three furlong pole as an outer BADGEBALL loomed a danger, drifted out to the four path while
clinging to a margin entering the lane, dueled gamely with that foe through upper stretch, but lost the advantage leaving the furlong grounds, then failed to
match strides in the final sixteenth. VERITABLE took a light brush from an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, got headed by a pair of outer
bidding rivals at the three furlong pole, gave way to them approaching the five sixteenths marker, yielded through the lane, yet fended off his stable-mate in
the closing stages to save show to the wire. SUNDAY BREEZE took a bump from an inner rival soon after the start, spotted the remainder of the field many
lengths down the backstretch, saved ground before shifting to the three path at the quarter pole, rallied between horses in midstretch to attempt to reach his
tiring stable-mate for show at the wire, but missed. INEXORABLE laid off of the pace four wide, took the turn in the four to five path, and stayed on late to
bid for show outside of a pair of foes, but also missed. LUCKY DEVIL tugged along the inside to an inside stalking position just behind the leaders
approaching the turn, chased those foes from the two to three path around the bend, but tired through the lane while hanging on his left lead. CALL ME
FAST pulled two wide and between horses to track the pace, checked mildly when the rider took a firm hold into the turn, then yielded when uncomfortable
between horses in the four path at the three furlong pole. LORD CAPTAIN bumped an outer rival after breaking a bit slowly, and showed little.

Footnotes
GET HER NUMBER stalked four wide, loomed a danger while inched closer turning for home, chased a clear GUN IT through upper stretch, progressed
and sparked a duel at the furlong grounds, battled outside of his wandering counterpart through the late stages, and gained an advantage nearing the wire.
GUN IT vied for the lead two wide and between horses, gained an advantage approaching the turn, drew clear of pressing foes on either side passing the
quarter pole as an outer GET HER NUMBER menaced, refused to respond to the rider's correction to change to his right lead approaching the three
sixteenths pole, met the aforementioned foe's challenge while wandering about and losing action due to the rider asking more forcefully for a lead change at
furlong grounds, clung to an advantage while losing action again a sixteenth later as the rider persisted, but was bested approaching the wire. LYKAN broke
a beat slowly, chased from midpack in the five path, tucked to the two path entering the turn, tipped back out to be four wide passing the quarter pole, and
moved up to reach show in midstretch. HAUNT prompted the pace three wide, then from between horses around the turn, but yielded entering the lane.
COUNTY FINAL vied for the lead along the inside, pressed inside of GUN IT around the turn, but gave way in upper stretch. PERFECT SPEIGHTY saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ATOKA broke a bit slowly, trailed in the three path around the turn before swinging five wide entering the lane, but
failed to factor.

Footnotes
LADY ROCKET set the pace in the two path, built a clear margin at the nine sixteenths pole, showed the way while well in hand around the turn, came into
the lane in the three path, was steered outwardly to confront SCONSIN's outer bid in upper stretch, then held sway firmly and safely thereafter. SCONSIN
stalked three wide, pursued to clear leader from the four path around the turn, inched closer to striking range while well in hand turning for home, took aim
on LADY ROCKET from the five path entering the lane, but drifted outwardly in upper stretch after that foe shifted closer, failed to keep pace before
straightening course in midstretch and secured place from an inner challenger. BELL'S THE ONE broke a step slowly, trailed along the inside into the turn,
slipped inside of a rival approaching the five sixteenths pole before awaiting racing room turning for home, paused behind BAYERNESS entering the lane
before that foe vacated the rail, rallied through that hole with a mild kick in upper stretch, attempted a bid for place inside of SCONSIN leaving the furlong
grounds, but leveled off. FOUR GRACES laid off of the pace three wide, tracked four wide turning for home before tipping to the five path entering the lane,
and stayed on mildly. BAYERNESS stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader while under urging around the turn, shifted off of the rail entering the
lane, but failed to progress between horses in upper stretch. PENNYBAKER broke half a beat slowly, settled off of the pace in the two path, but yielded
between horses around the turn to trail the field at the five sixteenths pole, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. KALYPSO
pressed the leader from the outside early on, chased that foe approaching the turn, then from between horses around the bend, but faded three wide
entering the lane.

TOP OF THE CHARTS refused to leave the tunnel for a small period of time, then prompted the pace outside of FAVORITE OUTLAW, dueled with that foe
around the turn, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and drew clear at the furlong grounds before finishing strongly. FAVORITE OUTLAW set the pace
inside of a pressing TOP OF THE CHARTS, dueled with that foe around the turn, got headed in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, then gave way
at the furlong grounds. RIGHT TONE took a bump from an inner rival while breaking a beat slowly, tracked in midpack four wide, ranged up turning for
home, but stalled in upper stretch while leveling into stride on his left lead. LOFTY ADJUDICATOR broke outwardly, stalked three wide, then from between
horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the top pair entering the lane, and lost show soon after. SCHMOOZIN saved ground while trailing, and
improved along the rail in upper stretch. IGNITIS took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but failed to
menace. OLLIEMEISTER broke a step slowly before shying from an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased from the two path around the
turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. RESPECT THE CODE broke a beat slowly while getting bumped by an inner rival, then laid off of the
pace along the inside, but never got involved. EYES OF GLORY took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, floated to the six path entering the lane,
but made little impact.
