Footnotes
INDY REBEL was unhurried while off the inside into the far turn, moved up from the four or five path through the turn, continued with good momentum into
the lane from the four path, caught the leader just outside the eighth pole then inched up and held. SPINEL vied for the lead from the three path into the
turn, continued in the three path through the turn and into the lane, shook off challengers while straightening in the lane , was joined by the winner with a
furlong to go and gave ground grudgingly to settle for second best. AIR PAYNTER was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, moved into the
lane from the five path and was gaining to the end. LITTLE RED SCOOTER vied for the lead through the turn while near the inside then gave way entering
the lane. LITTLE JOHN COLONY pressed the pace from between rivals into the turn while in the two path, settled back through mid-turn and weakened.
TRAVELINJUSTICE never a factor while near the rail. BILLUPS was off a step slow and veered to the rail, raced in the back into the lane and never was a
threat. LET'S GO JOE chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was asked for more in mid-turn to stay in a contending position then was empty
through the lane.

Footnotes
COMPRESSED ENERGY chased the leader through the turn while in the three path, bid into the lane to get nearer the winner, continued under a drive
through the final eighth and and edged up. ROYAL TO BE was off to a good start to gain the lead at once, raced on a clear lead through the turn and into
the lane, was still clear with an eighth to go then gave ground grudgingly to settle for second best. DOWNDELANE stumbled at the start and trailed early,
raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path to get nearest the top two then could not gain while just lasting for the show
spot. HARLANS PRINCESS raced in the four or five path through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on the leaders and just missed the show spot.
ROYAL CHEYANNE chased the pace from the three path and slowly lost ground. TWO CARROT RANSOM tracked the pace from the inside through the
turn then faded after entering the lane.

Footnotes
TIZ TACT TOE stalked the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid after straightening in the lane, caught the leader inside the eighth pole and
edged clear. TROPICAL TORNADO set a clear pace soon after the start, continued with a clear lead while under a hold, was asked for more after
straightening in the lane, yielded to the winner then stayed on to just save the place spot. BOONE'S SPIRIT stumbled at the start and settled back to trail,
moved through the far turn while in the three path, continued with good momentum into the lane while in the six or seven path and finished with good energy
to just miss the place spot. CLASSIC KING bobbled outward at the start, raced in the three path through the turns while never far back then lacked a closing
response. ZIPPER ZAPPER chased the pace from the inside into the lane then tired. SAINT COMMISSAIRE was in the two path while a contender for half
then was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
LIL EVIE settled off the early pace while in the three path, bid four wide through late turn, gained the lead into the lane, cleared well before the eighth pole
and extended while ridden out late. MORE APPROVAL bobbled at the start, raced in mid-pack through the turn while in the two path, was guided to the five
path through the lane and was up for the place spot. BROOKVILLE STORM chased the pace from the three path through the turn, moved up to get nearest
the winner when straightening in the lane then weakened through the final eighth while drifting in. QUICK AND EASY raced near the inside through the turn
and into the lane then moved up through the lane and just missed the show spot. LEXI SUN set the pace from the two path through late turn then gave way
while moving off the rail inside the eighth pole. DANCE MONEY never a factor while in the two or three path through the turn. FLIRTY DANCER chased the
pace from the two path through the turn then faded entering the lane. MISS FORT was outrun while saving ground. NOBLE PRIZE was never a menace
while in the four path.

Footnotes
HAWK OF WAR stalked the pace from the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane while still in the two or three path, gained a short lead with an
eighth to go then held while under strong handling. NIP N TUCK set the pace along the inside into the lane, vied with the winner through the lane and gave
ground grudgingly. FREEDOM'S WAY was in the three or four path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the six path and was
closing in to the wire. UNDERDRESSED chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, was a serious threat into the lane while swinging into the five
path then stayed on well to be inching up late. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) chased the pace while along the inside into the lane and needed more through the
final eighth. PURPLE DREAM raced in the two path through the turn while in mid-pack and finished evenly. GINSBURNED was off a bit awkwardly but
taken in hand, trailed for half, moved with momentum through the four or five path in late turn,came into the lane from the seven path and gained belatedly.
GOLD HERITAGE never a factor while in the two path. PERFECT SILENT CAT never a factor while saving ground. BLUEMOON JUSTICE was not far back
into the turn while in the three path then was suddenly done in late turn. HERE COMES TREY raced in the four or five path through the far turn and made
little impact.

Footnotes
CLOUDY was unrushed while comfortable in the second spot, bid on the far turn and caught the winner under mild urging to set a course record. HALOO
was clear early under swift fractions, then couldn't hold off the winner and proved second best. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF raced evenly in the two path.
TOLKIEN had a mild late bid for the fourth spot. STIRLING'S GOLD raced in the four path but had no late bid. SMARTY ALEX and BIGGIE raced evenly.
FIERCE ASSAULT saved ground to no avail. FIDELIO saved ground and then faded in the stretch. AFTERTHECONQUEST was not a factor.
