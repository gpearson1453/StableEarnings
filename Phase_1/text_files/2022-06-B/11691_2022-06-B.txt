threat, hung late and finished second best. MIDNIGHT BABY was never far back, closed steadily and was along for show. STORMY GALE led early,
pressed the pace to the turn, swung wide, fell back and faded through the stretch. MISCHIEVOUS EFFORT vied to the turn and gave way. BLACK BELT
GINNY reared at the start to be off slowly, fell back and passed a tiring rival. NAUGHTY NOT NICE was not a factor. The stewards' posted an inquiry
concerning the start. No change was made. Hand timed.

CROSS TOWN bumped at the start, led to the turn, responded when challenged and hung late. ROUGE SUNSET bumped and was squeezed at the start,
was checked entering the turn, fell back and held for show. HIGH FLYIN TIGER broke slowly, trailed the field, went wide in the stretch and offered a mild bid
only. REAL POUCH showed good early speed, fell back and had no further response. LUCKY CHANCE was crowded at the start, raced evenly and was not
a threat. HAMMERING LEMON had brief speed only.. Hand timed.

Footnotes
LA CASTIGLIONE stalked the pace, got through along the rail on the turn, assumed command and drew off. SENORADIABLO raced close to the pace
along the inside, angled out on the turn and lacked the needed rally. YES PLEASE was slow early, put in a steady effort and was along for show. LAST
PUNCH set a pressured pacce to the turn and gave way. J T'S LA NENA pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER showed
good early speed, swung wide leaving the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

AWESOME LADY set the pace, responded to pressure to duel for the lead and drew clear late to prove best. SKY HIGH VERONIKA vied inside, was
steadied early, came again along the inside to duel for the lead and hung late. ELLE VICTOIRE lagged early, put in a steady effort and earned show.
SNOOZY SUZY showed speed to the turn, bore out badly and dropped back. FACE OF GRACE failed to threaten in an even effort. DIXON DOLL stalked
the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. DYNAMIC WOMAN was not a factor. ALEMOON trailed the field. Hand timed.

Footnotes
TENGAS MASTERPIECE led early, fell back to stalk, rallied on the turn, assumed command and drew off under mild urging. DEPUTY'S DANCER raced
close to the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, failed to rally and was all outa for place. HEY NOW was never far back, put in a steady effort, failed to gain
and settled for show. GENERAL THAYER raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and came up empty late. ON ICE raced in the back and improved
position in a steady effort. GOLD STAR STUDENT was never far back along the inside, angled out on the turn and had nothing left for the drive. FULL
VISION ducked in at the start to be off slowly and was not a threat. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY set the pace to the turn and gave way. JOKERIN had brief
speed only. O G GULFSTREAM GUS was outrun. Hand timed.
