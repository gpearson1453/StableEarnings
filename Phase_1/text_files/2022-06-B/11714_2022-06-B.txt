Footnotes
CLEMENZA led off the rail inside three rivals, moved clear in midstretch and remained safe driving. SOUTHERN RUNNER prompted the pace between
rivals, bid inside the winner in the stretch but could not get by. MR. TUTTLE eased back then wide in the opening quarter and continued willingly just
missing the place. SPLITZVILLE broke slowly, moved up inside and lacked a rally. E T'S SUPER STAR dropped far behind outside and was never a factor.
LATE TO THE SHOW prompted the pace three wide then gave way in the stretch.

FAST INTENTIONS vied between rivals then inside, repelled repeated challenges and edged clear through the final furlong. SIZZLING ROMA settled inside
the dueling leaders, swung wide into the stretch, loomed a danger but was outfinished. REITERATE dueled three then two wide to midstretch and faltered.
ZENSATIONAL DIXIE trailed for half a mile inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. ANGINETTI chased within range along the inside and gave
way. KENAI COOL dropped far behind and was never in contention. ATLANTIC AVENUE alternated for the lead inside then was finished after half a mile.
SHIRLEY GREENE lacked speed and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
MUSAMAHA squeezed back at the start, split foes into the far turn, led into the stretch and pulled away while kept to her task. SPRINKLE THIS saved
ground close up, advanced into the stretch but proved no match for the winner. DON'T B RIDICULOUS set the pace to the quarter pole, drifted out and
weakened. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO dropped far behind inside then passed tiring rivals. POP THE CLUTCH prompted the pace wide to the quarter pole
and gave way. SNAPPY RIDE was reserved off the pace between rivals and lacked a rally. RUBY DOOBY DOO pressed the pacesetter to the far turn and
stopped abruptly. OVERTHEBLUESKY raced wide and stopped on the final turn.

ROADTRIPTONOWHERE forced the pace outside, took over when ready midway on the final turn then eagerly moved well clear while geared down late.
DANIEL SUN settled inside the pacesetters, bid on the final turn and proved no match for the winner. KID BOURBON lacked speed, advanced outside on
the final turn and was no threat. LOUIE'S LAW set a pressured pace inside, was passed midway on the turn and faltered. IMAGINE THIS trailed along the
inside and was never in contention. NAUTILUS prompted the pace three wide then was finished by the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
DERBY HOUSE outrun early, advanced inside, angled out rallying into the stretch then drew away and coasted to wire. ALFATEI stalked the leaders
outside, bid on the final turn and proved no match for the winner. DAVIDIC LINE set the pace along the inside, was collared on the final turn and weakened
in the stretch. MIDNIGHTCHARLY dropped back wide in the opening half mile then finished along the rail. SHOOGER RAY TOO bobbled at the break,
raced wide off the pace and stopped. COBBLE ROAD prompted the pace outside to the three eighths pole and faded. WISE JUDE dropped back after the
start and was always far behind.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TABBY saved ground throughout, settled off the pace, closed strongly through the stretch and surged clear in the final furlong. PRINCESS CUPID
pressed the pacesetter inside, was eased back into the far turn, bid, led briefly then tired. PAPER MANSION lacked speed then advanced in the two path
with good energy. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH was taken up into the far turn then rallied well wide in the stretch. SILVER FIST ducked in sharply at the start
striking the rail and losing any chance then chased inside. LEVIOSA prompted the pace outside then began fading on the turn. BELLA LINO set the pace in
the two path then inside and faded on the turn. PERFECT DIRECTION raced wide throughout, drifted wider on the turn retreating.
