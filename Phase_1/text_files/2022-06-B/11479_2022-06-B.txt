KEYSTONE FIELD checked while altering off a rivals heel's in the opening furlong, achieved an inside stalking position into the first turn, easily slipped
inside of the pace setter entering the far turn to bid at the three furlong pole, inched an advantage entering the lane from his outer counterpart, and edged
clear in midstretch before holding sway through the final furlong. RODERICK established a clear margin approaching the first turn, managed a loose lead
while a path off of the inner railing, left the rail open for KEYSTONE FIELD to produce a challenge into the far turn as an outer KOOLHAUS pressed intently,
got headed by the prior entering the lane, then failed to sustain the battle in midstretch, and kept on to prove second best. KOOLHAUS was prominent
inside of RODERICK early on, took back to alter course outside of that rival approaching the first turn, bumped an outer HOZIER in the process before
stalking the clear leader from the three path, pressed three wide around the far turn after the eventual winner produced a rail bid, but failed to keep pace
with the top two entering the lane, then remained well clear of fourth. CELERITY hopped minorly at the start, raced at the rear two wide, saved ground
around the far turn, but failed to threaten the top trio through the lane. BLANKET OF ROSES settled at the rear along the inside, trailed under urging two
wide around the far turn, spun in the four path entering the lane, and made little impact. HOZIER pursued outside of the leaders early on, took a bump from
an inner KOOLHAUS entering the first turn, tracked from the four path thereafter, but faded around the far turn.

ATTA BOY ANTHONY vied for the lead outside of FULL IMPACT through moderate fractions, forged an advantage at the three furlong pole, spun into the
lane in the four path, battled with his inner game counterpart through the lane via a long duel, and maintained an advantage. FULL IMPACT vied inside of
ATTA BOY ANTHONY from the get go, got headed by that foe at the three furlong pole, battled on entering the lane, sparred gamely through a prolonged
duel, but was bested. RUNWAY MAGIC tracked four wide and outside of foes around the turn, bid foe show in the five path entering the lane, gained that
position approaching midstretch while chasing the top two, and grinded away mildly at their advantage through the final furlong while proving best of the
rest. RIDGEPOINTE stalked along the inside, was ridden along under strong urging to keep pace in the two path around the turn, but failed to produce a bid
before tiring through the final furlong. ZOFFA broke a step slowly at the start, saved ground at the rear of the field around the turn, but to no avail. SPACE
ODESSEY stalked outside of the leading pair early on, chased from between rivals around the turn, but tired in the four path entering the lane. CATIPARI
broke a beat slowly, raced at the rear two wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and was outrun.

JUST CINDY bobbled slightly a few strides out of the gate after breaking a bit flat-footedly, tracked the leaders from the two path, shifted outside of the top
pair and to the four path at the three furlong pole to stalk, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage approaching the furlong grounds, and
edged away entering the final sixteenth. CORNINGSTONE rushed clear early on, met AMERICAN APPLE's challenge into the turn, briefly failed to keep
pace with that foe at the five sixteenths pole, but dug in in the two path entering the lane, vied again in upper stretch as an outer JUST CINDY menaced,
dueled with that foe through midstretch, but yielded a sixteenth from home. CHAMPAGNE CALLING raced off of the pace along the inside under a snug
hold while behind foes down the backstretch, moved between horses into the turn, tracked from the two path while off of the pace around the turn, then
stayed on to bid for show inside of rivals in the late stages, battled with JUST LIKE MAGIC approaching the wire for that position, and prevailed. JUST LIKE
MAGIC broke outwardly and bumped AMERICAN APPLE at the start, stalked two wide, but was outmoved by the aforementioned foe at the three furlong
pole, then again by the eventual winner while chasing turning for home, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, sustained stride to vie for show in the
final sixteenth, but missed that position. AMERICAN APPLE was bumped an bothered by an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, pulled to produce a
bold bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, led turning for home, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. C C CRUISE CONTROL took the turn in
the three path while off of the pace, then lacked a bid before shifting inwardly in upper stretch. CATHERINE BLAZE broke well, chased the pace along the
inside briefly, but folded into the turn.

Footnotes
ANGITUDE prompted the pace two wide, vied turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch, drew clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway
safely. PATHETIQUE chased two wide and between horses while under strong urging approaching the turn, pursued from behind the top pair around the
turn, sustained stride while tipping outside of them in upper stretch, took aim on a clearing ANGITUDE in upper stretch, and chased that foe home while
claiming place entering the final sixteenth. COMEDY ACT set the pace inside of a prompting ANGITUDE, sparred with that foe turning for home, but was
headed in upper stretch, and yielded approaching the furlong grounds. WINGS OF AN ANGEL tracked in the three path, shifted out to the five path entering
the lane, and stayed on mildly while outside of rivals. MY MY MUNNY stalked three wide, but lacked a bid while chasing between horses turning for home,
and failed to menace. GIVERNY broke a step slowly, moved forward to an inside stalking position down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace at the three
furlong pole, saved ground around the bend, but faded. MY SWEET KAT took up mildly at the start, trailed in the four path around the turn, then made little
impact in the five to six path through the lane. TRAIN TO ARTEMUS leaned outwardly at the start, tracked four wide, gained turning for home to take aim
outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but faltered in upper stretch. TWO SIXTYONE took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and was
outrun.

Footnotes
HIPPODROME vied for the lead inside of AMERICAN MAYHEM while a path off of the rail around the turn, dueled gamely through upper stretch, and shook
clear entering the final sixteenth. AMERICAN MAYHEM vied while in the middle of the track leaving the chute, sparred outside of the eventual winner while
in the four path around the turn, dueled through midstretch, but failed to keep pace in the final sixteenth. WHAT'S UP DOC broke slowly, moved two wide
and between horses while off of the pace approaching the turn, stayed on to claim show from an outer foe inside the final furlong, and held that position.
ARCH EGO laid close up between the leading pair early on, stalked those foes from the three path around the turn, chased them through the lane without
progressing, and lost show to an inner rival in the final furlong. HEIR TO GREATNESS tracked among foes, but lost position down the backstretch, raced at
the back three wide and between horses around the turn, and failed to menace. SILVER BLUR broke a step slowly, trailed four wide around the turn, and
lacked a rally while hanging on his left lead. G FLAT tracked along the inside, but weakened entering the lane. PAID TWICE tracked in the four path, but
faded in the five path entering the lane.
