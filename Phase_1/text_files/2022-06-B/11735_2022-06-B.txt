Footnotes
IT'S BOBS BUSINESS broke readily, sprinted clear of the field just off the inside racing into the turn, held sway on a widening margin into the lane and was
kept to mild hand urging. WITHSTANDTHESTORM, urged four deep, then between foes pursuing the leader into the turn, angled inwards moving to a clear
second entering the lane, then held rivals on a narrow margin late to prevail for the place honors. SHARPENED angled to the inside pursuing the pacesetter
in tandem with several rivals racing into the bend, switched out nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share between foes while
just missing for the place honors. FISHERMAN OSCAR, held up momentarily when bumped at the start, switched out four wide racing into the turn while
being roused to advance, gained terms with the second flight in late stages but was outkicked for a share. JERSEY WANNA BEE, caught five wide in early
stages pursuing the pacesetter, gave way racing into the turn. PRESTIGIOUSLY WILD, off slowly, then bumped at the start, never gained contention.
GRACE A'LACE broke inwards bumping a rival and dropped out early. IMAGINE DRAYGON was slow to gather stride and soon trailed the field.

Footnotes
JUST RIGHT MIKE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, dueled for command between foes through the turn turn, then edged
forward leaving the furlong marker under firm handling. MISAWA tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, advanced three deep into the turn to
press the issue to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. ELUSIVE FREUD, exchanged bumps with WARNING LABEL at the start, raced off
the first flight four wide between foes into the bend and continued evenly in late stages. SR. BOM BON was rated stalking just off the first flight a bit off the
inside racing to the turn, angled inwards a bit racing into upper stretch but had no late kick. BRASKA, slow into stride, dropped well off the leaders on the
backstretch, angled to the six path racing through the stretch and gained some position while making no impression. PROFOUND ONE, urged inside rivals
disputing the pace for three furlongs, gave way into upper stretch. WARNING LABEL, bumped at the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
DOCTOR OSCAR, away well, was roused right handed to establish the advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the
turn, then held sway, widening in the stretch under firm encouragement. BAYOU BENNY, forwardly placed three deep prompting the pacesetter racing into
the turn, proved no match in the drive while besting the others. SISAWAY NOW angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight,
saved ground to upper stretch and edged a rival for a share. GIVE EM HECK BECK tracked just off the pacesetter between foes through the backstretch,
was held up momentarily, then eased out to the four path racing into the turn while being urged to advance on the leaders but flattened out in that path
leaving midstretch. CHICKEN TRUCK tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn but offered no closing bid. LAPIS LAZULI tracked off
the second flight outside a rival racing into the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. COACH HAPPY, slow to gather stride, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATEICECREAM, reserved between rivals in the last flight racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling conceding some position
racing into the far turn, angled to the rail on the second bend, came through inside foes when presented an opening in upper stretch to challenge for
command, then came through close quarters in the closing stages to prevail under firm handling. JAILHOUSE KITTEN angled to the inside stalking off the
first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to bid between foes just off the inside entering upper stretch, disputed the issue grudgingly outside the
winner but was just outkicked. EXETER, bumped at the start, was righted to join the leaders three deep racing to the first turn, conceded some ground to the
pacesetter on the backstretch, moved to prompt that rival on the far turn, was carried out four wide by TIZONA entering upper stretch but continued with
interest while just outkicked by the top pair. UNBROKEN SONG, reserved along the inside while dropping out last racing to the backstretch, saved ground to
upper stretch and made some belated progress inside foes. CASHANOVA, bumped by OPTIMISTIC VALOR while being forced into EXETER at the start,
was righted while shifting inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, continued between rivals through the far turn, then
shifted four wide racing through the stretch while finishing evenly. TIZONA broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the first
turn, went briefly clear on the backstretch, resisted a rival's bid racing through the far turn, shifted out under pressure racing into the three path in upper
stretch and gave out between foes late. KRAMDEN shied outwards at the start, was urged to prompt the pace between foes to the first turn, was eased
back to track the leaders three wide between foes to the far turn and soon emptied out. OPTIMISTIC VALOR swerved out bumping rivals at the start, was
collected while caught outside foes racing four deep to the first turn, continued in that path through the far turn and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
PRINCE RAMA joined the pace four wide racing through the backstretch, continued to press the issue three deep on the bend, edged forward to a clear
advantage in upper stretch, then shifted to the inside while holding sway to the end under firm encouragement. MRS. BEANS, restless in the gate prior to
the start, was urged inside rivals pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, couldn't match the winner in the drive but proved best of the others.
LOOKIN FOR EIGHT settled well off the field along the inside racing to the turn, tipped off the inside splitting rivals nearing midstretch and continued with
interest to prevail for a share between foes late. STORMIN HONGKONG vied with the first flight three wide between foes in the opening quarter, pressed
the issue between foes to upper stretch and gave way. CUMBERLAND AVENUE tracked just off the first flight outside rivals in the opening quarter, was
prompted to make a brief advance four wide racing into the turn but came up empty in the lane. DYNAMIC RULER was rated stalking just off the first flight
along the inside racing into the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. REEF'S DESTINY was urged between foes pressing the pace through the
backstretch but gave way early.

Footnotes
APART OF MY CHARM came in at the start crossing into the path of BRIAR THICKET, sped clear of the field while angling to the inside, dictated the pace
to upper stretch and gamely held ROZEY CHEEKS to the end under firm handling. The latter stalked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight under
rating to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane, tipped out racing through the stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. MINNESOTA
NICE was rated off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, improved position into the lane and finished evenly late. JEWEL AZUL angled inwards
to track off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted to the inside leaving the far turn and continued with interest to gain some
position. FOXGLOVE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the far turn and faded into the stretch. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT ducked out at the
start while breaking last, switched out three wide racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. MERLIN'S SISTER tracked off the second flight inside rivals
to the backstretch and faded early. CUPIDS LOVE, forwardly placed between foes tracking just outside the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way into the
lane. BRUCE'S GIRL trailed the field to the stretch. BRIAR THICKET, shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, proved no threat.

Footnotes
TEST PILOT was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward in upper stretch, then shifted to the three path while
going clear in the closing stages being gathered up in the final strides. WESTPORT CAPTAIN angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing into the turn,
saved ground to upper stretch and came through inside foes to prevail for the place honors late. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY settled outside foes in the last flight
racing to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. CASEY'S LAW broke readily, attended the pace
three wide racing into the turn and faded under pressure in the drive. TIZ'A STELLAR DUDE, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch
into the turn, gave way in upper stretch. TAIL OF SAMSON shied outwards, then was shuffled back avoiding tight quarters at the start and never gained
contention. MR. PRIME TIME settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the turn but offered no rally. PRINCE OF EARL came under pressure between
foes in the last flight early but lacked a response.
