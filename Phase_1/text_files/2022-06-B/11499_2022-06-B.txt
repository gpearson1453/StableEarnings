Footnotes
MA FRANCE (IRE) stalked early and moved inside while in hand. waited for room behind the top pair on the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, headed the
leader at the eighth pole and kicked clear. VELVET got knocked into inside rival leaving the gate, steadied at the nine-sixteenths pole, stalked three deep
into the turn, angled out in the lane, rallied and proved second best. GRANOLA GIRL pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the turn and led past
the quarter pole, put away inner rival in upper stretch but was soon challenged by the winner, relinquished the lead past the eighth pole and flattened to
third. BELLE CHERIE broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, settled well off the rail, went four deep into the turn, entered the lane six wide and kept on
for a minor award. JUBILEE LAKE (GB) got bumped from outside in the beginning, got shuffled back between runners prior to the dirt crossing, moved into
range between rivals up the backstretch, spun four wide into the lane but lacked a late bid. PEANUT BUTTER CUP climbed crossing surfaces early then
settled into stride but had to steady shortly after, chased between leaving the backstretch, exited the bend two wide and could not rally. WISHING ON A
STAR raced greenly up the backstretch, went two then three wide around the turn and was not a factor. ANACAPA raced up close outside the top pair then
dropped back a bit and chased three deep, entered the stretch five wide and came up empty in the lane. QUICK ROMANCE set the pace inside a rival up
the backstretch, dueled around the turn, lost command with a quarter mile remaining, fought into the lane then gave way. REBEL GIRL chased along the
inside and never responded to urging. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BELLE CHERLE FROM FOURTH TO FIFTH FOR
BREAKING IN AND KNOCKING VELVET INTO JUBILEE LAKE (GB) AT THE START, WHICH COST JUBILEE LAKE (GB) A CHANCE AT A BETTER
PLACING.

Footnotes
VIOLENT RUNNER vied three deep up the backstretch, cleared past the three-eighths pole and crossed over, led clear into the final furlong, then got
pressured by LOMA VISTA in the final furlong and held that rival at bay. LOMA VISTA chased from outside then went four wide into the turn, traveled three
deep around the bend, took aim at the leader entering the stretch, bid from outside in the furlong grounds but could not get by. PEQUENA TORMENTA was
off slow to begin, went up to challenge between rivals, lost contact with the winner past the three-eighths pole, chased along the inside into the lane, steered
out nearing the eighth pole, lacked the needed late punch to threaten the top pair but finished a clear third. WORK TO LIVE was off a bit bit slow to begin,
vied with a pair of rivals up the backstretch, got put in tight two times on the turn, entered the stretch two wide and could not rally. TALKATIVE GAL
stumbled leaving the gate, chased two wide leaving the backstretch, drifted out a bit around the bend and also weakened.

Footnotes
ECONOMICAL rated early outside the leader, flanked the pacesetter into the far turn, dueled around the bend and cleared into the stretch, urged
right-handed through the lane and held off the challenge from TODAY MATTERS to gamely prevail. TODAY MATTERS broke a step slow, stalked in the
two path then moved inside, angled three wide around the far turn, drew alongside the leader in the late stages but failed to final kick to overtaken the
winner. KING ROB coaxed to the front from inside, set the pace to the far turn, dueled with the winner around the bend, lost touch into the stretch,
weakened in the lane but held the show. CORSICA FLAVOR was off a bit slow, chased four wide around the first turn, continued four wide into the far turn,
moved down to the three path around the bend and could not rally when called upon. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM traveled three then two wide around the first
turn, sat off the pace up the backstretch, traveled along the rail into the second bend then tipped out and came three wide into the stretch, lost the whip in
upper stretch and never threatened. QUINCEY stalked in the three path early on, angled to the rail around the far turn and lacked a rally. MONGOLIAN
BONUS got bumped leaving the gate, went angled down into the two path around the clubhouse turn, raced off the rail and came four wide into the stretch
and made no impact. LOOKOUT POINT traveled four wide near the back, raced outside rivals into the far turn then entered the lane five wide and was not a
factor. ASPHALT ANDY broke out and bumped rival, dropped well back early and never got involved.

Footnotes
SHE'S A JOKER shifted out but was quickly corrected at the start, stalked from inside, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied to the front with a sixteenth
remaining and drew clear. QUEEN OF POMPEII traveled near the inside at the back, ran up on heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the
stretch, tipped off the rail in the lane and closed well to earn second. ICONIC SKY broke out and bumped rival at the start, took an awkward step crossing
back onto the turn, moved clear to take control, headed by rival past the five-sixteenths pole, fought into deep stretch and yielded late. MISS O'BRIEN
stalked four deep early, bid outside the leader on the turn, dueled while holding a narrow advantage into the final furlong but flattened in deep stretch.
GOTHAM DESIRE got bumped at the start and crowded between runners shortly after, raced between runners at the back into the turn, tipped three wide
around the bend, angled out in the stretch and lacked a bid. BUY WAVE BUY raced three deep at the back early, went three then four wide around the turn
and was never a factor. KITTEN'S KID became fractious in the gate, chased between runners and got crowded entering the turn, went two to three wide
around the bend, moved out in the stretch and weakened. NICE AND TRUE bumped leaving the gate then tossed her head briefly early, forwardly placed
three deep on the backstretch, dropped back around the turn and faded out of contention.

LADY MARYANN dueled for the lead from inside to the turn, cleared rival around the bend, still confidently ridden into the lane, roused in upper stretch and
drew off while coasting in late. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY stumbled at the start, chased from inside, climbed entering the turn, eased out to three path around the
bend, then rallied to gain the place. FLAME MCGOON stumbled, broke out and bumped rival at the start, chased inside the top pair early then along the rail
into the turn, shifted to the two path around the bend, lacked a bid in the lane and lost the place. DON'T JU FORGET stumbled and got bumped between
rivals at the start, climbed a bit early while off the pace, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and earned a minor award. TAMARANDO COAST got bumped
on both sides at the start, tracked off the rail, three wide around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. BELLEO'S MUSIC broke a bit
slow, tracked well off the rail, rounded the turn five wide, steered inward in upper stretch and failed to menace. SAPADILLA got bumped leaving the gate,
traveled in mid-pack outside a rival, took the turn four wide and had little left for the stretch run. LUCY L stumbled and bumped leaving the gate, went four
wide into the turn, angled in a few paths and was not a factor. SMILING MOLLY stumbled, broke out and bumped rival, went up to duel from outside early,
lost touch with the winner on the turn, chased five wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
CARPE VINUM bumped rival leaving the gate, settled on the inside then went outside a rival, ranged up three wide past the quarter pole, took over in upper
stretch and drew away. QUATTROELLE (IRE) broke a step slow from outside, traveled in the two path near the back early, altered out past the quarter pole
and came four wide into the stretch, rallied and nailed FREEDOME FLYER for the place. FREEDOM FLYER rated three wide early, bid three then two wide
from outside on the far turn, led briefly in upper stretch but was quickly overtaken by the winner and got nailed at the wire for the place. MACADAMIA (BRZ)
bumped leaving the gate, angled down to the inside and settled in mid-pack, took closer order leaving the backstretch, lacked room and steadied past the
quarter pole and kept on through the final furlong while unable to threaten. JAVANICA forwardly placed in the two path early, bid outside the leader leaving
the backstretch, took over at the five-sixteenths marker, cleared SUPER GAME and angled to the rail, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. MISS
LOUNA (FR) reserved on the inside early, got blocked behind SUPER GAME and altered out past the quarter pole and could not after. SUPER GAME vied
from outside into the first turn then cleared and angled over to the rail, set the pace up the backstretch, challenged entering the far turn, lost command
midway around the bend, checked past the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
APPREHEND pressed from outside early, vied between rivals into the stretch, dueled with CITY RAGE in the final furlong and dug in late to share the win.
CITY RAGE stalked the top pair from outside, bid three deep on the turn, took over in upper stretch, drifted out a bit at the eight pole, battled outside
APPREHEND while drifting inward in the furlong grounds and gamely prevailed. HOUNDSTOOTH chased two then three wide around the turn, tipped out in
upper stretch, bothered by CITY RAGE at the eighth pole, kept on through deep stretch and finished gamely for third. COALINGA ROAD tracked four wide
and continued widest around the turn, chased within striking distance with a furlong remaining but lacked a late bid. LAW ABIDIN CITIZEN set the under
pressure early, vied with a pair of rivals on the turn and into the stretch, fought back to the eighth pole and weakened. DISC JOCKEY was off a bit slow,
trailed two wide to the stretch and failed to menace. THERE WAS A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOULD LODGED BY THE RIDER OF HOUNDSTOOTH
AGAINST APPREHEND FOR THE INCIDENT AT THE EIGHTH POLE. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT HOUNDSTOOTH
DRIFTED IN SLIGHTLY AS CITY RAGE DRIFTED OUT SLIGHTLY AS WELL AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
BOLDEN bumped leaving the gate, sped cleared and crossed over, drew away on the turn, roused in upper stretch and widened under hand urging.
JOHNNY PODRES settled off the rail, went two then three wide around the turn, summoned a mild rally and gained the place. FORGIVING SPIRIT was
closest in pursuit in the early going, chased a bit off the rail into the lane, lacked a late bid and got edged for second. BRIX came in at the start, tracked
along the inside, tipped out at the top of the stretch and failed to find the needed response. ROCKY GIBRALTAR broke slowest from outside, lagged behind
early, saved ground on the inside and was never a factor. CAERULEAN fractious in the gate, got forced in at the start, pulled hard up the backstretch before
settling into stride near the half-mile pole, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch and weakened. VROYSKY bumped with the winner leaving the gate,
steadied after crossing back onto the turn, chased outside a rival out of range, went two wide around the turn and came up empty.

MANITOWISH stalked off the rail, chased three to four wide around the turn, reeled in the leader at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MCWHERTER sped
to the front and crossed over to the two path, led a bit off the rail into the stretch, continued clear into the final furlong, caught by the winner at the sixteenth
pole and held the place. SHADY EMPIRE raced in range up the backstretch, went between rivals into the turn, asked two then three wide around the bend
but finished evenly in the final furlong. DANCE COMPANY brushed with outside rival at the start, sat off the pace, went two wide into the tur then angled
four wide around the bend and could not rally. FOREMAN was off a bit slow, went five wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend, tipped out in the
lane and failed to make an impact. VERRAGIO bobbled a bit leaving the gate then dropped back, trailed two wide into the stretch and not a factor. MAD
CATTER raced up close then went up to press the leader briefly from inside, could not keep up into the turn, lost ground around the bend and tired. FULL
DRAW brushed with DANCE COMPANY in the beginning, traveled off the rail then angled five wide around the turn and also failed to rally.

Footnotes
CHERUBIC FACTOR tugged early on the backstretch while outside rivals, got boxed in from the three-eighths to the five-sixteenths, gained a clear path and
spun three wide into the stretch, rallied five deep in the final furlong, bumped with KANT BEAT THE ROCK late and edged that rival for the victory. KANT
BEAT THE ROCK forwardly placed early, chased three wide around the turn, rallied four deep in the final furlong, bumped with CHERUBIC FACTOR late
while getting outclosed for the win. HEARTBREAKER was closest in pursuit to the outside of the pacesetter early, applied pressure past the
seven-sixteenths pole, lost contact with the leader at the five-sixteenths, re-bid three deep midstretch and finished gamely between rivals for third. MISSED
CALL stalked along the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, lacked room along the fence in upper stretch, found room in the final furlong, finished well
along the rail but lacked the needed late kick. SANTOS TO WILSON sped to the front and showed the way up the backstretch, challenged from outside past
the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared rival midway around the turn, clung to a short lead entering the final sixteenth and yielded late. BREAKFAST RIDE broke
out and bumped rival at the start, chased between then steadied off heels early, raced in tight quarters near the five-sixteenths pole and kept on through the
lane while unable to threaten. CONSTANT CONFLICT steadied off heels early, raced along the inside at the back, tipped out into the stretch, no threat.
SONIC BREES broke in and bumped rival, pulled and checked early, raced outside a rival at the back into the turn, went two wide around the bend then got
floated out into the stretch and made no impact. CHIPPER got pinballed leaving the gate, went four wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and came
up empty.
