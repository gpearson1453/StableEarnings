Footnotes
CONTEMPORARY ART coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket behind the cover of the leader, tipped to the two path three
furlongs from home and steadily advanced on the front coming under coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch seizing
command straightened away, drew clear under a drive and was mildly hand ridden through the final sixteenth to the finish. SAHLABIYA showed the way in
hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under challenge for the initial time, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded the
front straightened away, dug in under a drive proving no match for the top one while running on to safely secure the place honors on the line. PERSONAL
BEST saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to
secure the show honors. RHOMBIQUE forwardly placed two to three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three
wide at the head of the stretch and weakened in the late stages. ROSIA BAY three then two wide through the first turn, settled just off the inside just off the
pace behind the cover of RHOMBIQUE, tipped three wide with nine-sixteenths to go into the clear and chased three wide through the far turn placed to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled in to spin just off the inside for home, bid mildly to the finish but was outkicked. ORNAMENTAL just off the inside at
the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route at the quarter pole before tipping out to the four or five path with about
three-sixteenths to go, then made no impact.

Footnotes
ATHENRY was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide over heels while roused into upper stretch,
rallied to the lead coming to the eighth-pole, drifted out some under a left-handed crop in the final furlong, responded gamely to the challenge of the
runner-up in the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. KING MOONRACER dropped back after the start then settled near the rear, raced under
restraint in the two path around the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead while behind the winner past the
three-sixteenths then swapped to the proper lead while tipping out, rallied to make a bid into the final sixteenth but was turned back and just missed while
clear for the place. MONTATHAM settled on the outside, jostled with BOX OF JOE near the half-mile pole, went three to four wide around the turn, came
five wide into the stretch, pursued the vanguard under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. PROPENSITY
moved up on the outside after the leader crossed in front, pressed that foe on the outside then in the two path around the turn, was asked at the
three-sixteenths, gained a short lead under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker, dropped back into the
final sixteenth and weakened. FAST N FEARIOUS was bumped soundly at the start and forced into another foe, recovered quickly then angled in while
going to the front, showed the way inside through the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and gave
way. WINTER SON broke out and bumped soundly with an opponent, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while two then three wide around the
turn, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BOX OF JOE bumped with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, jostled
with MONTATHAM while dropping back at the half-mile pole, went four wide around the turn, dropped to the three path into the stretch and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
STORMI CAT LADY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside isolated between the top trio and one lone rival well behind, advanced from the
three-eighths coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch displacing the top pair straightened away for home, then
edged clear under a drive to prevail. GAME THEORY vied from the two path between foes early on, then dueled with SIMPLE SUGAR from the
nine-sixteenths through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and was overhauled straightened away,
then weakened to the finish while safe for the place honors. SIMPLE SUGAR hustled from the gate, vied inside a pair down the backstretch early on until
emerging in tandem with GAME THEORY to duel to the inside of that foe through the turn urged along from three furlongs out, cut the corner collared in
concert with her main pace rival and weakened to the wire while along well clear for the show honors. FROSTED BOURBON vied four then three wide with
a pair to her inside early on, got shaken off with nine-sixteenths to run and chased three to four wide through the turn, angled six wide at the top of the
stretch, faltered and was eased home to the finish. DELLA LUTE brushed the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside growing detached at the
tail of the field, continued just off the inside throughout while trailing throughout and was eased home to the finish walking late.

COMMUNITY ADJUSTED dropped from the two path to the rail around the opening bend, moved out while rated under a snug hold down the backstretch,
went three wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, rallied to make an outside bid in upper stretch, gained the advantage into the final furlong
and edged clear under steady urging. EYLARA (IRE) tucked into the two path entering the first turn, was unhurried at the back, traveled around the far turn
in the two path, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths then came under a drive into upper stretch and finished with late energy for the place. ENTWINE
(IRE) settled on the inside, was asked near the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders in the drive and lacked the needed
kick then just missed the place while able to get the show. MISS TAPIRADO went three then wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside,
made a bid in the two path with three furlongs to run, gained the lead at the quarter-pole, led under a drive to near the furlong marker then was headed by
the winner and weakened. EXCEPT TEMPTATION went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, raced two then three wide on the far
turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LINNY KATE went to the front, showed the way
on the inside, passed the five-sixteenths under coaxing, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
MORE MANGO just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked inside through the turn riding a loose pocket while patiently handled, took the
inside route into upper stretch placed to coaxing, advanced inside and was behind RIGBY when that rival drifted out a furlong out albeit with that rival safely
clear, had RIGBY go back inside inside that station and rallied to loosely split foes near the sixteenth marker before taking command in the final strides to
score. RIGBY dueled with HIGHWAY QUEEN very early on before shaking away to a length advantage briefly down the backstretch, had that rival latch
back on into the turn and dueled once more coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under lone late threat and was caught in the final jumps to the wire. HIGHWAY QUEEN dueled very early on after being hustled from the
gate, briefly got shaken off and prompted the aforementioned foe before surging into the turn to latch on and duel once more to the outside, got coaxed
along at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on surged home to preserve the show honors. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE five
paths off the inside early on, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly
for the last major share. BARBARA chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, kept on under a
drive to the wire but was out-finished. ALICIA'S WAY broke out at the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from three-eighths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and was outkicked. WRITE THIS DOWN four wide briefly, chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered
three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LEMON TAFFY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide
into upper stretch and tired. GAGLIANO chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn, went five wide into
upper stretch and trailed throughout.

BIG Q chased the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leader in the three path around the turn, dueled gamely with that foe in the stretch and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. QUALITY STONES broke fast and went straight to the front, showed the way in the two path around the turn, fought on
gamely with the winner in the stretch, dueled with that foe to the wire and was denied while just able to get the place. PRETTY CLEVER was last to
commence, raced off the pace under urging, drafted behind horses while along the rail on the turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch,
chased against the rail into the final furlong, made a bid outside the furlong marker, fought determinedly to the wire and just missed while able to get the
show. KHALI MAGIC bumped with a rival at the start, settled just off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, moved from three to five wide around
the turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, pursued the leaders while outside into the final furlong and finished willingly but missed the trifecta. WAILIN
JOSIE was forwardly placed on the outside, went four wide around the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, made a brief bid under a drive in upper stretch
but was out-kicked. MOSIENKO broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused between horses
at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response.

HAPPY FARM showed speed then chased the pace on the inside, saved ground around the turn, pursued the leaders under a drive while against the rail
into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up under strong handling. THREE TWO ZONE settled at the rear of the field, went around the
turn in the two path, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed well while remaining on his inside lead to make a bid near the furlong marker, gained a short
advantage while still on his inside lead into the final sixteenth but just missed while able to get the place. CHATEAU displayed good speed, showed the way
in the two path, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, led under a drive to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the
show. FIRE SWORD settled off the pace, was asked in the two path while between foes on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased into the
final furlong and weakened. NEWBOMB chased the pace on the outside, went three then four wide around the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths,
spun five wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
