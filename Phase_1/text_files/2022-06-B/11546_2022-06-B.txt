finished willingly to the wire. SUGGESTIVE HONOR (ARG) stalked the pace, checked in the early stages, raced three wide around the far turn, angled five
wide and finished willingly late. BETCHA BY GOLLY settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced four wide near the three eighths pole, was six to seven

KRACHENWAGEN pressed It's Game Time from the outside down the backstretch, raced two to three wide in the stretch while continuing to stay to outside
of foe and finished gamely to the wire. GHOST STALKER stalked the early pace, raced three wide near the five eighths pole, was ridden two wide near the
five sixteenths pole and came on again late while racing between rivals. BAHAMA CHANNEL tracked the top trio down the backstretch, dropped back a bit
near the five sixteenths pole, moved up inside the three sixteenths pole, raced in a bit tight at the eighth marker and kept on to the wire. LOST MY
VOWCHER raced in tight at the break, lagged off the early pace, angled five wide, bid three sixteenths pole and flattened out. MONYINTHEBANKSEY
settled off the early going, raced three to four wide and never was a factor. EXCALIBUR dropped back early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole
and never menaced. THREETHEHARDWAY was unhurried early on, saved ground and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
SUPER LOVE was urged early to set the early pace, had a clear lead down the backstretch, raced two wide in the lane, was eager and drew off to be well
clear under a steady hand ride. GOLDENIZE was forwardly placed, raced between near the half mile pole, chased the early leader and finished gamely
while racing inside foes. JEBOLOGIST stalked the pace, raced four deep near the half mile pole, was in pursuit through the far turn and kept on to the wire.
CYNERGY'S STAR settled off the pace, moved up nearing the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. FREE SQUARE raced between rivals early on,
shifted out in the drive and was empty late. ZEN PI was unhurried early on, well placed down the backstretch, angled five to six wide and had no rally.
LITTLEBITAMEDAL was a bit sluggish early, raced near the rail at the three eighths pole, angled out and never threatened. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND raced
off the inside early, angled widest in the lane and never threatened. MOSLEY NATURAL had a sluggish beginning, raced off the rail and never threatened.

Footnotes
WHY NOT TONIGHT rated kindly in the early stages, made a good bid near the three eighths pole and raced doggedly to wore down rival late under all out
pressure. CAN THE QUEEN was sent clear early on, met bid near the three eighths pole, raced clear while racing three wide through the upper stretch and
finished gamely to the wire. COCONUT CAKE stalked the pace from the outside, made an advance near the five sixteenths pole and slowly closed in on the
top pair late in a game effort. NO MO LADY was well placed early on, raced near the inside early on, edged up near the three eighths pole, took aim nearing
the eighth pole and flattened out. SHE IS WISKY settled off the early going, was asked nearing the quarter pole, had a four wide trip and made a good late
gain. I'M BLUSHING was rated early on to race midpack, raced between near the five sixteenths pole, eased out through the stretch and lacked a rally.
QUIET IMAGINATION was forced to check in the early stages, moved up between through the far turn, raced four wide through the upper stretch and raced
evenly late. DENDROBIA dropped back early, raced near the inside and never menaced. BREVIARY was slow early, raced three wide and never was a
factor. DAILY PLANET was allowed to settle early, raced near the inside while edging up near the half mile pole, checked slightly near the quarter pole and
faded. EPIC IDEA stalked the pace, was ridden along near the three eighths pole, tired the final quarter of a mile and was eased up on late. AWESOME
JAZZ was off slowly, raced near the inside and never was a factor.

Footnotes
MANOLITO was well rated early on, moved up through the turn, eased out three wide through the upper stretch, floated out a bit late and got up under
strong handling. FULLY CONNECTED bobbled at the break, vied two wide early on, raced clear through the far turn, drifted a bit late and gave way
grudgingly in a game effort. GHOST GAME raced off the early pace, ridden through the far turn, angled five wide and rallied late. DRIVE BY LAYOVER was
off a step slow, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled and flattened out. GREAT CAMANOE tracked the pace while racing four wide early, took
aim into the lane and gave way. BOSS MAN J J prompted the pace from the inside, raced willingly to the eighth pole and faded. PELOTA stalked the pace
while racing between rivals, asked near the five sixteenths pole while racing three deep and gave way late.
