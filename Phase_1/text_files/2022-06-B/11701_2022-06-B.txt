WORTHTHEMONEY got bumped at the start then was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, launched a two wide bid mid-way around the turn,
took over the lead upper stretch and finished going away. ROBERT WHO raced in contention off the top pair and chased three wide around the turn,
launched a bid for command turning for home and finished second best. STRONG STORM lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground on the turn,
launched an inside bid top stretch, edged closer and gained a share. WAR REPORTER raced off the early pace, urged two to three wide into the lane and
needed more for late impact. JOAN'S JUNIOR chased along the outside around the turn and failed to move on in the lane. MOONSHINE MAX sped to the
lead at the start, set the pace and held firm around the turn, got collared by the winner upper stretch and gave way. DOX BIZ showed brief response in the
opening quarter then faded.

Footnotes
FLY FIRST CLASS dueled for the lead up the backstretch, continued to battle with COLD SNACK THIRSTY into the final furlong, dug in gamely two wide
and held on. JAZZY JUSTIN raced near midpack into the turn, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane and captured place. COLD SNACK THIRTY
dueled for the lead up the backstretch, continued to battle outside of the eventual winner into the final furlong then ran on evenly late. NOTORIOUS NICK
hesitated and came away slowly at the start, hustled up into contention mid-way around the turn, chased four wide into the lane and lacked closing
response. THEGREATGENERATION race off the early pace, urged four to five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. BOO BE RIGHT was forwardly placed
up the backstretch, sustained bid through the turn then gave way. SEE THE PYRAMIDS raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and never
threatened. FLAT ROCK was off slow at the start and failed to move into contention. GRADESTER chased the pace along the inside and retreated in the
lane.
