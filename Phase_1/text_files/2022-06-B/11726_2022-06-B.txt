BARBARIAN dueled outside of a rival, bid at the eighth pole and drew off under steady urging. CAN'T HUSH THIS dueled inside of the winner, but was no
match late. BLUE NILE stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered. GJALLARHORN was not a factor. LONGER VIEW faded.

Footnotes
ESKENFORIT set the pace while under pressure into the backstretch, continued with pressure to the turn, shook clear before mid-turn, widened into the
lane while floating to the five or six path then was ridden out while extending the lead to the end. SAQEEL trailed the field while near the inside, bid into the
lane while still near the rail then moved up to gain the place spot late while not a threat to the top one. DREAM KEEPER pressed the pacesetter two wide
into the far turn, could not keep up through the turn and into the lane but stayed on to be clear for the show spot. MARITAL BLISS was never a factor while
in the three path through the turns. HEMP HEAVEN chased the pace along the inside and tired.

CREATIVE CREDIT was away alertly to gain a clear lead before the turn, widened through the turn and into the lane and maintained the comfortable
advantage while being ridden out. LEMOS CUNHA chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and was up
for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) was close up early then steadied when lacking room, raced along the
inside through the turn, came off the rail into the lane, found no room and shifted back to the inside and moved up for the show spot. CAT ATTACK chased
the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response. THUNDER LOVE (GB) chased the pace from the three path
through the turn and into the lane and weakened. NORTHERN DIAMOND was in the three path through the turn and lost ground throughout.

Footnotes
ROCKET DOCKET chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path with momentum, took aim on the leader after
straightening then methodically reeled that one in and rolled past. VENICE BEACH pressed the pacesetter into the turn while two wide, moved past in late
turn, cleared into the lane, opened her largest advantage with an eighth to go then could not hold sway while settling for second best. CAPTAIN HARVEY
was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, bid into the lane while three wide then rallied for the show spot and best of the rest. PRINCE ACT was
steadied between rivals into the turn, settled off a bit while in the two or three path, moved closer into the lane, swung into the stretch from the five path with
aim on the winner and weakened late. PURE TAP saved ground into the lane and moved up while not a threat. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE was in the three to
the four path through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. ALTERNATE NIGHTS was in the two path through the turn, angled into the seven path
for the drive and improved position. EDENS GLORY chased the pace from the four path through the turn and tired through the lane. BOLD BIZNESS was in
the three or four path through the turn and came into the lane from the eight path while never a menace. TITLETOWN JUSTICE raced along the inside and
steadily faded. GEORGE THE MAN set the pace on a clear lead early then folded up through the lane.

Footnotes
RAVE ON set a clear pace from the outset, raced near the inside through the far turn, was asked into the lane, widened to inside the eighth pole then
geared down in the last seventy yards. HEY BOSS chased the winner into the lane while in the two path, was no match for that one but finished under a
drive to save the place spot. MY FAVORITE UNCLE was taken up when shut off into the first turn, raced well back while near the rail, moved into the three
path through the turn when gaining momentum, continued with good energy into the lane from the five path and was closing in on the place spot. BIG
PAPER saved ground through the far turn when never far back then lacked a closing response. GUIDED ARROW tracked the winner from the two path into
the far turn then weakened after turning into the lane. FIERCE ASSAULT was steadied when put in tight on the backstretch, continued to save ground into
the lane and never factored. ELEGGUA chased the winner early while in the two path and steadily faded. RULE THE EMPIRE raced near the back while in
the two path through the turns and was done turning into the lane.

KING SOCIAL chased the pace from the three or four path through the turns, bid into the lane from the four path, caught the leader inside the sixteenth pole
then edged up. BENNY'S LEGACY was along the inside through the turns, came into the lane from the two path, shifted into the three path after the eighth
pole and was gaining to the end. ROTARY DIAL raced five wide into the far turn, continued well off the inside through the turn when gaining momentum,
entered the lane from the five path and finished with good energy from mid-track. CONCRETE CHARLIE was in the two path through the turns when well
back, came into the lane from the three path and was gaining momentum late. CLASSIC MAX set the pace while in the two path into the lane, continued
clear inside the eighth pole then gave way. DAAHER STREET was in the two path through the turns when well back, came into the lane from the three path,
moved up then finished evenly while not a threat. MANSFIELD TIGER chased the pace from the three path into the lane then weakened. HAZEL RAH
tracked the pace along the inside into the lane then tired. SCOTTY'S ON EDGE was bumped at the start, raced in the three path through the turns and
lacked a response. GOLD BUCKLE was in the two path through the turns and was done entering the lane. MILLION DOLLAR RED never a factor while
saving ground. SILENT SONATA was in the four or five path through the far turn and was never a factor.
