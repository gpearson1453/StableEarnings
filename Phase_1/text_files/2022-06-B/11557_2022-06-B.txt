Footnotes
SMARTY ILLUSION rated back early on, circled horses while three wide on the final turn, and won the battle down the stretch inching away late. TOTAL
BETTY stalked the leaders, took over entering the stretch, soon to be challenged by the winner on the outside and battled hard through the lane giving away
late. LOADED SECRET chased the leader early on, took command between runners briefly on the turn and finished up well. STOLE THE RING showed
early speed inside, was collared at the three eights pole and stubbornly gave way the final stages. SKINNY DIPPIN stalked mid pack, waited inside on the
turn, angled out in the stretch and showed some interest late. BODY OF LAW bobbled at the break, was roused in the final turn and offered little down the
stretch. PRINCESS SOLITAIRE hopped at the start, made a mild bid inside through the second turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
MIRIAM'S SKY stalked the loose pacesetter inside, angled out into the stretch, collared the leader and edged clear following a long drive. FIRST SPRING
settled outside, advanced wide on the turn and continued willingly while unable to get by the winner. SELF INFLICTED raced close up three wide, loomed a
stretch threat but flattened out. TRICKY MAGICIAN quickly moved clear setting the pace in hand, was collared in the lane, resisted but weakened. DANI'S
VICTORY saved ground throughout, chased the leaders then went evenly late. ROBUSTO prompted the pace in the two path then proved empty in the
stretch. JEGOS FIRE broke slowly then was steered very wide and was finished after half a mile. CERRADO dropped back early and was never in
contention.

WARP RIDE chased the leader throughout and wore down that rival in the final sixteenth. SPITE STORE took command early, opened up on the turn and
gave way grudgingly down the stretch late. RECONFIGURE rated near the rear, circled horses four wide through the turn and stretch finishing up with good
energy to be third. DETERMINED FURY stalked outside of horses around the turn, loomed into contention at the top of the stretch, rider lost his whip at the
eighth pole and ran even thereafter. SOUPER CLASSY stalked mid pack between horses, was roused entering the stretch and offered little. NEVAEH'S
DREAM saved ground on the turn and offered no finish while on the rail. LESSON LEARNED (IRE) was outrun early and never factored.

Footnotes
GIANT TEDDY reserved just off the pace, made a strong bid near the quarter pole then drew away eagerly under moderate urging. OCTOBER FROST
trailed early, circled his field rallying and continued strongly while no threat to the winner. JUSTIN'S WAY saved ground within striking range, angled out in
the stretch but offered only a mild bid. KIDDIE HOLIDAY chased wide throughout and finished willingly in the stretch. UNCLE JOE stalked the pacesetter
inside, was asked into the stretch but flattened out. STYLISH GENT controlled the pace inside then was finished after three quarters. BIG BROWN
BREWSKII lacked speed outside and was never a factor. QUIET WYATT prompted the pacesetter outside then faltered in the stretch. POSEIDON STEEL
saved ground well behind and lacked a rally. LUCYS CHILD chased three wide off the leaders and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BEN LOMOND was in a good stalking position early, lost his path while in between horses at the three sixteenth pole ,then re rallied up the rail in the final
eighth to draw away. REDOUTE'S LIGHT trailed early on, angled out the widest through the lane and finished very game outside to capture second at the
wire. STREET LEGAL rallied outside through the stretch to finish well just missing the photo for second. OUR ZUMA stalked the dueling leaders on the turn,
angled out at the quarter pole to briefly take the lead but could not hold off the challengers late and finished with a minor share. MALIBU MAX was rated mid
pack throughout, was behind horses waiting down the lane and found a seem to late to finish on end. D'S BEN was away alertly on the inside dueling with
foe around the turn and weakened the last eighth. SOCIETY JOE showed speed early while dueling with an inside rival through the turn and faded the final
eighth. GORGEOUS KITTEN was never involved. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL#2 STREET LEGAL AGAINST #8 REDOUTE'S LIGHT THROUGH THE

EPILOGUE reserved widest, advanced on the turn, bid into the stretch and was just up following a long duel. SILENCE BREAKERS forced the pace
outside, led briefly into the stretch, held on gamely but was nailed at the wire. DOTTED LINE saved ground throughout, stalked the pace, bid at the top of
the lane and continued willingly. EXECUTIVE SEARCH led along the inside, was collared the nearing stretch and weakened. JUNGLE FIGHTER dropped
back at the start and trailed then passed fading rivals. WHEAT KING raced just off the pace, moved between rivals on the turn then tired. SO SUAVE (IRE)
lacked speed and was finished by midway on the turn.

ENGLISH CLASSIC took a good inside stalking position early while behind the pacesetters, waited to angle out in the stretch to collar the leader at the
quarter pole and slowly began inching away the final sixteenth. HULLABALOO put away an early challenge entering the stretch, was headed at the quarter
pole and fought on bravely down the lane to just miss. COUSIN BOB loomed into contention while widest at the quarter pole, was slowly closing in on the
top two through the lane but could not get there late. INFAMOUS COVERT was between horses throughout, was roused entering the stretch and ran
willingly the final eighth to get a minor award. DAWSON SILVER trailed early, made a mild rally in the stretch on the rail, had to be steadied at the three
sixteenth pole, then rebid outside and finished with some interest late. PERFECT PLAY saved all the ground throughout and was never a factor. UNION
COLONEL challenged for the lead while inside through the turn, was headed at the quarter pole and weakened down the stretch. UNSPEAKABLE was
asked on the turn while outside of horses, angled out widest in the stretch and had little response.

MASON'S GAMBLE prompted the pace three wide, bid to front at the top of the stretch, was challenged repeatedly but held on tenaciously. CANDY
OVERLOAD trailed early, swung wide in the stretch, loomed as danger but could not get by the winner. SECRET RESERVE raced close up inside, loomed
a threat through the stretch but was outfinished. RED RIVER REBEL crowded early, raced in traffic on the turn, angled out to secure room and finished well.
SOUPER SUCCESS forced the pace four wide down the backstretch then weakened in the lane. SUNSPEAR broke sharply and led inside, drifted out into
the stretch and weakened. DUN DRUM dropped back early then moved along the inside in the stretch with a mild rally. FORESTER'S FORTUNE raced
close up behind a wall of rivals and continued willingly. LAST AMERICAN EXIT crowded early, chased outside and lacked a rally. ESKIMINZIN was taken
up and shuffled back near the quarter pole and gave way. A claim of foul by the rider of ESKIMINZIN against the winner for interference on the turn was
dismissed.

WHO'S THE STAR hopped at the start and trailed down the backstretch, then circled horses six wide at the five sixteenth pole to have a clear path down the
stretch to run down the leader late. PALAZZI rated behind the leaders on the rail early, then angled outside at the quarter pole to take command but could
not hold off the winner in deep stretch. ENGLISH CONQUEROR waited for room entering the stretch, then split horses at the quarter pole and finished well
but could not catch the top two. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION set the fractions early, was headed at the quarter pole and finished willingly to get a minor share.
SIR SAHIB loomed up at the quarter pole between horses only to lose his path, then had to be steadied and levelled out the final sixteenth. BURNING MAN
was near the back early and when asked entering the stretch offered little response. THEREGOESJOJO chased the leader through the backstretch and
was empty for the drive. JOCKEYS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #5 SIR SAHIB ON #3 PALAZZI AT THE EIGHTH POLE WAS

Footnotes
AWESOMECREST far back early, rallied on the final turn, split foes in the stretch and surged away in the final furlong. SASKATCHEWAN crossed over to
the lead early, remained clear to midstretch but could not hold off the winner. MAXIMUM DANGER pursued the pacesetter throughout then steadied slightly
late when issue decided. KILLARY dropped back three wide and lacked a solid rally. TIMMINS chased in midpack in the two path and never threatened.
POT COMMITTED was firmly rated off the leaders then faltered when asked. I LIVE BY FAITH broke slowly and lacked a response. BREACH OF TRUST
well placed outside, offered a brief bid on the final turn then proved empty in the stretch. LIONESQUE trailed early and was never in contention.
SNOOKERED saved ground well behind and was always outrun. ANSELMO prompted the pace to the far turn and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the
third finisher against the second finisher for interference late was dismissed.
