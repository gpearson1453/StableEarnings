Footnotes
IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN dueled for the lead on the inside and shook clear on the turn, then drew out in the drive to prove much the best under mild
urging. SOULSTONE was allowed to settle early, came six wide into the drive, lugged in nearing the furlong marker slamming BUTTON CANDY, then
continued rallying and lugged in leaving the sixteenth pole and got the place award late. SONG SAVER stalked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid
on the turn and flattened out. BUTTON CANDY was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out for racing and room and was
slammed and knocked sideways at the furlong marker, no late gain. OUR GOLDEN COLLEEN stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn
by the quarter pole and faded in the drive. SHEER ALICE (GB) broke in the air, was four wide by the quarter pole, had to check by the furlong marker and
angled out for racing room and had no rally. ASGATA dueled for the lead three wide and weakened. The Stewards posted an INQUIRY and the jockey on
number two BUTTON CANDY claimed foul against number six SOULSTONE for interference in the stretch, after video replay the STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED SOULSTONE from second and placed her fourth. PLEASE NOTE THE FINAL MARGINS WERE DONE BY THE PERSON WRITING THIS
CHART DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH CAMERA MALFUCTION.

THE LITTLE SPROUT prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain command by the quarter pole, then drew out in the drive to prove
much the best under brisk handling. KINGDA KA tracked the early pace from between rivals, was three wide on the turn and tipped out four wide leaving the
turn for aim, was no match for the winner while clearly second best. NOTORIOUS REY set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened, bested rest.
TOUCH OF PRINCE chased the early pace on the inside, then was two wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. MISTER ARANGUIZ lacked a rally.
GIANFORTE chased the early pace and was four wide on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
RED MESA set a pressured pace two wide, then was three wide into the lane and turned back the bid from DREAMING OF LOVE to draw clear in the
furlong grounds under mild urging. DREAMING OF LOVE prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and went on even terms for command
by the furlong marker, but flattened out, clearly second best. OWIN chased the early pace three wide and came five wide into the lane and had no rally,
bested rest. AFLEET TRAXX passed the tiring rivals. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY checked hard around the five eighths marker, came six wide into the drive
and had no rally. GEM JUAN chased the pace and was five wide on the turn and weakened. COOL YOUR BOOTS pressed the early pace on the inside and
weakened. ECHOES OF DESTINY was off slowly and showed little.
