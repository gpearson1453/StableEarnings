Footnotes
NOVA BOY raced off the duel down the backstretch, moved up three to four wide in the stretch run and finished well to get up under strong encouragement.
HERE WEGO showed good early speed along the inside to duel with Degas around down the backstretch, raced two to three wide in the lane, dug in and
held the place position late. DEGAS dueled while racing just to the outside of Nova Boy, raced three wide in lane and kept on to the wire. EXTRA MEDIUM
settled off the early pace along the inside, continued to race near the inside in the drive and made a mild late run. BIG RINNE dropped back early on, swung
five to six wide through the upper stretch and lacked a rally. SHOULDA HAD IT broke out, bumped at the start, saddle slipped and raced along the outside
while racing far back.

steady hand ride. SHE'S A TRIPP stalked the early going altered in near the five eighths pole, Jockey of She's a Tripp claimed objection for interference at
the five eighths marker and stewards ruled no change, raced near the rail at the quarter pole and got up for the place position. DIVINE VICTORY broke
slow, rushed to set the early pace and weakened the final furlong. COLOROFACLOUD pressed the pace while racing just to the outside of Divine Victory
and gave way while racing three wide. RATIONALMILLENNIAL stumbled break, was slow early and trailed.

IN A SPIN was a bit fractious pre-race, drifted in break, stalked the pace, waited near the three eighths pole while racing up between, swung four through
the upper stretch and finished well to just get up under strong handling. NICOLAR was forced to check at the break, a jockey objection was filed for the start
against the winner and stewards ruled no change, dropped to the back of the pack early on, made a strong advance through the far turn, raced five wide
through the upper and finished gamely to the wire. FUNWHILEITLASTED was sent along to set the early pace, dug in near the eighth pole and gave way
grudgingly late. COLOR CRUSH stalked the pace, made an inside bid through the far turn and flattened out. WINTER PRINCESS was forwardly placed to
lay up close early on, took aim inside, angled out and was empty late. HOT CHOICE settled off the early going, raced near the inside and lacked a bid.
HAPPYLIFE was unhurried early, raced two to three deep in the drive and had no response. BONNIE BLUETOOTH was forwardly placed to lay up close
early on and tired readily.

Footnotes
SWAYIN TO AND FRO was rated along the inside early on, moved up to take the lead through the far turn, raced under confidently handling and was well
clear to be a hand winner. Swayin to and fro stayed in her left lead through the stretch. JOE MIKE JIM was off a step slow, set the early pace along the
inside, was overtaken near the three eighths pole, re-railed in the stretch while racing off the rail but was no match for the winner. THIEF OF HEARTS
tracked the early pace while racing three wide, raced four wide in the lane and weakened a bit in the final stages while racing four deep. CHICA RABIOSA
stalked the pace, took aim in the drive while racing four wide and weakened. SO GRACIOUS was slow early, raced two to three wide and had no response.
PLIANTLEA saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
GASTOWN BABE settled off the early pace, circled four wide near the quarter pole, raced five to six wide inside the upper stretch, surged late and got up
under strong pressure. RAMBERT tracked the early pace, raced three to two wide, was clear at the eighth pole and was caught late. RIBALDRY (IRE)
settled to the middle of the pack, made a four wide bid in the drive, angled in and moved up to improve position. CANDAR was unhurried early on, angled
four wide and moved up in the drive. DETERMINED HOPE dropped back early on, checked off heels through the stretch, angled out and gained ground
late. SWIFT ACTION stumbled when in tight in the early stages and dropped well back, angled very wide through the stretch run and rallied willingly.
TREVISE stalked the early going, raced four wide near the quarter pole and weakened. BOURBON SWING was allowed to settle early on, raced four wide
in the drive, checked near the eighth pole and never threatened. ABSTRACT MOMENT stalked the pace, raced in traffic near the eighth marker and
weakened. VIVI MY LOVE raced midpack early and lost ground while racing four wide. PRINCESS PALMER was quick to begin to set the early pace and

finished well to get up under strong pressure. ROYAL WHISPER raced four wide early, circled five through the turn, led at the three sixteenths pole and
gave way grudgingly to the winner late. MOONSAFE was unhurried early on, moved up to split rivals near the three sixteenths pole, closed inside foes and
finished willingly. HITCH A RIDE made a good bid between rivals near the five sixteenths pole, had a narrow lead through the upper stretch and faded.
SWEET GRACIE raced off the early pace while racing three deep, was six wide through the upper stretch, shifted in and made a mild run. R B'S STAR
stumbled at the break, was forwardly placed and faded in the drive while racing three wide. SUMMER ODDS was off the early pace, angled seven to eight
wide and lacked a bid. KILIMANJARA broke slowly, raced near the back early on and lacked a bid. LITTLEBITALILY showed good early speed along the

Footnotes
ISLAND PHILO boke slowly, raced off the early pace, split rivals through the stretch run, drifted in and finished well to get up under strong handling. FAST
LANI showed good early speed to set the early pace, drifted to the outside fence through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. A GIRL NAMED JAC was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced in a bit tight near the three eighths pole, raced three to four wide and finished willingly to the wire.
BOURBON WILDCAT was off the early pace, circled five wide and moved up late. I'M GITTIN THERE settled to the middle of the pack early, raced four
wide near the quarter pole, angled in and made a mild late gain. BECKON was in tight, checked slightly near the half mile pole, raced near the inside at the
quarter pole, angled four wide and had not enough. TRIKKI NIKKI stalked the early going, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole moved up a bit past
the furlong grounds then lacked a solid finish. SOMMER VELVET was forwardly placed, raced near the rail in the stretch run, steadied near the eighth pole
and weakened.
