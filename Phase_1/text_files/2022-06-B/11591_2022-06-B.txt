SWEET SHALLOTS Away best, vied for the lead along the two path, took charge on that path at the top of the lane and under pressure proved best.
CLIFDEN PUNCH Vied for the lead along the rail, chased to no avail and finished second best. STABILIZE Slow to load, broke slow, saved ground on the
turn and made a mild bid. KAUFY FUTURES Well placed, tracked along the three path into the lane and weakened. KATIES COURAGE Fractious loading
in the gate, three path trailing on the turn, four wide out of it and tired.

Footnotes
PRINTRACK Vied for the lead along the two path, kicked clear in the lane and widened as much the best. BOURBON'S HOPE Vied for the lead along the
rail to the lane, chased and had enough left for the place. BROTHER JEREMIAH Unhurried along the three path, angled to the five path quickly on the turn
and rallied wide. FAR AWAY LOOK Gained along the rail on the turn and hung. FLIPPING FUN Unhurried along the two path, eased out and failed to fire.
QUAD PARTY Broke in the air, saved ground and tired. RUN CASPER RUN Four wide on the turn and tired. HOLY COWBOY Broke slow, close up five
wide early and tired. MISTER LARRY Close up along the two path into the turn and tired.
