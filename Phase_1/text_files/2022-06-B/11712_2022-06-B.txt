Footnotes
TIGERBEACH was in the three path while leading throughout to be much the best. MORE ICE was in the four path around the first turn then settled in the
middle of the pack while still in the four path, responded in the stretch to finish well. PICKING ROSES was allowed to settle in the two path down the
backstretch angled out at the top of the stretch to make a late rally. CANDIZAR saved ground throughout while chasing the leaders but didn't launched a
serious bid. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was position just off the pace and off the rail through the final turn and faded in the drive. EAST LEX saved ground
but was not a threat. DREAM HALO was void of speed and not a factor. INDY TOURIST went in the six path around the first turn then dropped in down the
backstretch to track the leaders in the two to three path but gave way in upper stretch.
