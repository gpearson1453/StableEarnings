STREET LAMP rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure and dueled Steal The Cash leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms nearest the
rail on the far turn, drew clear past the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged to hold on. SANTO raced off the pace in the two and three paths, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out leaving the turn and dug in to take second the final yards. STEAL THE CASH
raced with the pace, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dropped back from the winner past the
eighth pole but ran evenly through the stretch. ARE YOU HAPPY saved early ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the five
path of the far turn then flattened. ROCKIN THE PALACE saved ground, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled outward on the far turn and showed
little in the lane. DRUM AND BASS hesitated then veered out leaving the gate and saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn. ITS MR POPPI TO U was not a factor.

Footnotes
TIMEISGOLDEN settled off the pace in the three path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the three path, had her heels clipped by
Miss Chamita approaching the eighth pole but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. EXTRA CRUNCHY stalked, challenged at the
seven sixteenths pole and took the nod toward the five sixteenths, drew clear into the far turn, was steadily encourged leaving the turn, but gave up the lead
mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded. FORTUNATA ITALIA settled off the pace about the four path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close four
wide on the far turn and just missed second in an even finish. MIDNIGHT REGRET raced off the early pace toward the inside, picked up the chase laving
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five and six paths, drifted leaving the turn and closed the gap in and even finish. CHESAPEAKE
STORM rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail
into the far turn and weakened. GOSSIPING saved ground, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and had little left.
TAPPING SOUTH was not a factor. MISS CHAMITA settled back saving ground on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, closed the gap off the rail on the far turn but clipped the heels of Timeisgolden nearing the eighth pole and lost her jock. A Stewards inquiry
took place to review the incident nearing the eighth pole. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
STORMIN ROCKET saved ground just off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, dueled for the lead past the eighth
pole and held on with steady encouragement. PENGUIN PARADE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail, drifted toward the head of the lane and was caught leaving the eighth pole, but came back to finish well. NOID rounded the opening turn in
the three path, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the three path, lost some ground toward the head of the lane but
dug in through the stretch to take the nod for third under the wire. HAPPY YEARS came away awkwardly then stalked two deep, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn but was carried out toward the top of the stretch then nipped from third under the wire.
AZURE FIRE raced well back from early contention, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then eased outward through the
stretch while closing ground. FREEDOM RIDER rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, but faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
COACH RUBE set a pressured pace, inched clear two deep midway on the turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. BAHAMIAN GIRL
pressured the pace from the start, but dropped back at the rail midway on the turn, flattened stride late stretch, though, held on for second. MINER'S GEM
gave chase, rounded the turn in the two and three paths and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. SCARLET TANAGER came away a step slow
then angled to the outside to give chase, ran at the rail on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and passed rivals outside. CHIEFS KINGDOM gave
chase, rounded the turn in the three and four paths then flattened. LA FAMILIA gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened.
STROLLING THROUGH gave chase, eased outward on the turn and showed little in the lane. The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim of foul against
the rider of Coach Rube, for alleged interference on the turn, lodged by the rider of Bahamian Girl.

Footnotes
PARTY MONSTER settled close in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane,
drifted a bit into the stretch but dug in to steady handling and drew off. MOONLIGHT MISS lacked room through the front stretch and saved ground on the
opening turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and dug in to take second later yards. RAVIOLI MAMA
tapered in through the front stretch and stalked two deep, took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled clear past the seven sixteenths but was caught at
the rail approaching the top of the lane and flattened stride. TOTALLY PERFECT saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and flattened into the lane. CHANNEL SCENT rounded the first turn in the three path, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path, eased to the outside leaving the turn and showed little further. HOLIDAY CONNECTION saved
ground, bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole and flattened into the stretch. RHYTHM TREE set the early pace inside, was caught at the nine sixteenths
pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back leaving the seven sixteenths and gave way into the far turn. CROSS THE MERSEY rounded the first
turn about the four path, left the turn outside and faded through the backstretch.
