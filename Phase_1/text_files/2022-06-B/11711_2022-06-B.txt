Footnotes
ELVIS JUST ELVIS chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid from between rivals into the lane, continued on with steady energy through
the lane, edged up and held. EL CARDINAL set the early pace from near the two path, was joined by another into the turn, vied with that one to mid-turn,
shook that one off but was joined by others through late turn, continued on near even terms to inside the sixteenth pole then yielded while staying on for the
place spot. FIFTY TWO PICKUP raced in the four path through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane from the five path while three wide with the
others, continued in close proximity to late and missed the place spot. TEQUILA REVOLUTION was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and
showed some energy while not a threat. MY HONEY'S PERFECT vied for the lead along the inside through mid-turn then faded from the rail. JOE'S
CALLING was never a factor while along the inside. DISCOUNT DENNIS was outrun while racing in the two path into the lane.

continued on with good energy to collar the leader inside the eighth pole then inched up and held. MELTDOWN vied for the lead two wide into the far turn,
shook clear through mid-turn, was still with a short lead with an eighth to go then gave ground grudgingly. BLESSED WITH LUCK chased the pace from the
three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path and finished evenly. EGOMANIAC was in the two or three path through the turn and into the
lane then moved up while never a threat. EL BOHEMIO vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn and was done nearing mid-turn. GEMO RAIN was

PURR SEA stalked the pacesetters from the three path, bid three wide into the lane, shook up soon after straightening then was ridden out while widening
the advantage. PIPELINE GIRL set the pace along the inside through late turn, was no match for the winner while straightening in the lane but stayed on to
save the place spot. SHOSHONI MOON stumbled at the start, raced along the inside into the lane came off the rail for the drive and moved up for the minor
share while never a threat. QUICKY DESIRE chased the pace through the turn and into the lane then weakened. PRINCESS ELIN was never a serious
factor while in the two or three path through the turn.

Footnotes
BUTTONS tracked the pace while near the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the two path with aim on the top two, shifted into the four path
while gaining momentum and was up in time. MORNIN' BOSS set the pace while near the inside, was challenged for the top spot nearing the eighth pole,
lost the lead outside the sixteenth pole then gamely battled back along the rail and was inching to the front late when outfinished by the top one. HAPPY
GAL chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane while two wide, gained a short lead inside the eighth pole then could not hold off
the dueling rival then was outfinished by the winner. PEPPER SWEET raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane, was put in tight near the
eighth pole and gained mildly. JAYLA settled to the back early, raced in the three path through the turn, straightened in the lane from the five path and
moved up. MIDNIGHT XO was in the three path through the turn , came into the lane from the two path, drifted in near the eighth pole and weakened.

urging. TAPPIN INTO SUMMER raced in the three to the five path through the turn, came into the lane seven wide and stayed on to move up for the place
spot. WEST COAST JUSTICE was in the two path through the turn when never far back, bid from between rivals through the lane and never was a serious
threat while finishing clear for the show spot. KISSES SO SWEET saved ground through the turn, came off the inside and into the two path for the drive and
moved up late. LASHES was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane five wide to be a serious threat then flattened. PERFECT

MAMALA KAMALA settled four wide, rallied five wide at the quarter pole, angled in slightly in early stretch and drew off under mild urging. ZIPSY ROSE
LEE was unrushed early, rallied inside on the far turn, angled five wide in the stretch and closed well. MISS LUV SHACK led inside but couldn't last.
TOURASTAR stalked the pace in the three path, bid inside on the far turn, then faltered in the stretch. GOLDEN HEIST stalked the pace inside before
fading in the stretch. LAST HURRAH was off awkwardly, stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the three-eighths, tried to get in at the three-sixteenths pole
and lost momentum. SHARP LIFE was pinched back at the start. CLEVER KATE raced evenly. MISS DIAMOND RICH pressed the pace between foes to
the stretch and gave way. GIODORABLE was not a factor. MOLLY'S WARRIOR raced evenly between foes to the stretch and faded. AFTER AN
OBJECTION AND AN INQUIRY CONCERNING MAMALA KAMALA IN EARLY STRETCH, SHE WAS HELD BLAMELESS FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE.
