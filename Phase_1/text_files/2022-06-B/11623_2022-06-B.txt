stalked the pace four wide, angled in nearing the eighth pole, reached near even terms leaving that marker but was turned back by the winner. SPLURGE
hesitated at the start, raced three wide in midpack and finished evenly to gain the show. STUCK IN MALIBU slammed into the starting gate, raced off the
pace two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. FLAG WOMAN set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. DA JOURNEYGIRL
pressed the pace three wide between foes and weakened in the lane. ANNA'S IMAGE was outrun inside. GENUINE MISS saved ground and failed to
menace. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF DA JOURNEYGIRL AGAINST NICE BABY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER

Footnotes
GREAT UNCLE set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. NOTHNGOODCOMSEASY pressed the winner from
the three path, could not reel in that foe but stayed on to remain clear of the rest. THE MAR went evenly inside. COMMANDER BIZ broke in and bumped
PLAYERO into REDJACK at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, angled into the two path in upper stretch and
ran on for the show. PLAYERO was bumped between foes at the start, steadied along two wide around the first turn, went three wide around the far turn
and was one-paced through the lane. REDJACK was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, steadied late on the first turn and dropped back
inside. ENGINE'S READY chased the pace three wide and retreated through the stretch.

LANIAKEA STORM steadied early, stalked the pace inside, came through inside of foe in upper stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole, dueled inside
of the runner-up to the wire and prevailed. TRUE BLUE PEARL saved ground off the pace, edged closer two wide around the far turn, came four wide into
the lane, reached near even terms near the sixteenth pole and was narrowly outfinished. TIZ ENOUGH stalked the pace four wide around the first turn,
advanced outside down the backstretch, dropped back under a drive nearing the quarter pole, then came again widest in the lane to gain the show. KIZZY
set the pace in the two path, led past the eighth pole and weakened. NOVELERA raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, angled in nearing the
far turn, saved ground from there and lacked the needed rally. KNOWWHENTOFOLDEM stalked the pace four wide, bid four deep rounding the far turn,
battled to midstretch and tired. CHALLENGE PRINCESS failed to menace while racing four and five wide. BE NAUGHTY WITH ME had early speed while
hard held and was through early.

Footnotes
AWESOME ANNMARIE stalked the pace four wide, moved to the front in upper stretch, drifted out throughout the stretch and edged clear under
right-handed urging. OUR FANTASY hesitated at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, bumped entering the turn, saved ground around the
bend, bid inside of foe in midstretch and fought on to hold second. SIMPLIFY (ARG) set the pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch but battled
on between foes to save a slice. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL steadied near the half-mile pole, chased the pace inside around most of the turn, angled five wide
turning for home and had a mild gain. DON'T GET KHOZY raced without hind shoes, was off a bit slow, raced five wide around the turn and had a mild gain
down the center of the track in the stretch. RAIN pressed the pace three wide and tired in the drive. STARRY HOPE had early speed two wide, bumped with
OUR FANTASY entering the turn and retreated three wide.

DIGNIFIED hit the starting gate, raced well back four wide, closed strongly down the center of the track, took over leaving the eighth pole and readily drew
off. ROBBING ROBIN settled off the pace along the rail, came through inside of the pacesetter to take the lead in midstretch, was no match for the winner
but fought on to preserve the place. DIVINE CONNECTION raced off the pace three wide, bid in upper stretch, reached near even terms between foes in
midstretch but was outkicked. PUPPET MASTER raced well back three wide and rallied belatedly. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO was off slow then forced to
steady when DAVID'S ROSE ducked in soon after the start, raced two wide around the turn and never threatened. VELOCE BELLA set a fast pace along
the rail and tired in the lane. DAVID'S ROSE ducked in soon after the start, chased the pace two wide and faded through the lane. LI LI BEAR stalked the
pace in the clear two wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
BLACK SILK led early, settled off the duel inside, swung four wide near the quarter pole, swept to the front nearing the eight pole, drifted out and drove
clear. CENTSATIONAL GRACE pressed the pace three wide to upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and stayed on for the place. TORA
LORA LORA was off slow, advanced four and five wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. STELLARATOR raced two wide in midpack, angled four
wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. TIZMET dueled between foes to midstretch and weakened. RAIN OF BLESSING saved ground to no avail.
DRILLZILLA lacked early speed while racing two wide, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. SUPERSNAKE dueled along the rail to
upper stretch and tired. DALI'S HEART failed to menace while racing three and four wide. PENNY ANGEL hit the starting gate, raced three wide and never
threatened. OLYMPIC FENCER trailed outside.
