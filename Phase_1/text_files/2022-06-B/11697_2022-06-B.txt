MANUELITO stalked the pace between foes, rallied four wide in the stretch and was just up under steady urging. HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE led in the two
path, and was caught late. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT dueled outside of a foe and was caught for the place. MR. SPRINGTIME raced four wide, bid late and was
the best of the rest. ORIENT MAGIC pressed early in the three path, then faded in the stretch. SUDDEN SHIFT raced four wide but had no late bid.
DILLSBORO DEVIL was in tight at the half-mile mark, saved ground, then faded in the stretch. UNBRIDLED VICTOR was not a factor. BOOTDADDY
JUSTICE was in tight at the half-mile mark and fell, then was vanned off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY AND DISQUALIFIED
HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE FOR PUTTING PRESSURE ON HORSES INSIDE, CAUSING THE SPILL, AND PLACED HIM LAST.
