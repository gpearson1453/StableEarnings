POMME SAUVAGE trailed along the inside, was still behind while continuing to race inside heading into the stretch, and improved for show.
MYGIDGETMARIE stalked in the two path, was hustled from the inside around the turn, but flattened. KEENE ON JENNY chased from the four path, ws
roused three wide around the turn, drifted into the five path at the top of the stretch, but was empty.

the win. FUTILE rated between rivals, was cued while continuing to race between foes around the turn, tipped three wide into the stretch, and ran on. MR
FANTASY set the pace inside, raced in the three path at the top of the lane, but was rundown late to show. THE EXCEPTION raced well back while four
wide, was ridden in the four path at the top of the stretch, and improved position. FIRSTCADETE prompted the pace inside but faded entering the stretch.
SEANY P was in mid pack while three wide, drifted into the seven path into the stretch, and finished evenly. MOON LAUNCH tracked the pace from inside
but was done early. HIGH FIVE COTTON stalked while three wide, was asked three wide around the turn but was empty.
