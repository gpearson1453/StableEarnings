Footnotes
CAPSTONE GIRL set the pace in the two path, repulsed a bid nearing the lane, drew clear in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. JAZZY T settled off
the early pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, could not quite keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but kept on outside
and was rapidly gaining the later yards. CRYSTAL COAST stalked the winner three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out in the lane.
SIMONELA raced off the pace two wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn and had a mild stretch rally. DIVINE EXCHANGE failed to menace while
racing two and three wide. BALL LIGHTNING saved ground and never threatened. JEFF'S ANGEL was outrun inside. PLAY THAT TONE had brief speed
inside.

Footnotes
TRUST ME dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, drew off under a drive and held off a late closer
to the wire. INFINITE DIAMOND was boxed out by the horses to either side leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside early, began to improve
position from the two path up what remained of the backstretch and around the turn, and continued to gain ground steadily on the outside down the lane.
LUNA TUNA dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, gave way in
upper stretch and chased the winner home from there. LE BOIANA chased the front runners on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. DROPKICK QUEEN raced in the middle of the pack early, saved ground around the turn and
finished evenly while never threatening. IMPERIOUSLY brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack between
horses in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two and three path and came up empty in the stretch. GINRIN chased the leaders on the outside
in the early going, began to drop back while racing in three path around the turn and continued to tire from there. I LIKE VINO hit the gate leaving it, settled
off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. MURSAL trailed the field the entire way
around the oval, raced in the three path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LEE ANN'S WARRIOR brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, stalked the leaders from the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a
bid from the three path coming off the turn, gained ground on the outside and pulled clear in the final furlong. GEOSCIENCE dueled on the outside through
the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, was carried wide into the stretch, could not go with the winner late and
chased that rival home, holding second from a late closer. LORD DARNLEY bumped with the horse inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground steadily to the wire. AWESOME PUDDING
brushed with the outside horse leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ETERNAL REST tracked the pace setters on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane.
WHISKEYONHISLIPS raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and came up empty in the stretch.
FACTORINO reared up leaving the gate, almost unseating his rider in the process, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn,
improved position in upper stretch and flattened out from there.

Footnotes
STAR WEAVER tossed his head at the start to get off a bit slow then had his path taken away, trailed inside early, edged closer two wide around most of
the turn, swung five wide leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed widest and was up and clear late. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT
set the pace in the two path, held clear to deep stretch and just lasted for the place. CAMPEADOR saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the
quarter pole, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied through the lane to just miss second. MILITARY DRILL prompted the pace in the three path and
weakened in the lane. FRENCHMEN STREET steadied nearing the turn, raced five wide around the bend and was one-paced through the lane. NO NAY
MAYBE (IRE) chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. EARTH failed to menace while racing three wide. ZANNO had brief speed two wide. LIVING
VICARIOUSLY broke outwardly and bothered the winner at the start, raced four wide and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
DEM A WONDER maintained a short lead while racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to
the wire. VITAEMI pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, could not go
with the winner entering the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. COZY CAFE chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch,
came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. RACE DAY SPEED raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from
the three path and was outkicked in the lane. PLAYERA raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, continued around the turn in the
two path and came up empty from there. SHADILEE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving
ground around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch. LOVIN LIVIN raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two
and three path and never fired.

Footnotes
EMPIRE BUILDER saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around the far turn, came through a wide-open rail in upper stretch, struck the front in
midstretch and edged ahead. R ADMIRAL led in the two path early, settled back when DAKOTA BOY was intent on the lead late on the first turn, re-bid
outside of that foe nearing the far turn, set the pace in the three path around the that bend, led to midstretch and fought on outside of the winner. SIR
SAMUEL tracked the pace three and four wide, bid nearing the quarter pole but was one-paced outside of the top two in the lane. UNION OF THOUGHTS
failed to menace while racing three and four wide. EXACTING played no factor while racing two wide. BLUTO'S CANDY broke a bit awkwardly and made
little impact while racing two and three wide. MID ATLANTIC hit the starting gate and was outrun inside. BICKELL saved ground to no avail. DAKOTA BOY
rushed up three wide around the first turn, led down the backstretch and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
MADDY'S DREAM chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, took over with a furlong
to go and held off a late closer to the wire. THE DISTRACTOR hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
began to improve position from the two path while racing around the turn, and continued to gain ground steadily down the lane to just miss. HAMMER LANE
dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, gave way in upper stretch and chased the top two home from there. POPPY'S PRIDE dueled
for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch. GANGLY raced off the
pace on the outside early, angled in to save ground around the turn and offered no bid. VIVE BIEN tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
POIEMA set the pace along the rail, drew off readily, was urged past the eighth pole then geared down late. HA' PENNY chased the pace four wide, was no
match for the winner but stayed on to be clearly second best. EASY COME EASY GO saved ground off the best and bested the rest in the lane. RACHEL'S
ROCK broke awkwardly, stalked the pace two wide and faltered nearing the lane. KAEKO chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.
SOPHIA'S STORM had early speed three wide but was through after a half. PEACHY WEACHY was in range two wide and faltered around the turn.

path coming around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. TRAPPE THE WIND bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, raced four wide around the turn, swung out further still entering the
stretch and gained ground steadily to the wire. NEOPHYTE hit the gate leaving it, recovered to lead the way thorough the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn, kicked clear at the top of the stretch, was collared in the final furlong and weakened late. BLANK'S HAT TRICK raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly. BAKER BLOCK raced at the back of the pack in the opening
stages, came around the turn in the two path, split horses and gained ground in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. ETERNAL FLAME
tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. DOUBLE WARRIOR dueled
between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, gave way entering the stretch and tired from
there. WHERES HUNTER trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.
