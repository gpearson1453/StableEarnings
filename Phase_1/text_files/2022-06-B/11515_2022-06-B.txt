Footnotes
ANATOLIAN saved ground around the first turn, raced inside at the back of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a three wide bid coming off the
far turn and gained ground on the outside to pull clear late. SANDPIPER MEMORIES saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside
up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and chased the winner home. HIGH VIBES dueled from the two path around the first turn
and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the second bend, continued to battle in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final furlong.
WINNING AT EASE raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved
position mildly in the lane. UNBRIDLED GLITTER raced in the three and four path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside up the
backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path passing the three eighths pole and weakened in the stretch. DRY HUMOR hopped up leaving the
gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never
threatened. HEIR TO THE ROAR raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the three path and tired from there.

LAST LEAF stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the five-sixteenths marker, drew clear in midstretch and widened under a drive.
FREEDOM SPEAKS bobbled at the break, steadied leaving the chute, came out and bumped RAPTUROUS near the five-eighths pole, bid four wide around
the far turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but dug in inside a foe to hold the place. RAPTUROUS hit the starting gate then was in
tight leaving the chute, angled widest soon after, was bumped near the five-eighths marker, angled in to trail in the two path around most of the turn, swung
five wide in upper stretch, could not threaten the winner and was held off for the place late. SLOT QUEEN dueled two wide and weakened in the lane. ONE
IDENTITY dueled along the rail for a half and gave way near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
BION MAGIC raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn four wide, began a bid in upper
stretch, dueled outside down the lane and got up in the final strides. SPROUT WINGS chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path
coming around the turn, took the lead entering the stretch, dueled gamely to the wire and just missed. REAL DOOZIE raced between horses in the middle of
the pack in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the top two. VEIL raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. MS BIG SPRING led the field up the backstretch,
continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, gave way in upper stretch and faded from there. MAGICGIRL raced off the pace on the
inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn, improved position mildly in the lane and never threatened. PRETTY PRINCESS raced at the
back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was not a factor.

was no match for the top two late. OUTSHINE stalked the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane. PAPA

inside around the first turn, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. LONG BEACH KID saved ground and failed to menace. VALID

OF A REVOLUTION brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three
path coming around the turn, pulled clear with a furlong to go and was in command at the wire. FELIX brushed with the horse to his inside at the break,
recovered to duel from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. IF NOT
FOR LUCK brushed with the horses to either side leaving the gate, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and chased the
top two down the stretch. DESERT RULER raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outrun from there.
CHANCELLOR BAY raced off the pace on the inside early, was pulled up coming into the stretch and vanned off. POSITIVE REVIEW was squeezed into
tight quarters approaching the turn, lost his rider, was caught by the outriders post race and walked off.

Footnotes
RAMSEY SOLUTION was bumped hard between rivals just after the start, raced off the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, swept to the
front in midstretch and drew off under a drive. EAMONN settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and churned on to gain the place late. CALIBRATOR was intent on the lead in the three path around the first turn, set
the pace in the two path around the far turn, vied to midstretch and weakened. MO HAWK was soundly bumped at the start, had early speed inside, settled
back midway around the first turn when CALIBRATOR sped to the front, re-bid outside of that foe nearing the quarter pole, vied between to midstretch then
tired. JOURNEYMAN settled off the pace inside, advanced inside down the backstretch but had no response around the far turn. BETTERMENT failed to
menace while racing three wide. CARAMEL CHIP broke and bumped the winner at the start, saved ground off the pace and lacked a closing bid.
