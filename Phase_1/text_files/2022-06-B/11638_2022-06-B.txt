Footnotes
ANTIGONE rated between horses at the half mile pole, roused while three wide through the final turn, took command at the eighth pole to draw away nicely
at the end. LIL'S TURN chased the pace in the beginning, took the lead briefly at the quarter pole, was collared quickly by the winner but held second easily.
MOONLIGHT RAIN rated inside through the first half, waited on the final turn to angle out three wide entering the stretch and finished with interest to get
third. ELEANOR POWELL stalked outside mid pack early, loomed four wide on the final turn to contend but levelled out mid stretch to get a small share.
AMI'S LINK was away alertly to clear and take command on the rail, rated well through the backstretch, was headed at the quarter pole and faded while
inside the final eighth. FLAT OUT VIXEN trailed while saving ground throughout but was never a factor.

Footnotes
DAZZLING DIVA rated back in the early stages, made an early move at the half mile pole to get a good position into the turn, was four wide at the quarter
pole to take command then opened up quickly through the stretch to win comfortably. NORTHERN PASSAGE chased the pace just outside through the
turn, angled outside entering the stretch to the four path for a clear run and closed willingly for place. WANNA PLAY was brushed at the break, allowed the
settle behind horses down the backside, waited for a clear path through the turn and closed well between horses through the stretch to get third. FAVORITE
CHANNEL rated mid pack on the rail early, shuffled back a bit while inside on the turn and chased belated through the stretch to get a minor share. SHE
MAKES ME TIZZY trailed early on the outside, was roused while four wide through the turn and had nothing for the run down the lane. VIVIAN ANN
squeezed briefly at the start, took the lead at the five eighths pole, was collared by the winner at the quarter pole and backed away on the rail the final
eighth. DAISY DANGLES chased the leader in the first part, was shuffled back between horses through the turn and offered little down the lane.

COLLECTING FLATTER was away alertly on the outside to clear and take command on the rail, pressed on the the turn and challenged entering the stretch
by that same foe ,repelled that bid to open up through the final eighth. WITCH HAZEL was just outside the winner throughout, challenged turning for home
but was repelled at the eighth pole by the winner and held well for second money. FILM was between horses early, took back to be behind the pacesetters
through the turn on the rail and battled with an outside challenger down the lane to hold third. TRICK AND TREAT broke outward and was a step slow at the
break, rated back then angled to the outside of foes through the turn, battled with the inside horse through the lane for third money just missing that placing.

READY LADY settled off the leaders racing on or just off the rail, engaged the leader in mid-stretch, dueled inside that one and edged past late. SHE
MAKES A POINT settled well back of the pacesetter but leading the others, bid two to three wide taking the lead a furlong out, was then engaged and
outfinished by the winner. QUEEN JUDITH settled while shifting in, saved ground on the turn, came out in mid-stretch for room, gained show from inside
another rival while too late to tackle the top pair. AMAZIN QUEEN was unhurried early trailing the field, angled six wide turning for home, was outfinished for
third. SLEEK LYNX (GB) raced mid-pack going two to three wide on the turn, ran evenly. SAKE (FR) shifted in early racing third near the inside, went two
wide on the turn, weakened thereafter. MO TOURING sped clear to set the pace inside, gave way. BEQUIA raced outside rivals four to five wide, failed to
threaten. UMNEYAAT was inside a foe early, went three to four wide on the turn, shifted in once in the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
EVERYDAY MAGIC stalked two to three wide, moved to the lead at the top of the stretch, lugged out repeatedly through the lane and just lasted to get the
nod. LIVIN ON LUV tracked in behind just off the rail, found room between foes in upper stretch, was a game second but just missed. GRACE ON THE
GREEN saved ground on the first turn, moved out heading up the backstretch, advanced three to four wide on the far turn, was carried out in late stretch
and lacked the needed late bid. KIMONO KATE exchanged a light brush early, raced outside mid-pack three to five wide just off the leaders, was carried out
in late stretch and needed more late. WELL ACTUALLY exchanged a brush and was in tight early, raced between rivals before dropping back late up the
backstretch, shifted seven wide at the top of the stretch then angled in for room in late stretch while running on well. KOTO set the pace while pressed by
the winner, weakened through the stretch. FLEEKA broke a bit awkwardly and settled early, advanced inside rivals, then evened out in the stretch.
DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE raced outside foes mostly four to five wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NORTHERN RUBY was urged forward between rivals to set the pace facing, faced pressure from an outside rival, was clear a furlong from home and held
under steady urging. CEFALO attended the pace outside two to three wide, lost ground on the leader coming to the eighth pole as well as position, regained
the place and was gaining on the winner with good late energy. IMA DAREDEVIL raced off the leaders three wide into the turn, shifted five wide past the
quarter pole, kept on in the stretch to get up for third. ONEZY'S DREAM stalked mid-pack, went three then four wide on the turn, loomed a threat coming to
the eighth pole moving just briefly into second then lost show late. WAKE UP MAGGIE raced outside mostly four wide on the turn and was never near
enough to threaten. VALLEY GIRL broke a step slowly, shifted in and moved up inside to regain contact with the field, went two wide on the turn and evened
out thereafter. D'S SOUL showed some brief speed inside then steadily retreated.

GAMBLE'S SILVER rated kindly between horses through the half, waited inside just behind the pacesetter on the final turn and found the rail seam at the
eighth pole to quickly take the lead and inch away late. SILVER MAGNATIZED took command early setting all the pace, was collared by the winner at the
eighth pole giving way grudgingly the final sixteenth. FREDERICIA chased the leader three wide throughout, contended between horses turning for home
and fought on gamely down the lane to make a rebid to capture third place. SYSTEMATIC was bumped entering the first turn to be six wide ,circled horses
four wide on the final turn to contend but levelled out late losing third. LUZ DE LA LUNA was steadied outwards entering the first turn, rated behind horses
on the rail mid pack on the backside and showed some interest late between horses for the final eighth. BLAZING SKY trailed early while saving ground and
passed fading horses through the stretch. MUM'S THE WORD was squeezed entering the first turn, rated outside mid pack through the backstretch, rallied
mildly on the final turn and offered little at the finish. TAQUANYAH was a bit headstrong entering the first turn on the rail, settled nicely behind horses
through the backstretch, appeared to take multiple missteps from the half mile pole to the three eighths pole and was not persevered with afterwards.

Footnotes
HARD EDGE prompted the pace from outside, moved in from three to two wide early on the turn while moving ahead of inside rivals, was clear into the
stretch, held sway under steady handling. GIZMO'S B F F vied between rivals early, steadied just slightly and altered out three wide at the three-eighths
pole, kept on and held the place. IMAGERY settled off the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, came out six wide at the top of the stretch, gained
slowly and steadily to miss second. IN MY OPINION altered outside rivals off the rail early, raced at the back two to three wide on the turn, ran on evenly.
FOREST DRIFT altered outside rivals to avoid early traffic, raced off the pace four to five wide on the turn swinging seven deep into upper stretch, ran on
with mild late interest. SWEET CAROLENA was urged inside, bumped in that forward pursuit, contended along the rail, came up empty. TAKOTA was
within range of the leaders four wide, faded. IMA BEAST was in tight and bumped a rival then steadied in the early going, saved ground on the turn, failed to
menace. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF GIZMO'S B F F AGAINST HARD EDGE ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
HAZELBROOK was four wide circling the field on the turn, took command nearing the eighth pole and was full of run late to hold of an inside challenger.
MILLENNIUM FORCE stalked the pace on the rail, waited inside through the turn, angled just outside a fading runner to rally between horses finishing
strongly up the rail. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE chased the speed through the turn to lead briefly entering the stretch ,was headed by the winner nearing the
eighth pole and finished well holding onto third. MS VANCOUGAR loomed in contention while three wide on the turn and was outkicked while between
horses for the final eighth. AMALFI SKY broke inwards at the start, was between horses throughout the turn and ran evenly through the stretch. GHAALEB
THE GREAT trailed inside, angled out for the drive and passed a fading horse. BILLYJANE took the lead early, cleared and angled in to the rail on the turn,
was collared at the quarter pole and stopped through the stretch.

HALL OF DREAMS was reserved off the leaders early shifting in, raced mostly three to five wide, took aim advancing past rivals turning for home, rallied
strongly to drive past in the final seventy yards. GUARD OF HONOUR brushed with a rival heading into the first turn, tracked in behind the pace along the
inside, moved out and commenced a bid outside that one on the far turn, took the lead past the quarter, kicked clear in mid-stretch but was outkicked late.
BRINGER OF RAIN settled at the rear racing outside three to four wide, swung five wide turning for home, kept on to get up for show. STRONGER
TOGETHER stalked mid-pack two to three wide early, encouraged along three to four wide on the far turn, lost show honors late. BILL NEEDLE bumped a
rival lightly at the start, moved to the middle of the pack three to four wide heading into the first turn, continued two to three wide on the far turn and ran on
evenly. LARAQUE steadied in tight quarters while brushing lightly with a rival into the first turn, tracked inside, moved out four wide up the backstretch, was
within range three to four wide on the far turn, flattened out in the drive. TUFF RAGS was lightly bumped at the start, angled to the rail, saved ground early,
lacked room on the far turn, came out a bit leaving that bend and ran on. MAD MOCHA appeared to be getting out a bit heading to the first turn, moved back
in to dictate terms in the clear, was collared past the quarter pole and gave way. RALPHIE BOY bobbled slightly at the start, chased the leaders two to three
wide, asked for more early heading into the far turn but had no response and came up empty.
