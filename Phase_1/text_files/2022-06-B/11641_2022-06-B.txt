Footnotes
CLARE CRESCENT, bumped at the start by CHARLIES MISSILE, was righted to force the pace outside that rival in the opening stages, moved away to a
clear while angling inwards racing into the turn, held sway into upper stretch and widened late under mild encouragement. EXODUS AND HOPE tracked off
the first flight racing to the turn, tipped out to the three path entering the stretch and bested the others. TIMBER LADY settled between foes in the opening
stages, shifted out to the four path racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. ALITTLEBITALEXIS settled inside foes in the
last flight early, saved ground on the turn but never gained contention. CHARLIES MISSILE broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was righted, then
urged to dispute the pace briefly inside the winner into the turn and gave way into the lane. ALL SING BABY stumbled at the start, settled outside foes in the
last flight racing to the turn and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
LADY CLARE broke outwards brushing REESE C, then was squeezed between foes just after the start, recovered quickly to track the pacesetter inside a
rival racing into the first turn, was prompted to make a steady advance through the backstretch to challenge inside the pacesetter racing through the far turn,
wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and kicked away through the stretch under firm right handed encouragement. CANTERBURY GOLD ducked
out at the start making some contact with the eventual winner, was hustled clear shifting off the rail, dictated the pace to the far turn, briefly resisted the
winner's bid racing into the stretch but proved no match late. REESE C, bumped, then shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start, settled last racing to
the far turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with some late interest to gain some position while earning a share. TANTIMA, off a bit
slowly while held up out of close quarters after the start, settled along the inside racing to the backstrech, tipped out racing into upper stretch but had no
rally. MINKOTA JOY broke inwards bumping REESE C, was righted to track the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight racing to to the far turn and soon
faded. SURELY A LEGEND tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn while briefly gaining some position
but came up empty in the drive.

MR. D'S LEGEND was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, came around a tiring foe making a steady gain just off the inside to
gain striking distance leaving the midway point of the far turn, tipped out to split rivals racing past the three sixteenth marker to bid three deep entering the
lane and continued with a solid late response to wrest the advantage under firm handling. THAT'S NOT FUNNY tracked the pacesetter between foes in
second flight racing to the backstretch, made steady progress to gain terms with the leader nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage entering the lane
but proved no match when confronted by the winner. ANGEL'S MAGIC tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight to the backstretch, was urged to
advance in that path on the far turn, was fanned four wide racing into the stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. MINNESOTA RED,
caught four wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside a rival into the backstretch and continued evenly to late stages.
SCARYATCANTERBURY, urged to gain the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace for five furlongs, dueled for command through the far turn to upper
stretch and gave way. RED WAVE broke readily, angled to the rail early to track the pacesetter inside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch but
steadily faded after a half. EL DIABLO GUAPO was soon outdistanced but walked off the course under his own power.

Footnotes
IT'S HER TIME, caught in tight quarters while exchanging bumps at the start, was urged to the lead outside foes in the opening stages, dictated the pace on
a narrow advantage in the three path to the turn, angled inwards setting the pace while widening her margin on the turn, then continued grudgingly while
shifting a bit in late stages to hold SUNDANCE STAR on a safe margin to the end. The latter was rated off the second flight outside foes on the backstretch,
advanced four wide on the turn to upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner late. FLASH FLOOD tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight, tipped outside a tiring foe racing through the turn and continued evenly late. SAINT SARENA tracked the leaders inside rivals in
second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. MAIDEN ROCK settled between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the
lane but failed to menace. MOONSHINE MOXY broke outwards exchanging bumps with the eventual winner at the start, was urged between foes prompting
the pace inside that foe through the backstretch but emptied out after a half. MADISONIAN, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, trailed throughout while
racing wide into the lane.

Footnotes
WAR CHEST was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, continued under patient handling into the far turn, angled out five wide in
upper stretch and rallied to the front to go clear in time under firm handling. ATOMIC CANDY, forwardly placed pursuing the pacesetter in early stages,
conceded some ground to that rival to the lead the second flight to the far turn, tipped three wide entering the lane to take over midstretch but couldn't fend
off the winner late. ITS A BOY angled inwards tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, was urged to advance inside foes to bid along the rail in upper
stretch but was outkicked for second. ROBINSON settled into stride off the inside racing to the backstretch, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and
continued with an effort to improve position. CAVE HILL tracked off the second flight in the opening half, switched out three wide while being urged to
advance racing into the far turn to briefly gain striking distance nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. JOE PHILLIPS was urged to the lead
while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace on a clear margin to the second bend, briefly resisted when challenged nearing the lane but
gave way leaving midstretch. WHERE'S JORDAN settled while angling inside early, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. KING NATE trailed the
field to the stretch. TWISTED DIXIE was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter to the far turn and gave way on the far turn.

MAGIC CASTLE, in touch with the pacesetter three wide between foes prompting that rival through the backstretch, continued with a steady bid in that path
racing into upper stretch to challenge for command leaving the furlong marker and prevailed in time under firm handling. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY broke
sharply, was urged dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing well off the rail into the turn, dueled for command past midstretch and grudgingly resisted
the winner while just failed to contain that foe. OUT RUN'M, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, angled to the rail after the opening quarter,
continued with a steady effort to gain contention inside foes racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. RUNAWAY READY settled outside
foes in early stages, was fanned six wide entering the stretch and continued to improve position. CANDY WOMPUS settled along the rail in the opening
quarter, shifted out five wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. SAHM TEQUILA was urged along the inside pursuing the leaders into the turn
and gave way into upper stretch. TOP DOG, bumped at the start, was settled last racing to the turn and failed to menace thereafter. BOOTLEGGIN POSSE
broke awkwardly, was righted, then urged to contention racing four wide to the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SKYKAT was rated off the first flight between foes racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance
and continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage under strong handling. BABY BEE MERRY, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset
into the turn, couldn't contain the winner's bid but continued with a grudging effort to prevail for the place honors late. TEQUILA MARY settled along the
inside in the opening quarter, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued willingly to just miss for second. SILVER COIN, urged three
wide between foes pressing the pace on a narrow advantage from the outset to upper stretch, weakened between rivals late. AIKEN TO BE, urged between
foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the lane, gave way midstretch. PURPLE SCOOTER, caught five wide tracking just off the first flight
racing to the turn, continued in pursuit of the leaders four wide into the bend and soon emptied out. HOT HABANERO, forwardly placed four wide between
foes in the opening stages, was eased back from that position nearing the bend, then bore out badly entering the turn while quickly dropping out.

Footnotes
LADY GOLDSTART attended the pace four wide through the backstretch on her own courage, continued three deep into the bend while coming under
pressure to maintain striking distance, then continued with a steady effort to wear down the pacesetter to prevail in time under strong left handed
encouragement. CLICKBAIT was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch but failed to sustain her
momentum. HARKING, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the bend, gave way midstretch. STAR OF THE NORTH, reluctant to
load, broke a step slowly, shifted to the inside while climbing a bit racing into the turn and had no closing bid. SHE'S MY WARRIOR broke readily, vied
briefly three wide between foes in the opening furlong, angled inwards while dropping off the first flight racing into the first turn and quickly emptied out.
