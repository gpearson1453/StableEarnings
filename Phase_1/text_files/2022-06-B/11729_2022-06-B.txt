Footnotes
GONE INZANE tracked the early pace, then was two wide on the turn, eased out and came four wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to get up in
time under right handed crop urging and then a vigorous hand ride late. CALL WIL was well placed early, saved ground on the turn, made a inside bid
leaving the turn to gain a short advantage by the furlong marker, but was caught late, saved place award. SPEEDY MOONLITE set a pressured pace while
racing two wide, then kept on gamely to the wire to just miss the place award. SPIN CYCLE was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the inside on
the turn, then had a late rally on the inside but needed more. TRILOGY was off a step slow, reserved early towards the inside, angled out in the drive and
had a belated rally. HYMN'S SYLVIA broke in at the start, pressed the early pace and was three wide on the turn and weakened. GET A VALENTINE
chased the pace and was three to four wide on the turn and had no rally.

and came five wide into the lane, finished willingly to be gaining late, second best. EXPENSIVE was allowed to settle while two wide on the turn, then
moved to the inside leaving the quarter pole, had no kick while besting the rest. AFLEET TRAXX was off a step slow, reserved early, then was four wide by
the quarter pole and offered a belated rally. MY MAGICAL MAN vied for the lead between rivals and weakened. OWIN was allowed to settle early, then was
three to four wide on the turn and had no rally. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY vied for the lead four wide and weakened. GEM JUAN lacked a rally. ECHOES OF

UNCLE REMI was away alertly and soon clear and moved to the inside while clear, then remained clear by the furlong marker, then held sway late to prove
best under a drive. DECLARATION TIME was rated along early, was two wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, closed well late to get the place
award. ROBBY'S RANSOM was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, then was gaining on the inside late, missed place3 award. SACHMO was
reserved early, saved ground and advanced on the turn, angled out leaving the furlong marker, then checked in the furlong grounds, then had a late rally.
FREEAINTFREE tracked the winner early and made a mild two wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out late. ET'S MAGIC MAN offered a belated rally.
ECLIPTICALS BEAR failed to menace. ON THE RIM was settled early and then made a three to four wide run on the turn and weakened.
MONEYONTHELINE was through early.

Footnotes
BOURBON MUSIC rated inside early, shifted out nearing the half mile marker, made a three wide move on the turn, then was roused right handed and drew
off in the stretch to prove much the best, sharp. UNCLE BUDDY was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, made way to the inside on the turn and
was headed by the quarter pole, proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. PALACE SUPERNOVA was allowed to settle early, saved
ground on the turn and had no rally, bested rest. SPOOKY ONE was reserved early, then was two to three wide on the turn and had no rally. CAPTAIN
CHAZZ tracked the pace two wide and weakened. MAGNETIC CHARM was four wide and through early.
