RAISING MOON raced off the pace inside, moved up at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, split rivals in the stretch run, closed willingly
between horses and finished best to win going away. LE COSTE raced off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the far turn, came two wide into the
lane, rallied on the rail in the stretch drive and got up for second at the wire. VICTORS VALIANT was a bit reluctant loading, set the pace on the inside,
showed the way into the far turn, dueled past the quarter pole, then dug in gamely in the stretch drive and earned the show spot. TAP THE CANDY pulled
and was steadied along in the early stages racing close up two wide, then stalked two wide, bid between rivals on the far turn, dueled into the stretch and
was outkicked. ROCK THE STARS steadied leaving the chute, raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the backside, went five wide past the quarter
pole and rallied mildly outside. KING OF CHAOS raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole and rallied mildly in the lane. CHIEFS BLANKET
tracked close up on the inside, had a ground saving trip, lacked a bid and weakened. KING TSUNAMI steadied twice in the early stages on the inside, made
a four wide middle move into contention, bid three wide on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. FUSION JAZZ pulled and was steadied in the early
stages, stalked two wide, went four wide at the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
SHE'S GOT GAME tracked close up on the inside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled between rivals past the quarter pole, responded when asked,
took over near the sixteenth marker and drew clear under urging. BEAUTIFUL STAR stalked close up two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled
outside rivals, battled with the winner in upper stretch and came up second best. BAHAMA PEARL raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn,
angled out at the top of the lane and lacked a rally. SIREN'S LUCKY SONG raced four wide into the first turn, cleared the field, set the pace, dueled inside
rivals on the far turn and tired. COOL FRONT raced off the pace between rivals early, continued two wide on the far turn and lacked a response. BELLE
GOSSE raced off the pace with an inside trip and failed to threaten. THEFABULOUS MOOLAH stumbled at the start, raced five wide early, then three wide
off the pace and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
MONTAUK SUMMER was well placed tracking on the inside, waited patiently for room on the far turn, slipped out at the top of the lane, closed willingly
outside of SPARK (PER), took charge and pulled away. SPARK (PER) set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, responded when asked, briefly
shook free at the top of the lane, dug in gamely, was no match for the winner and saved the place. CANDY KINGDOM trailed the field, saved ground on the
far turn, rallied inside in upper stretch and finished well. DOUBLE DAVID pulled and was steadied in the early stages, pressed the pace in the two path, bid
two wide on the far turn, dueled and weakened. JO JO KATZ raced off the pace between rivals on the first turn, continued two wide, moved up three wide
on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and closed mildly. KING RAMOS raced off the pace, had an inside trip, raced between horses in upper stretch
and failed to rally. BIG PERM pulled and was steadied early while rating, then stalked two or three wide, chased on the far turn and tired. ROGALLO raced
three wide on the first turn, then two wide off the pace and gave way.

urging and coasted the final yards. OUR LUCKY MAN veered out at the break, then was sluggish and very slow into stride, left far back early, moved up
entering the far turn, made a three wide run on the turn, rallied in the stretch and finished well for second. SEICHE raced three wide early, settled two wide
off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and came again for third. STYNER stalked early on, then vied outside for the lead, dueled with the winner on
the far turn and tired. MAGIA NERA raced close up early on the rail, chased inside and tired. AWESOME LAUNCH raced off the pace inside, was asked on
the far turn and failed to respond. JACK RABBIT QUICK raced three wide off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn and gave way.
