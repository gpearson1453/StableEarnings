Footnotes
GIV'EM THE BIZ away alertly, prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, responded under right handed urging, made the lead, shook clear and won
under strong handling. TEAM LEYENDECKER unhurried early, angled out, closed willingly in the five path and finished well clear for second. RACIN' JACIN
allowed to settle, finished with good courage along the rail. WEEKENDER was hard used to stalked the pace for a half then faded. POWERFUL PHIL broke
in front, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. VOLUME OF TRUST was no factor. BLISTERING PAKSHI was outrun. BIG STOCK
WINNER had good early speed along the rail and was through after a half. THE GOSPEL OF MARK reared at the start and was never close. PER OHIO
STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2022-TDN-52, DATED 08/08/2022, GIV'EM THE BIZ WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
