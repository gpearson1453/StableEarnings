KANDY KATIE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide while battling for the
lead from the outside of ANOTHERSUNNYDAY entering the final turn, and wore down that stubborn pace rival in deep stretch, to prevail. WANDALITA
away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing three out from the lead, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
willingly five wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY away alertly and raced to the lead while racing out from
the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run to the final turn, battled through the final turn from the inside of
KANDY KATIE, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid effort. OSTRACIZE angled in to save ground entering the backstretch while securing a tracking trip,
rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn while awaiting room leaving the turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive while
gaining ground late. ICE BREAKER was slow into stride while trailing the field into the first turn, saved ground through the final turn, but failed to make a late
impact.

WE'RE IN COMMAND stalked the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run
down the backside, rallied smartly two wide into the final turn, tipped five wide leaving the turn, and closed determinedly four out from the rail in the drive to
prove best. VON DOM away well and pressed the pace three wide through the first turn and through the stretch the first time, continued three deep into the
second turn before easing into a tracking trip entering the backstretch, reengaged the leader three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three
wide in the drive in a solid effort. PADDY D'ORO away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, continued to set a pressured
pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with VON DOM entering the lane, and was
outfinished late. MUSTACHIO broke sharply and dueled for the lead from between rivals entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two
wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and was outfinished late. CALGARY CAPER unhurried early
while dropping well behind the rest of the field in the run to the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, raced three
wide into the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. The one mile split for this race was unavailable at the current time

DR. BENNY settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down
the backstretch while gaining ground approaching the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed
determinedly to assume command in mid stretch and draw clear late. SLOOP JOHN B away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace through the second turn and in the run down the backside, took a narrow advantage entering the final turn, held a clear lead into
the lane, but was no match for the winner late, while clearly second best. TRAPALIS unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced three out from the
rail while biding his time at the back of the field in the run down the backside, rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest three out
from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. Y VEE R hopped at the start to get away awkwardly, quickly raced into a tracking trip two out from the rail
entering the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backstretch while under snug restraint, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
was outfinished in the stretch drive. SHOWMAN broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of SLOOP JOHN B entering he first turn, forced the
issue from the outside of that rival through the second turn and in the run down the backside, struggled to match strides with his pace rival entering the final

share. HIGHER IMAGE chased the leaders three wide into the turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the drive. LENT ME TWENTY chased the
pacesetters one out from the rail entering the turn, but was unable to make a late impact while finishing two wide in the drive. VIVA CON WOW broke
sharply and chased the dueling leaders into the turn while racing two out from the rail, battled three wide through the turn, but was outfinished in the drive.
CHI CHI'S SONG was devoid of early speed while dropping back to trail the field into the turn, was always well back, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
A TREE OF LIFE broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the stretch while racing two out from the rail while well in hand, forced the issue three wide
in the run to the final turn, quickly took control and opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and continued to widen his advantage through the final
furlong while being geared down late. JACK DON'T DRINK stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground along the inside, rallied
from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides. EH TEE EM away alertly and
dueled for the lead from the outside of SOLANDER entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival through the second turn
and into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, was no match when overtaken by A TREE OF LIFE entering the final turn, and
just failed to hold the place while finishing two wide in the drive. SILVER ARROW settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the first
turn, dropped back to trail in the run to the second turn, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, swung five wide for the drive, but failed to make
a serious late impact. SOLANDER vied for the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run
down the backstretch, steadied when put in tight quarters at the rail entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. ZULU POWER was slow
into stride, but raced into a stalking trip while racing four wide approaching the second turn, began to drop back in the run to the final turn, and wasn't
persevered with in the late stages. Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry into possible interference enteringt he final turn. After
review there was no change made to the original order of finish

COULTERBERRY unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the
backside while gaining ground approaching the final turn, launched his bid two wide entering the turn, and was held in check while lacking racing room
leaving the turn, tipped six wide into the lane, and closed with a late rush to get up in the closing strides. JUST MAKE BELIEVE away alertly and stalked the
leaders through the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, continued with a four wide trip in the run down the backside and into the final
turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to just miss. MR. QUALITY tracked the leaders through the first turn while racing two out
from the rail, saved ground while commencing his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, angled off the rail entering the lane and closed willingly to
just miss. FRANKIE MACHINE vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from along the rail in
the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late.
KNOPFLER broke sharply and pressed the pace three wide entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue three wide in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, but was outfinished in deep stretch. FREE FOR SURE dueled for the lead from between rivals through the stretch the
first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, struggled to match strides with his pace rivals leaving
the turn, and faded in the stretch drive. The mile split for this race was currently unavailable

VALUE MAX settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to advance three wide midway down the
backstretch, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn and quickly drew clear to prove best. SHARPZAN away
well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly three
wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. MONTE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated
the pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was quickly overtaken entering the lane, and just failed to hold the place. CASSIDY COWBOY
settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive.
UNBROKEN broke sharply and tracked the leader through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, but
was outfinished in the late stages. NEW CHASER was slow into stride while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide from the back of the field entering the
final turn, but failed to make a late impact. MT SEYMOUR stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, continued two wide into
the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.
