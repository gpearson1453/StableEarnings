Footnotes
REAL GRACE tracked leader inside, challenged along the rail into the stretch, dueled, took over passing sixteenth pole, drew out late. MARKET KING
tracked leader outside, challenged into stretch, dueled, prevailed for the place but couldn't match the winner late. HALL RICH LEGACY opened up inside,
was challenged inside and out in early stretch, dueled between horses, gave way grudgingly. PLENTIFUL, back and inside early, advanced into the stretch,
angled out for room in deep stretch, bothering St. Louie Guy just before the wire, kept coming between horses to make a place bid. MR. DAZZLE stalked
outside, rallied to make a place bid. ST. LOUIE GUY tracked the leader between horses, was finishing evenly late when bothered. WARRIOR'S MAP
stalked widest, lacked rally. BLACK OPS showed little. The rider aboard ST. LOUIE GUY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of PLENTIFUL for
interference in deep stretch. PLENTIFUL was disqualified from fourth and placed sixth.
