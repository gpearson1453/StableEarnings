turn, dueled clear toward mid-stretch and held on well. MARTIN MAN settled inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the
three path, drifted leaving the turn, came along for second mid-stretch then flattened. AUBURN MILL rated the early pace inside, was met and came under
pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod at the three eighths, continued close at the rail on the far turn but flattened stride inside the
eighth pole. JEFFERY SCOTT settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little in
the lane. GRECIAN ADMIRAL rounded the first turn about the three path, raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the

Footnotes
OFFICER APPEAL came away a bit awkwardly but moved to the inside and rated the pace, was hand urged away from the five sixteenths pole, widened at
the rail on the far turn and finished of his own initiative. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled off the pace toward the inside, bid toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. RIGHTEOUS MAN saved ground off the pace, bid past the half mile pole, ran in the three path of
the far turn and showed little more. LUNAR IMAGE saved eaerly ground while racing well back, left the second turn outside and gave chase from the half
mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. HACKER MAN rounded the opening turn about the five path, bid leaving the
three eighths pole and could only improve his position. TOWERING CHANCE stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, though
faded at the rail on the far turn. CITIZEN'S FIRE was not a factor. EXPLOITATION stalked the early pace about the three path, but dropped back through
the second turn and faded past the seven sixteenths pole. TOMMY PIES rounded the opening turn about the four path, stalked from the seven eighths pole
but was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
HEY CONGRATS contesed even terms from the start, raced close at the rail on the turn, took the nod past the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to inch
clear of GRAND FIBER, who dueled at even terms from the start, contested the edge two deep on the turn, ceded the nod past the eighth pole then
flattened in late strides. INSIDE RISK gave chase leaving the chute, entered the turn about the three path, angled widest through the turn and finished well
for third while gaining on the top two. CASH FOR THE SOUL gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. RESIDENT
raced well back from early contention, ran at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. SCOTTSDALE chased the early pace toward the inside, angled to the
six path nearing the top of the lane and ran evenly in the lane. ZEP chased outside, rounded the turn about the eight path and showed little in the lane.
WIZARD OF ODDS chased, angled to the seven path through the turn and showed little more. FIT BUT FAT gave chase toward the inside then faded
through the lane. SOMERSET BAY gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path then weakened.

Footnotes
FRANKEE MERCH stalked off the rail on the first turn, started a three wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved to take the lead two
deep midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on. MY SACRED PLACE rated close about the three path, picked up the chase approaching
the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR rounded the opening turn
about the four path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, continued in the four path of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
JUNGLE WARRIOR tapered in through the front stretch and raced with the pace two deep, took the nod and dueled leaving the half mile pole, drew clear
toward the quarter, but was met a the rail midway on the far turn and flattened the final sixteenth. THE IRON BANK saved ground racing well back and
could only improve his position. VIDMER'S COURAGE saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. ELEVATED
FOREVER raced with the pace inside, was met and dueled leaving the half mile pole, raced close through the backstretch but dropped back toward the
quarter pole and faded at the rail on the far turn. SPINNING KITTEN was never a factor.

COURAGEOUS GRACE stalked two deep and took aim nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to the lead in the three path approaching the top of the
stretch, dug in to clear MAE SAI PRINCESS mid-stretch and held on well. The latter stalked the early pace from the three and four paths, raced at even
terms leaving the half mile pole and dueled clear of Take Me Home midway on the far turn, but at the same time picked up the challenge of the winner, gave
up the nod to that one nearing the eighth pole and relented the final sixteenth. DUSTWHIRL WONDER settled off the pace in the three and four paths the
opening turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and dug in to take the nod for
third under the wire. TAKE ME HOME set the early pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled close, but dropped back midway on the far turn,
flattened stride through the lane and was nipped from third under the wire. FLOATING BY saved ground well back, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and flattened into the lane. FONDA ROMANA saved ground and bid mildly from the seven sixteenths pole.
SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM stalked the early pace from the three path, started a four wide bid toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the three path of the
far turn. UPSY DAISY DO was unprepared for the break. NATIONALIST was through early.

HELLO AMIGO rounded the opening turn about the five path and left the turn outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the four
path of the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to get up the final strides. SOCIAL CHIC stalked the early pace then challenged leaving the
three eighths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn, dug in to steady encouragement but was caught in
the final strides. MISSIONSNINETYNINE angled to the inside toward the first turn and rated the pace, kept the edge over Social Chic leaving the half mile
pole, came under pressure nearing the three eighths and was met approaching the quarter pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage and ran
evenly in the lane. ALLEN CAN DO IT left the first turn outside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and ran
evenly in the lane. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the
three path of the far turn. SHOWTIME CAT settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and
flattened later yards. REMYS SHOWTIME steadied off the inside flank of Missionsninetynine nearing the first turn and rated close through the turn, picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in range off the rail on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. The Stewards reviewed claims of foul
against the riders of Hello Amigo and Missionsninetynine, lodged by the riders of Noballstwostrikes and Remys Showtime, respectively, for alleged
interference on the far turn, though, found no fouls.

and four paths, closed steadily and dueled through later yards for second. NORTHERN RIDGE rated off the pace and off the rail, rallied to the lead leaving

inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. MR HOOVER raced off the early
pace in the three and four paths, left the second turn outside and picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far
turn. WHAT DOES IT TAKE was shut off leaving the gate, settled off the pace in the two and three paths and bid only mildly leaving the seven sixteenths
pole. HUMPTY GRUMPTY set the early pace inside, was caught leaving the half mile pole, gave chase from that point but weakened at the rail on the far
