Footnotes
I LIKE DREAMING tracked the leader from the two path to the final turn, made a bid in mid turn to challenge the leader in the stretch drive and wore down
the leader and cleared late for the win. A STAR IS BORN NOW was allowed to settle on the inside in the second flight through the final turn then angled out
in upper stretch and made a late gain to be up for place. G'S STORM set the pace from the inside through the final turn then was challenged from the
outside in the stretch drive and weakened in the final furlong. ROBTADI STORM stalked the pace from the three path never made a serious bid and gave
way in the stretch. ACTIFDASH was in the four path in the first turn then moved to the two path between horses on the backstretch but was never a threat.
DOUBLE PRIORITY was in the four path into the first turn then settled in the three path on the backstretch, made a mild bid on the final turn and faltered.

SABER QUEEN hustled to press the pace from the inside then took command at the quarter pole and drew off while drifting out. GOLDEN ARTIST tracked
the leaders from the three path made a four wide rally to improve position. SUSAN JONES was prompted to the lead from the two path and weakened late.
STAR PRADO raced near the back made a rail bid in the stretch but was not enough. SPECTACULAR IZZY saved ground throughout and was not a factor.
BEAUTIFULANDWILD was never a threat.

Footnotes
POP LIFE was allowed to settle while saving ground around the first turn and down the backstretch made a three wide bid into the turn and closed well to be
up in the final jump. MILITARY BEARING was sent to the lead just off the rail around the first turn and down the backstretch was able to hold off the
challenge by MO TAP on the turn but was nailed by POP LIFE at the wire. MO TAP was in the four path in the first turn then moved to press the pace from
the two path on the backstretch, drew even with leader in mid turn but couldn't match strides and faded in the stretch. GUILTY LOVER was in the three path
on the first turn then dropped in to be forwardly place off the leaders but failed to menace. MOMENT OF STARDOM tracked the leaders from the inside but
never made a bid.
