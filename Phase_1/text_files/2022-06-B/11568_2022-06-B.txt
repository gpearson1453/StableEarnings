A GIRL LIKE ME was allowed to settle out of the gate and rated off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide midway around the turn, edged up to
challenge LAURIEANN for the lead in upper stretch, took command leaving the furlong marker and finished going away. LAURIEANN was forwardly placed
up the backstretch and into the turn then moved up to take over the lead from CATECHISM leaving the quarter pole, held a slim lead at the head of the lane
then got collared by the winner. BLACK KAT TAPS tracked in contention through early stages then hustled up three wide around the turn, weakened off the
top pair in upper stretch and ran on for a share. CATECHISM took command soon after the start and led the way into the turn, got collared by LAURIEANN
leaving the quarter pole and gave way. DARLENE STRONG was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, chased inside around the turn then retreated in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
TYLER'S TRIBE quickly cleared from the outside at the start and angled in, held a clear lead around the turn then drifted four wide turning for home, roused
for more in upper stretch, responded willingly and drew off while ridden out. ANNUAL BUDGET was off slow at the start, saved ground and rallied up the
inside to finish on equal terms for place. SUCCESSION raced off the early pace, came five wide into upper stretch, steadily edged up closer and finished on
equal terms for place. ROCKIN THE DAD BOD hustled up along the inside around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and finished evenly. STROLLN
WITH STELA chased two to three wide around the turn, came three wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. ACCELERITAS raced midpack into
the turn then chased four wide a furlong out and lacked a rally. MACH SWEDE was ridden along two to three wide and never threatened. SANGRIA SKY
chased after the eventual winner and came up empty in the lane. WILY WADE raced three wide around the turn and failed to move into contention. DARK
WHISKEY had no response.

marker, responded and edged away. SPURWINK LANE stumbled hard at the start and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted out four
wide at the head of the lane, finished strongly and captured place. LOTS OF GOLD dueled outside of rival for the early lead and continued to battle into
upper stretch, took a slim lead past the furlong marker then got outfinished. HATCHET GURL tracked the embattled pair around the turn, given cue three
wide turning for home but failed to kick on. TA raced off the early pace and chased along the outside, urged five wide into the lane and failed to rally. LG
SHEZA RANDOMCAT dueled inside of LOTS OF GOLD around the turn, battled for the lead to the furlong marker then came up empty.
