Footnotes
CATCHUSIFYOUCAN showed good early speed from the inside held gamely in the stretch run to be clear late under strong handling. BEVERLY'S
CHARGE was allowed to settle off the early pace, made a good advance while racing two wide through the far turn, raced four wide at the three sixteenths
pole and rallied for the place position late. MOON OVER TUSCANY stalked the pace from the outside while racing three deep, challenged the leader near
the five sixteenths pole, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. FIELD DAISEY chased the pace while racing through the far turn,
raced five wide through the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. HER GIANT pressed the early leader to the outside while racing two wide and
gave way the final quarter mile. LADY PROTONICO was off slowly, dropped to the back of the pack early, raced towards the outside in the drive and had no
late rally.

Footnotes
PEPPER PIKE raced off the early pace while racing near the inside down the backstretch, continued a rail bid near the quarter pole, shifted two wide to race
past Cabertoss and was well clear late under steady handling. JINGLE was rated down the backstretch, raced three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung
five wide through the upper stretch and got up for the place position late. CABERTOSS showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced clear nearing
the eighth pole and weakened the final furlong while racing near the rail. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF settled off the early pace, made quick move nearing the
half mile pole, pressed down the backstretch through the far turn, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened. HIGHER AUTHORITY was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on while racing between rivals and weakened through the stretch run while racing four wide. RIVER ECHO (GB)
settled off the early pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole, shifted five to six wide through the lane and had no rally. TO KALON was slow early, raced
four wide through the upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
COLONELSDARKTEMPER was quick to begin to set the early pace, was ridden along near the five sixteenths pole as The Stiff moved up to challenge,
responded well and was well clear late while racing near the rail under steady pressure. THE STIFF tracked the early leader while racing two wide down the
backstretch, was hard ridden near the three eighths pole, moved near the leader at the five sixteenths pole but couldn't match strides with the winner in the
stretch run and held the place position late. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART was sent when the gate was opened for early positioning, stalked the top pair along
the rail down the backstretch, raced three to four wide in the drive and kept on to the wire. PEEKACHO stalked the pace while racing three deep, raced four
wide near the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly late. GOOD JUJU settled off the early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no
late rally. WHAT A COUNTRY lunged at the break, settled near the back of the pace, raced four deep through the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
TIWANAKU showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced well clear through the far turn and held gamely to remain clear under steady handling.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, chased the leader through the far turn while racing two wide, was three to four
wide in the stretch and slowly closed in on the winner to finish second best. AMERICAN HERO chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch,
moved up four wide near the quarter pole and was no match for the top pair to race along for third. HAPPY ROMANCE broke to the outside, stalked the
early pace from the outside, and weakened the final quarter while racing near the inside. SEVEN FLAT dropped back early on, swung out five wide through
the upper stretch and had no late rally. SONO GRATO was slow early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. READY
PURSUIT was coaxed along early and tired readily.

ROMAN GIANT was away alertly, set all the pace down the backstretch and held gamely through the stretch run under steady handling. STORMIN ARMY
stalked the top trio early on, moved up four wide through the upper stretch, finished with good energy and got up for the place position late to finish second
best. THREE ZERO was coaxed along to press the early leader, challenged leader while racing two wide near the quarter pole, raced three wide in the
stretch run and kept on to the wire. DETERMINEDLY settled to the middle of the pack early on, made an advance through the far turn while racing two wide,
shifted five to six wide through the stretch run and made a late gain. EL CERRITO was unhurried early on, raced near the rail around the far turn, raced two
to three wide in the drive and raced evenly late. DEER DISTRICT was forwardly placed to lay up close, bore out near the three eighths pole, dropped near
the back of the pack, was ridden along again nearing the quarter pole, raced five to six wide in the stretch and never was a serious threat after early mishap.
HARD TO COME BY raced off the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole, was wide through the stretch run and had no rally. SCOTT CITY
dropped back early on, raced towards the inside and had no response. CAJUN BLAST settled off the early going, raced five to six wide through the upper

Footnotes
SILVERLEAF tracked the early leader down the backstretch whil racing two wide, finished strongly in the stretch run to forge clear under steady handling.
TIFFANY'S MO showed good early speed to set the early pace, was challenged by the leader nearing the five sixteenths pole and was no match for the
winner while racing near the rail. HEDY LAMARR stalked the pace, raced in tight quarters early on from the inside, raced three wide in the drive and raced
along for third. SACRED KITTEN settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the seven eighths pole, moved up through the stretch run and improved
position. WHAT'S TO DO dropped back early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no late rally. SPARE CASH was fanned six wide near
the seven eighths pole, raced midpack early on, was four wide through the upper stretch and had no response. MISS EVERYTHING was fanned five wide
near the seven eighths pole, raced near the back of the pack early, was five to six wide through the upper stretch and never threatened. MY SWEETNESS
failed to sustain a bid to race back late.
