Footnotes
CHASING DAYLIGHT went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path early the turn, moved to the three path while
shaking clear with three furlongs to run, spun four wide into the stretch, drifted out under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, drew off under steady
urging into the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. BAVARIAN CREME tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the
four path around the turn, chased the winner five wide into the stretch, pursued that foe under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear
for the place. FROSTY INVASION was rated off the pace, came under coaxing late on the backstretch, raced in the two path while put to stronger
encouragement around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MRS. BOOMER brushed
with an opponent at the start, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn,
dropped back with three furlongs to run, climbed severely and lost action into the kickback outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back fast at that point and
weakened. CAPITAL GAL settled on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide around the turn and failed to respond. PAVE MY WAY brushed
with a foe then was taken up some just after the start, angled in then was reserved at the rear, moved from the inside to the two path early on the turn then
shifted four wide around the three-eighths, continued four wide into the stretch and was no factor. LOLA LOLA veered in at the start, established a good
position just off the pace, came up empty along the rail on the turn and retreated then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
MY GIRL LEXI three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong out, edged clear under a drive to prevail. VIRADIA four wide in aim of the front, tucked to the two path through the turn advancing to take command
three furlongs out, came under coaxing at that juncture and was under threat to the outside when taking the inside route into upper stretch, got collared a
furlong from home, kept on clear of the rest for the place honors. MATOULA dueled early on from the two path with FOXTAIL to her outside, tucked inside
into the turn and was shaken off half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
QUASAR turned her head to the left side as the latch was sprung and got away last, chased three wide advancing midway on the turn and coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths to offer up a bid spinning two to three wide for home, couldn't sustain the move and tired in the stretch. SEEDS OF TIME five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. FOXTAIL dueled from the three path with MATOULA to her inside, tucked to the two path into the turn and shook off that rival
before coming under threat from a pair, tucked inside midway on the turn and readily yielded the front, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat,
folded and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
FORT TICONDEROGA broke in at the start, settled comfortably in fourth position, was asked while two to three wide around the turn then roused for more
near the quarter-pole, rallied under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under
good handling. GROWTH CAPITAL came away in good order and went to the front, tugged at the bit while showing the way under a snug hold, moved clear
with five furlongs to run, dropped from the two path to the rail around the turn, was set down in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the
furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken by the winner while clear for the place. MOST WANTED MAN
settled well back on the outside, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
improved to get the show while no threat to the top two. SMOKE AND HEAT brushed with a foe early, dropped back leaving the dogleg onto the main
course, settled towards the back, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, shifted from the rail to the two path around the turn, came under the crop in
the vicinity of the three-eighths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. PIVOTAL MISSION brushed with a foe early
while taken in hand, tugged at the bit under strong restraint while rated just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path while let out around the turn,
chased the winner into upper stretch and tired. CRIMSON ROCKET pulled hard while rank under stout restraint early, dropped back with five furlongs to run
then tracked the pace, was asked in the three path on the turn, dropped back with five-sixteenths to run and capitulated. NOTHINGTOSEEHERE lost his
footing at the start and was off a bit slow, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was
distanced.

Footnotes
SISTER LINDA four then three wide in aim of the front down the backstretch, advanced tucking three then two wide into the turn taking over command near
the three-eighths pole, steadily shook away through the latter portion of the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in growing a bit leg weary late while holding safe to the finish. CARAGATE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. MIA BEA STAR got bumped at
the start by SUNSET LOUISE and was knocked briefly askew, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path
through the turn getting placed to coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, went six wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors well clear
of the rest of the field. SUNSET LOUISE reluctant to load prior to the start, broke out at the start bumping MIA BEA STAR and knocking that rival briefly
sideways, chased three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. RAFFINITY coaxed from the
gate, pressed the pace along the inside briefly vying for command into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in the midst of being shaken off
and faded, went three wide into upper stretch and tired in the drive. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY lightly coaxed narrowly showing the way two to three wide
down the backstretch, was under challenge from flanking rivals into the turn and tucked to the two path before yielding command tucked inside and under
coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and tired.

ITS ALL RELEVANT bumped soundly with a rival at the start, jostled with MISTER WINSTON while taking the lead under coaxing near the seven-eighths,
shook clear with five furlongs to run, moved from the rail to the two path while extending the advantage around the turn, shortened stride into upper stretch,
was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop while tiring significantly outside the sixteenth-pole, went back to a
right-handed crop late and held desperately to prevail. DIRECT ORDER settled well back in the field, was urged along in the two path around the turn,
angled out under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, gained quickly on the winner into the final sixteenth and closed well but was too late while clear for
the place. O SHEA CAN U SEE broke in and bumped soundly with a foe while tossing his head some, trailed the field under urging, saved ground around
the turn and gained willingly to safely secure the show. PERUVIAN BOY broke a bit awkwardly and was last to commence, settled off the pace, moved
closer late on the backstretch, was asked while shifting from two to four wide around the turn, dropped to the three path outside the quarter-pole, chased
into the stretch and came up empty. AUBURN HILLS moved out in the early going, settled in third position on the far outside, was asked while four then
three wide around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. MISTER WINSTON broke out at the start, showed speed and led early, jostled
with ITS ALL RELEVANT while losing the advantage near the seven-eighths, dropped back with five furlongs to run, came up empty while shifting from
three to five wide around the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
BARLEEWON tracked the pace along the inside remaining patiently handled until set down angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to
close stoutly outside the top pair and just got up in the final jumps to score. TIMBUKTU two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong knocking heads with RALLY
SQUIRREL through to the finish taking narrow command seventy yards from home, then got nailed on the wire. RALLY SQUIRREL coaxed from the start,
tracked the pace along the inside until tipped to the two path nearing the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home,
rallied to take command a furlong out loosely between rivals, dug in dueling with the aforementioned foe and was headed by a bob of the noggin seventy
yards from home and caught then got outfinished in the final jumps while preserving the show honors. AGENT CREED tracked the pace along the inside
from mid pack until tipped three wide through the far turn getting put to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up
a mild kick. LORD FLINTSHIRE saved ground in pursuit from just off the pace, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, went six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished. FRONT LINE DANCER two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the
field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outfinished. BREADMAN saved ground
near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and offered no response. MASETA coaxed from the
gate, showed the way under rating along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under challenge for the initial time, cut the corner into
upper stretch under threat, dug in and was collared near the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES three to four wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no headway. MO DANCIN chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, tired. EDDIE THE GREAT coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from
three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
FROSTED OATS stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, made an outside bid near the
furlong marker, drew even with the leader coming to the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong urging. HEY THERE went to the front, showed the way on
the inside with company to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then put to a drive in upper stretch, led into the
final sixteenth but was denied while able to get the place. JANE MAST settled well off the pace, saved ground around the turn, steadied while traveling a bit
awkwardly along the rail outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive into upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and finished fast to just get the show.
MRS. GREEN was rated in a good position just off the pace, saved ground around the turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, chased into upper
stretch, moved out just inside the furlong marker and finished willingly to just miss the show. WINGS LIKE EAGLES broke out then was taken up, spotted
the front a few lengths, was reserved near the back, traveled around the turn in the two path while held up behind horses, shifted six wide at the
quarter-pole, steadied while lacking room behind horses to the three-sixteenths, altered in several paths for clear space outside the eighth-pole, rallied into
the final furlong, closed fast into the final sixteenth, checked sharply behind horses late and lost any chance in a brutal trip. BROADWAY BOOGIE settled on
the outside towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and improved position. DEVILLY prompted the pace
on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked approaching the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened.
AMBLE moved out midway down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, raced behind foes passing the five-sixteenths, wanted to angle out in
upper stretch but steadied while lacking room in behind horses, paused while trying to gather momentum into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick.
FULL COUNT FELICIA angled in early, exchanged bumps repeatedly with GATHER THE FACTS down the backstretch, went three then four wide around
the turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted out some under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker and also lacked the needed kick. CHARLEY
RUDE was reserved towards the back, went two then three wide around the turn, shifted six wide into the stretch, was carried out some near the furlong
marker and failed to rally. PHARAOH'S JEWEL settled nicely off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was asked late on that bend, shifted four
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GATHER THE FACTS exchanged bumps repeatedly with FULL COUNT FELICIA down the
backstretch, was roused four then three wide around the turn and failed to respond.
