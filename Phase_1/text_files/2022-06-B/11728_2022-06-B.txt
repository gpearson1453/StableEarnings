Footnotes
BIG CITY RALPH chased outside, collared the leader at the quarter pole, dueled to midstretch and edged away. THE ANGRY MAN hustled to the front, led
under pressure, dueled to midstretch, resisted then yielded. CHARLIE THE GREEK trailed early, moved wide on the final turn and stretch with a mild bid.
MY MAN ELVIS forced the pace outside for half a mile and faltered. KINGS HIGHWAY raced close up inside early, faded before half a mile and was no
factor. BOAT OVER THE HILL made a menacing move along rail after a quarter mile then faded.

Footnotes
CARTWHEEL controlled the pace inside, remained well clear and widened in the stretch under a moderate drive. QUIET PLEASE pursued the winner
outside throughout and proved easily second best. ABHAILE saved ground within striking range and flattened out. FLORENCIA was squeezed back at the
start then chased wide passed faders. GALILEO'S AFFAIR lagged far behind and was never in contention. MIKEY'S JEWEL raced wide off the leaders and
weakened steadily. BELLA G moved off the pace between rivals then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
RISQUE REBEL held a narrow advantage inside, repelled challenges then drew away through the final furlong while kept to a drive. FACTOR THIS IN
dueled the winner outside, loomed a stretch threat then weakened. SPRING EMPEROR settled behind the pacesetters, awaited room on the turn then
closed well inside. SON OF A SAINT stalked the duelers three wide, bid at the quarter pole then came up empty in the stretch. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL
dropped back at the start, moved outside on the final turn and was no threat. DUBROVSKY lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention. LOAD
UP MOE moved closer inside before half a mile then had no further response. MUCHACHO MACHO lacked speed outside and weakened steadily.

MOONCHILD quickly moved clear, controlled the pace in hand, widened through the stretch then was geared down late. DECISIVE CAUSE saved ground
off the pacesetter, bid on the final turn, proved no match while easily second best. MY FIRST LOVE pursued the pacesetter outside then flattened out in the
stretch. ADVOCATE HARBOR dropped far behind inside and lacked a rally. VIOLET JESSOP lagged far back and was never in contention.

Footnotes
I'M BLAMING YOU outrun early inside, angled out on the turn, moved wide and closed with a rush to get up in time. I SAW IT ALL saved ground throughout
then rallied strongly in the stretch too late. SHACKLE CAT forced the pace outside, led at the quarter pole and continued willingly. LAST INVESTMENT
raced close up, was fanned very wide, led briefly in the lane but weakened. FRANK N DUCKY raced close up inside, moved out rallying into the lane then
yielded. CATCH MY VIBE chased off the pace three wide and lacked a solid rally. ELITE MISSION broke poorly then trailed and was no factor.
FORGOTTEN MISSION hustled to a narrow lead inside then began fading on the turn.
