Footnotes
GOLDEN MERGER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded to steady handling and was up in the final strides. ONE
WARRIOR disputed the pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane but could not resist the winner from over the top. QUARTANO
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. MY BAD was off slow, lagged far back,
saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. I AM THE JUAN was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside and weakened after going
a half.

DOER NOT A FAKER was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with HENNESSY LOOKER RF disposed of that rival after going a half and
drew off. THRUTHESTORM was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive
but finished well to be clearly second best. HENNESSY LOOKER RF disputed the pace from the inside with the winner and gave way after going a half. MR
RIGGER was off slow, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. BYE BYE BROOKY raced off the pacesetters
early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. TARDY CAT broke sharply then lagged throughout.

Footnotes
GRACEANNE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased her margin into the stretch and was ridden out to be kept to task.
BERNICE WHO was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner but finished well to gain the
place. MAMIE'S WARRIOR was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. QUESTA broke sharply to chase
the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival and gave way in the drive. THE TIME'S RIGHT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
turn and did not menace. PARADISE N REACH was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
