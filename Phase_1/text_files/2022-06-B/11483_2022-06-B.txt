FIRING PIN was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was up with a rush in the final seventy yards. NUMMY NUM saved ground while being
prominently placed early, slipped through inside of Coastal Wonder entering the stretch, gained the lead nearing the eighth pole, but was unable to resist the
winner late. BET THE HOUSE was forwardly placed from the start while racing three-wide and was going well at the finish. R N' R ATTHE BEACH broke in
at the start to bump Havarti Gold, then dropped early, angled out in the stretch and made up some ground late. COASTAL WONDER sprinted clear early,
saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole and tired. HAVARTI GOLD was bumped at the start by R n' R Atthe
Beach, then showed brief speed from between horses and gave way nearing the stretch.

MAHI MAHI was reserved off the dueling pacesetters, rallied four-wide the final quarter and was up with a late rush. CAPITAL EXPENSE dueled for the lead
from the outside along the outside, responded during the drive and held on gamely for the place. LA WAUN dueled for the lead from along the inside, but
lacked the needed late response. R B EYE saved ground while lacking early speed, continued along the inside into the stretch and found his best stride too
late. MAMACALLMEBOO gave way after showing brief early speed from between horses.

MISS KITNESS was off a step slow, rushed up between horses to open a clear lead on the backstretch, saved ground setting the pace and was ridden out
late to increase her advantage. DANCE FIGHTER stalked the pace while racing two-wide, was unable to reach the winner, but continued on well for the
place. CAMEO SHORES was unhurried early, swung out to come five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. DODROPIN was allowed to settle in
stride early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. MY FUNNY GAL was forwardly placed to near the stretch from along the inside
and tired.

TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY saved ground setting the pressure pace, drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole and maintained his advantage. TOIL AND
TROUBLE never far back, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished strongly for the place. MIXO stalked the pace while racing in tight along the inside,
angled out for room nearing the three-sixteenths, launched his bid, but wasn't quite good enoughj. CANDY ZIP saved ground while being unhurried early,
slipped through during the drive, but was not a serious factor. LEPRINO pressed the pace from along the outside to near the stretch and tired.

WARFRONT FIGHTER forced the pace from along the outside, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT saved
ground stalking the pace, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished well for the place. BUCKLEY BAY sprinted clear early to get to the
inside, then saved ground setting the pressured pace and held on fairly well when headed. MASTER RECOVERY was unhurried early, improved his
position while racing along the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly.. SPARKLING LUTE was prominently placed early while
racing two-wide and weakened during the drive. HARBOR KITTY showed little after breaking a step slow.

UNION BLISS was forwardly placed while racing between horses, forged to the front nearing the three-sixteenths pole and quickly drew clear. BALIUS
unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out three-wide to split rivals nearing the three-sixteenths pole, then angled back to the inside
for the drive and was gaining late. J C EXPRESS allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished well. LUCK IS MY NAME finished
in a mild rally while racing five-wide. STONUS MAXIMUS prompted the pace from along the inside, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths pole to the stretch
in tight, angled out and finished willingly when clear. RADIANT KITTEN raced six-wide on the turn and was not a serious factor. LOOSE BALL dropped back
early, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. SWEETWATER CLYDE gave way after showing brief speed while racing three-wide. BODEEMAN set the
pressure pace for a half mile from along the inside and tired.
