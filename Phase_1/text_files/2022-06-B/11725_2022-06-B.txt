Footnotes
CURLIN'S NEW MOON Tracked along the two path up the backstretch, moved to challenge from between at the top of the lane, kicked clear and under
pressure proved best. LIGHTNING ROB Tracked from between to midway on the last turn, dropped back some at the top of the lane, responded when
asked and finished well. DUCK POND ROAD Tracked three across after a half mile, moved to challenge three across four wide at the top of the lane and
then failed to sustain the bid. ROCKY RIVER Set the pace along the rail to the top of the lane, was collared, battled some and faded.

DROSEL DIEM Tracked along the three path, two path into the turn, challenged at the top of the lane, battled three across leaving the furlong marker and
under pressure outran CAPT' REMINGTON to the line. CAPT' REMINGTON In hand along the rail well placed into the turn, slipped inside into the lane,
reached the leaders a furlong out, battled to the line and finished gamely. GONNA BE DANCING Broke alertly, quickly assumed the lead, set the pace along
the rail, was collared, battled from between leaving the furlong marker and weakened late. MR GHOST Well placed along the three path early, four wide into
the lane and lacked the late needed response. SEATIGER Unhurried along the three path early, took the rail into the turn, angled out and finished evenly.
CASH BAIL Broke sluggishly, two path on the turn, was outrun.
