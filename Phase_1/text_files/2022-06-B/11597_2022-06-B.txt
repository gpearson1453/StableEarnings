then inched away to the finish kept to task. ON PALM SUNDAY just off the inside shortly after the start, tipped out four to five paths to show the way in hand
down the backstretch, tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go before making his way to the inside through the far turn patiently handled until let out

Footnotes
DAWNLAND was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms while dropping from the two path to the rail around the turn,
responded well when shaken up in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. GRIS TORMENTA settled on the inside, moved to the two path while
asked at the three-eighths, chased the winner under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. TACTICAL RANGE was
snatched up briefly with the right-rein when the pacesetter crossed in front early, raced on the outside under urging, chased in the three path through the
turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. ROUGH TOUGH LOVE stumbled at the start and was off a bit slow, settled at the rear under some urging,
started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide while roused for more, continued four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LANDBISCUIT settled comfortably on the outside, moved closer while three then four wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths then roused for
more while making a bid outside the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe into the stretch then dropped to the two path in front of two foes to took the lead at the
three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under a left-handed crop. BRICCO was reserved on the outside, came under urging while
four then five wide around the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the
place. CHESS'S DREAM leaned in at the start then brushed with a foe, was reserved off the pace, pulled his way forward outside the five-eighths, saved
ground on the turn, paused after thinking about slipping through along the rail outside the three-eighths, squeezed through to make an inside bid at the
five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the place while able to get
the show. SIDD FINCH settled towards the rear on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, swung six wide
into upper stretch and improved position. GRECIAN PHAROAH settled near the back, went around the turn in the two path, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GIRL DAD came away in good order, followed the leader while well
placed in second position, ranged up late on the backstretch, made a bid while asked in the three path on the turn, took a slim advantage just inside the
five-sixteenths, brushed with the winner into the stretch then lost the advantage while between foes, dropped back into the final furlong, swapped back to his
inside lead while weakening late and tired. THE BIG GREY broke a half-step slow then was taken up, settled at the rear, saved ground under urging around
the turn and was no factor. NOT YET CHARLIE went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, was challenged in the two path around the
turn, lost the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MARVELOUS MAUDE just off the inside into the first turn, got clipped behind by an eager and restrained INSTINCTIVE, tracked the leader from just off the
pace tipping four paths off the rail down the backstretch before making her way back to the two path into the far turn, came under light coaxing when
advancing on the front five-sixteenths from home, spun three to four wide into upper stretch taking over command straightened away and edged clear under
a drive getting geared down to the finish to prevail comfortably on the line. POP THE BUBBLY three wide through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. OUT OF SIGHT three then two wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, took over brief command spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole, got headed straightened away
and flattened out in the late stages while clear for the show honors. INSTINCTIVE clipped the back of MARVELOUS MAUDE bobbling heavily when pulling
keen into the first turn, raced four wide through that bend and down the backstretch before tucking inside through the far turn, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and offered no response. A BIT O'IRISH SASS three wide into the first turn, spurted away on the pace just off the inside, tucked inside through
the far turn coming under intensified pressure and yielded the front when taking the inside route at the quarter pole, then tired in the stretch. SWEET
FRANNY LU just off the inside through the first turn, raced two to three wide into the backstretch behind the loose cover of CARA'S DREAMER when that
foe took a bad step and hopped and was pulled up directly in front, clipped heels of that rival in front when colliding with her just prior to being severely
checked, and lost about seven to eight lengths of ground to the front before settling back into stride after assessing everything was okay, and was unable to
make an impact while completing the course well behind. CARA'S DREAMER three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide into the
backstretch, took a bad step and appeared to suffer an injury to the right front hopping and being taken in hand under a protective hold quickly, got clipped
behind and bumped by SWEET FRANNY LU when being pulled up directly in front of that rival, then got fully pulled up and was subsequently vanned off.

dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty while able to get the show. MAD MUNNYS bobbled at the start then brushed with a foe, pressed the
pace on the outside of two rivals, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. BRILLIANT BROOKS broke a
half-step slow then was sent hard, raced on the outside under urging, tucked into the three path leaving the backstretch, shifted four wide while roused for

Footnotes
GOODNIGHT OLIVE broke in at the start bumping CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE into EMILIA'S MOON, showed the way in hand briefly four paths off the
inside before tucking to the two path, remained patiently handled through the turn as a rival advanced outside, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
received a pair of taps to the right side and came inwards to the rail while drawing off under her own power to prevail comfortably at the end. BETSY BLUE
chased just off the inside until tucked inside five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. HALO CITY brushed at the start by EMILIA'S MOON due to pressure begun by
GOODNIGHT OLIVE, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route
into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE got bumped at the start by GOODNIGHT OLIVE and in turn
bumped EMILIA'S MOON, prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide
into upper stretch and tired. EMILIA'S MOON got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe due to pressure from GOODNIGHT OLIVE breaking
inwards, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide for home and made no impact. HONEY MONEY forwardly placed
three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and folded.

Footnotes
YES AND YES bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside of the leader, inched closer in the three path around the turn, was given his
cue outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, disposed of PRINCIPLED STAND into the final sixteenth and just held off his
fast closing stablemate under strong urging. BIG PACKAGE was slowest into stride, settled at the rear of the field, went two then three wide around the turn,
gained coming to the quarter-pole, shifted six wide over heels into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss while
clear for the place. PRINCIPLED STAND (GB) displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was
asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, fought on with the winner until inside the furlong marker, dropped back into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN bumped with an opponent at the start, settled off the pace,
traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused late on that bend, chased under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the
show. MR. HUSTLE broke in and bumped with a foe, settled near the back on the outside, went three wide around the turn, was asked late on that bend,
came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. PULSATE was bumped on both sides at the start, settled just off the pace on the outside,
went four wide around the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch and also lacked the needed response. KING OF
DREAMS bumped with a foe at the start, was well placed just of the pace, came under urging while along the rail on the turn, moved to the two path under a
drive in upper stretch and weakened.
