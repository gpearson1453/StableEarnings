PROSPERA was never far back, swung out four-wide to launch her bid nearing the quarter pole, gained command leaving the eighth pole and gradually
drew clear. YES YOUR GRAZE was bumped at the start by Lutes Lil Gift, then vied for the lead from between horses in the stretch and held on gamely for
the place. LUTES LIL GIFT broke in and bumped with Yes Your Graze at the start, then moved up three-wide to dispute the pace into the stretch and
continued on well to the wire in a good effort. MO CONNELLY unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch, reached contention nearing the eighth pole
and then went evenly late. SACAGEWEA saved ground to the stretch, angled out during the drive, but lacked a bid. FOR YOU ONLY sprinted clear early,
angled over to the rail, saved ground setting the pressured pace but tired on the turn.

Footnotes
SLACK TIDE set the pressure pace from between horses, responded when roused to quickly open clear and was ridden out to increase her advantage.
ROPERS N WRANGLERS allowed to settle in stride while racing two-wide, split rivals late and finished fast. UNSOLVED MYSTERY disputed the pace
while racing three-wide and finished willingly for the show. KORON dueled for the lead from along the inside to the stretch, but lacked the needed late
response. MS PARKSIDE stalked the pace from along the outside, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. CIELO DIAMANTE saved
ground throughout but lacked a response when asked. WEGOTTODRINKING failed to threaten while racing three-wide.

COMMAND SGT MAJOR was allowed to settle in stride, launched his bid nearing the quarter pole while racing four-wide and was up in the final sixteenth to
win drawing clear. BOURBONWITHATWIST brushed at the start with Papawasarollnstone, then saved ground setting the pressured pace, was unable to
resist the winner but continued on well for the place. MANCUSO AT THE MIC was in tight between horses from the half mile to the three-eighths pole
waiting for room, angled out to be three-wide when clear and finished fast. PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE broke in to brush with Bourbonwithatwist, then saved
ground while being allowed to settle, angled out during the drive and finished in a mild rally. MARKSMAN ON TARGET saved ground and found his best
stride too late. SHAKELAS DESTINY failed to threaten while racing three-wide. LIVE A GOOD LIFE forced the early pace from along the outside and tired.

EL ALTO HOMBRE saved ground stalking the pace, angled out four-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole, came in slightly approaching the eighth pole,
took the lead inside the sixteenths pole and was all out to prevail. DEFENSE WINS allowed to settle in stretch while saving ground, steadied lacking room
nearing the three-eighths pole, found room entering the stretch, steadied from between horses while in tight, angled in leaving the sixteenths pole and
finished fast when clear to just miss. FOREVER GOLD dueled for the early lead from along the outside, opened clear after three furlongs, but was unable to
resist the top two late. WHEEL RALLY disputed the early pace from along the inside, came out slightly nearing the eighth pole and weakened. STAND TO
was off a step slow, then raced four-wide on the turn and failed to menace. FRANKS FIX IT raced in the middle of the field while between horses, but lacked
a response when asked. The owner-trainer of Defense WIns lodged an objection against the winner, but after viewing the films, the stewards made no
change in the order of finish.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE CHEF was reserved off the early pace, moved closer on the turn, split rivals nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled out four-wide during the
drive, took command nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied three-wide
nearing the stretch and while no match for the winner, finished strongly for the place. MIDNIGHT MOJO was pinched back at the start, then was unhurried
during the early going, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished fast. SMILING GOODBYE dueled for the lead from along the inside into the stretch and
weakened slightly late. LITTLE CASINO was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch but was unable to threaten. SAINT PIEUS was bumped at the
start by A View From Above, then saved ground stalking the pace, angled out for the drive, steadied in traffic nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly
when clear. A VIEW FROM ABOVE broke out to bump Saint Pieus at the start, then disputed the pace from along the outside to the stretch and gave way.
The rider of Midnight Mojo lodged and objection against Itsallabouttheride, but after viewing the films, the steward made no change in the order of finish.
