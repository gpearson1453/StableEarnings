Footnotes
TOO MUCH BOURBON moved up to duel just after the start after breaking in good order, disposed of the other speed by late in the turn, drew clear past
the furlong marker under brisk handling, continued to increase advantage to the wire under continued firm pressure. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT in the second flight
early off the inside, crept a bit closer in the two path late in the turn, proved no match through the stretch, edged clear late for the place. FAZIO broke sharp,
dueled inside the winner up the backstretch and into the turn, fell back late in the bend inside, continued along the inside drive, came back for the show late.
MIDNIGHT BAYOU in the second group outside, three wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing punch, outkicked for the show.
PURE VALOR back off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. JIMMY TWO TIMES broke in the air, trailed throughout to be outrun.

IM A COWBOY TOO closest to the early leader inside, lost some position while continuing to save ground second turn, moved out for the drive, up final
strides while well out in the strip. BINDING AGREEMENT behind the pace, made an early foot move the inside to challenge far turn, took over into lane,
drifted out final furlong, caught late. SMARTY GRIMES sprinted well clear after the start, continued to hold a large advantage up the backstretch, responded
when confronted far turn, dueled, weakened final furlong, saved the show. MUFFIN NUTS lacked early foot, raced three wide most of the way, lacked a
significant closing response. CAVE RUN fell back before a half, saved ground into the straight, also failed to muster a rally when called on. INCA WARRIOR
turned head just as the gate was sprung, dwelt, far back, distanced after soon losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
CUSTOM KAT in the second flight while off the inside, continued in the two path while between rivals turn, chased the winner upper stretch, engaged that
one from the outside with less than a furlong remaining, wore down that rival under firm handling. ARGYBARGY BUCK broke alertly, showed the way up the
backstretch, larger lead turn, responded when the winner came along side with a furlong to run, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, clearly second best.
MY BOOK lacked early foot, moved out, advanced four wide into the lane, closest to the top pair past the furlong marker, no match for those two, clear of
the rest. NOCOMET in mid pack early, in some traffic toward the inside, raced along the rail stretch, continued one paced in lacking a closing punch.
DOCTRINAIRE in the main body, moved closer in the three path midway on the turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. EGEAUXTISM off a
step slow, was four wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally. CLOSING AMERICAN forwardly placed behind the runner up into the turn, in a bit of
traffic when appearing to weaken three furlongs out, continued to give way through the lane and jogged in well back.

STRONG RULES broke on top, showed the way through the first turn under stout restraint, continued to show the way middle half just off the inside,
responded when challenged from along the inside into the lane, displayed good mettle to hold the runner up at bay late. WILSON TO LOCKETT off the pace
early while rank into the first turn, continued to race unruly through that bend, crept closer after a half, remaining inside,challenged inside the winner entering
the stretch, extended drive, could not get by. SUCH forwardly placed off the inside, remained within contact of the leader into and through the final turn,
lacked a winning response in the drive, finished up well clear of the others. ZENUCCI fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag up the backstretch,
improved a bit inside a couple of rivals into the lane, failed to make a serious impact in the run to the wire. LIAM SKYE prompted the winner from the outside
and three wide for five furlongs, gave way. THREE RUN HOMER last to leave, settled off the pace and the inside, tired while four wide turning for home.

Footnotes
THAT YOU MARGARET within striking distance while outside, advanced and took over three wide midway on the turn, clear when straightened for home,
drifted out a bit, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. ABSOLUTELY MINDY took up at the start, raced well back early as a
result, came four wide into the lane, rallied for the place, well clear of the others, not a serious threat to the winner. HEY YOU forwardly placed off the inside,
lost contact with the winner into the lane, proved no match for the runner up, comfortably clear of the others. SADIE'S PORT pressed the issue early in the
two path, weakened. HAIRTRIGGER HEART fell back after the start, raced three wide when trailing turn, failed to threaten in the run up the stretch. COZZY
KISS broke on top, flashed early speed along the inside, was finished by late in the turn. PERFECT PUDDING off a step slow, trailed to be always outrun.
