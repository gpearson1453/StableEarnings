Footnotes
WAITIN' ON A WOMAN broke on top, fell back off the pace well off the inside, dropped to the inside to save ground into the lane, moved back out,
challenged between horses nearing the furlong marker, took command late then held the runner up safe in the final strides. XANTHUS WRATH last to
leave, raced back off the pace, came four wide into the lane, lodged a bid while widest a furlong out, fell back then was coming again late. BERNIE
SPECIAL dueled up front along the inside, shook clear nearing the furlong marker, responded when challenged soon after, gave ground grudgingly to the
top two the final sixteenth. MY LITTLE JUNIOR dueled up front in the two path, continued to vie into the lane, first to blink nearing midstretch. PALANTE fell
back, was finished early in trailing home.

Footnotes
IN THE ARCH away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch while in hand, continued to set the pace through the turn, shook clear when
straightened for home, not threatened to the wire while being kept to pressure. DEBONNAIRE DUDE pressed the issue for a half three wide, chased the
winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. GRACIDA last away, void of speed, rallied into the lane, split foes
nearing midstretch and finished willingly to be clear of the others. LUNAR LIGHT in mid pack off the rail, briskly roused while four wide into the stretch,
lacked a serious closing response in finishing up evenly. WARRIORS GEM settled in the second flight along the inside, came up empty for the drive.
FRIENDOFTHECOURT forced the issue for four furlongs between rivals and outside the winner, gave way in the drive. BROADWAY JONES had little for
the drive while racing outside. OFF SIXES trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
ALL MIKE NO MAE sprinted out to a clear lead past the wire the first time, extended that advantage the middle half through some lively fractions, continued
to hold a large advantage into the lane, enough left despite getting a bit short strided late. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY lacked early foot, began to advance late
backstretch, four wide into the far turn, continued to steadily advance while running out of real estate late. PARALISSFRMANALYSS lacked early foot,
began to move far turn, continued with a mild rally three wide to be also getting to the winner late only to run out of ground. OAK HILL LG settled in the
second flight, went one paced throughout in lacking a significant closing response. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE closest to the winner early, began a steady
retreat after a half. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT remained always back while four wide into the stretch. GENUINE KITTEN four wide in the first turn when off the
pace, was finished after four furlongs, well back.

Footnotes
KING MARVIN broke behind the early leaders, advanced into contention off the inside entering the turn, bid late in the bend, clear nearing the furlong
grounds, slowly expanded that advantage to the wire under steady handling. IDE LIKE HAWAII also in mid pack early, advanced into a forward position
while three to four wide turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one in the run to the wire, held sway for the place. SHADY
MONKEY settled off the pace and the inside, raced three wide and in some traffic into the stretch, up late for the show, not enough for the second spot. K
T'S JILTED GROOM lacked speed, asked along in the three path midway on the turn, came five wide into the lane, improved position down the middle of
the strip while also being outkicked for the place. HOPE FOR CHANGE also back off the issue early, saved ground into and through the first half of the turn,
steered out to be three wide while surrounded into the stretch, continued to improve through traffic. LUCKY BIG DADDY void of speed, swung six wide into
the stretch, passed some tiring rivals while not a threat. BLUE RIDGE RED broke alertly, quickly sprinted well clear, continued to show the way turn, faltered
when headed by the top two entering the stretch. BIG BOSS MAN in mid pack for a half, had little left for the drive. SHOT ON WINDY HILL chased early,
began to weaken before a half. CLEVER PRINCE off a step slow, remained always back.

Footnotes
GOLD MERRITT broke on top, shook clear to set the pace up the backstretch in hand, continued to lead by daylight through the turn and into the lane after
setting some legit fractions, enough left late to last. GRUNT chased the winner up the backstretch and through the turn, fell back off that one entering upper
stretch, coming back to that one late under firm handling, well clear of the others. JANETS JAY JAY unhurried for three furlongs toward the inside, swung
out five wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally down the middle of the strip to annex the show, too late for the top two. SCRAPPY ARTIE void of speed,
steered out to be four wide into the lane, improved position with some belated interest of his own. SHACKLEFORD STRONG in the main group off the
inside, three wide through much of the turn, came four wide for the drive, went flat to the wire. HEZA WAY MAKER in mid pack for a half, also had little the
way of a response for the drive. TRUE DEAL last to leave, moved up to a forward position by midway on the turn while three wide, faltered in the drive. ONE
TOUGH CHARLIE forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady retreat after a quarter toward the inside.

Footnotes
RITHMICALLEA settled off the pace along the inside, moved closer just before a half, lost some position inside of traffic through the middle part of the final
turn, moved out four wide turning for home, outside bid, drew clear under pressure. BOURBON ST TAPPIN last away, lacked speed, two path up the
backstretch, moved out and came three wide and with the winner inside that one into the stretch, challenged between horses past the furlong marker, could
not keep pace with the winner late, second best. M AND M'S CUSTOM broke on top, clear in the first turn, continued to show the way the middle half toward
the inside, was in the two path while still in front entering the stretch, drifted out a bit nearing the furlong marker just before being challenged, could not
contain the top two late, saved the show. GETCHA in mid pack and three wide, continued one paced final turn, lacked a closing response in the drive to
finish up evenly. THE BIG IRISHMAN broke back, trailed early, improved position the final four furlongs without posing a serious threat. WE NEED A FIVE
raced in the second flight for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. F J'S GEM forwardly placed and outside early, steadily faded before a half. HE'S A
LUCKY MAN was finished early and trailed home.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE TAKEOVER broke back, raced unhurried while saving ground, continued inside second bend, brief wait into the stretch, rail bid past the furlong
marker, put a head in front inside the sixteenth pole and dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. COOL INDIVIDUAL raced back off the pace just off
the inside, floated out five wide into the lane, late bid outside, denied to narrowly miss. BAYOU JAM in the second flight off the inside, continued to stalk
three wide into the far turn, challenged late in that bend, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker between the top two, outkicked in the late going,
clear of the others. WISH UPON A STAR off the pace while three wide much of the way, angled out four wide and inside the runner up to float that one out
exiting the final turn,lacked the necessary closing kick to serious contend. BIND FAITH set or forced the pace closest to the inside for six furlongs and began
to weaken. THAT'S D 'CAT dueled up front in the two path, also began to falter into the lane while in some traffic between rivals. DIXIE STAR last away,
trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
DAVE'S RONDA broke back, moved up steadily out of the chute to take control before a quarter, clear into the lane, not threatened to the wire while under a
firm right handed crop. CUPIE CUTIE back off the pace and the inside, roused three wide and in some traffic exiting the turn, rallied through some additional
traffic to bet just up for the place, not a threat to the winner. SHEEZA PRIORITY close up from the start, in the second flight between horses into the turn,
chased the winner through most of the stretch,nipped late for the place. JIG TIME BANDIT forwardly placed outside, came four wide for the drive behind the
winner, lacked a closing kick. SEEMYVALENTINE broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, relinquished the advantage to the winner before a
quarter, began to gradually weaken thereafter. VISIONLADY forwardly placed outside, four wide into the turn, had little for the stretch run. HALOS ALARM
last away, trailed early, made little impact. SUNSET FLASH in mid pack early, was finished after a half. SHEZA SHERIF was also finished early, well back,
jogged in.
