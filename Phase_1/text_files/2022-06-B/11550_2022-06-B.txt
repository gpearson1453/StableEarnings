was well rated two wide early, made a four wide move on the turn to draw clear, then was headed by the sixteenth pole and could not match strides with the
winner to the wire, clearly second best. TUNE MY GUITAR was reserved early, moved to the outside on the turn and was five wide by the quarter pole, had
no late rally, bested rest. MUSADA was five wide into the first turn, set a pressured pace three to two wide and tired the final two furlongs. WAR TRIBUTE

sixteenth pole and edged away late to prove best under a drive. HARDCORE FOLKLORE was rated three to four wide, made a four wide bid nearing the
quarter pole, but hung while getting the nod for the place award. VIM AND VIGOR stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, gained a
short advantage leaving the turn but faded late, lost place award at the wire. MO VODKA set the pace on the inside and was well handled, was headed on
the turn and dug in but weakened in the drive. SCHMOOZE was allowed to settle on the inside and had no response.
