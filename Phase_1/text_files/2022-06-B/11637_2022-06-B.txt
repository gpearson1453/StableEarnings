Footnotes
SABELLE sprinted to a clear lead shortly after the start, set all the pace unchallenged and maintained her advantage under strong handling. MISS ENCISO
chased the winner and held on for second in the six path. RUNONFAITH unhurried early, had a mild rally late in the four path. SOLDAT TEMPTATION
trailed down the backstretch and found her best stride late outside. ALITA was bumped at the half mile pole and stalked the pace in an even effort.
CENTRAL PARKING was also bumped at the half mile pole then faded. JUSTASMALLTOWNGIRL was no factor. TACK WISE close up, failed to respond.
SWAMP WITCH HADDY bore out at the start bumping MY DANCING QUEEN and was outrun. MY DANCING QUEEN was bumped and forced outward at
the start, rushed to contention, veered out over a rivals heels bumping CENTEAL PARKING and forcing that one into ALITA, had speed through the turn
then gave way. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
WOODLAND WALK dueled on the early lead, shook clear in mid stretch, remained clear late under right handed urging. MORE THAN GOOD pressed three
wide throughout, could not gain late on the winner but finished with good courage and held place. KADRI dueled early from the rail, dropped back slightly on
the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished willingly. AHIMELECH tracked four wide, went evenly late. AYE AYE SIR raced mid pack and was no threat.
MIGHTY ANGEL allowed to settle, failed to menace. LAZARUS PROJECT was no factor. OLA QUE TAL trailed. The rider of KADRI claimed foul against
the rider of WOODLAND WALK for alleged interference at the three eight pole. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.

Footnotes
TANTRUM unhurried early while settling four wide, responded readily entering the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch,
drifted to the five path and drew off through the final furlong under brisk handling to win as much the best. SAMMY'S SMILE pressed the pace two wide into
the stretch, drifted to the six path, dug in determinedly and got up for second. MR LOOOCH veered in at the start brushing with RUMBLE STRIP RON, set
the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. SILENCE was forced inward at the start, trailed through the far turn then passed
tiring rivals. COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY vied for the lead three wide, gave way on the second turn and returned bleeding bilaterally. RUMBLE STRIP RON
was brushed and forced inward at the start then failed to menace. GONE IN A FLASH well placed, was through after a half. STUNT MAN raced under
strong restraint along the inside for six furlongs then flattened out.

Footnotes
MOBIL SOLUTION was bounced around between horses at the start, settled along the inside, split horses two wide midway on the second turn, dropped
back inside, got through to make the lead and proved best in a stiff drive under left handed urging. RELISH THE RIDE tracked the leaders two wide into the
far turn, loomed boldly three wide entering the stretch, drew on near even terms for the lead inside the furlong marker but was denied. BIG TRUCK never far
back, finished determinedly in the five path. MANGA MAN trailed for nearly six furlongs then closed a gap late in the six path. FIRST SONG made the lead
entering the clubhouse turn, set a pressured pace along the inside for six furlongs, drifted to the four path then weakened late. AUTHENTIC COWTOWN
bore in at the start bumping the winner, was hung five wide into the first turn then failed to menace. OHIO EAGLE close up for a half, dropped back to trailed
on the far turn then came on again late. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE bore out bumping the winner at the start, settled widest then lacked the needed response.
PAT'S KARMA stalked the pace along the rail into the stretch then gave way. JIMTOWN was no threat. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE pressed the pace two wide
for five and one half furlongs then flattened out. AUNT BEE close up, was through after six furlongs.

Footnotes
ARMY WIFE was bounced around between horses at the start, forced inward, prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, gained the advantage, dug
gamely under right handed urging and proved best. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL also bumped and forced inward at the start, was forwardly place three wide,
loomed boldly entering the stretch and finished second best. SHE'S PURE SILVER never far back, finished with good courage two wide. MICROCAP with
the second flight while saving ground, went evenly. MALICED sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside for six and one
half furlongs, kept pressure into the stretch then weakened late. TAKE CHARGE LORIN was bumped then shut off at the start, within striking distance for
six furlongs then gave way. JLO CAN DANCE bore in badly at the start causing a chain reaction of bumping to her inside then was through after a half.
MARACUJA unhurried while within striking distance, angled out entering the far turn, passed a rival then suffered and injury to her left front left in deep
stretch, was eased to the wire and vanned off.

Footnotes
TAWNY PORT settled in the four path, advanced steadily through the far turn three wide, drifted to the eight path while making the lead and put to a left
handed whip in upper stretch, was righted and won under a strong hand ride. WHITE ABARRIO settled in the four path early, loomed boldly between horses
two wide on the far turn then was no match for the winner. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY pressed the pace two wide for a nearly a half, made the lead, edged clear
on the far turn, battled into the stretch then was outfinished in the late stages. BARESE close up along the inside, shifted out to the four path on the far turn,
improved position then finished evenly. DROPPIN G'S within range, moved closer at the top of the stretch then leveled off. ETHEREAL ROAD settled five
wide and failed to menace. PINEAPPLE MAN made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace for nearly a half, kept pressure into the stretch then
gave way readily.
