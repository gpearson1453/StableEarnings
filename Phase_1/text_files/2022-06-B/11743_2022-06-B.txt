Footnotes
KLAYTON'S KANDY was well alertly and set the early pace while crossing over towards the inside, was well handled throughout, gave up the rail leaving
the far turn, but responded well when challenged leaving the furlong marker to kick clear the final sixteenth to prove best under left handed crop urging.
MALDIVES MODEL tracked the paced three wide, then angled in on the far turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn to challenge the winner by the furlong
marker, but was outkicked the final sixteenth, second best. MUCHA MEZQUINA prompted the pace three wide and faded in the drive, bested rest.
MINDING MILLIE was settled back early, made a four wide run on the far turn but finished evenly late. WITCH was in tight and checked into the first turn,
tracked the pace from between horses on the backstretch and weakened. KILIMANJARA tracked the pace on the inside and tired. ANNA ROCKS dropped
back.

Footnotes
KNOCKDOWN KID pressed the pace and made a three wide3 bid on the turn, shook clear by the furlong marker and then remained safe late to prove best
under a drive. KINGDA KA chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to loom boldly but hung in the final furlong, saved place. THIS I
KNOW was off slowly, then chased the pace on the inside on the turn, shifted off the inside and came three wide into the lane, then finished willingly late on
the inside to just miss the place award and gaining on the winner. AWESOME WOLF set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened in the drive.
COMPACT chased the pace from between horses, came three to four wide into the drive and had no rally. STRUCTURAL DAMAGE was bumped at the
start and failed to menace. JEKYLL ISLAND was slammed sideways at the start, not a factor.

Footnotes
LA LENA was away alertly and soon to clear to set the pace while racing removed from the rail, drew out on the turn, then drew off in the lane to prove much
the best while being ridden out. FAIRY DREAMS was allowed to settle early, advanced five wide on the turn and finished willingly while no match to the
winner, clearly second best. FRED'S SHEILA chased the winner on the inside and weakened, saved show award. SOCIAL EXCLUSION bobbled at the
start, settled early and was two to three wide on the turn and weakened. NINJA PRINCESS failed to menace. PANDORAS CHARM chased the pace four
wide and stopped.
