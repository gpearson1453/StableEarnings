Footnotes
RESILIENT COURAGE prompted the pace on the outside, dropped a bit behind the leader with a half-mile to run, was asked in the two path around the far
turn, gained under a drive to make a bid in upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and got up late under strong urging. KARMA'S
WARRIOR came away in good order and went to the front, showed the way on the inside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked on the far turn,
responded well when put to a drive in upper stretch, dug in gamely under threat from the winner in the final furlong but was denied while clear for the place.
MEDIA SENSATION bumped with a rival after the start then was taken in hand, raced towards the back under reserve, was roused three wide on the far
turn then driven four wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. PIVOTAL RUN was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the two
path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. SLOW DECISION bumped with an opponent
after the start, settled comfortably on the outside, was asked in the four path around the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch then made an outside bid at
the three-sixteenths, fought outside the top two into the final furlong then was unable to sustain his run and weakened. CHAPEL ROAD was rated on the
outside while tugging keenly at the bit with an open mouth, came under urging near the half-mile pole, chased three wide around the turn, made a brief bid
in upper stretch then tired. TIZ SNOW bumped with a foe early then was taken under a tight hold, raced in the back half of the field under restraint, was let
out in the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response. SARATOGA SKY was reserved at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn
and was no factor. WHISKY WARRIOR was reserved near the back on the outside, came under urging on the backstretch, went three wide around the turn
and failed to respond. TRIPLE BROWN bumped with a rival early then became rank while taken under stout restraint, continued rank along the rail early on
the backstretch then was rated on the inside, came up empty on the far turn and dropped out. BOOK OF DELANCEY was brushed while hustled from the
gate then taken under a tight hold, raced under reserve off the pace, moved from three to four wide around the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
ALITE three to four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong latching on the leader near the sixteenth marker before
taking command seventy yards from home, dug in and prevailed on the wire. FAZARO three to four wide in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch,
advanced tucked to the two path into the turn to knock heads with that rival coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and taking over command just inside
that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared seventy yards from
home, fought on to the finish clear for the place honors. PRINCE OF FENTON chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
three wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. PAPI ON ICE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a left handed crop drifting out and was one paced
through to the finish. CUGINE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. ANY MINUTE showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go and came under increasing pressure
through the turn yielded the front just inside the three-eighths pole, chased coaxed along through the latter portion of the turn and took the inside route into
upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MONTAUK DADDY moved in while going to the front, showed the way in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked for his best into upper
stretch, came out some and tightened up a gap between foes near the eighth-pole, drifted out slightly in the final furlong and just held under strong urging.
STAGE LEFT was eased back early then rated off the pace, saved ground around the turn, moved to the two path while espying a seam between foes at
the three-sixteenths, checked when the hole closed due to a slight drift from the winner at the eighth-pole, altered course to the inside before the
sixteenth-pole, regained momentum late then gained fast coming to the wire but just missed. NOVA RAGS bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe,
chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, made a bid in upper stretch, was bumped in the hindquarters near the eighth-pole,
kept on to get on even terms for the lead in the final furlong but just missed while able to get the show. FITZPATRICK stalked the pace on the outside, was
asked four wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. DISCO PHAROAH
bumped with a rival at the start, settled under some urging, raced in two path under restraint while behind NOVA RAGS on the turn, was asked between
foes at the five-sixteenths, steadied off heels outside the quarter-pole, shifted five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner on the outside in the final furlong
and finished with good courage but missed the superfecta. HE'S IN CHARGE was last to commence then settled at the rear under some urging, dropped
back while ridden along in the two path around the turn, moved out into the final furlong and finished fast but reached his best stride too late. FOLLOWING
THE RACE, THE RIDER OF STAGE LEFT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST MONTAUK DADDY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH-POLE AND
THE STEWARDS' POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
DAKOTA GOLD broke out at the start bumping ONE TIME WILLARD into MARINARA SAUCED, tracked the leader in closest aim from the two path coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning from the two path into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in
gamely tussling head to head with the runner up before shaking away from the duel with that rival in the final jumps to the finish. SURPRISE BOSS coaxed
from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under light coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and
was confronted straightened away, dug in under threat getting headed for command a furlong out, fought on gamely inside to the wire getting shaken off in
the last strides while along clear of the rest and second best. MARINARA SAUCED got bumped at the start by ONE TIME WILLARD breaking outwards and
then once more by that foe this time due to pressure from DAKOTA GOLD breaking outwards and was briefly pushed behind BARREL OF QUESTS,
chased two to three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure
the show honors. ONE TIME WILLARD broke out at the start bumping MARINARA SAUCED then got bumped by DAKOTA GOLD back into MARINARA
SAUCED, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under motivation with three-eighths remaining,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. BUCKORTWO coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride
from the five-sixteenths and weakened in the stretch. BARREL OF QUESTS three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
spun three wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
PRINCESS PINKY bumped with a rival at the start, was rated towards the front on the outside, ranged up three wide on the far turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, took the lead while set down in upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and just held under strong urging. KEMBA stumbled at the
start, remained out five wide through the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, went three wide on the final turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths,
shifted four wide at the quarter-pole then quickly tipped six wide coming to the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to just
miss while up for the place. NOBLE ENTERPRISE went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, traveled four wide around the far turn, was
roused late on that bend, rallied into the final furlong and finished well for the show. ROSEMARY POTATOES bumped with rivals on both sides at the start,
recovered well to go to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole then headed in upper stretch, fought on under a drive in the
final furlong and was outfinished. SYNONYMOUS broke out and bumped with an opponent, was unhurried near the back, raced five wide around the far
turn, was roused late on that bend, came seven wide into upper stretch and improved position. MASABEEH brushed with a foe at the start then was hustled,
dropped off the pace on the inside then was reserved in the middle of the field, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused three wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed kick. RAINING CANDY stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two path late on the far turn, chased under a drive
into upper stretch and tired. CLARA BELLE bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled, dropped towards the rear, saved ground around the final turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the needed response. CLASSIC VINMAN moved in around the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the
inside, saved ground through the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. MISS INVINCIBLE stumbled badly at the start then
bumped with a foe, was reserved at the rear on the far outside under tight restraint, went four wide while let out on the far turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
CHULAINN went three wide around the first turn, was reserved on the outside, traveled three then four wide around the far turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final stride. RUSE smashed open his
stall door prior to the start but remained in the gate, came away in good order, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, moved up
with six furlongs to run then prompted the pace, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead while asked at the quarter-pole, came under a drive in
upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong, led to the final stride but was denied while just able to get the place. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS bumped hard
with a rival at the start, settled on the inside, swung four wide while roused at the quarter-pole then tipped to the five path, rallied inside of the winner in the
final furlong and closed well to just miss while narrowly able to get the show. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR angled in early, raced three wide around the
opening bend, settled on the outside, traveled three wide around the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied inside of foes in the final furlong
and also closed well but just missed. BAR FOURTEEN established forward position early, navigated the first turn in the three path, contested the pace on
the outside of a foe then inside of an opponent starting just before the three-quarter pole, vied inside around the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole
then lost the lead to the runner-up into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished. QUIET OUT EAST bumped with a rival at the
start then was checked while pinched back, went around both turns in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch then tipped out to the seven path and
improved position. UNCLE CURLY contested the early pace on the inside, was eased back off the pace with six furlongs to run, saved ground through the
far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. SARATOGA FLASH was taken in hand early then rated in the two path, came three
wide into the stretch then was asked for his best and lacked the needed response. JADE'S DREAM was bumped on both sides at the start then checked
while squeezed back, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground around the far turn and was no factor. K P ALL SYSTEMS
GO went three to four wide on the turns and failed to threaten.

leader a furlong from home, dug in under a drive and was ultimately repelled to the wire. MAGNIFICENT CHROME stumbled awkward at the start, raced
briefly just off the inside off heels before tipping to the five path down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on to procure the show honors. MONEY IN THE BANK broke out at the start, chased just off
the inside until tucked inside through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch under urging, offered up a mild bid, then weakened in the late stages.
STRIKING SPEED coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along in the two path, tucked inside through the turn coming under intensified
pressure, spun just off the inside for home and was roused straightened away, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened to the finish.
ABSENTEE coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened.
WARRIOR IN CHIEF coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, went three

Footnotes
DREAM CENTRAL was a bit slow into stride, moved up with five furlongs to run, saved ground around the turn, was roused while cutting the corner into the
stretch, moved off the rail while rallying into the final furlong, bumped multiple times with the runner-up while making a bid between horses and got up under
strong handling. ROBYN AND ELI bumped with a rival at the start then was slow into stride, spotted the front a few lengths, moved in while reserved off the
pace, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid before
the furlong marker, bumped multiples with the winner while battling outside in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole, gained a short lead late but was denied while
able to hold the place. ROYAL DANCER was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear at
the quarter-pole, shied in some in upper stretch, remained clear into the final furlong, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught but was clear
for the show in a good effort. HOWDYOUMAKEURMONEY settled off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path,
swung five wide into upper stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed kick. SHIGEKO was
taken under a vigorous hold early then anchored towards the rear, remained in hand while in the two path for most of the turn then dropped to the rail, was
asked near the quarter-pole, moved out into the final furlong and improved position. SILKEN DOLLAR bumped with foes on both sides at the start, settled
on the outside, was urged four wide around the turn and lacked the needed response. MORNING MATCHA broke in at the start, settled towards the rear,
went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GALAXINA was well placed down the backstretch, came under urging in
the two path on the turn, chased three wide into the stretch under the crop and tired. SHINFULL bumped with foes on both sides at the start, prompted the
pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. LIBERTY
FLAME brushed with a foe after the start, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back three then four wide around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch
and had nothing left. HALF BIRTHDAY bumped with an opponent after the start, settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
Following an eight minute delay due to a pair of gate scratches and an injury to an assistant starter, RELATE coaxed from the gate, raced three then two
wide in aim of the leader coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and taking command at that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged
clear under a drive to prevail. MARTINEZ chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive rallying willingly to be along clear of the rest and second best. BRENNAN'S WAR chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MOON HUNTER five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. JOSHUA broke a half a beat slow, chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. STEERAGE hustled from the gate, showed the way in
hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole under pressure to the outside, yielded the front taking the inside route into upper stretch
and weakened to the finish. UNLIKELY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch, tired.
SECRET SANCTUARY chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch and tired. MUCHO MACHO COMET broke a half a beat slow and was brushed by UNLIKELY who broke outwards a step, came under
some taps to the off side when sluggish early growing quickly detached from the main body of the field, suddenly hurdled an invisible fence nearing the half
mile pole nearly tossing the rider from the saddle to the left side when landing roughly, completed the course under his own power, the rider out of the irons
the rest of the way while eased home to the finish in an adventurous nightcap.
