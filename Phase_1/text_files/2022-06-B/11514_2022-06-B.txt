Footnotes
SOME DUDE broke alertly, was taken in hand, gradually advanced on the leader from outside on the backstretch to gain the advantage on the second turn,
was roused with two furlongs to go, continued to open up on the others with mild urging and was allowed to coast the final sixteenth. TAIGA HONEY
hesitated at the start then threw his head a bit after leaving the gate, was sent to gain the lead on the first bend, challenged from outside with a half mile left,
lost the lead on the second turn, was no match for AWINBENEATHMYWINGS when set down for the drive, began to wear down deep stretch but lasted for
the place. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS unhurried early, was encouraged from well off the inside on the backstretch, began to close on the top pair after a half
mile, came widest into the stretch and was getting to the tiring TAIGA HONEY late.

Footnotes
HE'S A FINE MAN broke a bit inward, soon had the advantage in hand from outside, drew clear when allowed on the turn, was put to a drive in the lane,
drifted out under left-handed urging just inside the final sixteenth, was corrected when switched to right-handed pressure and prove easily best of the others.
TEARS ON A RIVER broke on top then was caught in crowding in the early going, waited for room behind rivals on the backstretch, gained a clear path two
wide between rivals on the bend, took over second then swiftly pulled away for the place upper stretch. HIDE AND RUN AWAY was also caught in crowding
shortly after the break, pressed the pace two wide between horses on the backstretch, did not keep up into the turn, angled out some, bore out badly leaving
the bend and did not recover. LAYTON THE DAY was prominent along the rail early but gave way on the bend. GALLI ATTACK squeezed between horses
shortly after the start, was in tight just outside TEARS ON A RIVER the first furlong, angled out after that and was forwardly placed into the turn but fell
shortly after leaving the three furlong marker then got up and trotted back to the barn area . There was a stewards' inquiry into GALLI ATTACK'S fall but no
action taken after their review.

Footnotes
WITCHING shared the lead outside horses from the beginning, angled in some nearing the end of four furlongs, battled on even terms outside QUEEN
EKATI through the lane and got the nod at the wire. QUEEN EKATI vied for the lead between rivals, was in tight quarters early in the bend, moved to the rail
when that lane opened nearing the end of four furlongs, was all out dueling on the front end through the stretch, narrowly outfinished but easily second best.
BEING CREATIVE prominent just off the rail, swung out widest on the turn, gained third upper stretch then could only maintain her position late. CAIRO
SUMMER displayed early speed from inside but began to fade after three furlongs.

best of the others. COPPER CROSSING broke outward, bumping YABA DABA DOO, was forwardly placed between horses, three wide taking the turn,
floated out slightly nearing the furlong marker then pulled away for third inside the last eighth. BAM BAM CAM moved to the outside of YABA DABA DOO

FRONTANA in contention early between rivals, advanced three wide on the bend, gained the advantage inside the last eighth, gradually drifted out under
left-handed pressure the final seventy yards but held on. COMFORT ME NOW forwardly placed from inside, found himself boxed in on the turn, gained a
clear path at the head of the lane, closed well deep stretch but was too late. R H SMOAKEM soon had a clear lead, saved ground on the bend, floated out
some entering the stretch and gradually wore down between rivals. HELLOFAGUY bumped at the start, chased from outside, was two wide on the turn,
steadied behind traffic with two furlongs left, altered out widest for the stretch run then could only make up minor ground. DR. LIECHTY bumped
HELLOFAGUY at the break, gradually angled in to prompt the pace from just outside, began to retreat two wide after four furlongs, floated out some
entering the lane and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY rated just off the inside, went for the lead from outside on the turn, angled in beside HIDENSEEK SALLY nearing the quarter pole, edged
ahead of that one upper stretch, was under a steady drive the last sixteenth and held on. HIDENSEEK SALLY soon had the advantage from inside while in
hand, was challenged on the turn, lost the lead upper stretch, never relented, lacked the extra needed but was easily second best. GHAALEB'S APPEAL
trailed from well off the inside on the backstretch, picked up her pace after two furlongs, reached contention along the rail on the bend, proved unresponsive
to urging in the lane and was allowed to coast in the late going. APOLLO U ANYWHERE pressed HIDENSEEK from just outside for two furlong then gave
way from between horses on the turn, was also unresponsive to urging upper stretch and coasted the last furlong.

Footnotes
MINI DRESS stalked the early speed in hand from outside, went for the lead three wide on the turn, took the advantage into the lane then steadily drew
away with mild urging. ABBMAR vied for the lead outside RENDLAKE, was no match for MINI DRESS when set down for the drive but pulled away for the
place inside the last furlong. RENDLAKE broke on top, was soon challenged from outside, also no match for MINI DREWW in the lane and flattened out
inside the final eighth. MAJESTIC RAJ chased from inside, angled out some upper stretch and was closing in on the tiring RENDLAKE in the late going.
APPLE VALLEY chased from outside and was empty for the stretch run.
