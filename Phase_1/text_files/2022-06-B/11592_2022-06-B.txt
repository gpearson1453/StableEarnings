chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the three path, bid into the lane while three wide, gained the lead when straightening into the lane, was
caught before the eighth pole, was no match for the top one but stayed on to best of the rest. SEIVER was in the two or three path through the turn when in
mid-pack, came into the lane from the two path and was never a serious threat while saving the super place. DIAMOND SURPRISE was unhurried while off
the inside, steadied entering the far turn when lacking running room, moved from the three to the four path in late turn and and moved up while not a threat.

Footnotes
BRUSTER JUSTICE a bit awkward on the start, rushed up to press the pacesetter into the turn, continued to press into the lane, asked for more and quickly
gained the lead and drew off. HECTORS TROJANWIFE chased the pace from the four to the three path through the turn, continued in the four path through
the lane and could only chase the winner home while settling for second best. SIR RONALDO tracked the pacesetters through the turn while saving ground,
shifted into the three path after entering the lane then stayed while finishing clear for the show spot. CONQUERED set the pace under pressure into the
lane, moved closer to the inside then gave way. JENNY'S BEIGNET was brushed at the start, raced in the two path into the turn, bothered nearing the
five-sixteenths pole when rival stepped in then was never a serious factor. MACHO JUSTICE broke inward and was shut off at the start, raced along the
inside through the turn and into the lane and never was a threat. LITTLE RUSTY never a factor while in the three or four path through the turn. GENERAL
AFFAIR never a menace while in the two or three path. FRANK 'N BOOTS stepped in at the start and brushed rival, raced in the two path through the turn
and never was in it. JUSTICEONEMORETIME saved ground through mid-turn, was taken up when rival came in and dropped back. A STEWARDS
INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE TURN DID NOT RESULT IN CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
BITTY BOSS was unhurried while saving ground through the turn, got through along the rail into the lane, gained momentum quickly to catch the leader
outside the sixteenth pole then drew off. STELLA TERESA set the pace from the outset while along the inside, cleared into the lane while moving to the two
path, was caught by the winner inside the eighth pole, no match for that one while clear for the place spot. TROUBLE MAKING raced in mid-pack while in
the two path, swung into the lane from the four path and finished with some energy to moved up for the minor share. BALL GOWN unhurried while in the
two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path, angled into the two or three path and gained belatedly. MAPLELINE was four wide
through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path and lost ground through the lane while ending up in the seven path. PEACH
COBBLER raced in the three path through the turn when unhurried, came into the lane from the five path and improved position while not a threat.
VIGILANTIA chased the pace along the inside through the turn, came off the inside into the lane, had aim on the top ones with an eighth to go then
flattened. MRS. K never a factor while along the inside. GABERDINE was three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and tired. PLAN
OF THE DAY raced in the four path through the turn when well back, was in the eight path in the lane when straightened and made no impact. ADMIRAL'S
GARNET was bumped about and jostled early, raced in the three path through the turn and never was in it. LADY DEMAREE pressed the pace two wide
through the turn then was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
BREAKUP WITH TITOS chased the two rival duel through mid-turn, continued with good energy into the lane while in the four path, gained momentum
inside the eighth pole, caught the leader approaching the sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. BOTOX KATIE was well back while in the four or five path
through the turn, came into the lane from the six path with momentum, shifted in through upper stretch and closed with conviction. SHOTGUN KATIE vied
for the lead two wide through mid-turn, shook clear into late turn, widened to the eighth pole, continued with a diminishing lead outside the sixteenth pole
then was no match for the top two late. MYGALJUSTICE raced in the four path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path
and finished evenly. LOVE DRUNK was in the four path through the turn and into the lane and showed energy too late. LANTANA JUSTICE was in the two
or three path through the turn and lacked a closing bid. LILMISS SASSYPANTS chased the pace along the inside through mid-turn then weakened and was
bothered near the eighth pole. SHINY SHOES was rank at the start, broke with her head being thrown left and right, settled to trail the field by at least five
lengths, raced in the three path and never was a menace. PALOMA'S PASS was in the three path through the turn and steadily lost ground.
ADDEMUPJUSTICE stumbled badly at the start, settled to near the back and made no impact. ERINS LITTLE MAE set the early pace while under pressure
to mid-turn and was done.

Footnotes
CLIMBER was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while three wide, bid on the far turn to be clear in the stretch and drew off under mild urging. LOUDER
THAN WORDS was bumped on both sides at the start, stalked the pace between rivals, bid four wide on the far turn but proved no match. HOLY JUSTICE
broke inward, bumping a rival, pressed the pace between foes, then couldn't last. SPEEDY DELIVERY led inside before giving way in the stretch.
EVERYTHING'S ROSY broke outward bumping a rival, stalked the pace between rivals, lacked room going down the backstretch, then had no closing bid.
GIO'S BABY GIRL saved ground to no avail. SPLASH OF TONIC passed tired foes. SKYS IMAGE was bumped at the start, then was no factor. NO TRUST
was not a factor. ACUTELY faded.

Footnotes
MOWINS pressed the pace along the inside through the turn, cut the corner and gained momentum into the lane, gained the lead just inside the eighth pole
and drew away. MR CHAOS was in the five to the four path through the turns, bid into the lane from the four path, got nearest the winner inside the eighth
pole and had to settle for being second best. LATIGO was in the three path through the turns while between rivals, came into the lane from the three path
and was up for the show spot. BELLA'S PRAYER chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn and into the lane and was not a threat after
straightening in the lane. KNIGHT'S MOVE was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn then moved up while not a menace. TOO BAD
JUSTICE stalked the pace from the four path through the turn then faded after turning into the lane. PICKLE FEET was in the three path through the turns
and never was a factor. TOUR THE MOON never was a factor while in the two paths through the turns. FIRING RANGE chased the pace while along the
inside and was empty into the lane. ORO AZTECA set the pace from the two path while under pressure from the winner along the inside then retreated
through the lane. BOULDER BAY was outrun while in the two or three path through the turns. WISHY WASHY raced for a half near the inside then was
pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
KATIECAN'TKEEPUP stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, dueled outside of a foe, then prevailed late under mild urging. TIME TO
CONFESS dueled inside, went clear briefly just past the quarter pole, dueled inside and yielded late. FARM SAFETY stalked the pace inside, then improved
position late, while no threat. CABIN ABBY dueled outside of the leader to the quarter pole before giving way. LIZ SAYS LIZARD stalked the pace between
foes, then faded in the stretch. MAYBE PRIZE was not factor. JAZZY'S REBELLION stumbled to her knees at the start, losing all chance.
