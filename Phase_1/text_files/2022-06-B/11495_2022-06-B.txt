Footnotes
EARNEST was away a half step slowly, advanced on the first turn to take over pace duties into the backstretch run, extended the lead along the second turn
and drew away in the final stages. GOING AWAY PARTY broke alertly, ceded the early lead to EARNEST and prompted that foe through the backstretch
run, could not match strides along the second turn and into the drive, but stayed on to hold for second. SIERRA MELODY settled three wide off of the early
pace, maintained position through the backstretch run while outside of rivals, was set down for the drive and was outkicked while just missing for second.
ORCZY (IRE) was unhurried early on, saved ground into the second turn and did not mount a late rally.

PIVOTAL FEVER broke alertly and was sent to the front, set solid fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, extended the lead on the far turn,
drew clear in midstretch and was guided under the wire while in hand. DR. HOFFMAN came three wide while tracking the early pace on the first turn,
steadily gained along the backstretch run and into the far turn, ran evenly to the stretch while saving ground and was outkicked in the final sixteenth but was
best of the rest. PERSEVERANCE stumbled at the start, recovered to be close the to pace along the first turn, stalked the solid pace to the second turn, lost
ground to the winner nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in the drive and weakened in the final stages, while well clear of the rest for third. LOVER BOY
TOM was unhurried into the first turn, saved ground to the second turn and was not a factor. WOLF MOON WILSON settled just off of the early pace, came

DANGEROUS ILLUSION was up close to the early pace, came three wide into the backstretch run, took back off of the pace approaching the second turn,
advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, confronted and overtook BALL LASS in midstretch and held safely under steady urging to prevail. ALISO
BEACH settled just off of the early pace and came four wide on the first turn, stayed outside of rivals on the backstretch run while improving position,
advanced four wide on the second turn, ran evenly to upper stretch and made a good late rally to be second best. MOONSHINE CAT stumbled at the start
and was off a bit slowly, stalked the early pace on the first turn, lost ground along the backstretch run, ran evenly to upper stretch and made a mild late gain
in the drive to secure the show. REMEMBER SUE showed early speed, ceded the lead to BALL LASS along the backstretch run, lost ground in upper
stretch and finished evenly in the end. BALL LASS tracked the pace on the first turn while outside of rivals, took command along the backstretch run, was
chased into the stretch run by the winner, was confronted by DANGEROUS ILLUSION nearing the eighth pole and gave way in the drive. KITTYBE QUICK
was unhurried while not far back in the early stages, lost ground on the backstretch run and into the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DOGE OF VENICE was sent along leaving the break and showed early speed to the turn while keeping close attendance on PIPER'S CAUSEWAY,
confronted that rival in upper stretch, dueled through the final furlong and determinedly prevailed. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY broke alertly and showed the way
to the turn, was prompted by the winner into the stretch run, was confronted by DOGE OF VENICE in upper stretch, gamely dueled through the final furlong
and was bested in the last strides, while well clear of the rest. MY MAN BIGGIE was hustled leaving the start, chased the pace from a two wide path on the
turn, was no match for the top pair in the drive but stayed on to pass tiring rivals and secured third in the end. GOOD DANNY chased the pace from a three
then four wide path on the turn and lacked a late rally, while just missing for third. KNOCKOUT GUY was up close to the pace to the turn, was shuffled back
and lost position midway through the turn, advanced in upper stretch, steadied behind a weakening rival in the final sixteenth and did not threaten in the final
stages. SMOKEM O'NEIL showed early speed and was prominent into the turn, came three wide while tracking the pace and up close approaching the
quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the late going. IGO bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, trailed through the turn,
swung widest into the drive and was not a factor. VICTORY GIG chased from midpack through the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the final
furlong.

EMPIRE HOUSE stalked the pace to the turn, confronted LAGATHA approaching the quarter marker, overtook that foe in upper stretch and drove clear in
the final stages. NEVER FOR MONEY traded bumps with IDA CLAIRE leaving the break, raced just off of the pace to the turn, advanced three wide
approaching the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch but stayed on to be best of the rest. IDA CLAIRE exchanged bumps with NEVER FOR
MONEY leaving the start, was in tight a bit entering the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, was outfinished in the drive and just held for third over an
oncoming rival. DRAW ME chased the pace from the inside, swung widest into the drive, did not mount a late rally while running on the left lead but just
missed for third. LAGATHA was sent to the early lead, drifted out a bit entering the turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the quarter marker, was
overtaken by that rival in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. DO YOU HEAR THAT chased the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter
marker, was outrun in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
ENGEE OMBEE contested the early pace with SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE then took back off of that speed and tracked the pace from an inside position,
advanced in upper stretch, shook free of the pacesetter in deep stretch and determinedly dug in in the final stages to prevail. CIRCLE OF ROYALTY was
forwardly placed to the turn, tracked the pace while two wide between rivals, mounted a three wide rally into the stretch run and could not reel in the
determined winner in the final stages but was best of the rest. SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE disputed the early pace with ENGEE OMBEE then took a clear lead
into the turn, remained clear to the quarter marker, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong grounds and could not hold off that bid and was
outfinished in the late going, while just saving third. RUNAWAY PRINCESS chased the pace from a four wide path, ran evenly to the stretch run, was
outkicked in the drive and just missed for the show. COUSIN NIECEY was crowded a bit at the start and was away slowly, improved position entering the
turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and could not muster a late rally. APPLAUD THE BENCH chased the pace, came three wide between rivals on the turn,
lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. JEANIE'S SWAN lacked early speed, improved position on the turn but was not a threat in the
drive. STORMY SIERRA chased the pace outside of rivals, came widest into the drive and weakened in the stretch run. ZEPHYR CAT lacked early speed
and was a bit rank into the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and was not a factor.
