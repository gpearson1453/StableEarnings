Footnotes
FRERET broke sharp to take command early, gave up the lead at the five eighths pole to stalk outside of the pace, made a rebid at the quarter pole to get
the lead and opened up through mid stretch and held on well late. PACENZA near the back early on, was roused three wide on the turn, angled out widest
through the stretch to close determinedly to be a clear second. MUMBLEBEE loomed three wide entering the stretch and finished evenly down the lane to
hold for a dead heat for third. CARLA'S HONOR settled near the rear early on, roused outside on the turn and finished well outside of horses to dead heat
for third money. I AM I SAID broke inward on the break, stalked mid pack on the rail through the turn, and rallied mildly entering the stretch between horses
and evened out late. FLAWLESS PINK had to be steadied slightly leaving the chute and trailed, angled out widest through the lane and showed some
interest late passing tiring horses. STUNNING RIVERS took an inside mid pack stalking position early, was asked on the turn and offered little through the
stretch. THE GREEN PLANET broke a bit slow, was keen leaving the chute, chased the pacesetters three wide through the turn to loom into contention at
the quarter pole and stalled down the lane. TAPITURE WAY broke well and assumed the lead inside at the five eighths pole, was headed by the winner at
the quarter pole and stopped badly the final eighth.

Footnotes
RON'S GIZMO rated behind the pace, waited on the turn to angle out in the three path to split horses at the three sixteenth pole and wore down his rival in
deep stretch. MASTER SPY pressed the lead throughout while just outside, gained command at the eighth pole and was just collared by the winner before
the wire. WENTRU stalked the pacesetters while three wide, asked at the quarter pole, could not quicken with the top two finishers but finished well to get
third. FOUR ACES HIGH set the fractions early on the rail, lost the lead at the quarter pole and faded in the final sixteenth for a minor share. PRICELESS
WILL trailed early on, angled out widest through the stretch and ran evenly down the lane. POUND GREEN saved ground through the turn but never was in
contention throughout. FARAT rated near the back and had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
SILVER SMOKE set the pace inside shadowed by a rival, kicked clear into upper stretch and was kept to the task. WAR STRATEGY bobbled just very
slightly at the start and recovered quickly to press the eventual winner two to three wide, was no match but fought on to hold off challengers to secure the
place. RAISE A PROFIT tucked in behind tracking along the inside, saved ground on the far turn as well, ranged up inside WAR STRATEGY but was
outfinished by that one for the place. DIXIE BOUND settled off the leaders, advanced inside foes heading to the far turn, angled out leaving that bend to be
five wide at the top of the stretch and gained late. SILENT FAREWELL bumped lightly at the break, stalked the leading pair outside a foe two to three wide,
had no extra for the drive. MORE THAN HAPPY was ridden along soon after the break to get position mid-pack and shift in, asked for more run two wide
late up the backstretch, came out four wide past the quarter pole, failed to rally. BRUTALITY exchanged a light bump at the break, was unhurried while
shifting in but racing off the rail, failed to rally. OPEECHEE raced three wide between rivals early, eased back and switched out heading into the far turn,
moved out further to be six wide coming into upper stretch and made no bid. GRAN ARTIETUDE was a bit washy heading to the gate, broke a couple
lengths slowly, went mostly four wide on the turns, tired.

Footnotes
SOUPER WATSON exchanged a bump at the start, settled outside off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, was brushed lightly in upper stretch,
unleashed a strong rally to drive past just inside the seventy-yard marker. KAWACATOOSE set the pace facing some pressure from inside and outside,
went two wide on the turn, moved clear in upper stretch but was outkicked. HAVE A SOUPER DAY exchanged a bump at the start but quickly recovered to
stalk mid-pack, went three then four wide on the turn racing between foes, angled out at the eighth pole for room and gained belatedly. BACHELOR PAD
moved forward between rivals heading up the backstretch and moved in to press the leader inside through the turn, kept on late to preserve a minor award.
SOUPER LEGACY stalked three wide through the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch and brushed with a rival, kept on late but missed fourth. WESTERN
TROUBLE stalked in behind two wide into the turn and coming out a path in upper stretch, had no extra for the drive. TAKE A CHANCE bobbled inwardly at
the break, raced between foes on the turn moving to the rail about the five-sixteenths and had no rally. RED HIERARCHY was in just a bit tight at the start,
settled toward the rear going two to three wide, failed to rally. VICTORY JET switched off the inside heading into the turn, swung six wide coming out of that
bend and failed to threaten. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR chased briefly inside, was in a bit tight and shuffled back heading up the backstretch, tired.

MOQADAMA (IRE) loomed boldly while running four wide on the final turn, took command at the eighth pole outside of horses and drew away the final
sixteenth. CURLIN CANDY stumbled at the break, sat behind the pacesetters on the backstretch, angled outside entering the final turn to offer a bid at the
eighth pole and held for second. LADY MOONSHINE rated back on the rail in the beginning ,split horses just outside on the final turn, angled out to the five
path down the stretch and just missed getting up for second. HUSHEMUP set the early fractions, was headed at the eighth pole and faded the final
sixteenth to get a minor share. AWESOME STREET trailed early on ,roused on the final turn while five wide and never gained contention. LADY BREW
broke outwards on the break, stalked behind runners, waited on the inside through the final turn and ran evenly through the lane. IT'S ON YOU was four
wide into the first turn, pressed the lead through the backstretch, faded between horses on the final turn. BRIENNE OF TARTH stalked outside of horses
mid pack early on and had little to offer for the drive.

GRANDSON was allowed to settle last on the rail through to the backstretch, angled outside through the stretch to be six wide and was full of run on the
outside to draw away convincingly late. WAVE BABY was six wide entering the first turn, followed a rival down the backstretch to get good position into the
final turn ,took over at the eighth pole but could not hold off the fast closing winner late. JACKIE'S PRIDE set the pace early on while saving ground, was
headed at the five sixteenth pole, repelled that foe but could not hold off the late charge of the two closing rivals on the outside. BLUE MAX stalked four
wide on the first turn and backstretch, closed belatedly outside of horses through the lane for a minor share. WHERE'S NEAL broke out at the start, was
shuffled going into the first turn, roused inside on the final turn and ran evenly late. SMALL TALK broke a step slow in the beginning, made an early move
three wide outside of horses down the backstretch and through the turn and faded between horses the last eighth. SUNRISE DRIVE got bumped at the
break, stalked mid pack between foes down the backstretch and never factored. GATLING GUN pressed the lead early, stalked while inside down the
backstretch, contended turning for home and faded through the stretch. VICTORY TOWN trailed throughout and was eased at the wire.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S PRINCESS shifted in while moving forward soon after the start, moved up inside a rival but racing off the rail to dictate terms past the five-eighths,
extended the margin willingly on the turn, was asked a furlong out to maintain and held well. LORENA had the early lead briefly then was forced to chase
outside the eventual winner three wide, was no match for that one but clearly second best. TRADING BAY settled early racing outside rivals, advanced four
wide on the turn, could not kick on with the top pair and was all out to maintain show honors. SOUPER PECAN stalked from between rivals, was in a bit
tight and exchanged very light brushes late up the backstretch, entered the turn five wide, altered outside a rival about the seven-sixteenths, came into the
stretch six wide and ran on with late interest but missed third. SPANISH BALLERINA shifted in early to track the pace three wide, had no extra in the
stretch. SILENT CAUSEWAY was forced in and made light contact with a rival just after the start, stalked from between foes and was again in a bit tight and
exchanged light brushes late up the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and kept on evenly. GOLDEN VISION broke a step slowly and lost the path at
the start, raced well back going three then four wide on the turn, failed to menace. NOVEMBER FOG settled well back along the inside, came out in upper
stretch then moved out further to be six wide in mid-stretch and was never near enough to threaten. ISHIYAYA broke in brushing with a rival after the start,
was in tight and altered out soon after, raced four to five wide on the turn swinging eight wide into the stretch and made no bids. JILLI MARIE raced between
foes two wide into the turn, failed to rally. HELLO FRIENDS was brushed after the start, chased two to three wide and came up empty. RED EQUINOX was
up close inside early, dropped back and faded.

LUCKY SCORE trailed in the early stages, angled outside entering the stretch to close well finishing strong the final eighth. MACLEAN'S POSSE chased
the speed early ,loomed boldly on the turn, took the lead at the three sixteenths pole only to be collared by the winner shortly afterwards while holding onto
second. SIR SEAMUS took command at the start, opened up entering the turn, was headed at the quarter pole and ran on well down the lane to hold third.
SOLIDIFY settled near the back in the beginning, rallied around the turn while four wide and closed belatedly down the stretch to get a small share. HICKSY
stalked between foes down the backside, saved ground inside on the turn and finished with some interest late passing tiring horses. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
chased inside, contended on the rail through the turn and backed through the field the last eighth. MALIBU SECRET stalked mid pack just outside early,
asked through the turn and had little to offer down the stretch. TYCOON was well back early, angled out to the six path turning for home but never reached
contention.

Footnotes
ROCKET JOE COPPER stalked just off the leaders under light rating tactics, went four wide on the turn, took the lead at the quarter pole and quickly moved
clear, was kept busy to the wire. MNEMBA ISLAND rated inside at the rear, saved ground on the turn, angled three wide in upper stretch for room, got up
for and held the place. HYPERFOCUS lacked early speed, went three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch for room and was carried out further by a
drifting rival in mid-stretch, ran on well but missed second. SEGUIMI attended the pace three wide, led briefly late on the turn before being collared at the
top of the stretch by the winner, was no match and could not kick on with the rest. SELFMADE shifted in early, tracked inside saving ground through the
turn, ran on evenly. COLEYVILLE stalked three wide between foes through the turn, drifted out gradually through the the stretch and failed to rally. LION'S
GOLDENHEART stalked outside going five wide on the turn, lacked room in behind foes at the quarter pole but failed to rally thereafter. ARI GOLD
SPEEDWAGN moved forward inside to take the lead and set the tempo up the backstretch after the opening three-sixteenths, gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
LUV TO WIN exchanged a brush at the start, was encouraged forward between foes to set the pace with moderate pressure inside and out, went two wide
on the turn, was clear in upper stretch and kept busy to hold sway. TREBUCHET broke just a tad awkwardly but recovered to race mid-pack into the turn
three wide, moved out five wide coming past the quarter pole, gained steadily in the stretch but too late. THE COACHMAN bumped twice with a rival at the
start then steadied in tight quarters soon after, moved up five wide into the turn, was gaining in the stretch but missed the place. MYSTIC POINT brushed
with the winner lightly at the start, stalked that one three wide through the turn, had no extra in late stretch. BODIE was reserved early, went two to three
wide on the turn, rallied between rivals through the stretch. STORMIN' HUMOR tracked in behind the leaders two then three wide and weakened. TAKE
CHARGE SOUSI switched out early, lacked speed despite urging, lacked room two wide in behind foes coming past the quarter pole, moved out three wide
turning into upper stretch and ran on. DR CHROME was bumped and bothered at the break, raced four to five wide on the turn and put to more encouraging
hand-urging three-eighths from home then more urgent requests coming to the quarter pole but had no response. WICKED CRAZY moved forward to press
inside briefly, emptied out. VIEW FROM EGBERT bumped a rival at the start, chased outside four wide, came up empty. WIN THE DRAW failed to threaten
after saving ground on the turn. DETERMINED FRIEND exchanged two bumps at the start, went four wide into the turn moving in two deep later on that
bend, was never a threat and tired in the lane.
