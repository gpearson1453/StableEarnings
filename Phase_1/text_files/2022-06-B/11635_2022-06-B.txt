DUBRONSKY advanced inside to the turn, bid between horses to challenge and drew off past the eighth pole in a driving finish. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT
pressed the pace, bid willingly to threaten, didn't have enough late and settled for place. POPS AWESOME raced close to the pace, bid five wide on the
turn, lacked the needed late rally and hung late. BRUIN MAGIC set a pressured pace to mid stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. ROWDY GUY was
off slowly and improved position in an even effort. AG MINISTER pressed the pace between horses, was steadied in tight quarters on the turn and gave
way. BEL RAGAZZO was not a factor. The rider of AG MINISTER claimed foul against the rider of DUBRONSKY for alleged interference on the turn. No
change was made. Hand timed.

Footnotes
EL CHAVO DEL OCHO set the pace and drew off in the drive while under urging. RAMBLIN' MAN raced mid pack, swung wide into the stretch, closed well
and finished second best. HEY PILGRIM was never far back, closed under steady urging and was along for show. DILLON ROCKS hesitated at the start,
was void of early speed, offered a mild bid and improved position. NUMEROLOGIST broke slowly, was unhurried early and raced evenly. TW SKIPPING
STONES bumped at the start, showed good early speed along the inside, weakened and gave way. CLASSY CLASS raced mid pack in an even effort.
TAPPED TO THE MAX came in and bumped at the start, chased the pace, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back. SENSEMAKER was hustled
along, flashed speed and dropped back steadily. Hand timed.
