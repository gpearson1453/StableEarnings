Footnotes
FONSSAGRIVES hustled out set the pace being pressed into the far turn dueling inside of rival from the rail down the stretch exchanging brushes in close
quarters getting up gamely. QUARIA BRAVA unruly loading delayed the start, prompted the pace dueling abreast foe through the far turn then down the
stretch moving in close quarters late as the pair exchanged brushes being out gamed at the wire. HOT AS BLUE BLAZES raced evenly through the far turn
losing ground to upper stretch giving a mild late rally seven wide. FRACING HOT gained on the backside chasing through the far turn vying from the four
path down the lane. JEWEL OF WINTER gained on the backside chasing through the far turn into upper stretch finishing evenly there in the three path.
SUMMER STORE moved up on the backside chasing on the far turn fading near mid track in upper stretch. HELENS SPIRIT was always outrun. MY
LORETTO having no mishap was far back throughout. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF QUARIA BRAVA AGAINST THE RIDER OF
FONSSAGRIVES FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
