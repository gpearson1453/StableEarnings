through the turn, then gained command in early stretch but was outfinished at the wire. COWBOY COOL got off slow, running near the back, then was

CHROME dueled for the lead while two wide, then inched away at the top of the lane, continued to dig in gamely but was caught in the end and was second
best. SINNIN N GRINNIN dueled for the lead from the inside into the turn, then continued to rally down the stretch but gave way in the end.
ITSONLYMONEYHONEY was unhurried early, then made a mild bid while four wide down the stretch but it was too little too late. MIZ JAMESON chased
the pace from the inside into the turn then flattened out and was no factor.

Footnotes
TEXAS RED BEL stalked the pace early on, racing in the three path, then rallied down the lane, to get up for the win in the final strides under strong urging.
HAPPY SAILOR made the lead early on, and fought off foes until the final strides, faltering near the wire but easily second best. ROSIE JANE stalked the
pace early, angling out to the five path in the stretch drive and offering a mild bid to grab show. TEXAS ASCOT QUEEN got shuffled back at the break,
hustled up to mid pack, then got checked sharply at the quarter pole but had no late run. ITS MY MONEY TOO was near the back, running along the rail,
then angled out slightly from the turn and offered a mild late bid down the lane. TRUE RUNNER showed no early speed, traveling two wide and failed to fire
in the stretch drive. KELLEY SAID READY was mid field early, four wide and dropped back in the stretch. Following the running of the race, the rider of
TEXAS ASCOT QUEEN, claimed foul on HAPPY SAILOR for interference at the quarter pole. After reviewing the films, the objection was disallowed.

strides. PIVOLIN was unhurried early then swung out five wide on the far turn to surge down the stretch lane and was up for the place winnings. HERN

MIDNIGHT was well placed while two wide, was in a steady drive down the backstretch, then made a mild bid on the far turn but weakened in the final
furlongs. BIG POWER RED chased the pace while two wide, then dropped back on the backstretch, made a mild bid in upper stretch but was no threat.
TENSAS TODDY steadied early, then chased the pace from the inside and failed to rally. V. I. P. WHO chased the pace while four wide, then dropped back
on the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GOLDEN ALE pressed the pace in the early goings, traveling two wide, the rallied down the lane to get up for the win at the wire. MY PAL MATTIE made
the early lead, racing along the rail, then gave way grudgingly in late stretch to hold on to second. REPLETE had no early foot, racing the widest throughout,
then made a bid in the turn, closing well, to get up for show. PUTMAN chased the pace, traveling along the rail and made a mild bid down the lane. HEROIC
SONG was in the middle of the pack, racing four wide, then offered a mild rally in the stretch drive. D C HERO was mid field early on, running along the
inside and offered a mild bid down the lane. JACKMAN'S RIDE showed no early speed, angled out three wide around the turn, and offered a mild bid in the
stretch. IMA BLING CAT was near the front early on, traveling in the two path but dropped back in the stretch drive. LET'S GO ALAMO reared at the start,
having no speed away from the gate and showed little. TAKE A LIMO was near the back, running along the rail and was no factor.
