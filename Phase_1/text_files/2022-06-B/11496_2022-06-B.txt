Footnotes
BOLD LEGEND dueled inside of MY KIKI for the early lead, continued to battle inside of rival into the lane, dug in gamely along the rail and edged away
near the sixteenth pole. MY KIKI dueled outside of BOLD LEGEND for the lead up the backstretch and fought back two wide into the lane, stayed on with
good response but could not move on with the winner in the final sixteenth. JAVISTHA tracked the pace near the inside in early stages, hustled up on the
inside around the turn then tipped out approaching upper stretch, sustained a three wide bid through the lane and held show. MAD TABBY got shuffled back
a bit after the start then settled nicely in the back while never too far back, picked up the pace along the outside on the turn, swung four to five wide into the
upper stretch and lacked the needed response for serious impact. NEW YEARS LOVE chased the embattled duo up the backstretch and around the turn
then came up empty in the upper stretch.

Footnotes
WAR RON was forwardly placed in opening stages and chased after the leader around the turn, sustained a three wide bid into the lane and forged clear in
the final furlong. FIRECRACKER STAND hustled up out of the gate and took over the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held clear around the turn,
continued on top two wide into the lane and got overtaken late. TRUE SAINT rated inside off the early pace, saved ground around the turn then shifted out
three to four wide entering the upper stretch and ran on for a share. FLY FIRST CLASS raced in contention along the inside into the turn, sustained
response in the upper stretch then flattened out. THEGREATGENERATION chased three wide around the turn then tipped four to five wide in the upper
stretch and failed to move on. GAME DAY DECISION reared in the air and broke inward at the start spotting the field several lengths, trailed in the opening
quarter and failed to move into late contention. CANTWAITTOGRADUATE showed brief speed then steadily retreated.

BIG THORN tipped a path off the inside and tracked the early pace, moved up to three wide to challenge for the lead mid-way around the turn, cleared
command approaching the upper stretch and pulled away willingly, finishing in hand. MEGATAP moved up four wide to engage rivals for the lead mid-way
around the turn, sustained a three wide bid for the winner through the lane and had to settle for second best. LORD OF THE PALACE dueled for the lead
soon after the start, battled on after the turn, could not move on with the winner approaching upper stretch but stayed on with response and cleared the rest.
POP'S BISCUIT raced in the back through early stages, hustled up four to five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. ROCK CITY ROCKET
broke on top and briefly held the lead before conceding position leaving the backstretch, chased inside around the turn then faded in the lane. GHOST
STRATEGY dueled for the early lead then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S MELODY was forwardly placed around the first turn and prompted the pace into the backstretch, let out a notch and cleared command entering
the far turn, continued on top two wide into the lane and held late under a driving finish. ATHENAS SONG tracked the top trio up the backstretch, was ridden
along three wide around the far turn, sustained a four wide bid into the lane and was getting to the winner late. OLIVE OYL dueled for the lead around the
first turn and up the backstretch then got collared by the winner entering the far turn, continued in contention a furlong out and dug in to hold show. HELLO
DARLING was allowed to settle off the early pace, launched a bid mid-way around the far turn, ran on in contention into the lane and got edged late for
show. SASSY AIN'T I rated off the early pace, urged four wide around the turn, sustained a two wide bid going by the furlong marker and ran on evenly.
DARK SILENCE dueled for the lead around the first turn and up the backstretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
SAMIRA tracked the pace in opening stages then hustled up three wide around the turn, dueled outside of SHESFORMIDABLE a furlong out then shook
free and kicked clear. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE set a pressured pace through early stages, took on the challenge of SAMIRA in the upper stretch, dueled
past the furlong marker then had to settle for second best. RAINBOW SUREBET prompted the pace into the turn, sustained a two wide bid into the upper
stretch and churned on for a share. READY TO GET LOUD chased four wide up close around the turn then flattened in the lane. SHIPS JEWEL was not too
far back and saved ground around the turn then weakened in the stretch. VICTORY BOLT chased along the outside and failed to move into contention. A
BUNCH FOR LUNCH saved ground around the turn then tipped two wide for the drive and never threatened.
