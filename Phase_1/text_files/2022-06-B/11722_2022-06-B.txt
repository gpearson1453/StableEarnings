Footnotes
EL MILAGRA was unhurried racing from the three path, made progress while floating into the six path at the top of the stretch, and rallied down the center to
win. MIAMI GOLD stalked from two wide, was hustled in the four path coming in to the stretch, and ran on for place. KISSES FOR HANNAH raced in mid
pack from the three path, was ridden along while continuing to race in the three path around the turn, tipped into the five path at the top of the stretch, and
improved for show. WINNINGFORPLEASURE prompted the pace inside, saved ground around the turn, but was tired. KARATS AND GOLD set a loose
lead from the three path, was coaxed from the two path at the top of the lane, but faded. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE trailed from the inside and was no factor.
BUFFUM'S BEAUTY rated in the two path but was empty coming into the stretch.

Footnotes
QT BLIEGH pressed between rivals, took over while racing in the two path around the turn, and drew clear. MO STYLISH prompted the pace from three
wide, drifted into the six path at the top of the lane, and held place. PERFECT SURVIVOR rated from the three path, was coaxed in the four path at the top
of the lane, but finished evenly to show. DRINK THE TAP raced well back in the two path and was no threat. DON'TMAKEAZEEN led from inside but
yielded rounding the turn. NO MORE FIRE stumbled at the start and lost rider. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED FOLLOWING
