Footnotes
LA RUSIA stalked the pace in the three path around the first turn, took over nearing the far turn, drew clear and angled in midway around the turn held clear
under a drive in the lane. KENTUCKY PRIDE settled off the early pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, had aim outside of
the winner in the lane but was second best. SHEA ON A MISSION raced off the pace three and four wide and was one-paced through the lane. PERFECT
KIMBERLY S had her head turned at the start and was off well last, saved ground off the early pace, advanced two wide around the far turn and lacked a
closing bid. TRULY saved ground and failed to menace. AMERICAN EMPRESS had her head turned at the start, was sent to the front, set the pace in the
two path and faltered around the far turn. KEITANY played no factor while racing three wide.

CELESTIAL GLAZE set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. REDJACK stalked the winner from the three path, was no match for that foe in
the lane but stayed on to be clearly second best. GO HOME HAPPY was in range four wide and lacked a closing bid. ACTION DREAM failed to menace
while racing four and five wide. GRAND PLAYER was in a bit tight between foes down the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn and retreated.
ZURIEL played no factor while racing three wide. KATRAKA was outrun inside.

SWEET PENELOPE set a clear pace inside and held clear under a drive. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE prompted the winner two wide, could not threaten that
foe in the lane but held well enough to remain clear of the rest. EVERTHREE raced off the pace two wide and was along for the show. KENYA SUN broke a
bit awkwardly, chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally. CHUTZPAH raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and never
threatened. ELLIEREESEASTON was off slow and outrun while racing two wide. MONGOLIAN MISSION played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SUN VIKING tracked the pace two and three wide, closed determinedly and was up late. K. C. CHIEF set the pace along the rail around the first turn,
pressed the pace inside around the far turn, regained command in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and was caught in deep stretch.
VALIANT AVENGER raced well back three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn an rallied outside to gain the show. STAR SHOPPING steadied
early, raced two wide in midpack around the first turn, edged closer four wide around the far turn but flattened out in the lane. QUANTUM THEORY pressed
the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the far turn, set the pace two wide around that bend and weakened in the drive. GHOSTINYOU failed to menace
while racing two wide. PANORAMA TRUCK saved ground and lacked a closing bid. MOGALU played no factor while racing two and three wide. GRAN
ANDREWS was outrun inside.
