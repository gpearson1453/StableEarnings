Footnotes
HEAVENLY TRUMP had no early speed, racing in the three path, then made a bid in the turn, closing fast, while drifting wider down the lane, drawing off
from the field to win easily. NOAH dueled for the lead briefly down the backstretch, then settled back to mid pack around the turn and rallied, three wide, to
get up for place. RED BIRD'S STORM took the early lead, dueled through the turn and gave way in the stretch drive to hold on to third. STRAWMAN was
mid field, three wide and failed to respond down the lane. DUDA MATT had no early foot, running four wide and never fired. REGAL PRIZE got off slow from
the gates, five wide and was no factor. MORO FLYBOY made the lead, drew clear, ducked from the whip, hitting the rail and lost the rider in mid stretch and
did not finish but was walked off. WITT AND WHISKEY dwelt coming out of the gate and stumbled, then was taken up by the rider by the half and did not
finish but was walked off.

getting up for second. LIGHTNING STRUCK showed no early foot, racing four wide, then closed well down the lane to get up for show and just getting

angled out at the head of the stretch with a bid to hold on for show. CHEROKEE COWGIRL made the lead, racing along the rail and gave way in late
stretch. STORMIEIS BLUE had no early speed, tracking the field, then angled out down the lane, six wide with a late rally. TYLER'S DREAM was mid field
early, three wide, then offered a bid down the lane, drifting wider. MY BABYS GONE was mid field, three wide, then angled in down the lane, with a late bid.
SUMMER LIGHTNING chased the pace, two wide and never fired. COBRA CASABLANCA pressed the pace, three wide and faded in the stretch drive.
