GO MAMA stalked the pacesetters, shifted out to the three path in the final turn, struck the front and was kept to task under intermittent reminders. SKY
DESTINY trailed early, lodged a rail bid into the lane, improved position mid stretch and finished evenly. IT'S ALEXUS stalked outside, droved four wide into
the stretch, and was outkicked. SHESAHEATWAVE prompted the pace outside of WHEELSUPINTHIRTY, and had nothing left in reserve for the drive.
WHEELSUPINTHIRTY set the pace under a strong hold, took pressure in the backstretch, was overtaken at the quarter pole, and gave way. WHISKARITA
showed little.

outside, moved up alongside IRISH TRICK to challenge the lead and was unable to get by. BOOKIE unhurried early, rallied inside into the stretch and dug in
under a late drive by RED CHOCOLATE. RED CHOCOLATE stalked the pacesetters, and bid belatedly. NO SUPAH FOR YOU sat in range outside and
was done early.

CAB SAV contested the pace leaving the backstretch, matched strides outside of TAKE NO PRISONERS, battled determinedly through the stretch and
wore down rival in the final sixteenth. TAKE NO PRISONERS sent for speed, responded to challenge from CAB SAV, dueled into the stretch and was worn
down. AMEER shifted outside leaving the backstretch, chased hard in the final turn, drifted in sharply clipping heels with OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR, and
held on late for show. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR chased outside, lost path at the head of the lane clipping heels with AMEER and re-rallied late. TRICKY
SPEEDSTER took back after encountering traffic into the far turn, and bid belatedly. SOMETHIN HAPPENIN saved ground, offered a mild bid into the lane
and gave way. GOLD'S UP allowed to settle just off the pace, and tired early. STEWARDS INQUIRY and JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the
rider of OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR against the rider of AMEER alleging interference into the stretch run was upheld. AMEER was disqualified and placed
fourth for interference to OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR.

Footnotes
TALA stalked four wide, was asked to quicken in the final turn, struck the lead at the head of the stretch and held. FIONA BAY took closer order nearing the
quarter pole, drove between foes then rallied inside but was unable to get by late. BEAUTIFUL BABE settled outside early, advanced nearing the quarter
pole, and closed with energy late. CHATTY GAL away well then stat just off the pace, moved up alongside BELLS AND WHISTLES to challenge the lead,
and came up empty in the drive. FLASHY SISTER trailed leaving the final turn, and closed steadily late. BELLS AND WHISTLES vied for the early lead, was
challenged in the final turn and gave way. DAME DEVIL last away, and offered a late mild bid. MARACOCA'S DREAM chased and failed to threaten.
AWESOME GIGI chased from rail, and tired.
