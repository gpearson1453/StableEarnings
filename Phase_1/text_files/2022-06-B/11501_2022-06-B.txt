Footnotes
STORIED FELLA established the front and crossed to show the way in hand from the two path forcing MAKART to be taken in hand briefly off his heels,
showed the way under pressure through the presence of FAIR TO MIDDLIN to the outside and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide
for home, dug in under a drive under challenge from flanking threats and had the rider lose the handle on the crop to the right side a sixteenth out,
stubbornly clung to command to the finish under a vigorous hand drive. MAKART traded a bump at the start with DATESFREEDOM, raced briefly in the two
path and was taken in hand off the heels of the aforementioned foe before tipping to the three path, tucked back to the two path through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied willingly along the inside but missed at the end.
SENSIBLECONCLUSION brushed at the start by FAIR TO MIDDLIN, who broke out a step, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied and had the rider lose the handle on the crop to the right side just outside the eighth pole, dug in
fighting on to the finish to secure the show honors. CLINGMAN chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch, offered up a bid a furlong from home, altered out a path inside that station and flattened out in the late going. DATESFREEDOM traded a bump at
the start with STORIED FELLA, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.
FAIR TO MIDDLIN broke out at the start brushing SENSIBLECONCLUSION, prompted the leader from the outside two to three wide under coaxing from
three furlongs out, tipped out four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PRAYER BOOK was rated just off the pace under a strong hold, moved from the rail to the two path around the far turn, was asked outside quarter-pole,
came out under a drive while inside of BORN A GAMBLER in upper stretch, chased the leader in tandem with that foe into the final furlong, made a bid
between horses at the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed on the wire at big odds. BORN A GAMBLER was rated just off the pace under a tight hold,
went two then three wide around the far turn, was roused late on that bend, chased outside under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid into the final
sixteenth, fought on even terms with the winner to the wire and was denied while clear for the place. BRAZILLIONAIRE remained out five wide around the
opening bend, moved up to stalk the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead just inside the
three-sixteenths, inched away under a drive in upper stretch, led to just before the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but held the show. BLESS BLESS
stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe, was taken in hand then reserved off the pace, went three wide while let on the final turn, was roused for more
near the five-sixteenths and improved position to get the last spot in the superfecta. SEIZING THE DREAM settled towards the rear on the outside, was
ridden along in the two path around the far turn, came under the crop before the five-sixteenths and also improved position but just missed the superfecta.
SUPER WICKED CHARM settled off the pace, saved ground around the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and gained late but failed to impact.
HE'S GOT IT bumped with a rival at the start, was taken back under stout restraint late on the first turn then reserved off the pace, raced in the two path on
the far turn, was roused with five-sixteenths to run, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. OCEAN DEEP broke inward at the start, settled at the rear,
was hard ridden in the three path around the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. BEZOS went to the front, showed the way on the
inside through very sensible fractions, lost the advantage just inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and faded.

STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide, came under coaxing tucked to the two path at the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home, then prevailed
edging away at the end. SUPER QUALITY hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for
home, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared with seventy yards to the finish while clear for the place honors.
RUGGED UNION showed the way coaxed along the inside, got a tap of the crop to the left side three furlongs from home when scraping the paint on the rail
then got taken in hand and pulled off the rail once more with five-sixteenths to go when getting inwards slightly, continued in the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was caught a furlong out, kept on to the finish and just preserved the show honors on the wire from a pair of
foes. JIMMY THE BOOT coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide tucking in half a mile from home and forcing MARCO POLO to check, came
under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the wire just missing for the show honors.
UPTOWN HUSTLER chased along the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, made no headway. DADS
GOOD RUNNER chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and offered no response. KING OF STING coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four to five
wide for home and offered no rally. STREAMING TAP chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch,
made no impact. MARCO POLO coaxed from the gate, chased three wide, got forced to check when JIMMY THE BOOT tucked directly in front near the half
mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. IRIE SPICE chased four then three wide pushed along
from the seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BAD GUY was last to commence then hustled, raced well off the pace under urging, saved ground around the turn, was driven three wide into upper stretch,
rallied outside into the final furlong and closed fast to get up late. WINNING DRIVE chased the leading duo on the outside, engaged those foes in the three
path around the turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole then shook clear in upper stretch, came inward into the final furlong, swapped leads back and
forth outside the sixteenth-pole, led into the final seventy yards but was caught while just able to get the place. DREAM BIGGER was hustled from the start,
disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, was urged along against the rail while still inside that rival around the turn, dropped behind the runner-up under a
drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, switched outside that foe into the final sixteenth, kept on well to the wire and just missed the place while
clear for the show. DURKIN'S CALL was taken up while in tight early, went three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and gained late but
failed to threaten. MISSION WRAPITUP chased the pace on the outside from fourth position, went four wide around the turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and tired. KAREN'S COVE was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two path while still outside that opponent
on the turn, battled between foes into the stretch and capitulated. MANIFEST DESTINY was crowded early, raced near the back under coaxing, rounded the
turn in the two path, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and faltered.

BOSS CARA chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home coming inwards under a right handed crop, then edged away to the finish kept to task.
CHLOE ROSE chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors.
CLOSING DEALS showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from a pair, came under coaxing tucked inside at the three-eighths and
under prompting from THEGODDESSOFSNAKES, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to the
finish but was ultimately bested for the place honors while safe for the show. MIA BEA STAR five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the
two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild belated bid. NEW
YORK BANKER bumped at the start by THEGODDESSOFSNAKES, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide under a ride from midway on the turn,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES broke in at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, raced four wide
in aim before advancing to prompt the leader from the outside, tucked to the two path into the turn and advanced to intensify the pressure coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, tired in the drive. HOLIDAY JAZZ chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MASEN (GB) came away in good order, moved out while showing speed on the inside of WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST, fought the rider rankly while wrestled
back badly with seven-furlongs to run then switched to the outside, tracked the leader from that point, went around the turn in the three path, was asked at
the five-sixteenths, gained to take the lead under a drive in upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady
urging. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST broke out and hit the gate, was coaxed to the front from the outside then taken in hand near the seven-eighths, showed
the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was asked in unison with the winner at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to that
foe under a drive in upper stretch, kept on well in the final furlong and gamely earned the place. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) tugged at the bit nearing the
seven-eighths, was reserved on the outside, went three to four wide around the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, gained in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. SANCTUARY CITY was hustled from the
start then taken in hand, tugged at the bit nearing the seven-eighths then settled near the back, came under coaxing late on the backstretch, saved ground
on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, kept on in the final furlong and also finished willingly but missed
the trifecta. PENALTY was taken in hand early, pulled under restraint as the pace slackened with seven furlongs to run, was reserved off the pace, went
around the turn in the two path while between foes, was roused at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CASTLE LEOCH settled two to three wide near the rear of the field and was patiently handled until placed to light coaxing just outside the quarter pole, got
angled out seven wide into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, rallied with a good kick to close stoutly outside a quartet through the final furlong
and just got up in the shadow of the wire to score. CREDIT EVENT just off the pace two to three wide in pursuit, got let out spinning three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command through the length of the drive taking narrow command a sixteenth from home, battled on between
foes and was nailed on the line. ANALOGY got carried in at the start by PARQUETRY and bumped with FIGHTER IN THE WIN getting taken in hand,
settled two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and closed well through the final
furlong to just miss between foes at the finish. CARPE'S DREAM led early on before being displaced from command by ICARUS, tracked that rival in
closest aim two then three wide, came under coaxing latched on to the outside of that foe loosely between rivals three furlongs from home, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes taking command near the eighth pole, gamely fought on inside an advancing quartet and got
headed a sixteenth out, battled on inside those foes to the finish. FIGHTER IN THE WIN traded a bump at the start with ANALOGY and was steadied,
saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive rallying into contention inside the final eighth, paused inside the final seventy yards and was bumped by ANALOGY coming out slightly as CREDIT
EVENT herded him very lightly near the finish and missed at the end. MERCI stumbled at the start getting away last, saved ground near the rear of the field
coming under coaxing near the quarter pol, swung four to five wide into upper stretch offering up a mild bid but was outkicked. ICARUS showed the way in
hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under increased pressure from CARPE'S DREAM to the outside through the far turn
and got placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat from a pair, relinquished the front just outside the
eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. PARQUETRY broke in at the start forcing ANALOGY into FIGHTER IN THE WIN, tracked the pace along the
inside patiently handled until set down along the inside route at the top of the stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish unable to quicken. DRIPPING
GOLD three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and came up empty.

TWO THIRTY FIVE settled off the pace, moved closer with six furlongs to run, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn, rallied to make
a bid outside the three-eighths, spun four wide into the stretch while inside of AIR ATTACK, commenced a spirited tussle with that foe, leaned out some
inside the furlong marker, battled gamely to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. AIR ATTACK was slow into stride, angled in at the rear
of the field, settled at the back, moved closer midway down the backstretch, started the turn in the two path, angled four then five wide inside the half-mile
pole, rallied to make a bid with three furlongs to run, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and just missed while well clear for the place.
LASTCHANCEATGLORY tracked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide around the turn, made a bid between foes near the three-eighths, dropped
back into the stretch and weakened but was well clear for the show. PIONEER SPIRIT was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, took the
lead in the three path early on the turn, lost the advantage before the five-sixteenths, dropped back four wide into the stretch and tired. PRINCE JAMES was
hustled from the gate, pressed the pace between foes through quick fractions, dropped back in the two path leaving the backstretch and retreated. CHRIS
AND DAVE settled on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, was ridden along while four to six wide around the turn, turned into the stretch in
the four path and was no factor. MUSICAL AMERICA was sent to the front, set the pace under heavy pressure from two foes to his outside, lost the lead
with a half-mile to run and stopped.

Footnotes
FORWARDLY was taken in hand early, saved ground around the opening bend, was rated towards the front on the inside, came under coaxing in the two
path around the far turn, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong
marker, disposed of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under steady urging. REMOTE was asked leaving the gate then brushed with a
foe, was taken under a hold early, traveled three wide around the first turn, was rated just off the pace, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, jostled
with a foe while four wide into the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken by the winner while clear for the place. GOOD
MEDICINE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused three then four
wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. HASHTAG NO WONDER settled near the back while saving
ground, was roused on the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position to just miss the show. THISTLE was reserved while saving
ground, came off the rail late on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, held a good striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and
lacked the needed kick. HOOKY PLAYER established a forward position early, prompted three wide around the opening bend, drew even with the leader
near the three-quarter pole, was asked in the two path on the far turn then took a short advantage, came under the crop outside the quarter-pole, spun three
wide into the stretch and jostled with a foe, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. STJAMES went three wide on the first turn, settled at
the back, raced two then three wide on the far turn, checked behind horses at the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. LEFT ON BOYLSTON was caught four
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back inside the five-eighths, went three wide on the far turn and had nothing left. BRAILLE brushed
with a foe at the start, was taken under a tight hold early, raced in the two path around the initial bend, moved closer outside the five-eighths, held a good
position in the three path while asked on the far turn, faltered coming to the quarter-pole then floated five wide into the stretch and capitulated. ACAMAR
went to the front, set the pace on the inside with company to his outside, was asked on the far turn then lost the lead, dropped back with five-sixteenths to
run and faded. DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE, ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA
