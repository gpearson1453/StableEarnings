HOLDONTOYOURTIARA just off pace to the turn, took over, well handled and held sway to the wire. DESTINY'S DARLING chased pace throughout, could
not keep up while well clear of rest. KITTY'S PROMISE raced evenly for the show spot in the stretch run. RADIANTRITHYM no speed to the quarter pole,
passed a few in the stretch run. UNUNDERSTANDABLE quick to the front, led past quarter pole, gave way readily. ONLY REWARD'S through early,
dropped back. SUPER STEAMY went wrong quickly on the backstretch, pulled up and vanned off.
