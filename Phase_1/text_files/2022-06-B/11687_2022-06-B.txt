Footnotes
ANNIEWAY U WANT IT was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, moved up to challenge DELUSION for the lead at the quarter pole, took over
control at the head of the lane then angled inside and pulled away. BARBED WIRE hustled along two wide around the turn, sustained a three wide bid
through the lane and finished second best. BIGMONEYHUNNY lacked speed and raced in the back, launched an outside bid at the head of the lane and
rallied for show. ADD IT ALL UP was ridden along three to four wide and lacked the needed response for impact. DONNA'S HOPE raced inside near
midpack, saved ground into the lane, gained position along the inside upper stretch then gave way. DELUSION sped to the lead at the start and showed the
way into the turn, took on the challenge from the eventual winner at the quarter pole, got collared by rival at the head of the lane and steadily weakened.
REMITTANCE SENT raced up close in early stages, sustained bid around the turn then tired in the drive.

ANIME DAY broke sharp, quickly cleared the field and angled closer to the inside, set the pace and held clear around the turn, turned back the bid from
JERI DAWN in the final furlong and held firm. JERI DAWN was ridden along just off the second flight late on the backstretch, angled out and hustled up four
wide at the quarter pole, made a move for ANIME DAY at the head of the lane, raced in striking distance but could not reach rival and finished clearly
second best. LITTLE MORE LOVE lacked speed and saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and gained show. RUN A FIRE was
forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, chased three wide around the turn then faded in the lane. FEELSSOGOODINLOVE raced in range between
foes into the turn then came up empty upper stretch. STREET RINGER raced in contention along the inside then retreated in the lane.

FIRST EMPRESS stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a bid for BIG IF TRUE near the quarter pole, stayed on determinedly through the
lane and got a nose up on the wire. BIG IF TRUE vied for the lead around the first turn then set the pace up the backstretch, held clear still unleashed
around the far turn, saved ground and came under a ride heading into the lane, remained clear a furlong out then began to weaken in final stages and got
nipped on the wire. FLATOUTANDFOXY positioned just off the second flight mid-way up the backstretch, hustled along four wide around the far turn then
angled inside approaching the furlong marker, sustained a bid along the inside and held a share. EUTYCHIA raced well off the early pace, saved ground
around the far turn, tipped three wide for the drive and gained on show. BOLD LEGEND vied for the lead on the first turn and remained forwardly placed up
the backstretch, was ridden along the inside on the far turn then faded in the lane. SOCIAL CIRCLE lacked speed and raced in the back, came four to five
wide into upper stretch and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
CALL KRYSTAL applied pace pressure to FIFTH RISK around the first turn, continued to force the issue up the backstretch and around the final turn, given
cue in the two path approaching the furlong marker, responded and edged away in the final sixteenth. FIFTH RISK set a pressured pace up the backstretch
and around the final turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, held a slim lead into the final furlong then failed to contain the winner late. SWEET
LAURA got brushed at the start, lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled up four wide around the far turn, sustained three wide bid in the lane and
gained show. STONECOLD STUNNER raced in the second flight up the backstretch, urged three wide into upper stretch and finished evenly.
TAPTHATLUCK tracked the pace in early stages, cut the corner and urged along the rail in upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. TAKE ME AS I
AM raced in the second flight and tracked the early pace, failed to respond under urging midway around the far turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
RUNNING ALEX'SBAND was allowed to settle in early stages then picked up the pace two wide late on the turn, tipped three wide approaching upper
stretch, steadily edged up closer then surged to the wire and got up in final stride. TAKE ME UP BRADY set the pace and held clear around the turn, came
three wide into upper stretch then angled inside, remained clear a furlong out and got caught on the wire. STAGE DOOR was not too far back early on,
chased four wide around the turn, sustained a bid into the lane and got up for show. ITSALLABOUTYOU raced in range and three wide around the turn,
sustained a two wide bid into the final furlong then finished evenly. NASTY EXAGGERATOR chased in contention, saved ground around the turn then gave
way. NEW GOSPEL hustled along in steady pursuit, sustained a three wide bid around the turn then faded upper stretch. PHILLIP JUSTIN had no response
and steadily faded.

MISS INVASIVE tracked the pace in early stages and raced three wide around the turn, launched a bid upper stretch, dug in determinedly and got up late.
LUCKY EVERY DAY set the early pace and held firm around the turn, continued to show the way into the final furlong then failed to contain the winner late.
NEW YEARS LOVE angled in closer from the outside post and raced two wide at the quarter pole, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, sustained
steady response and secured a share. JAZZ BRUNCH was ridden along four wide around the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and needed more for
late impact. GLOBAL EXCHANGE chased two to three wide in early stages, saved ground around the turn and failed to move on. MINGO MAGIC raced in
the back, came three to four wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. TRIPLE BOLD BABY was forwardly placed in opening stages, prompted
the pace around the turn then gave way. CLINE TIME chased the pace along the inside and faded mid-way around the turn.
