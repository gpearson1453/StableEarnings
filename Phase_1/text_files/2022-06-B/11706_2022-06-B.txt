Footnotes
MRSG'S LIL DREAMER trekked three wide throughout from the second flight, was roused around the bend and rallied to run down the leader in the final
furlong. SQUEAKY BOOTS chased the pacesetter from a ground saving stance and closed with strong strides to earn the place. DEN'S ROSE finished full
of run and just missed the place after giving chase from between rivals. DEVINE CANDY zoomed away from outset and opened a clear advantage into and
around the bend, led the field at upper stretch but was used up and rapidly faded in the closing strides.

Footnotes
SAVE A PENNY gained first command, led the field by a slight advantage through every call, trekked the two path, and refused to lose stretch duel for the
score. MANDONA broke alertly and travelled four wide around the opening bend, chased the pacesetting duo along the backstretch from a two path pose,
advanced on the leader around the closing turn, then was outdueled in final furlong. RIVER BISCUIT stalked the early pace from a three wide stance around
the first turn, angled to be widest at upper stretch, and rallied mildly to earn the show. A HEART OF A LION rushed from outset to rate close up as the inner
most rival of four abreast through the opening turn, was within striking distance at the quarter pole but gave way to dueling duo in the homestretch and was
nipped at wire for the show. COQUENA ROCKET threw her head shortly after the start, trailed the field around the first turn and stopped at top of
homestretch.

Footnotes
GENTLE GEORGE hustled away from outset to gain first command and never relished that command while tracking an inside line for a gate to wire score.
LEDOUX WHAT IT DO just missed the score after giving chase as the inner most rival around the turn and rallying along the rail in the closing sixteenth.
JEANO rated in the second flight, travelled widest of all at upper stretch and lost ground to front runners. DA CRIMSON PASS settled into midpack and
gave chase to pacesetter from between rivals before weakening in the final furlong. UNBRIDLED GUY trailed form outset and failed to menace.

JOLLY JUMPER broke alertly and gained command at first stride, saved ground throughout and led every step of the way for a gate to wire score.
BRAINSTORM tucked to save ground shortly after the start, stalked the front runner around opening turn, angled out to the two path inside the quarter pole
and was gaining on leader at the finish. FLY TO THE BANK was unhurried in the opening quarter, traveled wide through the first bend, advanced on the
leaders along the backstretch, but proved no match for top pair in final furlong. QUALITY ROCKET lacked a needed rally to end a two path route. KELLER'S
GOLD rated mid pack and trekked three wide around the opening bend before tiring in the crucial stages.

HELLO SUNDAY showed reserve along the backstrretch, circled rivals four wide through the bend, locked into a stretch duel at top of lane and proved best
in the end. GODDESS OF WONDER settled into second flight, closed the gap near the quarter pole while trekking three wide through the bend, then was
outdueled in the stretch duel. ROCKIN RONI was unhurried along the backstretch and rated well back entering the turn, then was roused and responded
well to close rapidly and earnt he show. EUROTIGRE set the pace from an inside stance, rated close up at top of stretch, then gave way to dueling duo.
BAD AT LOVE pressed the pace from a two path pose, led the second flight at upper stretch, and weakened in the end. EUROBOUTTOGETIT saved
ground to no avail.

Footnotes
SHE'S FIRE AND ICE rushed form outset, established an inside stance and steadily widened margin for a gate to wire score. THE ONE FOR FUN settled in
behind the front runner, trekked the two path, locked into a stretch duel for place and bested that rival for place honors. TAKE CHARGE GAL was nipped for
second after giving chase from a three wide pose and dueling for place honors in the final furlong. HOPE AND A DREAM established an inside position
shortly after the start, rated in the second flight as the inner rival of three abreast, then weakened in the closing stages.

Footnotes
CHERISH THE DAY showed reserve and tucked to save ground through the opening bend, advanced three wide at the midway point, gained command
through the final turn and drew off in final furlong for a clear score. MOONSHINE PRINCESS pressed the pace from between rivals through the opening
turn, gained command along the backstretch but proved no match for tough winner in the end. DERBYSHIRE was unhurried through the opening half before
angling out at upper stretch and finishing with the best stride late to earn the show. STAR ISLAND KITTY trekked three wide early, rated in the second flight
and two wide at upper stretch, and lacked a rally to improve placing. TERRIFIC INDY lacked a closing bid after settling into second flight and trekking the
two path. FAT TUESDAY failed to threaten while trailing the field from outset.

RAINING stalked the early pace from a two path stance, advanced on the leaders along the backstretch, gained command approaching the final bend and
opened up a clear margin. DEDE'S TRICK travelled wide while being unhurried through the first call, closed the gap on front runner at the midway point, and
was gaining on leader at finish. HONOR GRADUATE showed reserve through the opening quarter, advanced position under urging along the backstretch,
travelled three wide at upper stretch and held on for the show. PIPPA'S PROSPECT rallied mildly to be gaining at the finish after settling into mid pack and
angling out at the eighth pole. ANGEL WHISPER faded in the crucial stages after flashing early foot and leading the field trough the opening bend. BELLAS
KITTY saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
STEPPIN SHEP hustled from start to set the pace in tandem as the inner rival, gained sole command along the backstretch, and drew off in final furlong for
a clear score. GREAT REALIZATION settled into mid pack through the opening half, advanced along the backstretch, and finished a clear second behind a
tough winner. OLE SOFTY finished evenly to secure the show to end a three wide journey. HERE'S YOUR DRINK was unhurried and trailed the field
through the opening half before passing tiring rivals in closing stages. ELIJAH GHOST failed to threaten from a back rated stance. PARABELLUM retreated
rapidly in closing portion of contest after sharing the early pace from a two path position. FIRST COPY showed early interest and came under urging before
tiring after the half.
