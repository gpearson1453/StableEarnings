REDIFINED brushed the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside, got briefly taken in hand half a mile from home off the heels of a rival, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, inched away under a drive kept
to task. LOVE TANK broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking inside
through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the
eighth pole, ran on to preserve the place honors. COWICHAN (IRE) got bumped at the start by SHAYMYNAME, who broke in a step, chased along the
inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. FOURWAY STOP brushed the near
side stall at the start when breaking inwards, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, continued just off the inside into upper stretch
and stayed on one paced to the finish. JUST A CARE (IRE) broke out a step at the start and was corrected, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths when bidding into contention before swinging three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. SHAYMYNAME broke in at the
start bumping COWICHAN, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
DEE BO was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, took the lead in the three path into upper stretch,
shook off the pacesetter into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. FORESTWOOD LANE was coaxed along on the outside, came under
stronger encouragement while three then two wide around the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch then moved further out and earned the place while
no match for the winner. QUINTARELLI was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the
advantage under urging into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. IRISH GIANT broke out and bumped with a
foe, brushed with that same rival early then dropped back, moved in at the rear, shifted from the rail to the three path under urging around the turn, came
five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SCORPION DYNASTY bumped with a rival early, was coaxed along off the pace, dropped from the two path
to the rail around the turn and came up empty. TRUEBELIEVE broke in and bumped with an opponent, bumped with another rival early, tracked the pace on
the outside, chased three wide around the turn, dropped back around the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
RADIANT GEM just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive steadily gaining through the final furlong under a right handed crop coming in slightly and was just up at the wire to prevail. SOLIB established
the front and showed the way in hand along the inside a bit reluctant to show the way early on when under restraint before settling into a comfortable rhythm
down the backstretch, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive under growing threat from a quartet, got a bit weary with seventy yards to go and was nailed on the line. ROSEMARY POTATOES forwardly placed
from the gate, got taken under a firm hold to attend the leader to the outside in the two path, steadily got eased off and tucked in behind the leader with
nine-sixteenths to go, rode the hedge through the turn and was placed to brief and light coaxing taking the inside route into upper stretch, got himself into a
blind switch a furlong out stymied in behind the leader at the eighth pole, remained down inside paused off the heels of that rival until tipping out inside the
final seventy yards to bump THATAINT TOOSHABBY out a path and a half to get up for the show honors while also forcing VINTAGE GIRL to alter out
sharply at the finish and miss for the last major share. THATAINT TOOSHABBY just off the pace three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the leader home in the two path to the outside of the aforementioned
foe, got directed inwards very lightly just inside the sixteenth marker attempting to hem ROSEMARY POTATOES in her path behind SOLIB when that rival
suddenly tipped out, got bumped solidly a path and a half outwards inside the final seventy yards and was bested for the show honors while also forcing
VINTAGE GIRL to alter sharply at the finish. VINTAGE GIRL grew detached two to three wide at the tail of the field in the early going, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch before tipping three wide straightened away, closed well into contention with a seam between
the aforementioned foe and the eventual winner, got forced to pause late as that seam closed, then got altered out sharply at the finish as ROSEMARY
POTATOES knocked THATAINT TOOSHABBY directly in front and just missed for the last major share due to the late altering. SPOOKY ROAD two to
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. There was Stewards' Inquiry into deep
stretch as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of THATAINT TOOSHABBY alleging interference against ROSEMARY POTATOES. After review it was
deemed that ROSEMARY POTATOES had interfered with THATAINT TOOSHABBY and she was disqualified from third and placed fourth for that
interference before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS was urged early then moved out over heels coming to the seven-eighths, raced outside under coaxing, moved closer late on the
backstretch, chased four wide around the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole
and proved best under strong urging. MOUNT TRAVERS was hustled to the front, set the pace on the inside while under pressure to the outside, vied along
the rail on the turn, responded well when asked near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, lost the advantage inside the furlong
marker, and was outfinished while clear for the place. CRYPTO CASH was taken in hand early, came out and bumped with a foe approaching the
seven-eighths, was rated off the pace under a tight left-rein grip, was put to urging around the nine-sixteenths, chased inside to the two path around the turn
and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. MUSICAL AMERICA pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn,
was asked near the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. DARK STORM bumped with a rival early, was rated off
the pace, went two to three wide while roused on the turn and failed to rally. PERUVIAN BOY tracked the pace on the outside, was asked with five furlongs
to run, chased three wide on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and tired. LOST IN ROME was off very slow, raced at the rear, went three to four
wide under urging around the turn and faltered.

TOPIC CHANGER got bumped at the start by SILENT RUNNING, who broke out a step, tracked that rival along the inside from the pocket patiently handled
until urged cutting the corner into upper stretch in behind that same foe, had SILENT RUNNING drift off the rail being shown a left handed crop straightened
away for home and burst through that seam rallying to take command near the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive kept to task. SILENT RUNNING
broke out a step at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, showed the way lightly rated along the inside under the close watch from the presence of
CONQUIST but facing little pressure, got joined three deep by KINGDOM ON PAWS and had the pressure intensify through the far turn and came under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole in response, took the inside route into upper stretch, drifted out slightly being shown the crop to the left side and has her
main danger burst on through the seam, got collared nearing the eighth pole and ran on to chase that rival home clear of the rest and along second best.
KINGDOM ON PAWS got bumped at the start by SENSE A GIANT breaking inwards, then got bumped by COMPROMISER soon after, raced four wide
through the opening bend before advancing down the backstretch to settle three wide just off the pace with five furlongs to go, advanced outside the top pair
through the far turn to apply pressure coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive weakening in the
late stages unable to match the top pair while besting a rival for the show honors in a duel to the line. CONQUIST coaxed from the gate, raced four then
three wide through the first turn forwardly placed, settled just off the inside in closest aim of the leader attending that rival to the outside before intensifying
the pressure to prompt that rival between foes through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch,
weakened in the late going while knocking heads to the finish with the aforementioned foe and was ultimately bested at the end for the show honors. LOZ
saved ground near the rear of the field, tipped out briefly two to three wide near the five furlong marker before tucking back inside into the far turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. COMPROMISER three then two wide through the first
turn, tracked the front two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. SENSE A GIANT broke in
at the start bumping KINGDOM ON PAWS, raced three then two wide through the first turn before chasing five then four wide down the backstretch, tucked
three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response.
OLYMPIC DREAMS coaxed from the start, raced five wide into the first turn before tucking four then three wide through that bend, chased three to four wide
down the backstretch, began to retreat and tucked to the inside with five furlongs to go, grew detached at the tail of the field and cornered just off the inside
into upper stretch well behind, faltered and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
JAKE ROCKS broke in then bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the outside, moved closer in the three path around the turn, took the lead inside the
five-sixteenths, kicked clear when asked for his best in upper stretch, extended the advantage under a strong hand-ride into the final forty yards then was
eased up while much the best. CENTAVO was bumped at the start then forced into another rival, settled on the outside, was urged four wide around the
turn, chased the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. HEADS OR TAILS bumped with a rival at the start, was well
placed just off the pace in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch while roused, chased into the final furlong under a drive and weakened while just
able to get the show. FORTY COMETS broke out and bumped hard with a foe, was urged along near the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted three
wide into the stretch then moved further out while gaining into a reasonable striking range but flattened out and just missed the show. CAJUN
COMMANDER bumped with an opponent at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under the
crop and tired. SCOTTO was backed out of the gate then reloaded, broke awkwardly and bumped hard with a foe while last to commence, raced near the
back under urging, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. NATURE BOY went to the front, showed the way while in hand, went around the
turn in the two path, was asked under heavy threat coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage shortly thereafter, dropped back into upper stretch and
capitulated. FOREST SPIRIT was bumped after the start, raced in the back half of the field under urging, went three then four wide around the turn and
failed to respond.

Footnotes
MONTEBELLO dueled from the get go with COOL LAOBAN to his outside and was joined by FULL MOON FEVER between foes six and a half furlongs
from home, shook off COOL LAOBAN with five and a half furlongs remaining and steadily began to be confronted by FULL MOON FEVER, had that rival get
on near even terms at the seven-sixteenths and came under coaxing at the three-eighths in response now dueling with that rival, swung two to three wide
for home, shook off that foe and edged away briefly to a safe lead a furlong out, dug in under late threat leg weary and lasted on the wire from a late surging
foe. PRICE DISCIPLINE chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive surging
late, but it was not enough and was ultimately staved off by a head. FULL MOON FEVER coaxed from the gate, advanced to prompt the pace midway down
the backstretch before advancing once more to duel with MONTEBELLO from the seven-sixteenths through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, got shaken off at the three-sixteenths and kept on to preserve the show honors. SON OF AN EX coaxed
from the start, raced sluggish early on growing detached at the tail of the field just off the inside, came under urging three wide at he seven-sixteenths, went
seven wide into upper stretch, drifted out under a drive straightened away for home when offering a bid, then flattened out in the late going. COLLOQUY
coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, tired and was eased home through the
final furlong. COOL LAOBAN dueled early on five then four wide with MONTEBELLO to his inside, got joined between by FULL MOON FEVER six and a
half furlong out, then got shaken off and began to faded with five and a half furlongs to run, went five wide through the far turn continuing to back away,
swung three wide for home and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
BALTHUS (IRE) was rated towards the front on the inside, shifted to the two path while asked near the five-sixteenths, rallied outside to take the lead into
upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and powered away under strong urging to prove much the best. EASTER (FR) moved in while taken
under a hold early, went two then three wide around the opening bend, was reserved outside down the backstretch, went three then four wide while roused
on the final turn, gained into upper stretch, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. DANTE'S
FIRE was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, leveled out midway down the backstretch, saved ground
under urging around the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. HARD RYE GUY was taken
under tight restraint early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the back, saved ground on the far turn, swung four wide into
upper stretch and also lacked the needed response then just missed the superfecta. HILLIARD went three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the
back, moved closer inside the five-eighths, was roused three wide on the final turn, came five wide into upper stretch, lugged in inside the furlong marker
and failed to rally. TRENDING was taken in hand early, went three wide early on the first turn, was carried four to five wide midway through that bend then
dropped back closer to the three path, tracked outside down the backstretch, was asked three wide on the final turn and came up empty. Q F SEVENTY
FIVE went to the front, raced inside early on the first turn, swerved four wide to avoid geese on the course midway through that bend then dropped back
closer to the inside, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was headed by the winner into upper stretch and gave way.
CONQUER THE WORLD leaned out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced between foes leaving the backstretch,
dropped back in the two path around the far turn, moved out significantly near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. BEAUTY AMAZED was taken in hand
while getting forward position early, started the turn in the two path, shifted three to four wide when the leader swerved out to avoid geese on the course
midway through that bend, was taken up off heels while tugging hard as the leader crossed back in front, stalked outside down the backstretch, chased in
the two path on the far turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MISS SUGAR HILL (GB) got bumped solidly at the start by QUEEN QUIST, who lunged inwards, then got carried in by that rival and conceded seven to
