Footnotes
SILENT FLUIDITY chased in the three path, was hustled four wide into the stretch, and rallied to win. FOREST HALO trailed from the four path, tipped into
the six path heading into the stretch, bid for the lead passing the eighth pole, but hung. HETTY G. tracked in the two path, was ridden three wide entering
the stretch, but finished evenly to show. MOSLER'S TOUCH set the pace two wide, was roused two wide around the far turn, but faded. KIRBY pressed
from inside but was empty entering the stretch. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN stalked in the three path but was no menace.
