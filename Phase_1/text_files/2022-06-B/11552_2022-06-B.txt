Footnotes
DESERT DOTTY well rated while saving ground to the far turn would angle out for room at the head of the lane sweeping clear in the closing yards near mid
track. THIRSTY GAL pressured the pace dueling between horses through the far turn into upper stretch digging deep inside of rivals there saving place.
SEDUCTIVE (IRE) veered in crowding rivals at the break, advanced to bid on the backside dueling three deep on the far turn extending down the lane
hanging late between horses. MIDNIGHT LEAP in tight at the break raced evenly off the pace swinging six wide in upper stretch putting in a mild bid late.
CLEARLY VISIBLE bumped at the break made the early lead pressing a narrow margin to the far turn dueling inside of rivals in upper stretch weakening
late. PEGGY O'PRADO failed to mount a credible bid. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THREE-QUARTER FRACTIONAL TIME CHANGED UPON
REVIEW.
