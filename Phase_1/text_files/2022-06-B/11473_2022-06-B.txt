Footnotes
BISCAYNE BAY never far back, closed willingly five wide into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker and edged away under right handed
urging. KIST was bumped and squeezed at the start, trailed into the turn, swung wide and closed rapidly through the stretch in the six path. FORTUNATE
GINA drifted out at the start causing a chain reaction of bumping to her outside, offered a bid along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished. CHARDON
was bumped then squeezed at the start, stalked the pace three wide, loomed boldly at the quarter pole then came up empty. HOOS TAKING CHARGE also
bumped and squeezed at the start, prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead then was used up. EASTER PRIDE bore in at the start
bumping KIST was in tight shortly after then failed to menace. HEIDI'S BACK sped to the lead along the inside soon after the start, set the pace to the
middle of the turn then faltered.
