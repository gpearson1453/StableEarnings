FAIR AND SQUARE broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch at will to win as much the best. GREAT REVELATION never far
back, rallied through deep stretch two wide and got up for second. GRAND ISLE chased his stablemate and was outfinished for second two wide.
STORMIN'UNCLEJACK never far back, finished with good courage three wide. AGNELLO'S DREAM with the second flight three wide, moved closer
entering the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. DON'T CROSS JACK vied for the lead along the rail into the stretch then weakened. ELECTION
INTEGRITY was no factor. STREET TRAFFIC was outrun. SWING STATE hopped at the start, struck a fallen rider mid turn and was never close.
PHAROAH'S SYMPATHY close up from the start, suffered and injury mid turn unseating his rider and was vanned off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
BABA LOOEY sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and won as much the
best while taken in hand late. MARVIN'S EXPRESS pressured the winner two wide for a half then was no match while well clear for second. MARCH
MAGIC was bumped hard leaving the chute then had a mild late rally inside. JUST INSPIRED bore out at the start bumping MY HOMBRE then failed to
menace. BRILLIANTBENNY had good early speed four wide then weakened in the stretch. ZAROSHA well placed, failed to respond. SPLENDID SPIRIT
was a sharp threat three wide and through after a half. ORLEANS STORM was also bumped hard leaving the chute and outrun. TANNER also bumped
hard leaving chute, was never close. MY HOMBRE was bumped at the start, ducked in leaving the chute bumping hard with rivals and was through early.

Footnotes
WISE KHOZAN unhurried early, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch under right handed urging and was along in time. UNCLEJACKOMO
stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead in upper stretch, shook clear then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner.
EXONERATED PREZ trailed for nearly a half and found his best stride late between horses in the three path. HE'S A BELIEVER went evenly. FAST CALL
pressed the early pace, rallied two wide to gain a brief lead near the quarter pole then came up empty. MASTER broke in front, set the pace two wide for
nearly a half, had speed into the stretch and weakened late. MY CLEVER BOY was through after a half. GET ALONG was no factor.

Footnotes
MUCH TIMES TWO never far back, got through along the rail, made the lead before the furlong marker and drew off under left handed urging. RUNAWAY
RUSSELL sped to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace until mid stretch then was no match for the winner but held on for second. GOING
PRIMETIME slow early, swung wide and closed rapidly in the seven path through the stretch. DANES HEART chased the pace two wide into the stretch,
drifted to the six path then went evenly. JOHNS BIG RED failed to menace. THANKSDAD had speed three wide into the stretch then gave way. GIBBY MY
CORN was outrun. BIG TIME FLIRT with the second flight inside, was through after a half. STRIKING AGAIN had brief speed four wide. THORMEISTER
chased the pace into the turn, stopped abruptly, was eased, walked to the wire and was walked off.
