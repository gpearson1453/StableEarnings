Footnotes
JETINWITHCLASS was rated outside foes in the opening quarter, advanced on the leaders three wide through the turn, was fanned four wide racing past
midstretch but produced a steady late response to prevail under firm right handed pressure. BOMBARRA GOLD angled inwards to prompt the pace outside
a rival racing into the turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. TAKING CHARGE DESI, forwardly placed along
the inside prompting the leaders to the turn, steadied while bobbling midway through the turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued with interest
to improve position between foes to the end. LUNA S was urged disputing the pace inside a rival a bit off the rail racing to the bend, shifted inside on the
turn dueling for command to upper stretch, then weakened in late stages. MAY DISCO tracked the pace between foes on the backstretch and dropped out
early.

Footnotes
EXXEL broke readily, stalked just off the leaders three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival through the turn and went clear in the
stretch under firm encouragement. SHADOWLESS was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset, proved no match for the winner in upper
stretch but proved best of the others. CITRUS BAY broke readily, angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance and continued
evenly along the rail. PURE ROCKET tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. MAGIC REVOLUTION settled
last early and failed to menace. LOCHMOOR tracked the leaders outside foes racing to the turn and came up empty nearing the lane.

Footnotes
SCHLOFMITZ was rated off the second flight flight between foes to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the second bend, swung out five
wide nearing upper stretch advancing with a sharp move to gain the advantage late, then held the challenge of WHENTHEDAWNBREAKS to the end under
strong encouragement. The latter was reserved along the inside in the opening stages, tipped out to race between foes under rating after a half to the far
turn, angled out entering the stretch to advance six wide between foes racing past midstretch and continued willingly to challenge the winner nearing the
wire. LATIN NIKKITA was rated outside foes in second flight, advanced four wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command in tandem with several
rivals but was outkicked. BLISSFUL ducked inwards while breaking slowly, was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the far turn, then angled five
wide in the stretch to gain position between foes with a belated effort. DREAMWORKER settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance four wide racing through the far turn, was fanned seven wide entering the lane and continued with a mild bid. ELLE OF THE BALL tracked the
leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening between foes nearing upper stretch, shifted out racing through
the stretch while being urged to advance but had no final kick. CAPTAIRE was urged prompting the pace outside a rival to the far turn, then weakened
between foes through late stages. OFF RAMP angled inwards gaining a position tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, came through
inside foes to challenge for command in upper stretch but came up empty midstretch. SKY HIGH SUSAN, reserved between foes in the last flight to the far
turn, never gained contention. MISS HARD KNOCKS required an equipment adjustment prior to the start, was reserved while angling to the inside racing to
the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, then altered course avoiding traffic nearing midstretch while never threatening. TWIRLING SAVI was rated
inside foes in second flight, faded conceding some position racing into the stretch, then was held up avoiding close quarters midstretch while giving way.
ASENA was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset, edged forward racing through the far turn and gave out midstretch.

Footnotes
SPYCRAFT broke readily to gain a forward placing, gradually angled inwards pursuing the pacesetter racing into the turn, then continued with a steady
response to wrest command from that foe and go clear in time under firm handling. PLANE TALK broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace into
the turn, held sway past midstretch but yielded to the winner late. MARK OF THE Z angled to the inside early, saved ground tracking behind the second
flight, then steadily gained position along the rail in late stages to just miss for the place honors. SEVEN SCENTS tracked the leaders inside foes in second
flight racing into the bend, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly while being outkicked for a share. XY SPEED was rated off the
second flight between foes into the turn and continued with interest to gain position between foes to late stages. SHIP IT RED, reserved inside foes in the
last flight racing into the turn, continued under patient handling into the bend, switched out entering the lane and continued with a belated effort four wide.
ON YOUR MARK settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, angled out five wide in the stretch and continued with a mild effort to gain some
position. CHESS MASTER tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing into the bend, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and came up
empty in the drive. MALPAIS settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned six wide entering the lane and offered no rally. HUEY ATTACK settled last to
the turn and proved no threat. JAZZY TIMES, held up off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, steadily retreated into the stretch.

Footnotes
ROYALS' LIL DIVA was urged clear of the field racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, turned back a challenge from COLOR ME LEGENDARY to
regain a clear advantage entering the lane, held sway under pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. OJITOS angled
to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to narrowly prevail for the
place honors late. BAILOUT KELA tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight racing to the turn, shifted in racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to just miss for second. COLOR ME LEGENDARY stumbled just after the start, switched outside the pacesetter in the opening
furlong, was urged to press that rival racing into the turn, drifted out entering upper stretch and soon gave way. TAHKODHA KNIGHT tracked off the second
flight between foes racing into the turn but offered no rally. JACKS WILLIE, caught four wide in early stages prompted to a position in second flight racing to
the turn, steadily faded nearing upper stretch. SHINBORO proved no factor.

Footnotes
SHE CAN'T SING tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, tipped three wide entering the far turn advancing on the leaders,
moved to wrest command nearing upper stretch, then was roused through the last furlong to go clear. AMALFI PRINCESS tracked the leaders inside the
eventual winner as part of the second flight in the opening half, advanced in tandem with that rival into the far turn, tipped out entering upper stretch and
continued willingly pursuing the winner to the end while proving only second best. JOY OF PAINTING angled to the inside in early stages dropping off the
second flight, saved ground on the far turn gaining position nearing upper stretch, shifted out three wide entering the lane and continued to make mild
progress to the end while gaining a share. MEDALLA MATCH broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled for
command inside rivals with a grudging effort to midstretch but weakened late. BOW BOW GIRL, reserved a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch,
angled to the inside entering the far turn, then tipped out in late stages while continuing with an effort to improve position to the end. LADY HIDEAWAY
tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, made some brief progress three wide nearing upper stretch but flattened out while shifting
inwards in the closing stages. SARANYA tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn. BEACH FLOWER,
forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, gave way racing into the far turn. PRANCE settled last early and proved no threat. NICENO
WAS SCRATCHED AFTER THE POST PARADE AFTER DISLODGING HER RIDER AND RUNNING LOOSE ON THE BACKSTRETCH.

Footnotes
MR DUMAS, reserved while being guided to the inside to track off the second flight racing into the first turn, steadily gained position along the rail racing into
the far turn, tipped outside the pacesetter to challenge for command racing into upper stretch and took charge with a sharp kick to go clear under firm
encouragement. AGENT PETER GRAVES sprinted clear of the field while angling to the rail entering the first turn, held sway on a narrow margin to the far
turn, repelled a rival's challenge to maintain the advantage into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. DYN O MITE tracked
outside foes in second flight in the opening half, steadily gained striking position racing three deep into the far turn but lacked the needed final kick while
prevailing for a share. TUT'S REVENGE was rated off the second flight between foes, angled to the inside racing into the far turn and continued inside foes
to gain some position late. DRAMA CHORUS forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter under light rating in the opening stages, moved to press the issue in a
brief bid racing through the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch. SPANISH KINGDOM, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, switched outside
foes while being prompted to advance entering the far turn, swung four wide nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. ROCHAMBEAU tracked the pace
between foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn and faded in that path in the drive. STREET READY, caught in
tight quarters along the inside nearing the first turn, altered course racing into that bend and never gained contention. MY INDY angled inwards to track off
the first flight along the inside in the opening half, then faded between foes into the lane. GOALIE, reserved between foes to the backstretch, offered no
rally. BELLAMYS ROAN, shuffled back avoiding tight quarters at the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
STITCHED, forwardly placed three wide in the opening half attending the pace under light rating, pressed the issue racing through the far turn, kicked clear
in upper stretch and held sway through the lane under firm encouragement. BENS MALICE was settled outside foes in the last flight racing three, then four
deep to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught five wide racing through the far turn to upper stretch and proved best of the others.
HEAVEN STREET, carried out a bit racing into the first turn, was rated outside rivals in second flight, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn to
upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. DOWAGIAC CHIEF, caught in tight quarters between foes when momentarily impeded by TONKA WARRIOR
while shifting into the path of XAVEY DAVE racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight to the far turn, then continued with interest to split rivals
while gaining some position late. XAVEY DAVE, carried out by DOWAGIAC CHIEF into the path of HEAVEN STREET racing into the first turn, was rated off
the second flight to the far turn, continued four wide between foes through the far turn into the lane and finished evenly. TONKA WARRIOR was rated inside
foes in the opening stages, drifted out a bit into to the first turn momentarily impeding several rivals, was righted to track the leaders inside foes in second
flight racing into the far turn, was caught in tight quarters between foes racing into the stretch and lacked the needed late response. MAGOO, forwardly
placed between rivals in the opening half, lodged a brief bid racing through the far turn to strike the front but came up empty in the drive. SWITZER, shuffled
back avoiding tight quarters at the start, never gained contention. NEXT JOURNEY was urged to the lead along the inside from the outset, set the pace on a
narrow margin to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. CHROME KING, reserved inside foes in the lastb flight to the backstretch, emptied out racing
into the far turn.

Footnotes
SPEEDY ENOUGH was urged between foes from the outset disputing the lead, shifted to the inside entering the turn dueling for command inside a rival,
shook clear in upper stretch and kicked away under firm hand urging. OUTWORKTHEOKIEGIRL joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed
the issue outside the eventual winner into the turn but proved no match while best of the others. TEMPORARILY tracked the leaders inside foes in the last
flight racing to the turn, exchanged some light contact with MILLIGANMIKEANDME nearing the bend, saved ground on the turn into upper stretch and
continued well enough to earn a share. FULL SPEED ASTERN was settled outside foes in the last flight early, was caught three deep, then four wide racing
through the turn and faded into the lane. CREDIT CARD FRAUD flashed brief pace inside the top pair in the opening stages but gave way racing into the
turn. MILLIGANMIKEANDME settled between foes in the last flight, was brushed, then was shuffled back racing into the turn and lacked a rally.
PRICELESS MIRACLE WAS SCRATCHED AT THE GATE ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN.
