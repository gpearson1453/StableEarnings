Footnotes
MYBESTISYETTOCOME stalked the pace racing along the inside, slipped through nearing the quarter pole to join the leaders, dueled into deep stretch and
gradually drew clear late. COWBOY CAUSEWAY was allowed to settle in stride, rallied four wide-the final quarter and finished strongly for the place. BET
THE HOUSE dueld for the lead from along the outside into the stretch and gave way grudgingly late. SMILING PATRICK broke out to bump Chulkit at the
start, then rushed up to dispute the early pace from along the inside, was taken in hand slightly while bearing out approaching the quarter pole and tired.
CHUKIT was bumped at the start, then dropped back and showed little while racing three-widde.

COASTAL RUN sprinted clear early, saved ground setting the pace in hand and won with something left. SHARP CURVE saved ground stalking the pace,
angled out for the drive and was gaining slightly late. CAMDEN HIGH was allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide the final quarter and finished in a mild
rally. EASY DOES IT was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten while passing tiring rivals. SARA'S FINALE was forwardly
placed early and tired. LA POPIS gave way after showing brief speed.

Footnotes
ALOHA BREEZE set the pace from along the outside, came in slightly nearing the half mile pole, quickly opened clear and won as the rider pleased.
STICKINITTOTHEMAN broke in to brush with Turn of Fortune, then was allowed to settle in stride while saving ground, continued to find room during the
drive and finished strongly. I'M BETH DUTTON broke out to bump with California Halo, then prompted the pace from along the inside, steadied nearing the
half mile pole while coming out slightly, continued to prompt the issue into the stretch and weakened late. CHIPPEWA checked from between horses while
in tight nearing the half mile pole, then was prominently placed and finished willingly. SHELBY GOLD failed to seriously threaten while racing five-wide.
LUTE'S DIAMOND was not a factor while saving ground. CALIFORNIA HALO was bumped at the start and bobbled, then was forwardly placed early and
tired. FLY PATTI FLY was pinched back at the start and failed to recover. TURN OF FORTUNE was brushed at the start, then dropped back and was
outrun. The trainer of Chippewa lodged an objection against the winner, but after viewing the films, the stewards made no change in the order of finish.

FREESTONE set the pressured pace while racing slightly removed from the rail, drifted out slightly nearing the stretch and was all out to prevail narrowly.
NATIONHEART vied for the lead from along the outside, dropped back slightly entering the stretch, then responded to pressure to come again late and just
miss. WARRIORS HERO was unhurried early, rallied 6-wide into the stretch and finished fast. MOSQUITO FLEET saved ground stalking the pace, slipped
through to offer a bold bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole and then flattened out during the drive. KEEP ON DANZING was forwardly placed early, got out
on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
EARS TO US was off a step slow, then was allowed to settle in stride, made a bold bid while 5-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead entering the
stretch and then was all out to prevail narrowly. HICKORY WIND never far back while saving ground, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly
to just miss. BRANNIGAN saved ground while being unhurried, moved forward on the turn, angled out for room nearing the eighth pole and finished full of
run. BOOK SMART was forwardly placed from the start racing between horses and finished in a mild rally. GYPSY GUN saved ground setting the pressured
pace to the stretch and tired. ABRIERWIN was allowed to settle in mid pack, but lacked a rally. MYSTIC MAG lacked early speed and passed tiring rivals
late from along the inside. AIN'T NO SISSY was prominent early while racing four-wide and tired. DANNY ZUKO was forwardly placed early while racing
three-wide and gave way.

COLLECTING STARS saved ground setting the pace in hand, drew clear when ready and was ridden out to increase her advantage. TOP HAT HIGH
JINKS prompted the pace from along the outside, was no match for the winner, but continued on well for the place. WHATA FLIRT was unhurried early,
moved up nearing the quarter pole to split rivals and finished in a mild rally. GOLD SUPPLY saved ground but lacked a response when needed.
TEASPOON OF PEPPER broke in and bobbled at the start and failed to menace after that. LAKER JET bobbled at the start and failed to threaten. DANIEL
THE DREAMER raced three-wide on the turn and gave way after a half mile.

QUEEN BREEZY saved ground stalking the pace, waited for room nearing the quarter pole, slipped though approaching the stretch, seized the lead and
quickly drew clear. SLEEPY SUE prompted the pace from along the outside, was unable to stay with the winner during the drive, but held on well for the
place. RED NOON RISING was allowed to settle in stride while racing along the inside, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. LADY
O'PRADO forced the issue while racing three-wide and lacked a late response. JUDICIAL set the pace from along the inside, drifted out slightly leaving the
quarter pole and tired. CLOCHARD STREET was not a factor while racing four-wide.

Footnotes
FEATHER INTHE WIND set the paced racing slightly off the rail, opened clear nearing the stretch, came in slightly late and was fully extended to just last.
LOVE THAT KID unhurried early, rallied along the inside into the stretch, altered course to the outside inside the sixteenth pole and finished fast to just miss.
DARK N' HANDSOME prompted the pace to the stretch from along the outside, but lacked the needed late response. FANTASTIC DREAM hopped in the
air at the start, then dropped back early, came six-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. C JAXON was prominently place while racing
three-wide, but lacked a rally. MOON CIRCUMFERENCE bobbled at the start and then failed to threaten. PERFECT BLEND raced three-wide and failed to
menace. INDIAN RULE settled in the middle of the pace early and gave way entering the stretch. The trainer of Love That Kid lodged an objection against
the winner, but after viewing the films, the stewards made no change in the order of finish.
