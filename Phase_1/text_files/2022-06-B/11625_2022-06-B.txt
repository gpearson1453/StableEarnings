Footnotes
SENECA ROCKS settled just off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn, drifted five
wide into the stretch but dueled for the lead a sixteenth away and edged clear late. TIZ A COUNTRY GIRL stalked the early pace two deep, took the nod
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge off the rail on the far turn, was met mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded later yards. AIM'S JUBILEE
settled off the rail the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and dueled through the stretch for third. LOVE
TO ZOOM saved ground close to the pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran off the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth
pole. KATALIMA raced off the early pace about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. LONG LEGS LOUISE was never a
factor. CEDAR'S WISH set the early pace inside, was met leaving the seven sixteenths pole and gave close chase from that point, ran at the rail on the far
turn and weakened in the lane.

BOCA BIRDIE raced well back off the rail on the opening turn, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn five and six wide and
dug in the final furlong to get up late strides. I B NASTY saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide
midway on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in the final strides. WHOSE THAT LADY settled in the three path the first turn,
bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. MOJO MATTERS stalked off the rail the first turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened stride later yards. NAJWA raced with the pace through the
front stretch then stalked into the first turn, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took a slim brief lead toward the five sixteenths, was caught
midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. LOVETHEONEYOUGOT saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled to the five path leaving the turn and showed little in the lane. UNTAMED LADY raced with the pace
through the front stretch then showed the way into the first turn, dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod toward the five sixteenths and
weakened at the rail on the far turn. C V'S CAMPFIRE was not a factor.

dug in under steady encouragement to take the nod under the wire. PRINCESS HALO saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and ran
at the rail on the far turn, dueled for the lead toward mid-stretch, drew briefly clear later yards but was caught under the wire. SHOOFLY PIE was bumped
and pinched back at the start and raced well back in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the
far turn, angled out in the upper stretch and finished evenly. DIXIE YODELER stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. TIMETOGETUP ducked in to make contact with Shoofly Pie leaving the gate then
stalked from the three path the first turn, took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear past the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail,
was caught approaching mid-stretch and weakened. HOOK THE CHAIN raced off the pace two deep on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven

LACE REVOLUTION raced well back from early contention, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in leaving the
eighth pole and took the lead in the final stride. ASUE angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, ran at the rail
on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides. SPUNKY ZOEY rounded the first turn about the four
path and stalked into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn and remained a factor to the finish. ENJOY
SUMMER bobbled at the break, rated close inside and gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, then flattened later
yards. GHOSTLY NIGHT settled just off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. GOLDEN GLOW rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole but weakened near the rail on the far turn. CAN'T FIGURE saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. MAGNOLIA

Footnotes
GIGGING settled back off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn, dug in for
the lead later yards and edged clear toward the wire. COMBINATION settled back in the three path the first turn, started a bid with the winner leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path, left the turn four wide and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch, while taking
over second in later yards. NASHVEGAS stalked the earlier pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms in the three
path of the far turn then flattened stride late stretch. FIBER AND EMILY stalked two deep then took the lead into the backstretch, dueled at even terms and
put Black Candy away toward the quarter pole, contested the rail on the far turn then flattened later yards. TRINGALE rounded the first turn about the four
path, left the turn outside and showed little response. CAPE LOOKOUT was not a factor. BLACK CANDY set the early pace inside, was met into the
backstretch and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, but gave way at the rail into the far turn.

Footnotes
CHEESE LOUISE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure into the far turn and contested the edge nearest the rail, then dug in determinedly to
out-game the stretch effort of CRUZ IN THE CASTLE, who stalked off the rail, challenged into the far turn and contested even terms two deep through the
turn, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. SHE FIGURES rounded the opening turn about the three path and raced well off the pace into the
backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, left the far turn five wide and ran evenly in the stretch. LIL SWEETHEART stalked in the four path the first
turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. DIXIE SUNRISE settled back inside on the
first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five and six paths and passed rivals outside. LADY MADISON
came through the first turn in the four path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn still about the four path then weakened.
CASTLE OF CAYLEE saved ground. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY rated close inside the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but
weakened off the rail on the far turn.
