LADY COMMISH was unhurried early, rallied along the inside, slipped through late and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away.
YOUONLYLIVETWICE dueled for the lead from along the inside from the outset, drifted slightly off the rail entering the stretch, could not resist the winner
late, but continued on for the place in a game try. PERCY'S SIS vied for the lead from the beginning while racing two-wide, wasn't quite good enough, but
held on for the show. GOLD COAST GIRL was five-wide on the turn and six-wide entering the stretch racing outside of Coastal Queen and finished willingly.
COASTAL QUEEN raced four-wide on the turn and five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MIA CASA prompted the early pace while three-wide
and tired.

finished strongly for the place. FULLY COMPLIANT was unhurried early, rallied along the inside on the turn, angled out for the drive and was gaining late.
ONEFINEDAY sprinted to a clear lead shortly after the start, responded when challenged by the winner, then drifted out and steadied off that one's heels
inside the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. CARDS N COFFEE was forwardly placed while racing along the inside, found room during the
drive but lacked the needed response. CADILLAC MARGARITA gave way after showing brief speed while four-wide.

MAYBE I WILL was prominent for the start while racing three-wide, was carried further out nearing the three-sixteenths pole when Ima Happy Cat drifted
out, dueled for the lead from that point and proved narrowly best in a prolonged drive. BLAZINGBELLABLU stalked the leaders from along the inside,
slipped through nearing the three-sixteenths pole, disputed the issue from that point and just missed in a tough decision. DAFFODIL SWEET prompted the
pace while racing two-wide, was carried out nearing the three-sixteenths pole by Ima Happy Cat, vied for the lead from that point to deep stretch, wasn't
quite good enough but continued on gamely to the wire. DONTKISSNTELL settled in stride while racing two-wide, angled out for the drive and gained her
best stride too latte. IMA HAPPY CAT saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. MS LYNN was
not a factor while racing along the inside. BRILLIANT BIRD failed to threaten while racing three-wide.

stalking the pace, angled out four-wide to launch his bid, could not reach the winner, but finished strongly for the place. FIVE STAR GENERAL was allowed
to settle in stride while racing two-wide, slipped through nearing the stretch and was gaining late. SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ was unhurried early, rallied four-wide
into the stretch, steadied briefly in traffic nearing the eighth pole and was gaining late when clear. FANTASTIC DAY dropped back early, rallied 5-wide into
the stretch and gained his best stride too late. SPITTIN IMAGE settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. WINDRIBBON
well place early while racing along the inside, checked nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly when clear.. TORPEDO AWAY saved ground while
being unhurried, angled out for the drive, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole lacking room and was unable to recover. ANYPORTINASTORM failed to
threaten while racing four-wide. COASTAL JAZZ raced closed to the winner for a half mile and tired.

Footnotes
LIL' MISS MISCHIEF sprinted to a clear lead at once, settled into the stretch with a long lead and then was fully extended to just last. SHE SAID MY WAY
was unhurried early, rallied five-wide the final quarter mile and finished fast to just miss. ALY'S NATION was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied along the
inside into the stretch and finished strongly. BARSINTHECAR lacked early speed, came four-wide into the stretch and finished full of run.
TALKINGNONSTOP was not a factor while saving ground. ARE YOU FROM DIXIE hopped in the air at the start, then moved up along the inside to chase
the winner to the stretch and tired.
