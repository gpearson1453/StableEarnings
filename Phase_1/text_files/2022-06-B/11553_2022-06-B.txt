Footnotes
QUEEN OF LOVE attended to the early pace, advanced into a stalking position along the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter nearing the
quarter-pole, wore down ROSEBUD RYDE in upper stretch and drew away in the final sixteenth. CYCLONE SLEW settled off of the early pace, gained
ground nearing the half-mile pole, was outrun through the second turn and into the drive and was no match for the winner in the stretch run but kept on in
the final sixteenth to secure second. ROSEBUD RYDE stumbled slightly leaving the break and was hustled to the early lead, set the pace through the
backstretch run, was confronted by the winner nearing the quarter marker, met that bid to the top of the stretch, gave way in the final stages and was
passed late for second. DARK INTENT stalked the pace from a three wide path, was outrun on the second turn and tired in the drive. KID IN THE FOREST
settled just off the pace, advanced on the backstretch run, lost contact on the far turn and gave out in the late stages.

Footnotes
CLAIM OF PASSION prompted the early pace from a three wide path, overtook the tiring pacesetter leaving the three-furlong marker, was headed by
SACRED RIDER nearing the quarter pole, dueled with that game rival through the stretch and determinedly dug in in the final stages to prevail. SACRED
RIDER stumbled at the start, recovered to take a tracking position while four wide on the first turn, maintained course through the backstretch run, was
roused leaving the three-furlong marker, engaged with CLAIM OF PASSION nearing the quarter marker, dueled with that foe through the stretch run and
was gamely bested in the end, while holding safely for second. PREMIUM FOREST settled just off of the early pace, advanced on the backstretch run to
stalk the fractions to the second turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked by the top pair in the drive but was well clear for third. POUR
ON THE COLE stalked the pace from a ground saving position, gained ground nearing the half-mile marker, was in tight behind the tiring pacesetter midway
through the second turn and could not muster a late rally. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE was hustled to the early lead, set solid fractions while prompted by the
winner, dropped back on the second turn, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under his own power.

PHANTOM INDIAN broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, was kept to task
through the lane and was hand urged under the wire. EXQUISITE LEGACY was off a step slowly and chased the leading pair to the turn, saved ground to
the top of the lane, was no match for the winner in the drive but rallied for second in the final sixteenth. AIR FORCE WOMAN kept attendance to the quick
early pace, lost ground to the winner on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages.

SAFE COMBINATION was forwardly placed to the first turn, tracked the solid pace from a three wide path, advanced nearing the quarter marker to confront
the pacesetter, battled with CANDYBOX to the top of the lane, shook free of that rival in mid-stretch and drew clear in the end. CANDYBOX was sent
leaving the break, set solid fractions while tracked by the winner into the second turn, was confronted by SAFE COMBINATION nearing the quarter-marker,
met that bid and battled with that foe to the furlong marker but relented in the final stages and held safely for second. SUBITO SLEW was off slowly and
showed no early speed, was roused along the second turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run and challenged the runner-up for second in the end
while clear for third. FRISCO KID settled just off of the early pace, kept a two wide path into the second turn, came between runners nearing the
quarter-marker and could not mount a late rally. THE CALABRESE KID was not far back in the early stages while allowed to settle, saved all of the ground
to the second turn and did not have the needed late response. THE LONNA RANGER came five wide along the first turn while stalking the pace, ran outside
of rivals through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and gave out in the drive. MR. WILLPOWER stalked the solid pace from a four wide
path on the first turn, lost ground along the backstretch run, maintained position along the second turn while four deep, dropped back in upper stretch and
faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS showed good early speed while disputing the pace, inched away to extend the lead along the turn, was kept to task and drifted
out under left-handed encouragement in the final stages but was clear in the end. REFI NOW tracked the solid pace, came three wide on the turn, was
bumped by HYPERSONIC midway through the turn, was outkicked by the winner in the drive but held safely for second. HYPERSONIC chased the pace,
drifted out a bit on the turn and bumped with REFI NOW midway through the bend, gained a bit of ground in upper stretch but lacked a final rally in the drive.
GENTLEMAN'S SECRET stumbled sharply at the start, recovered to chase the pace to the turn, improved position nearing the quarter-marker, could not
sustain that run in upper stretch and did not offer a late bid. AGENT ZERO lacked early speed, trailed through the turn and was not a factor. DUMB LUCK
was hustled to be forwardly placed early on, dropped back on the turn and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HAKUNUI broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions while rating kindly through the backstretch run, extended the lead in upper stretch
and prevailed in a drive in the end. DANNY MICHAEL tracked the pace while saving ground, advanced in upper stretch, was outkicked by the winner in the
final stages but was best of the rest. SLIGHT APPROVAL showed early speed and attended to the pace, advanced on the backstretch run, could not match
strides in upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages while clear of the rest for third. STRAUS'S PLACE settled just off of the early pace, lost
ground on the second turn, re-rallied in upper stretch but could not muster a final response in the drive. FROMAJACKTOAKING was forwardly placed into
the first turn, came four wide into the backstretch run and maintained that path into the far turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and gave way late.
TAM'S TIME settled off of the pace, saved ground while unhurried through the backstretch run, lost contact along the second turn and passed tiring rivals in
the stretch run. THEULTIMATEPRAISE bobbled a bit at the start and was away slowly, came three wide while settling off of the pace on the first turn,
improved position while three deep on the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. NORWESTER was away a bit slowly,
raced in the second flight while four wide on the first turn, raced outside of rivals on the backstretch run, came five wide into the second turn and lacked a
late response.

HONOS MAN was unhurried early on, settled in a three wide path through the backstretch run, was roused along the second turn, mounted a three wide bid
into the stretch run, overtook RESPECT THE HUSTLE nearing the furlong marker and charged to the wire with a strong late run. RESPECT THE HUSTLE
settled off of the early quick pace while leading the second flight, confronted EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER nearing the quarter marker, took the lead into the
stretch run, could not hold off HONOS MAN in the drive and was outkicked while finishing best of the rest. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER was sent after an alert
beginning, set quick fractions while on a clear lead through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter-marker and ceded the lead into the drive
but kept on to be well clear of the rest for third. WINE AND WHISKY settled just off of the pace, shifted out into the backstretch run and carried out
NOWHERE MAN approaching the five-furlong marker, came within aim nearing the eighth pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.
NOWHERE MAN was unhurried in the early going while not far off of the pace, was carried out by WINE AND WHISKY leaving the first turn and five wide
through the backstretch run and into the far turn, gained ground from a four wide path nearing the quarter marker but could not sustain that run and could
not threaten in the late going.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY JULIE vied for the early lead with several rivals and emerged to set the quick early pace, extended the lead along the turn, was all out inside
of the final furlong, was confronted by CITY GLITTER in deep stretch and determinedly dug in for the win. CITY GLITTER vied for the early lead and tracked
PERFECTLY JULIE to the turn, lost a bit of ground to that rival nearing the quarter marker, closed with good interest in the lane, confronted the winner in
deep stretch but could not get by and just missed for the win, while holding for second. SMILING THUNDER was shuffled at the start and was away slowly,
lacked early speed while chasing the field into the turn, improved position in upper stretch, rallied through traffic in the final furlong, challenged the top pair in
the end and was clear for third. LION'S LAIR was hustled to show early speed, chased the pace while four wide to the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and
was outkicked in the drive. LIGHT UP was asked for early speed while vying for the early lead, tracked the pace through the turn, lost ground in upper
stretch and did not mount a late rally. MISS ARROWHEAD chased the early pace, improved position on the turn, ran evenly to the stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. CAROLYN'S WAY chased the pace from toward the rear and was unable to make an impact. CLEAR WIN showed early speed to the turn,
lost position nearing the quarter marker and faded in the stretch.
