Footnotes
BROKEN FINGER was up close to the early pace while three wide on the first turn, maintained a stalking trip to the second turn, overtook DI LAURIAN in
mid-stretch and was kept to task in the end to win in a drive. TWIRLING DERBY tracked the pace while saving all of the ground, lost ground nearing the
quarter marker, was able to re-rally in mid-stretch but was outfinished by the winner while holding safely for second. SUGAR BEETS was never far back in
the early stages, went two then three wide along the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch and did not mount a late rally. DI LAURIAN was hustled leaving
the break and set the pace while being prompted by BROKEN FINGER, maintained a narrow edge over the winner through the second turn, was overtaken
in nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the late going. RUNAWAY KRISTIN settled just off of the early pace, went three deep along the first turn,
stayed outside of rivals through the backstretch run, came three then four wide approaching the quarter marker and was not able to threaten in the final
stages.

Footnotes
GALOPIN GOURMET stumbled a bit leaving the break, was forwardly placed to the turn while outside of rivals, advanced on the turn to vie for the lead
nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive, felt late pressure from the runner-up and gamely held on to prevail. AWESOME DUDE was away
a bit slowly and stalked the pace to the turn, traveled just behind the leading trio approaching the quarter pole, shifted out nearing the furlong marker, closed
well in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. BOBBY'S ALIBI lacked early speed, chased the field along the turn, swung out
for the drive and rallied in the lane to secure third. GREAT STORY broke alertly and was hustled to the early lead, contested the pace through the turn,
could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. UNION WAVE contested the pace with GREAT STORY to the
turn, kept up that pace duel through the turn, was able to stay on into mid-stretch and tired in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
ROYAL JESTER broke alertly, pressed the quick early pace to the turn, advanced to duel with JAZZ CITY to the quarter marker, put that rival away in upper
stretch, was kept to task through the lane and was geared down in the final stages. ONE BROAD STREET chased the quick pace behind the dueling
pacesetters, was no match for the winner in the drive, brushed with JAZZ CITY nearing the sixteenth-marker and rallied on well to be second best in the
end. JAZZ CITY broke in at the start, was hustled to contest the quick early pace, kept up quick fractions while dueling with the winner to the quarter marker,
could not sustain that run in upper stretch, brushed with ONE BROAD STREET nearing the sixteenth-marker and weakened in the final stages, while well
clear for third. GALLO DEL CIELO had an awkward start and was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn and was not a factor.

CLEM LABINE settled off of the early speed, advanced outside of foes approaching the quarter marker, continued that rally in upper stretch, overtook the
pacesetter inside of the furlong marker and held determinedly in the end to prevail. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD tracked the pace, advanced nearing the quarter
marker, continued that bid into upper stretch, vied for the lead while between rivals inside of the furlong marker but was bested by CLEM LABINE in the end
and held safely for second. PAPAPIFAS broke alertly and was hustled to the front, set the pace through the turn, came under pressure in mid-stretch and
was overtaken by the winner but stayed on well in the end to be an easy third. UNION DANCE stalked the pace, gained ground from a three wide path
nearing the quarter-marker, could not sustain that run into the drive and lacked a late rally. DARNQUICK stumbled sharply leaving the start and lost the
rider. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND RULED THAT DARNQUICK CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES AT THE BREAK
AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
BORN TO REIGN was forwardly placed while three wide into the first turn, took over the lead into the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter
marker and repelled the challenge from GRIGORO, was headed by FABRIANA nearing the furlong marker, came on in the drive while dueling that game foe
and determinedly prevailed. FABRIANA settled just off of the early pace, advanced on the backstretch run, made a three wide bid on the second turn,
engaged with BORN TO REIGN in upper stretch, dueled with the winner to the line and was gamely bested, while well clear of the rest. GRIGORO was four
wide while close to the early pace on the first turn, advanced under a snug hold on the backstretch run, vied for the lead nearing the quarter pole, was
outrun in upper stretch and could not mount a final bid in the stretch. GRAZEN HONOR went to the front leaving the start, was prompted by BORN TO
REIGN through the first turn, ceded the lead to the rival into the backstretch run, could not match strides on the second turn and faded in the drive.
SMOKINHOTREDHEAD came in tight into the first turn, clipped heels with FABRIANA and lost the rider leaving the seven-eighths marker. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FIRST TURN AND RULED THAT SMOKINHOTREDHEAD CAUSED HER OWN
ISSUES AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD WAS VANNED OFF AS A
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.

Footnotes
AS AMATTER OF FACT found a tracking position just off of HIGHLAND GHOST in the early stages, kept attendance to that foe through the turn, steadily
gained inside of the final furlong, made a late push inside of the sixteenth-marker to collar HIGHLAND GHOST and edged away in the end. HIGHLAND
GHOST broke alertly and sped to an early lead, set solid fractions while tracked by the winner, was able to extend the lead a bit in upper stretch, was all out
and could not hold off AS AMATTER OF FACT inside of the sixteenth-marker and was overtaken while well clear of the rest for second.
MEETMEATTHECLUB chased the solid pace from a two wide path, lacked a late kick in the stretch run but was clear for third in the end. MASHHAD FLATS
was forwardly placed to the turn, lost ground while four wide approaching the quarter marker, the rider lost his crop approaching the furlong marker, and
weakened in the final stages. UNTO THEE stumbled leaving the break and was off slowly, chased the pace from the rear through the turn and tired in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
JANERO ROSE was bumped at the start by PT RANGER and forced inward into the path of SUGAR ON TOP, tracked inside that one to the turn for home,
slipped through a hole created when GOLD RUSH GAL drifted out a bit on the final turn, wore down PT RANGER in the final furlong and drew off under a
brisk hand ride. P T RANGER stumbled at the break, making contact with JANERO ROSE, then recovered quickly and sped to the early lead, set the pace
to the stretch where she was challenged by JANERO ROSE, matched strides briefly but was unable to fend off the challenge and was second best. GOLD
RUSH GAL was within striking distance early on, got close to the leader on the turn while running in the three-path, drifted out a bit coming out of the turn,
leaving a hole for JANERO ROSE, then had no rally in the final stages. SUGAR ON TOP off a step slow, was forced to alter course and veer inward when
JANERO ROSE took her path, fell well behind leaving the break and was never a factor.
