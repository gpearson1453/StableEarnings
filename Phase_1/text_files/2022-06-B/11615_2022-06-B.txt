Footnotes
CURLIN LANE set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from a pair of outer foes down the backstretch, was roused to sustain command as
FOTHERINGAY menaced around the far turn, but shook clear of that rival in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. FOTHERINGAY stalked
along the inside, but pulled against restraint in the early part of the first turn, steadied when running up the leader's heels at the seven furlong pole,
continued to tug in the bit entering the backstretch before settling at the five furlong pole, tipped outside of the leader into the far turn to take aim on that foe
from between horses, ranged up to bid turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch, and remained well clear of show. COMMAND CENTRAL tracked
three wide, tugged around the first turn to press the down the backstretch, but came under a drive at the three furlong pole before getting outmoved by an
inner rival turning for home, then failed to keep pace with the top pair in upper stretch, and was best of the rest. CONSIDER was last away and slow into
stride, trailed the field in the four to five paths around the turns, drifted inwardly entering the lane before shifting back out in upper stretch, and reached an
inner rival for a minor share at the wire. STAVANGER broke a beat slowly, laid off of the pace in the three path, inched closer into the far turn before
chasing the top trio from the four path around that bend, but faded entering the lane, lugged inwardly in midstretch, and lost fourth at the wire. SUPER
BROTHER raced forwardly placed two wide and between horses, pressed among foes down the backstretch, but weakened approaching the three furlong
pole, then was eased up in the final sixteenth before walking off.

Footnotes
LADY MERCEDES broke sharply, allowed outer rivals to go on in order to stalk along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair approaching the far turn, took
aim turning for home before shooting past those foes entering the lane, swiftly kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway from an rallying rival late.
MEJTHAAM began to move about just before the gates sprung, then hopped at the start, saved ground while tracking in midpack, came under a drive
turning for home while chasing behind the leading trio, tipped three wide in upper stretch after LADY MERCEDES took charge, then stayed on well in hopes
of bidding outside of that foe in the late stages, but ran out of ground. CHOPIN DRIVE pressed the pace two wide, bid approaching the lane as an outer
LADY MERCEDES loomed a danger, but was quickly outkicked by that rival entering the stretch, then tired in midstretch before losing place entering the
final sixteenth. AWESOME ALLY VEE leaned a bit inwardly while breaking slowly, trailed in the four to three paths around the first turn, came under a stern
drive into the far turn, and sustained stride through the lane while failing to threaten the leaders. MOUDARI set the pace along the inside, but proved no
match for a pair of outer bidding foes entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. MATLE VALLEY briefly chased the leaders into the first turn, but
faded at the seven furlong pole, was done early, and showed little.

Footnotes
WORLD OF WONDER set a pressured pace along the inside, clung to an advantage from a pair of bidding rivals around the turn, disposed of those
challengers entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, and held sway through the final furlong. EARLEY ROSE broke a step slowly before being in a bit
of tight quarters between horses at the start, settled off of the pace, inched closer into the turn to track the leading trio from the four path, ranged up to bid
for place in upper stretch after WORLD OF WONDER kicked clear, and stayed on to prove second best. IPSUM GRATUS broke half a bit slowly as an inner
rival crossed across her path, stalked along the inside, boldly slipped through tight quarters between the leaders two wide to bid at the half mile pole, vied
among the leading trio while under urging around the bend, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart entering the lane, and lost place at the furlong
grounds. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN trailed in the five path, improved turning for home, but failed to threaten through the final furlong. BACKYARD HEN
tracked two wide and between horses, got keen among foes leaving the chute, backed out soon after, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, but
lacked a bid before tiring. BEACH KITTEN hopped a bit before breaking outwardly while off a bit slowly and last away, stalked three wide, then four wide at
the half mile pole before vying outside of the leading pair around the turn, but was brushed between horses while weakening approaching the three furlong
pole. SCENIC VIEW broke a bit outwardly at the start, vied for the lead outside of the eventual leader while a path away from that rival, but yielded three
wide and between horses into the turn before fading around the bend.

Footnotes
DESIGNER READY stalked along the inside around all turns, tipped outside of the early pace setter entering the lane after an outer GOOD MEASURE
gained an advantage, bid inside of that one in upper stretch before gaining an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, and kicked clear at the furlong
grounds. GOOD MEASURE laid at the rear along the inside early on, checked behind DESIGNER READY entering the lane for the first time before tipping
outside of that foe, tugged and got rank while tracking between horses at the furlong grounds, settled into the second turn, tipped three wide entering the
backstretch, ranged up around the far turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, reached the lead while drifting to the four path entering the lane, but was
outkicked by an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, and proved second best. HIGH FASHION pressed two wide, but was outmoved by an outer rival
entering the backstretch, tracked two wide thereafter, then swung out to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on to reclaim a minor share. MALIBU
MARLEE tracked three wide, tugged exiting the second turn to vie for the lead outside of THREE TIPSY CHIX down the backstretch, but yielded between
horses turning for home. THREE TIPSY CHIX set the pace along the inside, was confronted by MALIB MARLEE at the five furlong pole, repelled that foe
before being headed by an outer bidding GOOD MEASURE at the quarter pole, and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WELL SPENT switched outside of rivals after being last away, surpassed inner foes down the backstretch to engage the leader two wide into the turn, vied
turning for home before asserting dominance on others entering the lane, and drew off under light hand urging thereafter. LARIMAR tracked three wide
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader while gaining place entering the lane, and maintained that position safely through the final furlong.
OFF WE GO laid close up two wide while inside of the leading duo, was forced down into another foe at the eleven sixteenths pole, then checked as well at
the five furlong pole as outer foes continued to shift in, lost position due to the incident and raced at the rear along the inside into the turn, trailed turning for
home, shifted out to the four path approaching midstretch, and stayed on between horses to claim show from an outer rival in the final sixteenth. GIRLS A
BULLET tracked along the inside leaving the chute, but steadied when put to tight quarters along the rail by outer rivals leaving the eleven sixteenths pole,
trailed two wide into the turn, gained three to four wide turning for home, but leveled off in midstretch while vying for show, and lost that position to an inner
rival late. HYPERNOVA set the pace outside of a trio of rivals early on, shifted inwardly through the opening quarter mile while not quite clear of inner rivals
causing trouble for many foes, ended with having his back heels clipped before tucking to the rail at the nine sixteenths pole before being confronted by the
eventual winner into the turn, but swiftly failed to keep pace approaching the quarter pole, and gave way entering the lane. CHERISHED tossed his head
briefly leaving the chute, prompted the pace three to two wide while inside of the leader and between horses, got rank among rivals at the five furlong pole
as the leader continued to shift down, clipped heels with that one soon after, stalked from the two path around the turn, but faded two wide entering the lane.

PICASSO vied for the lead early from the inside, took over command, stayed on the inside into the lane and drew off down the lane under a steady drive.
VASARIANO chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. AMANI'S EAGLE set the pace early
from between horses, was in the three path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. ISTHMIAN was in the four path into the lane and moved up
late in the stretch. PROTONIC POWER was fractious in the gate during the pre-start, trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane and
improved position in the stretch. THRIVE stalked the pace early three wide, was in the four path into the lane and faded down the lane. ELI was never
involved.
