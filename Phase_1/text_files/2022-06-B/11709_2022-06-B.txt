Footnotes
TONYS MORNING LINE broke on top, shared the lead from inside, drifted out entering the stretch, battled inside AHEADOFTHEGAME, and shook free with
a sixteenth left. AHEADOFTHEGAME vied for the lead between horses, was two wide on the turn, carried out into the lane, fought gamely but did not have
enough left deep stretch. MAC PANDOWDY contested the pace outside AHEADOFTHEGAME, did not keep up on the bend, lost ground staying outside the
latter entering the stretch, drifted out some approaching the final furlong, was no match for the top pair but unchallenged for third. CARNAVAL CONQUEST
was a contender from inside on the backstretch but began to fade after three furlongs. RODEO MAN prominent from outside, angled in nearing the bend
and gave way from just off the inside soon after. KEEP ATTACKING displayed early speed between rivals but yielded two wide on the turn. DEORA STORE
moved toward the outside early on, came widest into the lane and had little to offer.

Footnotes
AROSE FOR LYLA rated from inside, swung to the outside into the bend, rallied under urging, came six wide into the lane, was all out and got up in the final
strides under a well judged ride. GHAALEB'S CITY pressed from outside, went for the lead three wide on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch, gradually
drifted out under left-handed urging inside the final furlong, held a straight path in the waning yards but was outfinished in a game effort. JOLIE RULER
forwardly placed toward the outside, closed the gap two wide on the bend, fanned out to path four entering the lane, altered in when her path was taken
nearing the sixteenth marker and edged ahead for third in time. PRANCIPANTS saved ground, was blocked behind the leaders in the lane, gained a clear
path inside the last furlong but could not close the gap from between rivals late. DIAMOND GUCCI chased from outside, advanced three wide on the turn,
lost ground when swung out to path five into the stretch and found best stride too late. TIME BREAK was sent to contest the pace outside AUNT STELLA,
took the bend two wide then gradually wore down the final eighth. AUNT STELLA displayed early speed inside rivals but began to flatten out before finishing
five furlongs.

WALKER'S WIN rated on the front end just off the inside, floated out some into the lane, responded to urging with a furlong to go, moved clear and was
wrapped up the last seventy yards. WILLOW RIDGE displayed early speed outside WALKER'S WIN, was no match for that one inside the last furlong,
began to wear down in the waning yards but lasted for the place. YOU'RE IN COREY bumped with A MERRY HEART at the start, was insidboxed in behind
the leaders on the backstretch, followed WALKER'S WIN through the turn, angled inside that one midstretch, edged ahead for third then could only hold his
position late. FLASHY RICHIE raced in contention from inside, waited for room on the turn, gained a clear path two wide into the stretch, altered out when
his path was taken with a furlong left, was closing in for third in the waning yards, came up short but was clearly best of the others. A MERRY HEART
bumped with YOU'RE IN COREY at the break, was well placed inside from the early going but flattened out the final furlong. BABA'S BOY prominent from
outside, came five wide into the stretch and gave way.

DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT was sent to gain a clear lead then allowed to relax just off the inside, was roused upper stretch, slowly added some distance on the
others and was kept to task to the wire. RACETOTHEFINISH moved out widest midway on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the bend, fought for
second in the lane and gradually edged ahead of STOPSHOPPINGAMY for the place deep stretch. STOPSHOPPINGAMY pressed from inside, lacked the
extra needed to challenge the leader in the stretch, battled for the place, angled out some nearing the final sixteenth and slowly wore down. I LUV THIS
BAR helped prompt the early pace from outside, was three wide taking the turn then flattened out for the drive. WAY TOO SMARTE raced in contention just

Footnotes
DOLLY'S LINE soon had the lead in hand, moved clear when allowed on the turn, lengthened command when asked upper stretch and continued to open
up under a drive deep stretch. MOON PIES IMAGE without early speed, lost ground widest through the turn, was all out in the lane and took over second
inside the final sixteenth. LORI ATTACK in midpack early, advanced three wide on the turn, floated out to path five for the stretch run, moved clear for third
then could only just hold her position. TENSE broke alertly, was soon chasing DOLLY'S LINE from just outside, was no match for that one when set down
for the drive, began to wear down between rivals inside the last furlong and drifted out some with a sixteenth left. COWGIRL FRANKIE void of early speed,
advanced between horses on the bend, came into the lane from path four, altered inside when TENSE took her path with a sixteenth to go, showed late
interest and improved her position. SWEET FRAULEIN was forwardly placed between rivals on the backstretch, faded two wide on the turn and ran evenly
the final three-sixteenths. MORNING LINE NEWS well placed from inside, steadily yielded once on the bend. WHITE CASHEL weaved around traffic to
advance in the early going, faded along the rail on the turn and had no late bid. LADY BABA soon trailed from along the rail, angled out through the turn,
came into the lane from path five and had little to offer. SILVER EYES chased from outside, retreated further on the bend, angled in entering the lane and
was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
FAST JACK broke on top, was encouraged to stay at the fore, saved ground taking the bend, put to urging upper stretch, moved clear of CRANKSHAFT
inside the last eighth and held sway under steady handling. CRANKSHAFT contested the pace outside FAST JACK from the early going but slowly wore
down inside the final furlong. SIRCORRI raced in contention toward the outside, was three then four wide through the turn, lacked the needed late bid but
drew away for third as he was closing in on the tiring CRANKSHAFT in the waning yards. AFTER MY BROTHER pressed from inside, was outrun into the
bend, swung out three wide on the turn then flattened out for the stretch run. MON AMI FUZZIE void of speed, though hustled along, swung out through the
turn, came five wide into the lane and made up minor ground. INDIAN SIGN chased from just off the inside, had the rail on the turn, floated out some for the
stretch run and had no late bid. A BOLD RYDE failed to menace in a wide trip.

W W COOKIE MONSTER moved clear of the rest before finishing the first sixteenth, showed the way in hand just off the inside, had the rail on the bend,
was asked leaving the turn, widened command with hand urging upper stretch, was under a mild drive inside the final furlong and allowed to coast the final
seventy yards. DIAMOND MAXIMUS was boxed in behind the leader on the backstretch, dropped back a bit into the turn, moved out four wide for a clear
path soon after, was all out running widest in the lane and edged ahead for second in the waning yards. MKAR THE FAST in the second flight early
between horses, was two wide taking the bend and ran evenly through the stretch. GITA'S LAD a step slow at he break, was hustled up from inside to help
prompt the early pace, did not keep up after three furlongs and lacked a significant stretch bid. MEGAN'S HONOR reluctant to load, was unruly in the gate,
spotted the rest of the field several lengths when he thrashed about briefly when the gate did open, moved up quickly from outside, advanced three wide on
the bend then flattened out for the drive.

Footnotes
FINE GRAYDAR unruly in the gate, threw his head about when the gate opened and was several lengths tardy of the others to start, was settled briefly,
encouraged midway on the backstretch, progressed just off the inside on the turn, entered the lane two wide between rivals, altered to the outside upper
stretch, was all out and caught TRUIST nearing the wire. TRUIST prominent between rivals, advanced four wide on the bend, fanned out further for the
stretch run, took the lead inside the final sixteenth but was outfinished. ROCKET MAN ATTACK was sent to get the early lead, was challenged from inside
after the finishing the first eighth, edged ahead two wide upper stretch but did not have enough left in the late going. DARREN'S LEGACY moved up quickly
from inside to engage ROCKET MAN ATTACK after the first furlong then slowly wore down in the stretch. U S HONOUR NAP in contention early between
rivals, moved to the inside on the turn, regained a striking position along the rail midstretch but leveled off in the waning yards. BLEEDING BLUE bumped
solidly with LELAND JOHN at the start, bobbled, was steadied repeatedly behind traffic on the backstretch, progressed two wide on the turn, fanned to path
four into the stretch and flattened out. SKIP AWAY CARTER failed to menace in a wide trip. LUKE ATTACK broke well but soon was outrun, three to five
wide taking the turn, drifted out under left-handed pressure upper stretch, was checked and little to offer the rest of the way. LELAND JOHN recovered from
bumping and bobbling at the break to prompt the pace between horses but gave way three wide on the bend.
