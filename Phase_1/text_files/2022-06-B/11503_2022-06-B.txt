Footnotes
THE Z MAN broke readily to gain a clear advantage, angled inwards dictating the pace on a comfortable margin, kicked away when prompted by a rival
nearing upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. POVERTY FLATS angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter from out of
striking distance in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. IRISH TUFF settled off the second
flight early, angled to the four path in upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. UNEMBELLISHED, off a step slowly, was urged
advancing on the pacesetter racing into the turn, then flattened out racing through the stretch. NORTHERN WOODS reared, then was cut off at the start,
checked out of tight quarters at the start and never menaced thereafter. INFINITE JETSETTER ducked out at the start, then was checked off rivals soon
after the start, switched out to make brief pursuit of the leaders four wide into the turn but quickly came up empty. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GARDEN broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, forged clear racing into the far turn and steadily widened
the advantage under firm encouragement. STARLIGHT TWIST tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, tipped out splitting rivals on the turn,
switched out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. STREAMER was settled last racing to the turn, then improved
position between foes racing into the lane to gain a share. NORA'S LEGACY tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, shifted three wide
racing into the far turn, to lodge a brief, three wide bid, was carried wide into the stretch and quickly came up empty. PIPER ROSE tracked the leaders three
wide in second flight for a half and gave way racing into the far turn. IKNOWYOURFACE dropped out early.

Footnotes
INTENSE COMPANY (IRE), forwardly placed three wide racing to the first turn, tracked off the first flight racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady
steady advance racing through the far turn to gain terms with the pacesetter midstretch and prevailed under firm handling. DESERT GLOW, urged to
dispute the pace while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, shook clear racing into the far turn, resisted the winner's bid past midstretch but proved
only second best. INNOVATE settled outside foes dropping out last between calls racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three, then four wide
into upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. MISSEN THE POINT angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the far turn,
then gave way into upper stretch. DELUSIONAL DREAM, forced out by EXQUISITA racing into the first turn, settled between foes racing to the backstretch
and continued evenly. ANNIE M was reserved along the inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes while being fanned five wide racing into the stretch
but made no impact. SUMMER SWINGER ducked out at the start, was held up along the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain position
inside foes on the backstretch, was shuffled back behind tiring foes nearing the far turn, switched out three wide racing into the lane and had no late
response. EXQUISITA, reluctant to load, was urged to contend inside foes, but swerved out abruptly into the first turn impeding DELUSIONAL DREAM,
angled to the inside on the backstretch and dropped out early. PLANETARY was urged pressing the pace outside a rival to the backstretch and gave way
abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke sharply, dictated the pace off the rail on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, held a rival's challenge while shifting out
racing through the stretch and regained a clear advantage under pressure while setting a new track record. LONELY PRIVATE was urged three wide
prompting the pacesetter into the turn, proved no match for that foe racing through the stretch but prevailed for the place honors. RICKEY B tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out four wide entering the lane and finished evenly late while earning a share. RELEASE THE BEAST,
reserved inside foes racing through the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch and made an effort to gain some position between foes. STORMIN
HONGKONG was a bit outpaced outside rivals in early stages, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and gained some position while making no real
impression. NAME REJECTED tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing to the turn and gave way on the bend. MISTER WAYSIDE angled to the
inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
LET'S SKEDADDLE was rated off the first flight near the inside in the opening stages, switched out abruptly racing into the first turn avoiding SCENT OF
SUCCESS, advanced on the leaders three deep racing into the far turn, moved to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch, shifted out while being roused
to repel a rivals challenge and gamely prevailed under firm handling. SCENT OF SUCCESS, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages, angled
sharply to the rail racing into the first turn to track off the first flight inside foes, saved ground on the far turn, switched out to split foes three wide racing past
midstretch, then bid inside the winner late but proved no match. SARJENALLI, reserved last in the opening half, advanced on the leaders four wide through
the far turn to upper stretch to gain terms with the winner midstretch but flattened out late. MISSCZECH was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a
narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command racing into the far turn and gave way into the lane. B J'S SPIRIT was urged prompting a rival's
pace in early stages, pressed the issue between foes racing through the far turn and gave way in the drive. DYNAMIC MIMI tracked off the first flight outside
rivals to the backstretch and emptied out racing into the far turn.

GEAUX YOSHKA was rated between foes in second flight tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing to the turn, shifted out to the four path
nearing upper stretch steadily gathering momentum and continued with a steady late response to wrest a clear advantage in time under pressure. PRIZE
FIGHTER was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, went clear racing into the turn, resisted a rival's challenge racing past midstretch
but proved only second best when confronted by the winner. HURTS SO BAD tracked just off the first flight in the opening stages, advanced on the
pacesetter to bid in the three path racing into upper stretch, pressed the issue to midstretch but proved no match for the top two. FREEDOM FLASH was
urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch and gave way racing into the turn. KEEN RESPONSE, caught in close quarters and held up
along the inside in early stages, failed to menace. GLASSATO tracked the leaders four wide in second flight on the backstretch and steadily faded racing
into the turn.

SKIPPY'S STRIKE, reserved off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gaining some position, tipped
out three wide to split foes, then continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. PINTXOS was urged three wide into the
backstretch pursuing the leaders, shifted inwards racing into the far turn to press the issue outside a rival racing into upper stretch, gained the advantage
leaving midstretch but couldn't contain the winner. TREASURE RUN was urged to the lead while angled to the the inside racing into the first turn, set the
pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend, dueled for command through the far turn to upper stretch and weakened late. NO SLO MO was settled
last racing to the backstretch, swung out six wide racing into the stretch and continued with interest to improve position. BOB'S ALL IN angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out entering upper stretch but offered no rally. THE GREEN CRUSADER tracked off the first flight
three wide between foes in the opening half, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. GREAT BRITAIN, caught five wide, then four wide
racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn but offered no rally. THIRTY SECONDS OUT, pulling inside foes racing to the first turn,
switched out to make brief pursuit of the pacesetter between foes and emptied out racing into the far turn. OPTIMISTIC VALOR angled inwards to track the
leaders between foes in second flight and steadily retreated racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
BAYOU COLONEL, unhurried outside foes racing four deep in second flight, was prompted to make a steady advance in the four path into upper stretch
and continued with solid momentum to prevail in time under firm encouragement. CANDY PRINCE broke readily, forced the pace between foes racing into
the turn, dueled outside a rival into upper stretch gaining a narrow advantage between calls late but was collared nearing the wire. FUTURE PERFECT,
urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, weakened in late stages. JUST RIGHT MIKE tipped off the inside early to track the
leaders between foes racing into the turn and finished evenly late. XTREME MAYHEM, off slowly, settled outside foes in the last flight on the backstretch,
was fanned six wide into the lane and made some belated progress. ELUSIVE FREUD settled off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, angled
out five wide entering the stretch but made no impression. SAINT CHARLES was urged three wide through the backstretch prompting the pace to the turn
and gave way nearing upper stretch. LESLIE'S GOLD proved no factor. PROFOUND ONE angled to the rail in early stages tracking off the first flight but
retreated early.

Footnotes
NORTH ARM BAY was rated inside foes tracking the pacesetter into the backstretch, conceded some ground to that foe entering the far turn, tipped out
midway through the second bend commencing a steady advance, moved to wrest command racing past the furlong marker, went clear under pressure while
ducking out leaving the sixteenth marker to prove best. BACK TO SELLING sped to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace on
a clear margin to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. TIGER HUNTER switched out four wide racing into the backstretch and
continued well enough racing into the lane to gain a share. SOTA KING ducked out at the start, was righted quickly to track the pacesetter three wide in
second flight for a half and steadily faded racing into the far turn. TEN THOUSAND TIDES, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the
backstretch, emptied out early. HONEY'S SUPERMAN, caught wide to the backstretch while dropping out late, trailed throughout.
