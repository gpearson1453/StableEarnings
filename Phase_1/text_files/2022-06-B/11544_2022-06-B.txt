DAKATI away alertly and eased off the leaders entering he first turn to assume a tracking trip behind the dueling pacesetters entering the backstretch,
tipped off the rail to commence a two wide bid entering the final turn, took control entering the lane, and held EUROPEAN safely at bay late to prove best.
EUROPEAN broke sharply and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the contested early pace while saving ground along the inside entering he
backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive to prove second best. RING OF KERRY dueled for
the lead from the outside of SIR BARCLAY entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside, took a narrow
advantage into the final turn, was overtaken entering he stretch, but fought on gamely while being outfinished late. SIR BARCLAY vied for the lead from the
rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with RING OF KERRY entering the final turn, and
faded over the final furlong. JACK'S REIGN settled at the back of the pack while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. TEXAS KID refused to break. Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry
pertaining to the start of this race, with regards to TEXAS KID. After review it was deemed that all horses received a fair start, and that TEXAS KID just
refused to break, and was declared a starter. The three quarter split for this race was currently unavailable

Footnotes
BABY GRAND broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide from the outside of
LUCKY LUKE entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and held FOOT SOLDIER safely at bay to prove best. FOOT SOLDIER stalked
the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail
in the drive to get up for the place. JUVEE TOO settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, pulled his way from
between rivals in the run down the backstretch to gain a tracking trip entering he final turn, and finished with interest three wide in the drive in a better than
looked effort. LUCKY LUKE away well and raced tp the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run to the final turn, battled
from the inside of BABY GRAND through the final urn, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly in the stretch
drive. CALAMAZEUS away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle into a stalking trip from along the rail entering the backstretch, got shuffled
back to trail in the run to the final turn, and failed to make a late impact. BOLD AS BRASS settled off the early pacesetter while racing three wide into the
backstretch, advanced into a stalking position in the run to the final turn, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when
called upon. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of LUCKY LUKE lodged a claim of foul against the rider of BABY
GRAND for alleged interference entering he stretch. After review the claim of foul was disallowed and no change was made to the original order of finish

ALL LIQUORD UP away alertly and raced to the lead entering the first turn while saving ground at the rail, dictated the pace through the second turn, held a
clear lead in the run to the final turn, maintained his advantage through the final turn, and was never serious threatened late while finishing two out from the
rail in deep stretch to prove best. GREYTOGO away well and tracked the pacesetter from along the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his
position in the run down the backside, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and finished determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to get the
place. WISELY PLAYED broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two out from the rail
entering the final turn, and finished four out from the rail in the stretch drive. ITSMYDAY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid four
wide entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing three wide in the drive. HE'S A SAINT stalked the leader through the stretch the first
time while under snug restraint, maintained his position into the backstretch, advanced from along the rail midway down the backside, rallied smartly from
along the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. FAULKNER tracked the leader
through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position into the backstretch, struggled to maintain a striking trip in the run
to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
FORT LANGLEY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position through the
second turn, forced the issue from the outside of PARKER POINT in the run down the backside and through the final turn, got the better of that rival in mid
stretch and drew clear late. PARKER POINT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace
from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with FORT LANGLEY in mid stretch, but battled
on gamely to prove easily second best. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, continued with
a wide trip in the run down the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. MY
COLLEGE FUND away well and stalked the early pace while saving ground along the inside through the lane the first time, rallied two wide through the final
turn, but needed more when called upon. ARTISTIC JEWLER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run
down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact. ERLICH settled off the early pace while saving ground
at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground through the second turn while racing into a stalking trip entering the backside, but
began to weaken approaching the final turn, and had little to offer late. The three quarter split for this race was currently unavailable

AT ATTENTION unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced three out from the rail while biding his time at the back of the pack in the run down the
backstretch, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. STAY
FANTASTIC away alertly but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time,
maintained his position into the backstretch, advanced from along the inside in the run to the final turn, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the turn,
tipped three wide to overtake the leaders entering the lane, but was unable to fend off the late surge by AT ATTENTION while proving clearly second best.
EXPLODE tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue in the run down the backstretch from the
outside of BOLD ARCH, battled with that rival through the final turn, was quickly overtaken entering the lane, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to
hold on for a share. BOLD ARCH raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the second turn while saving ground
at the rail, battled from the inside of EXPLODE in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was overhauled entering the lane, and outfinished
late. SMART LAD broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, struggled to hold his position in the
run to the final turn, and had little to offer late. BIG UNION away well and stalked the leader two wide into the stretch the first time, maintained a striking
position in the run down the backstretch, struggled to hold his position entering the final turn, and had little to offer late.

BILLS SMOKN BULLET away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of KHAIKY'S
COMMAND in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and prevailed over that stubborn rival following a stretch long battle. KHAIKY'S
COMMAND away well and dueled for the lead from between rivals entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of BILLS SMOKN
BULLET in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and continued to battle with that foe to to wire to just miss. LAUGH WITH ME tracked the
leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive
while gaining late. ADITYA broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, but needed more late while finishing six wide in the drive. LITTLE GROOT was fractious prior to the start, and missed the break, settled well off the
contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to respond when
called upon. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn,
but was unable to sustain his bid in the stretch drive. ZERO DOWN pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch, forced the issue two out from the
rail in the run to the final turn, continued three wide entering the final turn, something appeared to go amiss soon after entering the turn, and was eased over
the final furlong. ZERO DOWN walked off the track under his own power following the race.

QUAGMIRE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch, maintained a narrow advantage into the final turn, and held TIZ MEOW safely at bay late to prove best. TIZ MEOW steadied when put in tight
