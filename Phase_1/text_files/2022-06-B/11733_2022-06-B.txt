Footnotes
MERRY OF SOUL never far back to turn, five wide run into the stretch, rallied strongly to be along in time under strong handling. MISS SOVELIA good
position to turn, rallied between horses stretch for the place spot. MISS MARPLE inside speed to deep stretch, outgamed to the wire late.
EYEOFTHEBEHOLDER no speed to turn, rallied outside late stretch to move up. KNOT WILD unhurried early, rallied stretch, steadied late, no gain.
ARISTA THE CAT three wide speed, just off pace, gave way readily stretch run. COUNT ME INDY broke tardy, never factored thereafter. AMORADA speed
between horses to the stretch, gave in through late going. YAQUESITA always back, no menace. TIZ BIZ stumbled start, unseated rider and walked off.
