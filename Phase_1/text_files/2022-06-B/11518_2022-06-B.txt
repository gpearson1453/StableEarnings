Footnotes
DIVA GAL dueled between horses and took the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the turn and held well under steady stretch
handling. TAPTAP veered sharply outward at the break and settled off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the turn then
dueled clear for second past the sixteenth pole. SWISS HORIZON contested the early pace inside, dropped back at the rail into the turn then flattened the
final sixteenth. IHEARTRAINACOMN chased through the backstretch, ran at the rail on the turn and was gaining on third in an even finish.
WARRIORINTHEHOUSE was shut off at the break, picked up the chase outside, ran in the five path of the turn but showed little more. MEDAL GENIUS
gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little more. KARPATHIAN DREAM was not a factor. LIL SASSY GIRL contested the early
pace three wide, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole then faded leaving the turn. FREYA'S BLESSING was forced out at the start and never
factored.

through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the lane and relented in the duel for second. MR. HOSTLER was hustled clear
while tapering to the inside and set a pressured pace, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the turn and faded inside the eighth pole. DOCTOR MCCOY
gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn and showed little more. REY O REYES chased the early pace inside but steadied at the rail past the five sixteenths

MORE PLEASE raced with the early pace two deep, took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and quickly cleared Bucks Lodge, drew away from that point,
ran at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. GABBYS BIG NOTION raced off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and
ran at the rail on the far turn, though, had to settle for second best. BUCKS LODGE set the early pace inside, was caught and dropped back past the seven
sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point, ran in the two and three paths of the far turn and weakened in the lane. I WAS RUN NAN settled off the rail the
first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and weakened. PRINCE'S REWARD settled in the three path
the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

LUNAR NOTION broke outward then hustled up to take over nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was steadily encouraged to
hold on. TALENTED CORINNA broke sharply and raced briefly clear, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the turn,
dueled for second later yards and was gaining on the winner. MISS MIDNIGHT ducked out and checked sharply on the chute, picked up the chase inside
and raced close off the rail on the turn, dug in from the top of the stretch but gave up second later yards. KIMSFAVORITESTORM came away a bit rank
then settled off the early pace, bid from the five sixteenths pole, left the turn outside, steadied off the heels of MIDNIGHT PASS in the upper stretch and
flattened stride. The latter broke inward then gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path, angled out toward the head of the lane and flattened inside the
eighth pole. CAN'T FIGURE was pinched back at the start and saved ground. PALACE OF MONEY was not a factor. BACARI gave chase then flattened at
the rail on the turn.

SILKY SERENA pressured the pace through the backstretch, took the nod past the quarter pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn and dug in under
steady encouragement to hold on. ALPINE MOON chased through the backstretch, entered the turn off the rail, angled to the five path into the lane, steadily
closed to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. LADY STORM gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path, was outfinished in
the stretch duel for second but just got up for third. FANCY HER UP chased through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn, factored to deep
stretch but flattened stride nearing the wire. OUR DIAMOND GIRL gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. GOOD
KARMA set a pressured early pace, was met past the quarter pole, continued close at the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. SHERWOOD
LADY broke out and made contact with Door Buster then picked up the chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride
later yards. MANAROLA chased, ran in the three and four paths on the turn, left the turn outside and showed little more. DOOR BUSTER was bumped then
shuffled back at the break and raced well back. TALENT EXPECTED gave chase inside then faded at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
WELL EQUIPPED settled off the earlier pace inside, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn near the rail, angled to the
five path approaching the top of the lane, closed to the lead mid-stretch and held on well; driving. LATE IN THE GAME saved ground racing well back on the
first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, eased outward on the far turn and left the turn about the five path, finished well to take second later yards and
was gaining on the winner. EPIC TIME stalked three wide then challenged toward the three eighths pole, took the nod approaching the quarter, contested
the edge two deep on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch but held the nod for third. HARDLY EVER BETTER stalked two deep into the first turn, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and raced close through the upper stretch before flattening later yards.
TWILIGHT YEARS settled off the pace in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then
flattened in the lane. WINDSOR'S TRACKER raced well off the pace and off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the
rail on the far turn and showed little more. HILLBILLY ROCK raced well back. THUNDERINREADYRICK was bumped off stride at the break but took the
lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, was met approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the
turn but weakened into the lane. OBANNON broke in and made contact with Thunderinreadyrick then settled in the three path the first turn, eased out
leaving the turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, weakened in the four path of the far turn.
