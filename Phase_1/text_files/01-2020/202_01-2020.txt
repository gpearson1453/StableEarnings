Footnotes
WHO'S IN CHARGE broke in at the start carrying in MANDATORY PAYOUT and taking over his lane, established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into
upper stretch, edged clear under a drive and held well to the finish. DEPUTY FLAG got brushed at the start by KADENS COURAGE, who broke outwards,
chased two to three wide, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to chase the winner home running on to safely
secure the place honors. SEED MONEY chased just off the inside, was under a firm near side grip of the reins into the turn appearing to want to get out,
came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and got out three to four wide at that station, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
weakened in the late stages. MANDATORY PAYOUT shied in at the start in reaction to WHO'S IN CHARGE breaking inwards, lost his lane to that rival and
bumped the rear of VINEYARD SOUND, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn placed to
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and offered up a mild bid to improve position by tired foes. VINEYARD SOUND bumped in
the hindquarters by the aforementioned foe, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. KADENS
COURAGE broke out at the start brushing DEPUTY FLAG, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for
home and tired.

Footnotes
OUR TICKET along the outside throughout, forced the issue from path four as the widest of a quartet from the top of the bend to the five-sixteenths pole, sat
poised to strike the front end as three-quarters was being rattled off, settled into upper stretch and was given its cue, took charge during the ensuing furlong,
stayed comfortably in the clear, kept busy to the end. TWO GRACES made it over to the rail after bumping lightly with EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH at the start,
abandoned the rail for a furlong beginning from the five-sixteenths marker to circle by a fading foe, retucked along the inside route and rallied for the place.
LADY CAT chased the pace from path two after bobbling at the start, fanned out five wide from upper to midlane, secured the show. EIGHTY SEVEN
NORTH lightly bumped at the start, stalked the front runners from path two on the turn, angled four wide into the lane, made no impact. SWEET BREEZE
towards the inside vying for the top as the innermost of three during the initial stages, went on to fight afterwards two wide and from between rivals from the
half mile pole until a short distance from the quarter pole, gave way. LA RUBIA remained stationed in the three path after the start, argued from between
rivals for control from between rivals for the majority of the run around the bend, facing off against as many three rivals, spun into the lane and folded.
HAPPYANDIKNOWIT between opponents contending for the top from chute to midpoint on the backstretch, shook clear and was guided over to the inside
route showed the way, feeling pressure from a threesome from the half mile pole to late on the bend, cut the corner into the lane and retreated. . MOLLY'S
SHRINK hard to load, pressed the issue from outside another pair during the early going, cut over to the rail at the conclusion of the backstretch having
noticeably shortened stride, lost contact, strolled three wide into the lane, then was allowed to fade far far away placed to a protective hold, walked off the
track after earning the last minor slice of the purse.

wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged clear under a drive to the finish. FOOLISH GHOST established the front and showed
the way in hand from the four path, shook away down the backstretch and tucked two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and was headed a furlong out, proved no match for the
top one late while running on to secure the place honors. SAN JUAN DIEGO six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
ICE PRINCESS caught leaning in as the field was being released, made light contact with the starting gate, brought up the back of the pack for the opening
half, slow to settle into stride, shifted into the path four after departing the backstretch, launched itself into contention with a rated four wide run, as the
tempo was slowed down quite a bit, settled into upper stretch and got called upon, fought its way to the top, then kicked clear in the last eighth. MYAWAYA
prompted the pace towards the two path, gained a slim advantage as three-quarters was being completed, proved no match once the winner was set down,
stayed on long enough to save second. HOLMDEL PARK tracked the front runners from along the inside route, was asked to pick it up moving to the
outside from the five-sixteenths pole, wound up approximately four wide a furlong later, mustered up a mild response to grab the show award. ANCIENT
BROWN off the inside throughout, unleashed a two to three wide bid as the third fraction was being posted, failed to claim the top and backed away.
COURAGEOUS GIRL attained a forward position after stumbling at the start, vied for the control from along the inside, got overtaken right around the
quarter pole and faltered. SHADOLAMO strung out three wide on the turn, gave way. SNEAKY SURPRISE sighted inside on the turn, was through after
going a half.

THE IMPORTANT ONE stumbled at the start recovering outwards, raced five then four wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining outside, took over command inside the sixteenth marker and inched away to the
finish to prevail. CENTRAL EXIT four wide in range of the front, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive inside a pair offering up a mild bid to get up for the place honors in the very last jump. MARU broke
out at the start bumping IRENA N ELLA, showed the way in hand from the three path safely in front, remained patiently handled until set down continuing
three wide for home, dug in under a drive coming under threat from flanking challengers, got collared inside the sixteenth marker, then got headed for the
place honors om the wire while well clear for the show honors. DESBORDES coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under a ride at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish to secure the last major share. HAYEZHEE coaxed from the
gate, chased along the inside coming under a ride three furlongs from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and was outkicked to the finish.
BECKY'S MISSION chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, weakened. BIG RED GIRL

backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. JUST
STAY HOME seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn, got pushed along three furlongs from home, spun

Footnotes
LIFE IN SHAMBLES well off the inside throughout, stalked the pace four to five wide on the turn, flashed interest as the half was being completed, was more
in the five path when set down in upper stretch, took over during the remainder of the journey leading up to the eighth pole, kicked well clear.
WEGOTOLDYOUGOTSOLD remained prominently placed after the field had been sent off and running, was in path four, disputing the pace as the widest
of a quartet for the initial half, made his way to a narrow advantage as the second split was being finalized, settled in upper stretch and was given its cue,
got overhauled by the winner soon afterwards, held on well to procure the place. OUTPLAY took up the chase from the three path, was on hold caught in
traffic approaching the quarter pole, swung into the lane, was in hand going safely by a stricken rival in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, went on to
finish a non-threatening third. THEY SHOT SONNY worked out a tuck into the two path at the half mile pole, got sent out towards path seven for the drive
home, mustered up a mild response. BLUEBLOOD strung out five wide on the turn, lacked the necessary response. LIAM LETS GO was down along the
rail involved in a multi-numbered pace dispute on the backstretch, fell back into a tracking position thereafter, got checked after the incident in upper stretch,
lost all interest. DEEP SEA two wide and between foes while involved in a multi-numbered pace dispute on the backstretch, fell back afterwards, got
checked after the incident in upper stretch, lost all interest. DARK N CLOUDY stationed in the three path, vied with vigour for the top from between rivals for
the opening half, got set down for the drive home, lost his rider after suffering a fatal injury to the left front, was subsequently euthanized. Following a
Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
WICKED TRICK five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and steadily advanced outside rivals to issue a
challenge and take command swinging three wide into upper stretch getting set down at that juncture, went clear under a drive to the finish. HEAVY
ROLLER four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. DYNAMAX PRIME coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field,
came under a ride at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. FELIX IN FABULA hustled from
the gate, vied outside a pair from the six path down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, was in
the midst of taking command when overhauled at the head of the stretch by the top one, swung three wide for home, weakened in the final eighth.
PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC coaxed from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn placed to coaxing
at the three-eighths, cornered five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. ITS ALL RELEVANT coaxed from the start, vied five to six wide down the
backstretch loosely between a pair, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and
folded. AMERICAN LINCOLN vied inside a pair from the three path down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on
the turn, faded through the latter portion of the bend and went three wide for home, then faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
SAGUARO ROW away to an apparent clean getaway, shifted into the four path before departing the backstretch, crept up to the ones to catch after the half
had been completed, closed the gap enough so as to loom boldly by the quarter pole, was given her cue challenging in earnest as the widest of a foursome
on near equal terms with each other, took charge, then stayed well clear, kept to encouragement. ABOUNDING JOY made it into the three path in short
order, went on to dispute the pace as the outermost of a trio from the end of the chute to the end of bend, got set down spinning into the lane from between
rivals, saw the winner assume control, stayed on well for the place. HONOR WAY four wide onto the turn, was sent out into path five exiting it, secured the
show while never posing a threat to the top twosome. OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE retained the advantage after an alert start, cut over to the inside, showed the
way, facing pressure from a pair of opponents to the outside from the late on the chute until the quarter pole, had the top one arrive on the scene prior to
spinning into the lane, was put to a drive heading home, succumbed to heavy pressure and backed away. SLIMEY rode the rail to the three-eighths pole,
got fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, made no headway. NEW YEAR'S WISH set up in the two path after the field had been released, pressed
the issue from between rivals for most of the journey leading up to the quarter pole, got roused turning into the lane, stayed in the pace fight for another
sixteenth then folded. CHAMPAGNE BLISS pursued the pace along the outside in midpack, got guided over to the inside route at the midway point of the
turn, ventured onward with the rider resorting to a brisk hand ride, was switched over to a protective hold in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole and
allowed to fade away.

BECCA TAKES CHARGE broke out at the start bumping SASSY SECRET, came under coaxing and advanced to vie inside a pair from the two path, tucked
inside at the half mile pole, was along the inside of a trio when placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch taking over
command, edged away under a drive to prevail. VITANZA five then four wide just off the pace dispute, advanced to vie with those foes from the outside
through the latter portion of the turn before being set down swinging four to five wide for home, dug in under a drive keeping on to chase the winner home
while safe for the place honors. MISS ROSS two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch from near the rear, tipped four wide through the turn placed
to coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive kicking on belatedly and shied out a bit late under a near sided stick
to the finish. TAKE IT ALL BACK coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and
improved position for the last major share. TATTERAZZI bumped at the start by DEJA RACONTE who broke outwards, vied four to five wide down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole between rivals as VITANZA advanced outside, cornered
three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. DEJA RACONTE broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, showed the way briefly
early on before being engaged by a pair and vied between rivals three to four wide down the backstretch and then two wide through the turn, got put to
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MOLLY'S NIGHTHAWK stumbled badly
falling to her face at the start and conceded five to six lengths to the front before recovering and settling into stride, the rider briefly losing the irons before
regaining them, tipped out five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then took the overland route through the turn six to seven wide, came
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive, had the rider lose the handle on the whip to the near side
nearing the sixteenth pole and offered no response. ROUSEY broke out at the start bumping MARGIE CAT, chased four then three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. MISS JILL got away to an awkward beginning conceding three to four lengths
to the front, chased two then three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. SASSY SECRET bumped at the
break by BECCA TAKES CHARGE who broke outwards, raced forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, faded through the turn and went three to four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. MARGIE
CAT bumped at the start by ROUSEY, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and tired.
