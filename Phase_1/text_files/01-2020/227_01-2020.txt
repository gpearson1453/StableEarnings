Footnotes
DISTINCT QUALITY was a bit reluctant to load, dropped back while showing no speed under urging, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide
into the stretch, drifted out under a right-handed whip at the three-sixteenths, rallied on the far outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going
away. SHACKLEFORD ROAD broke out at the start, showed good speed on the outside, moved clear inside the half-mile pole, extended the advantage in
the two path on the turn, was set down near the three-sixteenths, came under the whip just inside the furlong marker, remained clear but was shortening
stride into the final sixteenth and was overtaken while able to hold the place. JAIL HOUSE was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two
path, was driven under the whip into the stretch, gained on the tired pacesetter into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. CIVIL broke in at
the start, showed good speed on the inside then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. WELLFIELD was hustled from the start
then ridden along off the pace, rounded the turn in the four path, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. CABO HEADACHE broke a
half-step slow, was ridden along at the rear of the field, went four wide early on the turn, floated six wide late on that bend, came seven wide into the stretch
and was no factor. BLUEWATER CAT was urged along towards the rear, dropped back while five to six wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TURNER TIME settled comfortably off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, rallied into the stretch, took
the lead at the three-sixteenths, moved clear under a drive into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. WILDWOOD DEJAVU broke very fast,
set the clear pace, went around the turn in the two path, was asked just after straightening for the drive, lost the lead under a drive at the three-sixteenths,
dropped back into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. CONTAINMENT bumped with SENOR BLAIR early then dropped in,
settled off the pace, was urged along while three to four wide on the turn, gained six wide into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead throughout the
drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU dropped well back on the outside, went five wide into the turn then
dropped to the four path, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. WARRIOR'S KID was urged along on the outside, chased in the four to
five path on the turn and tired. SENOR BLAIR was bumped on both sides early then squeezed back, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.
HOMEVIEW bumped with SENOR BLAIR early, was urged along off the pace, chased in the three path while inside of WARRIOR'S KID, was driven past
the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty. FLASH ATTACK was urged along on the outside, dropped back while five to six
wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PEPPERMINT CRUNCH bobbled ever so slightly and was bumped very lightly at the start, recovered to set the pace inside foes into the turn, edged clear
while coming off the fence to the two path leaving that bend, dictated terms from off the rail up the backstretch while widening the advantage, continued in
about the two path on the far turn, was put to steady urging in the stretch, appeared to be shortening stride by mid-stretch, given continued encouragement
to the wire to just hold from CURLIN GREY, who was unhurried early racing along the rail at the rear, advanced inside a foe up the backstretch, continued to
save ground on the far turn before coming out a path leaving that bend, shifted out several more paths for room in upper stretch and took aim under stout
urging, was gaining on the aforementioned but too late. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS was caught three to four wide outside foes on the first turn, settled still wide
and outside up the backstretch, went three to four wide again on the far turn and asked for a bit more out of that bend, gained a bit on the leader in upper
stretch then evened out late. UPTOWN RULER brushed the inside foe lightly at the break, was taken back from among the vanguard and rated in behind
those in the two then three path through the first turn, lost ground on the pacesetter up the backstretch still racing wide, continued in the four then five path
on the far turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch then corrected back out and ran on. ZYPTO brushed the outside rival at the start and was thoroughly urged
forward between foes into the first turn, continued inside a rival in the two to three path out of that bend and up the backstretch, shifted in midway on the far
turn just outside the five-sixteenths, came off the rail in upper stretch and continued to weaken. GO FOR MOONSHINE was very lightly brushed at the start,
raced outside last but one kept in the three to four path through the first turn, shifted in a bit going in the two to three path into and on the far turn and was
never a threat.

Footnotes
MOMENTO followed the leader down the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, gained outside the five-sixteenths pole then made a bid,
bumped with GET DIRECTIONS at the quarter-pole, dueled inside of HAILEY'S DAY into the final furlong, moved clear when that foe ducked out at that
point and drew away under strong urging. ORB'S SOUL broke a step slow, settled on the outside, went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the two
path, moved to three wide late on that bend, shifted out under a drive in upper stretch and got up for the place while no match for the winner. HAILEY'S DAY
broke a bit slow, moved up on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was roused while gaining outside the five-sixteenths, rallied to lead at the
quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner in upper stretch, ducked out sharply under a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, was straightened by the rider
then switched to a right-handed whip and weakened then lost the place while just able to get the show. THREEWICKEDWISHES broke a step slow, was
urged along at the rear of the field, started the turn in the two path, angled four wide outside the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the whip,
moved out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while just missed the trifecta. LOVELY LADY was urged along off the pace,
dropped back while brushing with a foe leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and came up empty. GET DIRECTIONS broke very fast
and set the pace, raced inside on the turn, bumped with MOMENTO while headed at the quarter-pole and stopped. SILENT TRICK was hustled from the
start then urged along off the pace, brushed with an opponent while dropping back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SUMMERS HOPE moved clear soon after the start to set the pace racing in the two path, was under a hold still in the clear into the turn continuing a path
removed from the rail through that bend, opened up willingly into upper stretch, was unasked till the furlong marker then given moderate hand urging while
extending the margin. DULCIMER DAME shifted in as a rival came out heading up the backstretch, settled into stride along the rail toward the back through
the turn, came out four then five wide in upper- to mid-stretch, was driven along and gained the place. SWEET BAY came out a bit midway up the
backstretch in pursuit of the eventual winner inside a rival, entered the turn in the three path before shifting in a path, came back out to the four path in upper
stretch and kept on evenly while lacking the needed late kick. RESERVE LIST tossed her head just slightly at the start while breaking a half-step slow, raced
off the inside at the rear initially between foes then further back in the three path into the turn shifting in a path early on that bend, came into the stretch with
much to do and ran on to pass inside tiring rivals. SPEED ON TAP broke outwardly, tucked in mid-pack to the two path just off the leading trio early, came
out four wide into upper stretch when put to a drive, drifted out a further path or two in upper stretch then flattened out late. APTISENO LINE broke a step
slowly and was bumped, raced outside foes at the rear going in the three to four path through the turn, failed to rally. LEA'S PRINCESS broke a touch
outwardly bumping a rival at the start, was in pursuit of the winner from outside a foe going three to four wide through the turn, came out a path in upper- to
mid-stretch, faltered and faded.

into the stretch, angled out from behind horses while still on his inside lead at the three-sixteenths, switched to the proper lead when thrown in by the rider
around the furlong marker, rallied on the outside and got up in the final two strides under strong handling. RUNNINGWSCISSORS was carried in early then

upper stretch, waited while lacking room behind foes at the three-sixteenths, altered course to the outside shortly thereafter, chased into the final furlong,
took the lead just inside the sixteenth-pole but was denied while able to get the place. HE'S NO BULL pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three
path on the turn, took the lead outside the three-sixteenths, led under the whip until the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken while able to hold the show.

EXTRA MILE tracked from inside just off the leaders under a mild hold early, edged closer while tipping out midway on the far turn coming four wide past the
five-sixteenths, struck the lead past the quarter pole and was thereupon put to a drive and responded by drawing away through the lane. BAUDETTE
BLIZZARD stalked just off the pace from outside caught four deep through the first turn, continued outside foes up the backstretch then came in a bit to bid
three wide past the three-eighths, took a narrow lead till just past the quarter pole and could not kick on with the winner while clearly second best. CITY
PARK broke about a length slowly then settled at the rear racing in the two path, began to pick it up into the far turn going three then four then five wide
advancing between rivals leaving that bend, could not sustain the effort having made up lots of ground and flattened out. GUITAR SLIM was taken up at the
start, tucked in to the rail entering the first turn racing toward the rear, angled out abruptly up the backstretch, moved past rivals six then seven wide on the
far turn, levelled off in the drive. HALF PIPE settled mid-pack in the three path through the early going, shifted in a path entering the far turn, encouraged
along late on that bend and swung four wide coming to the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. C F JOHNATHAN shifted in heading to the first turn,
saved ground along the inside through that bend mid-pack, lost position up the backstretch into the far turn still racing on or just off the rail on that bend,
improved position in the stretch but had no rally. ANDIAMO GIACOMO raced outside a rival mid-pack through the first turn, continued outside numerous
lengths off the leaders up the backstretch, was asked for run four then five wide on the far turn but had no response. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU moved
forward after the break setting the pace in the two path, faced outside pressure leaving the backstretch, was overtaken outside the five-sixteenths, began to
weaken and continued to fade in the stretch. GOOD OLD CHARLIE went two to three wide on the first turn, came out a bit and was encouraged along early
up the backstretch, was further asked four to five wide midway on the far turn but failed to produce a bid. HARPER'S DEELITE broke outwardly, switched
outside the leader to stalk then press that rival three wide, began to drop back after the half then faded in the lane. JACI'S ROYALTY caught three wide
outside rivals into the first turn, soon dropped back still a couple paths removed from the rail and faded.

YANKEE SEVEN was urged along on the outside, moved in outside the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the
stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker, bumped with FORERUN into the final sixteenth and prevailed under
strong urging. ASONGFORYOU was sent hard from the start, chased the pace, went around the turn in the four path, pursued the leader under a drive into
the final furlong, moved out from behind horses around the sixteenth-pole, gained on the outside late but missed while able to get the place. SALTEE
STARK was urged along on the outside, moved in some late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, shifted out
under a drive around the three-sixteenths and finished willingly to just get the show. FORERUN was hustled from the start, showed speed then moved clear
passing the half-mile pole, was guided around the turn in the three path, came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead inside the furlong marker,
bumped with YANKEE SEVEN into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just lost the show. GREELEY WENT WEST was ridden along towards the
rear, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out while gaining under a drive near the furlong marker,
paused behind a rival near the sixteenth-pole then dropped in and finished willingly but missed the superfecta. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT bumped with a rival
at the start, was ridden along off the pace, entered the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, came six wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive
around the three-sixteenths and gained some ground but failed to threaten. JAKE THE BAND MAN bumped with a rival at the start, shifted out at the rear
near the half-mile pole, went three to four wide on the turn, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and was no factor. QUEETEN was hustled from
the start, showed speed then chased the pace, raced inside on the turn and tired.

JUST MIGHT showed good speed and set the clear pace, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole,
drew off under the whip until inside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride in the final seventy yards while much the best. ACE DESTROYER
was urged along on the outside then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved into second outside the furlong marker and safely secured
the place while no match for the winner. HORSE DOCTOR was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, passed the quarter-pole in the two
path, dropped well behind the winner under a drive in upper stretch and tired while clear for the show. MARK OF THE Z tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the three path on the turn and came up empty. DANCE TO MY SONG propped while leaning inward at the start then swerved out, spotted the
front around twenty lengths, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
ARTIES GAME showed speed then chased the pace, inched closer in the two path on the turn, made a bid outside the pacesetter at the five-sixteenths,
took a narrow advantage into upper stretch, dueled outside into the final furlong then drew clear under steady urging. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE moved up
under urging after the start, set the clear pace, raced inside on the turn, was challenged while under the whip at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into
upper stretch, dueled inside into the final furlong and weakened but just held the place. IT'SUPTOYOUPAL bumped with a rival at the start while hustled,
settled under some urging, went three to four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for
the show. BEFOREHAND was taken up at the start and off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went around the turn in the two path, moved around a foe
in upper stretch and failed to threaten. BOSTON LOVER dropped back while ridden along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into
the stretch and was no factor. ADIEU GALAXY was taken up at the start and off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along at the rear, raced
inside to the two path on the turn and never reached contention. DOUBLE PRIORITY was urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn,
floated six to seven wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. FIRST METAL COUNT bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along in third position,
went three to four wide on the turn and faltered.
