Footnotes
MY HAPPY PLACE tracked the pacesetter along the inside while unhurried in the opening stages, shifted out three wide entering the turn while
commencing a steady advance, bid for command nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and held sway through the lane under firm left handed
encouragement. ANGEL NUMBER settled last in early stages, split rivals entering the turn gathering momentum, angled outside the leaders nearing upper
stretch and continued with a steady effort pursuing the winner to late stages but was always only second best. I LOVE SHOPPING tracked just off the the
pacesetter between foes in the opening stages, advanced to press the issue racing into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid while gaining a brief
advantage leaving the midway point of the turn but gave way in the drive. TEXAS PROMO GIRL ducked a bit at the start, was quickly righted, then urged
forward while shifting off the rail in the opening stages, angled to the inside near the half mile marker dueling for command into the turn and gave way
nearing the lane. SMART BUCK tracked off the first flight four wide racing through the backstretch but soon faded from contention. LA GUATEMALTECA,
forwardly placed three deep between foes in the opening stages, shifted out five wide racing through the turn while losing ground to the leaders and soon
emptied out.

Footnotes
BUYWON GETWON broke readily to stalk just off the pacesetter between rivals under light rating racing into the turn, pressed the issue midway through the
bend, took over when given his cue racing past three sixteenth marker and steadily widened his advantage under firm hand urging. MIA'S BOBTAIL, urged
to dictate the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail racing into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid leaving the turn, gave way in upper stretch and
proved best of the others. COCKTAILS OR CANDY, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening quarter, was prompted to
advance in that path racing into the turn but emptied out racing into upper stretch. RED KITTEN settled outside foes in the last flight from out of striking
distance racing to the turn, improved his position between foes into the stretch but proved no real threat. ATHENA'S REVENGE settled last just off the
inside, switched outside rivals racing into the turn while being prompted to advance but lacked a rally. PURO BLANCO broke a step slowly and failed to
menace. GIFTED PATH was urged inside foes pursuing the pacesetter along the rail in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
BELLA BELLA broke readily, stalked just off the pacesetter under light reserve racing into the backstretch, moved to terms nearing upper stretch to wrest
the advantage and held sway to the end under firm handling. ZAO'S DREAMS, a step slow into stride, angled to the inside to track just off the second flight
racing to the far turn, shifted off the inside racing into upper stretch, then steadily closed the gap on the winner to late stages while angling to the three path
in the final sixteenth. ALABAMA BOUND moved to the fore along the inside from the break, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch but
weakened in late stages. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE, between rivals in second flight racing to the first turn, steadied in close quarters entering that bend, steadied
again nearing the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance, was fanned four wide in the closing stages and
continued with a mild gain. BETTER YET, caught four wide in second flight racing into the first turn, dropped back to track off the second flight on the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four, then five wide nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. QUEEN ROSE tracked just off the pacesetter inside
rivals racing to the far turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance but soon faded. ANABELLA QUEEN, caught wide leaving the
chute, then to the first turn dropping off the second flight, was fanned five wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid.
ASHLEY'S ROSE settled between foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. MI CUAIMA tracked the leaders three deep between foes in second
flight to the backstretch, was roused to advance into the far turn but quickly emptied out. SUGAR CANE GIRL dropped out early.

Footnotes
CASPIAN TALE broke sharply, conceded the lead racing into the first turn while switching outside the pacesetter, tracked just off that rival to the far turn,
came under pressure nearing the quarter mile marker to advance on that foe, moved to terms in upper stretch pressing the issue in a long drive and
prevailed in time under brisk handling while drifting out markedly in the closing stages. HANDSOME GIRL, urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the first
turn, set the pace on a comfortable margin racing a bit off the rail on her own courage into the far turn, resisted the winner's challenge past midstretch but
yielded late. PIPPAS POPPY tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path on the far turn,
was fanned five wide in the closing stages but made some mild progress to the end while gaining a share. VALERIE FIRST tracked off the second flight off
the rail under reserve in the opening half, was roused to advance between foes nearing upper stretch and gained some position while lacking the needed
late response. ANONYMOUS was settled outside foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, raced four wide into the stretch and never gained
contention. RAINBOW WARRIOR, pulling between foes tracking off the first flight into the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn while being prompted
to maintain striking distance but quickly faded. ALONG THE TRAIL, pulling a bit inside foes in the second flight racing along the rail to the backstretch,
dropped out early.

Footnotes
RUDIGER was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening five furlongs, shifted off the rail gaining some position nearing upper stretch, swung
out five wide racing into upper stretch and wore down A GIRLS BESTFRIEND to prevail narrowly in time under stout left handed pressure. The latter,
steadied in close quarters just after the start, tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far
turn commencing a steady advance, moved to gain a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner. FACTS DON'T MATTER,
shut off momentarily, then steadied off TRULY STELLAR in the opening stages, pulled her way to a position just off the leaders outside foes racing to the
backstretch, shifted three deep after a half steadily moving to terms with the first flight, pressed the issue three deep between foes racing through the far
turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch but couldn't match terms with the top pair through the lane while holding a rival for a share. QUALITY STEP
tracked off the firs flight along the inside to the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and finished evenly between foes in the closing
stages. HONEST TO GOODNESS, reserved off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then
gained some position between foes in the closing stages in a belated effort. ZACAPA RUN, held up avoiding close quarters just after the start, settled
outside foes to the backstretch, was caught wide racing to the stretch and proved no threat. TRULY STELLAR ducked inwards a bit just after the start, then
pulled her way to terms with a rival on the pace while a bit rank under restraint prompting the issue, pressed the issue into the far turn and emptied out into
upper stretch. DARN THAT PARKER, urged to gain the lead along the rail in the opening stages, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
REAL DOOZIE, in touch with a rival attending the pace racing well off the inside in the opening quarter, took over racing into the turn while shifting nearer to
the inside, went clear racing into upper stretch under some right handed pressure racing well off the rail and was gathered up by her rider in the closing
stages once the issue had been decided. MALICED broke outwards bumping TALK NICE lightly just after the start, tracked off the first flight outside a rival
racing to the turn, was prompted in pursuit of the eventual winner three deep through the bend but couldn't gain terms with that foe while proving best of the
others. DREAMS OF SHIRLEY tracked off the second flight near the inside in early stages, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch gaining some
position but had no closing bid. TALK NICE, bumped at the start, was urged to dispute the pace from the outset while angling inside, dueled for command
into the turn and gave way after a half. BORN TO GROOVE tracked off the first flight just off the inside racing to the turn but faded between foes early.
BEZEL SET dropped out last racing to the turn, saved ground to the lane but failed to menace.

Footnotes
LONTANI was rated inside a rival tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight conceding position to the leader into the backstretch, steadily gained
terms with the pacesetter between foes nearing the midway point of the far turn, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch and was roused clear.
TRAVEL AGENT tracked off the second flight while shifting to the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half,
angled out leaving the far turn and gained some position between foes into the lane. YABBA DABBA DUDE broke outwards brushing the gate, was
collected to track the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner to bid three wide
midway through the far turn but flattened racing into the stretch. MAYBEYESMAYBENO, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out nearing
the lane to gain some position three deep but made no real impression. TEMPLE MOUNT tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn and
steadily faded nearing the lane. GO HARLEY GO settled between foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. TOXICOLOGIST settled near the inside
early and never seriously menaced. SPINOS tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch but steadily retreated after a half. TAXMAN pulled
his way clear along the rail into the backstretch, held sway on a sizable advantage racing to the far turn and gave out abruptly once headed by the winner.

Footnotes
GUERRERON, caught four wide racing into the first turn, continued in that path to the backstretch tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance,
advanced in tandem with several rivals to challenge for command in that path racing through the far turn, then edged forward in the closing stages under
firm handling. UPPER CROWN, forward placed in the opening stages, was eased back racing into the backstretch to track the pacesetter three deep
between foes, lost some ground to those foes on the far turn but continued with a steady late bid in that path through the stretch to prevail for the place
honors. CREDIT CYCLE tracked the leaders in second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, was held up while switching out after a half
to track off the second flight, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. YOU'LL LIKE IT, urged to the lead along the inside,
set the pace on a clear margin racing to the far turn while a bit off the rail, dueled between foes resisting the winner's challenge into upper stretch but faded
in late stages. BROWN ESSENCE angled inwards to track the pacesetter between foes, then along the rail after a half, was prompted to advance inside the
pacesetter to challenge for command leaving the midway point of the far turn but flattened out in the drive. RUN SIEGER RUN was settled outside a rival
racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. OLLYSILVEREXPRESS dropped out early.

BATS CHANCE broke readily to gain a forward placing, stalked just off the pacesetter under light rating between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to
wrest the advantage on his own courage racing into the far turn, then held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. DANVILLE, bumped at
the start, was settled out of close quarters along the rail racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum while swinging out five wide racing into upper
stretch, drifted inwards under right handed pressure bumping HAY HAY MY MY while forcing that rival into the path of BIJEMINI SLEW but continued
willingly to prevail for the place honors. BIJEMINI SLEW, held up off GATOR POSSE conceding some position along the inside racing to the first turn,
tracked off the leaders to the second bend, shifted out after six furlongs gaining some position between foes racing into upper stretch, was bumped while
carried inwards leaving midstretch but regained some position late to prevail for a share. HAY HAY MY MY tracked off the second flight outside foes in the
opening half, advanced four wide into upper stretch, was bumped soundly while ducking inwards leaving midstretch and was outfinished for a share.
GATOR POSSE broke inwards bumping DANVILLE, was collected off that foe, then pulled hard against restraint when rank between foes racing to the first
turn, responded to rating to track off the pacesetter near the inside racing through the backstretch, switched outside that rival making light contact with HE
HAD A SECRET racing into the far turn while continuing in pursuit of the eventual winner to upper stretch but flattened out in the closing stages. PINAR,
reserved outside foes tracking well off the second flight to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress.
APPRAISED, caught in close quarters between foes, then held up while angling nearer to the inside racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight to
the far turn, was urged to split rivals just off the inside racing into the stretch, but was taken up when losing his path and his momentum in late stages.
SECRET MAGICIAN angled inwards to track just off the leaders between foes, lost ground into the far turn, shifted out five wide racing into the stretch but
had no rally. HE HAD A SECRET, urged to gain a forward placing three wide tracking just off the leaders for a half, was bumped racing into the far turn and
abruptly gave out. FUNNEL CLOUD sped to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin for five furlongs and gave way racing into the far
turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF HAY HAY MY MY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DANVILLE ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.
