Footnotes
BLOWINTHEBLUESAWAY was bumped by SEVERIN to begin, had no speed, settled to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and
closed steadily to get the nod in the last jump. CYCLOPS tracked the pace to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch, rallied to collar WINTER FOG in mid
stretch, took a short lead from that one a sixteenth out but was tagged by the winner. WINTER FOG set the pace from the rail to the stretch, battled gamely
when hooked by the runnerup but was outfinished in the final fifty yards. ICE OR FIRE tracked the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch then had the rider drop his whip a sixteenth out and finished evenly. LUCK IS MY NAME had no speed, was off the rail on the turn
then swung out widest for the drive and finished in a rally. NICKLE SHOTS was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but was never a threat.
SEVERIN broke out and bumped the winner at the start, chased the pace two wide to the stretch then gave way in final furlong. CREDANCE prompted the
pace to the turn, was being outrun while saving ground then was tiring, had to steady leaving the quarter pole off heels and stopped.

Footnotes
GRATZIE (GB) was always well placed outside rivals to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held
stubbornly. MUSIC BABE trailed to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch then shifted out widest and closed with a strong run but was too late.
SMILING ANN pressed the pace to the half mile pole, moved alongside FABRIANA and dueled that one to the stretch, took a short lead in mid stretch but
was outfinished to the line. CHARMING STARLET was allowed to settle to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then lacked the needed late
response. FABRIANA pushed to the front, set the pace from the rail, dueled inside to the stretch then was overtaken in mid stretch and weakened.

PERFECT SALE was away a bit slow but hurried along to stalked the pace to the turn, had to circle four then five wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms
with the runnerup in mid stretch then dug in determinedly to prevail. FLASHPROOF stalked the pace to the turn, was inside the winner and four wide to the
stretch, dueled that one in the final furlong and was bested. BAYONCE pulled to the contest the pace early, raced two wide to the stretch then was collared
in mid stretch but saved the show. BECKY FLAMES was chasing to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then finished evenly in the drive. BABY HANG
ON was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. CALESE dueled BAYONCE to the turn then pressed from the
rail to the stretch but got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. CITY SNICKER broke a bit slow, had no speed three wide and was never a threat. AUTISM'S
JOURNEY had no speed and was always outrun. LADY AGATHA also had no speed then lugged out six wide on the turn and gave way.

MAD AT MONEY was outrun to the half, bid two wide on the second turn, shifted out in upper stretch then closed fast to win going away. MISSED THE
BOAT had the best speed, set the pace, saved ground to the stretch, was headed by SAYIN GRACE in mid stretch but kept on gamely to save second.
SAYIN GRACE tracked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, got to terms with MISSED THE BOAT in mid stretch but hung in the
final sixteenth. AMERICAN CAMP was allowed to settle to the half, came two wide into the second turn, swung out four deep into the stretch but could not
offer the needed late response. BARREL AGED tracked the leaders to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, loomed to mid stretch then went evenly
late. CAPTAIN RED pressed the pace for six furlongs while off the rail then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. MY MAN DRAYMOND trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
TIZ FAKE NEWS had the best speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then edged clear to mid stretch and remained clear driving. ZAKAR broke alertly
but was outsprinted, got fanned four wide to the stretch then could not impact her stablemate but caught TROUBLE N PARADISE for second. TROUBLE N
PARADISE pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly. MIME chased the pace two wide to the stretch then
also failed to offer a late response. CHARMING LASS was outsprinted to the turn, raced off the rail to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. LUCKY
SARA had no speed and was not a factor. GO MUSKEE gave a dull effort, stopped then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
GOTHAM DESIRE was outrun to the turn, shifted to the rail and rallied when set down for the drive then had room and closed fast to prevail. THE FUN
BEGINS set the pace two wide to the stretch, kicked away to mid stretch but was tiring late and caught. PLUM WILD was also without early speed, raced
two wide to the stretch then shifted out for room and closed willingly to just miss the place. TRINA pressed the leader from the rail to the stretch, got outrun
to mid stretch and finished evenly. MISS MEGAN was outsprinted early, raced four wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and lacked a late bid.
QUEEN HELENE had no speed, raced four wide on the turn and was never a threat. PROMOTE (IRE) was also outrun to the turn, had to circle five wide to
the stretch, shifted out widest for the drive but weakened late. CHOCOLATE SPEIGHTS chased the pace two wide to the stretch then gave way. SHEZA
FACTOR was also chasing between rivals then was squeezed at the five sixteenths, took up sharply and lost any chance.
