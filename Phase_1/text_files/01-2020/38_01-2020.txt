Footnotes
DAY THE MUSIC DIED gained a stalking spot early on and took measure of the leader while well in hand, cruised up and engaged that one nearing the
turn, moved to a slim lead three furlongs out, cruised clear approaching the quarter pole, moved further out in mid stretch, came under urging soon after and
held firm under a drive. KOSHER KONTRACT , taken to rate early, steadied when put in close into the turn, regrouped, angled four wide and advanced into
the lane, straightened and finished up with good energy. BAPTIZE THE BOY under coaxing while chasing towards the rail, moved up then checked off heels
nearing the half mile pole, recovered and edged closer under a ride mid turn, eased out to edged up between foes, chased into the lane and kept trying to
the inside of KOSHER KONTRACT. CAPE LOOKOUT , outside rivals nearing the half mile marker, gave hard chase while three deep into the lane then
faded in the final furlong. BIG BOOTS , between foes early, dropped back and angled out leaving the far turn, circled five to six wide while under a hearty
ride but failed to respond. ODDS ON sped to the front and secured the inside, was joined by the winner near the half mile marker, sparred to mid turn,
stayed willingly to upper stretch then weakened.

ELEVATED FOREVER engaged CITY TRAVELER from the inside nearing the three quarter pole, went clear under rating about a furlong later, controlled
the pace around the turn, edged away approaching the lane, was guided three wide for the drive and held sway while kept to task. CAMPARI moved up
early and stalked the pace from the inside, came under pressure mid turn, edged up to loom briefly in mid stretch, kept on willingly and was clearly second
best. CITY TRAVELER took over early and set the pace two wide, was hooked from the inside nearing the six furlong marker, chased the winner past the
three eighths, shifted four wide into the lane and faded. BANISHMENT , off the pace while saving ground edged up a bit near mid stretch then flattened out.
EDDY DIRT , taken to rate, dropped back leaving the three eighths, angled five to six wide and came up empty. DREAMIN N SCHEMIN stalked early under
some rating, eased back from between foes leaving the far turn, shifted out and weakened. STUCCO hesitated at the break, was used wide to reach a
stalking position, chased wide past the three eighths and faltered.

RUN FOR JAMES broke sharply and took command early, set the pace in about the two path, held a clear lead around the turn, came under a ride nearing
the lane, widened under strong handling in mid stretch, drifted out in the final sixteenth but held firm. EARNED IT settled off the rail, commenced a run mid
turn, circled four wide into the lane, made a grinding run while on his left lead but was kept at bay. PUMPKIN STAR , between rivals early, chased two wide
into the lane but lacked a serious finish. RELENTLESS LION lagged off the pace and off the inside, circled five wide into the lane but failed to rally. FREE
TO TRUMP pursued along the inside, stayed in range to about the three sixteenths then gave way. MIAMI TIGER , outside rivals early on, dropped back
around the turn.

Footnotes
REDEEMED SPIRIT bid three wide outside rivals nearing the half mile marker, dueled three deep on a slim lead entering the lane, opened up after being
set down in upper stretch then held firm while kept to task. HYDRA eased back off the leaders early on, picked up some steam while saving ground mid
turn, angled four wide into the stretch and rallied. MIGHTY MOLLY , off a bit slow when brushed, raced off the pace, came five wide for the drive and closed
steadily. EDIT AND SIMPLIFY chased while in the clear mid turn, shifted six wide for the stretch run, moved up some near mid stretch then failed to sustain.
TAPDANCING GIRL had speed along the rail, bid inside rivals around the turn, dueled into the stretch then weakened through the final sixteenth.
TAPITTIZER R V F , fractious in the gate, was away slowly, saved ground into the lane and failed to menace. DAJEM had speed two wide, dueled between
rivals from the far turn to the head of the lane then faltered with a furlong remaining.
