Footnotes
SHADOW OP set the pace in the early going, led from a bit off the rail around the turn, met the bid of CHOCALATE MESS to the outside and held that foe
at bay in game fashion to the wire. CHOCOLATE MESS raced outside a rival, came in and bumped foe into the turn, bid outside the leader and came three
to four wide into the stretch, challenged through the lane but lacked the needed final kick to go by. CASH ENCOUNTER chased a bit off the rail, bumped
with rival into the turn, came out entering the stretch and edged MYSTIC GREY for third. MYSTIC GREY stalked the pace from the inside, saved ground
into the lane and lacked a response. PAPA CABALLERO settled off the rail, traveled five wide into the lane, lugged inward in the stretch and proved no
menace.

BOUND TO GO forced out by inside rival early, well placed behind the early speed, tucked in along the inside through the turn, angled outside the leader
into the lane, closed fast to grab the lead past the sixteenth pole and drew away to the wire. LEEDSLIMIT sped to the front, received pressure from the
outside, led clear into the lane, collared by the winner past the sixteenth pole and held the place. JOHANN'S COMMAND three deep in the early going,
exchanged bumped with inside rival entering the turn, chased four wide into the stretch and finished willingly for third. WHATAHANDSOMECAT pressed the
pace between rivals, exchanged bumps with outside rival into the turn, chased two to three wide leaving the turn and weakened. VERMEER forwardly
placed and four deep up the backstretch, lost ground and traveled two to three wide around the turn, then weakened in the final furlong.
