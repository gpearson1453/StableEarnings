Footnotes
MYSTERY MESSENGER reluctant to load, stalked the pace inside, came out into the stretch, bid outside the runner-up under left handed urging in
midstretch, gained the advantage nearing the sixteenth pole and inched away late. HIT THE SEAM had good early speed and angled in, pulled his way to
the front and set the pace inside, fought back a bit off the rail in the stretch, could not match the winner late but held second. FACTORIAL chased off the rail
then a bit off the fence, angled to the inside on the turn, went up the rail in the stretch and was edged for the place. SILKEN PRINCE broke a bit slowly,
angled in and saved ground off the pace, came out in midstretch and was outfinished. WORTHY TURK chased outside a rival on the backstretch and turn,
came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SOUL BEAM broke slowly, settled off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and did not rally.
CAMBY was reloaded after being fractious in the gate, stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. FIRST IN SHOW pulled
along the inside then stalked a bit off the rail, continue outside a rival on the turn and between horses into the stretch and also weakened.

Footnotes
TARTINI saved ground stalking the pace, came out some for room and waited off heels leaving the second turn and into the stretch, continued waiting while
behind rivals in upper and midstretch and until the sixteenth pole, then came out and surged between foes under some urging to get up. CHALLAH stalked
off the rail then bid between horses on the backstretch and second turn, battled between foes through the stretch and continued gamely to the end to share
the place. ZORICH four wide on the first turn, stalked outside, bid four wide on the second turn and through the stretch, took a short lead in the drive and
continued willingly to the wire. TAKEO sped to the early lead, set the pace inside then dueled along the rail, fought back along the fence through a stiff drive
and also continued gamely. MONGOLIAN LEGEND a step slow into stride, was forced four wide into the first turn, stalked three deep, came four wide into
the stretch and was outfinished. MAYAN WARRIOR had speed between horses then stalked outside a rival, bid three deep on the backstretch and three
wide between foes on the second turn, fought back in the stretch and weakened late. UNBROKEN STAR pulled between horses early then came out into
the first turn, stalked off the rail, angled out into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.

Footnotes
SHE CHERIE bobbled then steadied at the start, settled off the rail chasing the pace, continued outside rival on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch,
was five wide in midstretch rallied under left handed urging to bid outside the runner-up in late stretch and got up in the closing strides. QUEEN
CARMELITA pressed the pace three deep then stalked outside a rival, continued three wide leaving the turn and into the stretch, gained the lead in upper
stretch, inched away in midstretch, fought back in deep stretch and continued gamely to the wire. PROMNESIA saved ground stalking the pace, split horses
in midstretch and edged rivals for the show. JABBER NOW bobbled at the start, pressed the pace between horses then stalked a bit off the rail, was
between foes leaving the turn and into the stretch and in midstretch and was edged for third. DADDY'S MELODY stalked outside a rival on the backstretch
and turn, came four wide into the stretch and was outfinished for a minor share. LAKER JET chased a bit off the rail, drifted to the inside in the stretch and
lacked a rally. DIOSA had speed inside to duel for the lead, inched away a half mile out, set the pace inside, continued along the rail in the stretch and
weakened late.
