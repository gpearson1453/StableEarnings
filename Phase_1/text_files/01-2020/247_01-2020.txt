Footnotes
BAILESTON LASSIE well handled on the lead, nursed along to hold way at wire under stout handling. WELL SPENT just off leaders to stretch, rallied after
leader, in the final furlong while repelled late and best of the rest. SECRETLY WICKED unhurried to turn, raced on wrong lead while lugging from the
quarter pole and stretch run. LAS RAMBLAS just off pace to turn, bid into stretch but flattened out in the drive. RUBY Y'ALL battled for lead to the half,
gradually weakening in the drive. EMELY HEART four wide trip to turn, bid past the quarter pole widest but came up empty. GP'S AMAZING GRACE never
a threat.
