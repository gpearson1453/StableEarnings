Footnotes
BALLIE'S DREAM bumped with HONOLUA BAY at the start, then dashed to the front, rated along clear to mid stretch, and dug in gamely when challenged
by MISS LORETTA through the final stages to prevail. MISS LORETTA chased outside the pacesetter from the start, bid through the last furlong, reached
near-even terms 70 yards out but could not get by. SABINA PARK was bumped between horses at the start, saved ground in the second flight to the
stretch, and finished willingly on the rail. NERISSA bumped with SABINA PARK at the start, saved ground on the turn, moved out for the drive with aim in
the three-path, but did not have enough. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB raced four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed late bid. HONOLUA BAY was
bumped between horses at the start, lagged well back two wide to the stretch, and improved position without threatening. COMMANDER GRACE was no
factor inside. BEV'S STRENGTH was no factor three wide. CULTIVATION faded steadily after three furlongs. WHER'D DA LOVE GO chased after the
leaders three wide on the turn, steadied in upper stretch and dropped back.

Footnotes
VARSOVIA rated two to three wide not far off the early pace, launched a four wide bid entering the turn, circled up to challenge IMPRESSION GIVEN for the
lead near the quarter pole, assumed command then drifted out under left handed urging, prompted right handed, straightened out and finished going away.
SNAKE N SHAKE broke out and bumped with foe at the start then positioned forwardly along the inside, was patiently handled near the inside around the
far turn then angled out turning for home, continued a steady bid through the lane and got up late for place. IMPRESSION GIVEN sped to the lead and set
the pace down the backstretch, fought back when challenged by VASOVIA near the quarter pole then failed to match strides with rival top of the lane, kept
on then got edged out late for place. DIXIELAND HUMOR got bumped between foes and came away last at the start, headed in pursuit entering the turn,
advanced along the outside to range in range near the quarter pole, came out wider and flattened upper stretch then stayed on evenly. AUNT IRENE raced
in contention between foes in the flight off the leader at the half mile marker then failed to sustain bid near the three eighths pole and steadily retreated.
MAMA JO showed response in early stages then retreated after the half mile marker. LADY ALIDETT raced in early contention chasing the front runner then
faltered in the turn, got pulled up after the race and unsaddled then walked off.

DARK AGES bumped with SHANGHAI LEVI at the start, then brushed lightly with WHAT'S TO BLAME, tracked the pace three wide into the turn, wrested
command outside SHANGHAI LEVI turning for home while angling well out in the course, battled shoulder to shoulder inside WHAT'S TO BLAME through
the last eighth of a mile while shifting out a bit further, and gamely prevailed. WHAT'S TO BLAME leaned in at the start and had to be pulled off DARK
AGES to get away a step slow, moved inside tracking the top three into the turn, shifted out and ranged up outside DARK AGES approaching the stretch,
battled with that one while getting carried out slightly through the last furlong and came up just short. SHANGHAI LEVI bumped with DARK AGES at the
start, vied into the turn between that one and BROADCAST TIME, stayed on to the furlong grounds and gave way. BROADCAST TIME contested the pace
inside SHANGHAI LEVI and DARK AGES into the turn, could not keep pace leaving the quarter-pole and faded steadily. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE
WINNER BY THE RIDER OF WHAT'S TO BLAME FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

GAME BOY BENNY tracked the pair of embattled leaders through early stages, raced near the inside and put to a drive at the quarter pole, switched out a
path top of the lane, remained in steady pursuit for ATTHEPEARLYGATES and drew clear in final stages. ATTHEPEARLYGATES dueled for the lead out of
the gate and continued to battle into the turn, held a slight edge at the quarter pole then shook free turning for home, dug in determinedly under pressure in
the final furlong then got wore down in final stages. MOON PISTOL raced off the top two flights at the half mile marker, coaxed around the turn, raced in
range and continued a steady effort under pressure and got a nose up for show. KORCZAK vied for the lead out of the gate and continued to battle with
ATTHEPEARLYGATES into the turn, could not move on for the lead top stretch but stayed on with response then got nipped for show. BIG HAMBONE was
forwardly placed racing just off the embattled top pair, remained in strong contention entering the turn, given cue three wide at the quarter pole but failed to
kick on then gave way.

Footnotes
HATS OFF TOO YOU saved ground within range for three furlongs, shifted to the two-path to go after YOUNG RAYMOND at the top of the stretch, and ran
that one down through the late stages to win going away. YOUNG RAYMOND sped to the front at the start, rated along clear to mid stretch, but could not
withstand the top one while able to hold the place. WORDMAN raced in the middle of the pack for three furlongs, angled out in upper stretch and rallied to
best the remainder. DUNMORE TOWN saved ground throughout, and gained mildly through the lane without threatening. RED ASTAIRE raced two wide
around the turn, and lacked a late response. WHO IS JARETT chased outside YOUNG RAYMOND to the stretch, and faded. STONECASTLE had the
two-path on the turn, and did not factor. STROLL FOR GOLD broke slowly, and showed little at the back throughout.

NOON TIME GEM tracked the top trio while saving ground down the backstretch, angled out and launched a bid entering the turn, loomed up late turn to
challenge EARLY ENTRY for the lead, vied along the outside with rival holding a slight edge, dug in determinedly, got carried out wider then forged ahead
deep stretch. EARLY ENTRY vied for the lead with SENSATIONAL RIDE down the backstretch, shook free and led the way entering the turn then took on
the challenge from NOON TIME GEM turning for home, battled back into stretch run holding a slight edge, kept on gamely under pressure, came out wider
and got edged out in final strides. STONE HANDS stalked the top two leaders through early stages, hustled up for more near the inside then waited briefly
leaving the turn, shifted to the outside and set down for the drive, continued a solid effort but lacked the needed kick to get by. SENSATIONAL RIDE vied for
the lead with EARLY ENTRY out of the gate and continued to race near equal footing through early stages, could not move on for the lead entering the turn
then gave way. MR. JORDAN was reserved in the back along the outside, moved inside and prompted right handed upper stretch but had no response.

Footnotes
HARTLING prompted the pace outside ALAFIA, took over after six furlongs, moved inside and drew off through the stretch under pressure. BEASAICHI
stayed close inside to the far turn, moved to the two-path approaching the stretch, and finished willingly though unable to menace the winner. DUNIVERSE
saved ground early in the second flight, advanced a bit while swinging three or four wide at the top of the stretch, and rallied mildly. LADY NOGUEZ raced
three wide, came under a ride midway on the far turn gaining just a bit, but lacked a solid closing kick with an even finish. LOVELY BROWN awaited room
around the far turn inside, went around a tiring ALAFIA in upper stretch, moved back to the rail and finished one-paced. MIDNIGHT GEM went along in the
middle of the field to the far turn, moved well out in the course four or five wide into the lane, and could not gain late. LA VENEZOLANA (VEN) raced in the
second flight while saving ground, moved out in the stretch and failed to become a factor. ALAFIA cleared to the inside with the early lead, got collared by
the winner after six furlongs, and retreated on the rail. GABY'S DREAM took a bad step midway on the first turn, got pulled up entering the backstretch
favoring her right front, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
MEMORIZE was sent hard in opening stages to take control over the early lead, continued clear on top around the turn, widened to a commanding margin
at the furlong marker then kept clear along the inside under right-handed pressure. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE was allowed to settle in early stages, prompted
around the turn then shifted out wider leaving the quarter pole, raced wide under a drive upper stretch then switched in a few paths, stayed on with
response, was no match for the clear leader but secured second best. BABY ICE was off to good start and tracked the pacesetter racing between foes,
coaxed two wide around the turn then continued a steady bid and stayed on for share. TUESDAY'S ROSE raced two to three wide positioned off the second
flight at the half mile marker, urged for response on the turn then shifted to the outside entering top stretch and had a mild improve. SHALL RETURN was
off sluggish at the start and remained in the back, was under a ride late turn then pushed along two path at the furlong marker and lacked the needed
response for late impact. POCKET OF CANDY was forwardly placed and chased the leader along the inside through early stages, kept on with response
upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. RIGHT ON raced in contention between foes through early stages, continued a three wide around the turn
then failed to sustain bid and gave way in the lane. SALSA RITA raced in contention along the outside in early stages, put to a drive around the turn but
failed to move on then faded

Footnotes
BACCHANALIA saved ground early in the second flight, began moving after six furlongs while swinging out five wide, rallied steadily through the lane and
was along in time outside rivals. CAP DE CREUS bumped lightly with ON THE TOWN at the start, stayed in range four wide to the far turn, bid outside
CIVIL UNION past the quarter-pole and through the stretch, and fought gamely to the finish between horses. CIVIL UNION was forwardly placed outside
from the start, challenged in the three-path a quarter-mile out, dueled inside CAP DE CREUS through the lane and was edged to the wire. WHISPERING
BEAUTY saved ground in range to the far turn, angled wide at the top of the stretch and closed late outside. ON THE TOWN was bumped lightly between
horses at the start, rallied four wide coming off the far turn to loom a threat, lugged in approaching the eighth-pole and flattened out. MONHEGAN was
prominent early three wide, dropped back a bit entering the backstretch, failed to quicken appreciably when roused between horses into the far turn, and
went evenly late inside. SISTER KITTEN was outrun to the stretch toward the inside, entered the lane in the two-path and gained mildly while not a factor.
SINWAAN spent much of the race in the four-path, and could not reach contention. STEFANIE ON FLEEK vied two wide from the outset, came under attack
approaching the stretch, and gave way inside. WHATDOESASHARKSAY bumped lightly with ON THE TOWN at the start, stayed in range two wide for six
furlongs, and dropped back. MERCY MERCY vied inside early, stayed close for six furlongs, and faltered. TRISH THE DISH dropped far back after six
furlongs.
