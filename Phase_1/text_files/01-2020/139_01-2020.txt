came up empty. MYBESTISYETTOCOME broke awkwardly, raced outside in an even effort and did not threaten. DEPUTY MATT raced mid pack and

COCO LOCO MAMA was never far back, angled out at the top of the lane, bid eight wide, closed steadily and wore down her rival to get up late.
DESTINY'S STORM assumed command on the turn, drew off for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. SHESAIDSHESPERFECT raced
close to the pace, bid five wide, failed to rally and settled for show. WHISKERJULEP broke out, saved ground while in close, lacked a stretch response and
faded. SURF THE TURF raced mid pack, bid nine wide and came up empty. CHICKA LINA set a pressured pace, dropped back on the turn and gave way.
NOT TO CODE was fractious in the paddock and post parade, broke slowly and was in traffic late. MISTICAL MEADOW raced in the back, swung wide
leaving the turn and lacked a bid. TIZ A DREAMER failed to contend.

Footnotes
MISS PERFECTA raced close to the pace, got through along the inside on the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and held safely under mild
urging. POCO SUENOS was unhurried early, saved ground, advanced to the turn, awaited room, got through along the inside, bid willingly, couldn't gain
and was no match for the winner. LESEDI was never far back, awaited room leaving the turn and offered a mild bid to earn show. HERE'SLOOKINATYA
advanced to the second turn, went five wide entering the stretch and had nothing left for the drive. HONOURAPRILSRULES trailed the field, closed inside
and improved position. DEEP 'N' IT set the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. FRANCES ANNA stalked the pace to the second turn, stopped,
was eased late and walked off. CASHMERE BLISS got boxed in along the backstretch, was taken back, stopped, was eased late and walked off. Fractional
split removed by Equibase.
