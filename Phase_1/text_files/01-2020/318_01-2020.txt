Footnotes
MOTI began to advance between horses on the backstretch, lodged a strong two wide bid outside the early leader before three-quarters, lugged in under
right hand whip through early stretch bumping JACK BO repeatedly then drew out in midstretch. Following an objection by Silvera, MOTI was disqualified
and placed second. JACK BO opened a clear lead soon after the break, was rated close to the inside, was steadied when bumped repeatedly through early
stretch then weakened. BRAVE DEACON ran out while not far back into the first turn, raced two wide between horses into the far turn then tired.
EASTPORT steadied when BRAVE DEACON ran out entering the first turn, wasn't far back along the rail to the far turn then stopped. BOOMBA BRAD was
outrun. PIPPIN was caught in the four path around the first turn, wasn't far back in the three path between horses into the far turn then stopped.
SILVERZAR steadied along the rail into the first turn then was outrun.

Footnotes
MERROW established a clear lead into the turn while staying off of the rail, widened her advantage while drifting outwards in upper stretch, and held sway
through the late stages while continuing to drift under driving pressure. JEALOUS HEART took the turn in the four to five path while outside of rivals, and
made a grinding rally for place while closing the gap on the leader. DAMISELA chased the loose leader around the turn, attempted a two wide bid in the
three path turning for home, but got outkicked by the leader in upper stretch and weakened while hanging on her left lead. MISS CINDERELLA was a bit
antsy in the gate, raced far off the pace in the four path around the turn, and made a mild rally outside of rivals through the lane. CANDY PANTS saved
ground while far off the pace and failed to threaten. LIZ'S PARTY GIRL saved ground while midpack, but to no avail. SIX PACK GAL stalked in the three to
four path around the turn, but weakened turning for home. HORIZON trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
RICK'S SURPRISE was unhurried, began a run between horses after a half, rallied the two path around the final turn, angled out between horses for room
entering the final furlong, had to come out further past midstretch and quickly drove clear late. SCURLIN chased the early leader two wide, moved outside
that foe midway on the final turn, opened a short lead leaving the furlong grounds while bearing out under left hand whip then couldn't stay late with the
winner. SWIVEL wasn't far back between horses early, raced the three path around the final turn, edged closer outside the winner in early stretch then
flattened out. THERE HE GOES didn't break sharply, was hustled to a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed close to the rail for over three-quarters, ran
out entering the stretch and weakened. THE ACCUSER was slow to settle, made a run in the two path around the final turn, angled to the rail in early
stretch then flattened out. NIGHT SPREE raced wide around both turns and failed to matter. BRIGHT BLUE was outrun. UNCLE ARCHIE briefly showed
speed inside, stopped and was eased up through the lane. MINISTERSDONTPARTY wasn't far back three wide to the far turn, stopped and was eased up
through the lane.

Footnotes
I GOT A ROCK reared in the gate, then broke on top and set the pace from the two path, built a clear advantage into the turn before meeting a challenge
from ANYTIME ANYPLACE at the quarter pole, but repelled that foe in upper stretch and held sway under driving pressure. ANYTIME ANYPLACE stalked
close to the pace in the three path between horses, inched forward to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but flattened out and was repelled in upper stretch,
then held place through the lane over an inner rival. CUMBERLAND GAP angled to the rail from midpack turning for home, made a rail bid through
midstretch inside of the leaders, but did not have enough. CHEESE ON stalked close to the leader inside of a group of rivals, vacated the rail passing the
quarter pole to make a bid for the lead in the four path turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch and failed to make any headway. YOUR
SECRET'S SAFE brushed with an inner foe at the start and trailed the field by a distance down the backstretch, closed the gap on the field around the turn,
but waited behind rivals when angled to the four path turning for home, then split those foes approaching the furlong pole, and showed some late interest.
CACTUS JACK was fractious in the gate before the gates opened, then saved ground from midpack through the turn, but to no avail. HUNTINGTON DRIVE
prompted the pace in the five path and outside of horses while pulling under a tight hold, but weakened turning for home. MR. POSITIVE was close to the
pace between rivals in the four path, but weakened between horses passing the quarter pole. ROCKIN COWBOY was outrun in the six path, and was eased
up through the late stages.

Footnotes
SENOR RICCI brushed with ME DARLIN CHESSIE while dueling along the rail on the backstretch, drew out midway on the turn and was kept to urging.
PENNSYLVANIA STEEL went in the air in the gate at the break, began a run in the four path into the turn, angled sharply to the inside approaching the lane
and gained to the end. UNSUNG HERO wasn't far back in the three path and continued evenly under a hand ride. PURRS WELL ducked out into CASTLE
SMOKE leaving the gate, was slow early, swung wide into the stretch and made up some ground. CASTLE SMOKE was bumped then ducked out sharply
leaving the gate, was widest into the stretch and gained some. WHERE'S THE BEN'S stayed inside and tired. ME DARLIN CHESSIE brushed with the
winner while urged to duel outside that one on the backstretch, was eased up leaving the turn and returned with the saddle slipped back.

Footnotes
GRAY GARY set a moderately quick pace along the inside, met a challenge from SHANGHAISCHOOL around the turn, but repelled him in upper stretch,
then drew off approaching the furlong pole under driving pressure. BABY BULL stalked three wide around the first turn, backed off and got outmoved by
SHANGHAISCHOOL into the far turn, was put to a drive to gain slightly to striking range in the four path around the far turn, but drifted outwards and got
outkicked in upper stretch, then showed some late interest to rally for place in the late stages. THUNDER DAY had a slow start and trailed the field by a
distance into the backstretch, advanced position from the three path around the far turn, then angled towards the inside in upper stretch and offered a mild
rally inside of leading foes, but missed place. SHANGHAISCHOOL was caught five wide around the first turn, pursued the leader from outside of horses
down the backstretch, came under coaxing to advance position into the far turn, responded and bid for the lead outside of the leader in the three path, but
flattened out in upper stretch and weakened late to miss minor rewards. RUNNINGFORHOME slightly advanced position outside of horses in the five to six
path around the far turn, but failed to menace. MY DEVILS CHILD was caught four wide between horses around the first turn, backed out and angled to the
rail down the backstretch, but weakened further into the far turn and failed to make an impact. MUNSOOR prompted the leader two wide and between
horses around the first turn, then failed to keep pace into the far turn, steadily faded without encouragement from the rider around that bend, then was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY BULL advanced the rail into tight quarters behind the first flight entering the turn, got clear entering the stretch, bid inside and was narrowly best.
SUCCESS HURRICANE bumped with TWICEASLUCKY leaving the gate, made a wide run around the turn, raced five wide into the stretch, was on near
even terms on the front end into late stretch but was outfinished. TIGER ALLEY was fractious in the gate, stayed close to the inside with the early lead, ran
out some entering the stretch and gave way in the drive. WHOSE BABY IS THAT had position from the outset, moved closer three wide on the turn, swung
four wide into the stretch while dueling then gave way. TWICEASLUCKY bumped with SUCCESS HURRICANE leaving the gate, was slow early, circled
into the stretch and made up ground outside. SILVER DUKE broke slowly, steadied soon after, lagged early, swung wide into the stretch and finished
willingly between horses. SILENT ALARM was hustled early to chase the pace, moved to vie two wide between horses on the turn then weakened.
FOREST GATOR wasn't far back between horses early then tired. Off time was delayed several minutes due to an equipment adjustment to
TWICEASLUCKY.

Footnotes
RAG TOP rated far off the pace, saved ground through the turns before shifting to the four path at the quarter pole, came into the lane in the five path and
outside of the leaders, and rallied past to reach the lead approaching the wire. B B'S BUSTED saved ground from midpack, commenced a rally inside of
rivals into the far turn, squeezed through tight quarters at the five sixteenths pole, made a rail bid for the lead in upper stretch, reached the front passing the
furlong pole, but was caught by an outer rallying rival approaching the wire. FALCON'S VIEW dueled inside of DAZZLE ME while staying in the two path,
dug in turning for home but left the rail open for B B'S BUSTED, was headed by that foe passing the furlong pole, then gave way between horses late.
JANELLE DREAMS shifted to the six path turning for home and mildly rallied passed tired horses. DAZZLE ME dueled outside of FALCON'S VIEW while
being kept in the three path by that rival, but weakened in upper stretch and faded. LITTLE SONG stalked from the pocket, but was put to an all out drive to
keep pace into the far turn, but had no response. BIG BAD RED was forwardly placed in the three path between horses, but weakened in upper stretch.
ECHO BAY saved ground while trailing, but failed to get involved. IVANYA was caught five wide around both turns in midpack, but weakened around the far
turn. ABUELA LOCA prompted the pace from the four path early on, but weakened and readily faded into the far turn before being eased through the lane.
