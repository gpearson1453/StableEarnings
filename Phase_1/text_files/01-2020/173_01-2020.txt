FINDING VALUE pressed the pace, moved up on the outside around the turn, dueled down the stretch with SPACE COWGIRL and proved the best late.
SPACE COWGIRL challenged for the early lead, dueled throughout, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. WARRIORS SPEAK vied for the
early lead, forwardly placed throughout, but couldn't keep up with the top two deep in the stretch. CHATAIN'S FLYER raced in the middle of the field and put
forth an even effort. RIVETRIX lacked early speed, moved up four wide around the turn, showed late interest, but was no factor. ROSE LARUE always
raced near the back and was never a threat. MY PLEDGER dueled for the early advantage and made a steady retreat. ONE SPECIAL ONE raced in the
back of the pack, trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF CALEDON raced within contention, coming around the first turn four wide, moved up between rivals around the final turn, drove clear down the
stretch and finished under urging. DRY WOOD CREEK pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a
clear second. OVERNIGHT STAY unhurried in the early part, moved up three wide around the second turn, made a bid and got up for the show.
CHAOSMOS went to the front, drove clear and tired. MR. BANDINI'S BAND raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn four wide, moved
up, but was no factor. RUNAROUNDDANCING lacked early speed, had a wide trip and was never a threat. RIDE A SAINT raced within striking distance
and made a steady retreat. SUMMER APPEAL challenged for the early lead and was finished early. A WE BIT FLIRTY void of early speed and was never
close. ROSE NEEDS A CHECK trailed throughout and showed little.

MY LITTLE SPITFIRE raced within striking distance, moved up four wide around the final turn, drove clear entering the home stretch and won under strong
urging. LUCKY LITTLE LADY dueled with SNEAKY FREAK for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but
held off AMERICAN MOM for second. AMERICAN MOM lacked early speed, made a late rally and missed second. HALO'S SONG raced evenly near the
back, moved up, but was no factor. JEWELED CROWN broke out, raced within contention, came around the final turn three wide, faded and was no threat
late. SNEAKY FREAK dueled for the early lead, saved ground and was finished early. AUNT JANA always raced near the back and showed little.

LADY C unhurried in the early part, moved up, three wide around the final turn, drove clear down the stretch and finished well. FOUR PRINCESSES lacked
early speed, racing six wide around the first turn, moved up, made a late rally and closed willingly. KARATE HOTTIE pressed the early pace, racing four
wide around the first turn, took the advantage around the final turn, shortened stride down the stretch, having had enough. REACHREACHREACH raced
within contention, forwardly placed throughout and faded down the stretch. INDIAN GEM void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor.
WHISPER SOFTLY always raced near the back and showed little. MIAMI ROSE dueled on the front end and dropped back. KATIEBMEISTER challenged
for the early lead and stopped.

Footnotes
FREEDOMFI unhurried in the beginning, moved up four wide around the final turn, dueled with TOO MUCH BOURBON down the lane and drove clear
before the wire. TOO MUCH BOURBON raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the final stretch with FREEDOMFI, couldn't
match strides, but was best of others. LOUISIANA HERO lacked early speed, made a late gain, racing wide and proved third best. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE
challenged for the early lead and faded. FAST VERDICT hesitated at the start, racing in the back, showed late interest, but was no factor. BAYOU JAM
raced near the middle of the field, weakened and was no threat late. TONI'S STAR raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn and
dropped back. SOUL SONG sprinted to the front, took command, faltered and retreated to the back.

Footnotes
DEEP END brushed at the start, racing in the back, moved up on the outside down the backside, rallied around the turn and drove clear before the wire.
ANY OLE THING brushed at the beginning, racing near the back, made a late wide bid and got up for second. REALMENTE CALMADA raced within
striking distance, made a late try and was outfinished for the place position. DR. FRANKIE KAYE void of early speed, moved up five wide around the
second turn, made a late rally and finished willingly. HOPEITSAMIRACLE broke out, straightened up by rider, pressed the pace and lacked a late kick.
PALEEZE raced evenly in the middle of the field in the early going, steadied on the inside down the home stretch, lacked room to run and was no threat late.
WEAVEMEAWINR lacked early speed, came around the second turn wide and was never a factor. CHARLOTTE'S WISH pressed the early pace and
dropped back. CASUAL COOL went to the front, drove clear and retreated to the rear. SELENE'S ARGUMENT challenged for the early lead and stopped.
