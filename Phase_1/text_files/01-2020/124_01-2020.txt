Footnotes
IRISH CORK broke alertly and was under urging leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside MARKET MOVER, overtook that one mid way on the
turn, eagerly pulled away and was under brisk urging in mid stretch. ORDER FOR PORKY lacked speed, raced slightly off the rail around the turn, swung
outside in mid stretch and rallied. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN chased the pace three wide around the turn and faded through the stretch. MARKET MOVER
showed speed along the rail and weakened. SUPER DANCER was done early and fell back. MY FRIEND CASPER was outrun.

Footnotes
TEAM EFFORT prompted the pace three wide outside a rival, cruised clear leaving the three eighths, responded when asked in upper stretch, widened and
was under strong handling to the sixteenth marker. DYNA'S KNIGHT settled off the inside, angled out mid turn, circled five wide into the lane, kept on
grinding through the final furlong and out kicked LOTTO for the place. LOTTO stalked inside, eased out and moved up between rivals nearing the lane,
wandered outward a bit in the final sixteenth and gave way grudgingly. STAND MY GROUND saved ground mid turn, angled three wide into the lane but
lacked a response. PLAY BOY SKOAL took command early but was hounded from the outside, ceded to the winner mid turn and tired in upper stretch. GO
LOVER stalked off the rail, was under pressure four wide into the lane and gave way.

LA MAQUINA GRIS stalked the pace three wide outside a pair of rivals, took closer order past the five sixteenths, engaged the leader into the lane,
responded when set down past the three sixteenths, gained a slim lead while dueling under left handed rousing past the furlong grounds then edged clear in
the final yards. MIDNIGHT CRY assumed command at once, set the pace towards the rail, drifted off the inside when meeting the winner's bid approaching
the stretch, corrected and dueled with that one past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. BATTLE READY edged up between rivals soon after
the start, tracked the pace two wide, dropped off the leaders a bit nearing the lane, shifted out and continued willingly while just missing second. FINBAR
flashed speed inside, dropped back leaving the far turn, came out for the drive but failed to generate a solid run. MACHO MIAH dropped back early on, was
taken wide past the five eighths, continued wide and failed to threaten. SOCIAL MEDIA gave early chase in about the two path, eased back near the half
then faded. TOP CZAR was lightly steadied at the break and away last, raced wide off the early pace, angled in and could not recover.

FIVE CARD DRAW saved ground chasing the leaders, cut the corner into the lane, leveled off under right handed rousing heading towards the eighth pole,
surged inside to command near the sixteenth marker and eagerly widened. CREATED SPECIAL broke a step slow then pulled his way forward, gave
pursuit outside the winner mid turn, shifted out for the drive and continued with interest to nab the place. EVELYN'S HORSEPLAY tracked the leaders four
wide, bid in hand mid turn, gained a short lead dueling outside METAL MAGICIAN in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong grounds, was confronted
heading to the sixteenth marker then faded very late. METAL MAGICIAN vied in the three path, gained a short lead between foes mid turn, battled to the
inside of EVELYN'S HORSEPLAY leaving the three sixteenths then weakened in the final fifty yards. TOP HAT SCRUTINY accelerated inside to a short
lead, set a pressured pace in the two path, was headed leaving the three eighths, remained forward after shifted out into the lane, chased past mid stretch
and faded. GALLINIPPER was outrun. TALE OF DIXIE dwelt at the break, raced far back into the turn, saved ground into the stretch and had belated action.
There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action was taken

TRULY HOT , nudged along towards the inside, eased out in upper stretch, rallied between rivals to take command inside the sixteenth marker then was
fully extended to hold off an outside bid from DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN. DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN settled off the pace, angled four to five wide for the drive,
closed steadily but wasn't quite good enough. HASHTAG SELFIE prompted the pace outside DAT DARES GOLD, wrested command soon into the lane,
shook clear under a drive in mid stretch but failed to hold in the final seventy yards. THESWEETESTTABOO chased the leaders three to four wide and
faded in the final sixteenth. DAT DARES GOLD sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was hounded after a quarter mile, dueled from mid turn to
upper stretch, stayed willingly to about the furlong grounds then gave way. SHECOR , off the pace, raced five to six wide into the stretch but lacked a
response.
