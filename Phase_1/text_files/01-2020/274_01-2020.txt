Footnotes
MADAME MOUSSE chased briefly then cleared outside rivals, set the pace up the backstretch, led from the two path into the lane and padded the lead to
the wire. MY PROJECT GIRL chased from the inside, two to three wide into the stretch and held the place. CUTE TALKER chased the pacesetter four
deep, three to four wide on the turn and finished evenly for the show. AIMING STRAIGHT chased between rivals, moved over to the inside and saved
ground into the lane but lacked the needed rally. AMERICAN HEART tossed her head and hopped slightly at the start, trailed the field from off the rail, two
wide leaving the bend showed no response. SHARPEST ONE chased three deep and between rivals early, continued between rivals on the turn then
shifted out nearing the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CHARMING WEEKEND pressed from the inside, chased the top pair around the turn, re-bid in the lane and proved best under urging. PRINCESS RUN IT
dueled with rival from off the rail, led three wide nearing the eighth pole, shifted out in the upper stretch, met the challenge from CHARMING WEEKEND but
could not match the winner in the final sixteenth. VIDALIA stalked the pace from the inside, lacked room from the inside on the turn, saved ground into the
lane and finished willingly to earn the show. UNCHANGED outside a rival in the early going, angled four wide on the turn and failed to rally.
BETDESILVERGOLD dueled with PRINCESS RUN IT into and around the turn, bothered briefly from that rival who shifted out in the upper stretch and
weakened after.
