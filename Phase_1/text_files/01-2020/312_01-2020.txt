Footnotes
SYDSTER was hustled to the front, went around the first turn in the three path while in hand, drew off to a sizable advantage on the backstretch, had the
rider take a peak behind him outside the half-mile pole, remained clear in the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, was
put to the whip at the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. ATTA BOUY was taken in hand early, dropped from the two
path to the inside on the first turn, was rated under a snug hold, came under urging while inside to the two path on the far turn, swung out four wide into the
stretch then was guided a path further out, switched to the proper lead at the three-sixteenths then was quickly put to a left-handed whip, pursued the winner
under a drive and finished willingly while second best. SOCIAL AFLEET went four wide while in hand on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, dropped
to the rail early on the far turn, came out into the stretch then dropped back in again outside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.
LOUISIANA HERO saved ground under a tight hold on the first turn then was reserved near the back, went three then four wide under urging on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TOO MUCH BOURBON went around the first turn in the two path while in hand then was rated off the
pace, came under urging leaving the backstretch, was ridden along in the three path on the far turn and came up empty. HEZA PRIORITY went four wide on
the first turn, was rated on the outside, passed the half-mile pole under urging, fell back while five wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
PRINCE PIERCE bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along in the three path on the turn, moved closer into the stretch, came
out behind horses then was roused around the three-sixteenths, lugged in near the furlong marker, rallied under a left-handed while dropping to the rail and
closed determinedly to get up late. RIV bumped with a rival at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, chased four to five wide on the turn, made an
outside bid in upper stretch, took a slim advantage into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. NIIGON'S
GLORY was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, angled out between the three-sixteenths and the furlong marker then lacked the needed
kick while just able to get the show. SONOMA CRUSH showed speed on the outside then tracked the pace, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the
three to four path on the turn, took the lead into the stretch, lost the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. HANDFUL OF STRIPES
was hustled to the lead, set the pace while inside to the two path, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, was crowded while dropping back into the final furlong
and tired. ALITTLEVODKA broke through the front of the gate prior to the break, was brought back around and reloaded, bumped with foes on both sides at
the start, was urged along on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
SENOR BLAIR was lightly brushed at the break, coaxed forward to track along the inside, saved ground through the turn and was put to urging outside the
quarter pole, bid up the inside taking over just past the furlong marker, kicked clear under steady handling and was taken in hand very late once safely clear.
MAKING A MARC broke outwardly lightly brushing the aforementioned, settled last but one early, rode the rail through the turn gradually picking it up,
shifted out a path turning for home then gradually made it four wide by the eighth-pole, found room and ran on to capture the place. CARSON KAN stalked
from outside in the early going, went three wide on the turn edging closer on that bend, asked near the quarter pole and made a mild bid taking a narrow
lead in upper stretch but could not sustain the effort late. FLATTER THE QUEEN settled inside, was moved out off the fence late up the backstretch, went
two to three wide and inside a foe on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then out a further path and hard-driven but failed to sustain a bid. FAFA was
lightly bumped at the break, raced between foes early then continued the pursuit racing off the fence, was encouraged along three then four wide on the
turn, shifted widest of all seven deep near the three-sixteenths pole and ran on. WOMAN WITH A BOOK bobbled outwardly into a rival then corrected and
bumped the inside foe at the start, trailed racing in about the three to four path into and on the turn and was never close enough to threaten. SHOGOOD
was urged forward at the break, set the pace from the two path, faced challengers inside and out in upper stretch then gave way and faded. WARRIOR'S
KID was bumped at the break, stalked outside the middle group early going four wide on the turn, came out a path into upper stretch and came up empty.

five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch, rallied to make a bid around the three-sixteenths, fought inside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth
then overhauled that foe under a right-handed whip to prevail. COLOR ME PRETTY went three wide on the first turn, was reserved while last but one,
moved closer then stalked the leading trio in the three path on the far turn, was given her cue inside the five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, rallied six
wide into the stretch, closed fast on the outside to get the lead at the three-sixteenths, led under a right-handed whip while battling with the winner into the
final sixteenth then was overtaken but held the place. SOARING NOW went around the first turn in the four path, contested the pace inside of one foe and
outside of another while having multiple paths between those foes, vied in the three path on the far turn, was asked nearing the three-sixteenths the last of
the field to do so, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while brushing with THAI CHILI SUE
then held the show. THAI CHILI SUE bumped with a rival at the start, contested the pace on the inside, was asked at the five-sixteenths, fought under a
drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened then brushed with SOARING NOW late. BREEZY BEE bumped with a rival at the
start then was snatched up with the left rein, quickly drifted to the outside of the field, went five to six wide on the first turn, moved up on the far outside to
contest the pace, vied in the six path early on the far turn then dropped to the four path, moved to five wide outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under a

CITIBIKE broke outwardly bumping the outside rival, was briefly urged forward and set the pace racing removed from the rail, continued on a clear lead in
the two path through the turn, shaken up and asked for more into upper stretch, extended the advantage and held sway while kept to task. SWEET CARLI
was bumped at the break, stalked the winner from outside going three wide on the turn, was asked for more outside the five-sixteenths but could make no
headway while clearly second best. COLOR FASHIONED was slow into stride, raced unhurried at the rear in the two then three path on the turn, came into
upper stretch five wide and improved position. CRY LIKE A BABY tucked in to the rail early, saved ground on the turn but was unable to threaten. HERO OF
GOLD pursued the leading pair briefly from off the inside, went in the three to four path on the turn and came up empty in the stretch.

advantage outside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. BREAKFAST POND was reserved in
the two path on the first turn, moved closer with five furlongs to run, chased while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch

Footnotes
J D'S GIRL got away slowly and was pinched back at the start then altered out, moved forward outside rivals going four wide into the turn, took closer order
leaving that bend, drew nearly even with the leader near the sixteenth pole then surged past under steady handling. DAAHERACHEL broke outwardly then
moved forward inside rivals to set the pace racing just off the fence, continued on or just off the rail through the turn with a clear advantage coming out of
that bend, was challenged in mid-stretch, fought on but yielded grudgingly. WEIGHTLESSNESS was forced out just a touch at the break and a half-step
slow, tucked in behind the leaders to track inside, asked for more about the five-sixteenths pole but could only keep on evenly in the drive to capture show
honors. ALTERED DREAM hopped at the start and was off about a couple lengths slow, trailed early racing off the inside, entered the turn in the three path
then quickly shifted in to the rail nearing the three-eighths pole, began to advance along the inside under urging past the five-sixteenths, angled five wide at
the top of the stretch getting nearer to striking distance but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. NO TIME TO PLAY raced off the leaders in about
the two to three path early and through the turn, failed to rally. CARRY THE ONE exchanged a solid bump at the start, was in close stalking the pacesetter,
went two to three wide on the turn and was briefly between rivals late on that bend before switching out four deep approaching the quarter pole, came up
empty in the lane and was protected late. ALITTLEBITEXTRA exchanged contact with the aforementioned, was outside rivals four wide on the turn, came
out a further two paths in upper stretch then dropped back and faded.

the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch,

went around the turn in the four then five path, was carried six wide into the stretch, pursued the top two while outside in the drive and finished willingly for
the show. A SONG FOR ARCH was hustled from the start then taken in hand early and rated off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked at

Footnotes
SWIMHARD DREAMBIG was ridden along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail under a drive into upper stretch, moved out while
gaining between the three-sixteenths and the furlong marker, drifted out while closing around the sixteenth-pole and went by the tired runner-up late to win
going away. PRAY FOR LISA showed good speed then dropped just off the pace, gained in the three path early on the turn, took the lead at the
three-eighths, moved clear while four wide into upper stretch, extended the advantage while still on her inside lead into the final furlong, remained clear on
her inside lead while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and was overtaken while clear for the place. SHEZA MEAN BROAD was fractious behind the
gate, raced on the outside while urged along, went four wide into the turn then dropped to three wide, drifted out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked
the needed response while able to get the show. RED RIVER CHASE broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the
turn and improved position to get the last spot in the superfecta. MANE PRIORITY showed good speed and disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied
along the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths, dropped back into the stretch and tired. OUR SWEET DAISY was urged along off the pace, went
five wide on the turn and failed to respond. THE LAST GIG settled off the pace, was urged along while three to four wide for most of the turn, floated six
wide outside the quarter-pole and also failed to respond. JOEY G showed speed on the outside and disputed the pace, dropped back while floating from
four to six wide on the turn and faltered then was not urged in the final furlong. QUEEN E tossed her head while taken up badly at the start, went five to six
wide on the turn and was no factor.
