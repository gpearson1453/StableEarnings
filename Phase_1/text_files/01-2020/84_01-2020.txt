Footnotes
MANNFORD sharp speed outside, maintained control, ran off and held sway as much the best. TALE OF FAME never far back, between horses out of the
turn wit a good run while no match, clearly best of the rest. DREAM SATURDAY inside to turn, floated into the five path stretch and mildly for the show spot.
STARRY MESSENGER chased winner to the turn, faltered through the stretch. SOUL OF DISCRETION unhurried early, three wide out of turn, no late gain.
CHUCKMATE no speed to turn, floated six wide, never a threat. TEE TEE close with leaders to the turn, gave way readily.

Footnotes
LADY'S WEEKEND awkward start, advanced outside, all out drive to hang on. MASON A. P. pressed leader to stretch, caught in in tight in the late stages,
lost position, came back and just nipped on the wire. STATESBORO no speed to the turn with an off rail run late on the wrong lead and finished well. BIG
IRON speed to the front, dug in game through the stretch with a good effort. GENERAL DIRECTION raced evenly throughout with no response in the drive.
YONDERING never a factor. BARITONE never threatened. TOWN DRUNK awkward start, recovered to stay close to half, used up, folded. MIDLAND
stumbled badly at the start, rushed early and backed up readily. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER WAS
DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
FLASH N' DANCE inside speed, headed at the half, responded well and ran off under mild urging in the final furlong. REDHOT KATIE pressed winner three
wide, garnered a brief short lead but no match stretch while clearly best of the rest. DETOUR never far back to far turn, turned for home well off rail for the
third spot. YOU PEOPLE no speed to the turn, rallied along to improve late while never a threat. YES I'S A MILLER raced widest first turn, over to the inside
far turn but came up empty. LAKE BARKLEY never a factor. SKIP AND A HOP close up to the half but gave way readily thereafter. COOLER SCHEDULE
failed to menace. THIRSTY COWGIRL never close. SHEZA FAST was through after a half and dropped back.

shifted into the three path in the far turn and was no match for the winner in the stretch run. COOL CELESTE was back early on, was swung outward inside
the quarter pole, raced in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. HOLLEE PEACH stumbled at the start and raced back early on,
fanned into the five path in the far turn and moved up in the stretch. PURPLE MARTIN fanned into the five path in the far turn and improved position.

the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and was empty late in the stretch. KITTEN EMPRESS was through after three quarters. BLACKBERRY LISA

lane, made a bid three wide down the lane and edged clear in the final stages. MR EVERYTHING clipped heels at the start, chased the pace early, shifted
into the four path in the far turn, drove past and inched clear near the eighth pole but yielded in the final stages. BRISKY came out at the start then was
rushed up to set the early pace, shifted into the three path entering the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. GAME SET AND MATCH bobbled and came
in at the start, trailed the field early on, shifted into the three path in the far turn and moved up in the stretch drive. MR. SARINANA hopped at the start,

three quarters. FROZEN HANNAH was through after a half. BOOTSY'S HADENOUGH set the pace for three quarters then folded up. BYE BYE BULLY'S
