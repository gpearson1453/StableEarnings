HEAVEN SENT ANGEL stalked the pace angling out six wide in upper stretch slowly edging closer getting to the winner late. I RECALL dropped back early
lagging through the turn, had some response the final eighth in the five path. TIZ WHAT sent hard dueled from the rail through the turn into upper stretch
wearing out the final eighth. A FABULOUS KISS veering out leaving the gate was always outrun. FANCY KELLY folded up on the turn.
