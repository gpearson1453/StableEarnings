Footnotes
COMING UP ROSES slow from the gate, settled, rallied quarter pole, split horses into stretch, lugged in a bit in the late stretch while all out. BANJO BOY
slight trouble start, never far back to stretch, gamely to wire. SOFIA'S SLUGGER perfect position throughout, no late kick in the final furlong. MISTER
CARSON speed from tail led to deep stretch, faltered in the final sixteenth. KITTEN'S WORLD never far back outside, rallied with winner, slight steady late.
MAJOR SILAS through early, never contended throughout. FLORIDA FLASH reluctant to load, never made a move throughout. YAY FOR ME bothered at
the start, close up to the half, gave way badly. WIND TWIST dropped far back. TIMER MALFUNCTION CAUSED TIMES TO BE OMITTED.
