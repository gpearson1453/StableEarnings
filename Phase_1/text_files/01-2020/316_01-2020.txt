Footnotes
WICKED T was unhurried early, moved up along the rail around the turn, tipped out near the three-sixteenths pole, closed steadily and was up in the final
strides. QUEEN OF CAUSE set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn, held clear past the sixteenth pole but could not quite last. AMPHITRITE
stalked the pace two wide, chased in the clear around the turn and lacked a rally. BA YORK lacked early speed outside, angled to the rail entering the turn,
stayed inside through the lane and had a mild gain. READY TO TAP chased the early pace inside, then faded between rivals around the turn. DEAR JOHN
LETTER failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
VIRGINIA BEACH edged up three to four wide nearing the half mile marker and tracked the leaders, came four wide for the drive, leveled off when switching
over to her correct lead in mid stretch, forged to command heading to the sixteenth marker and held firm under a drive. DECO STRONG had speed to the
inside of a pair of rivals, eased back off of those two nearing the turn and gave chase, angled out into the lane, moved up behind foes in mid stretch, altered
to the rail for the final sixteenth, closed gamely and was getting to the winner. DETERMINED HEART broke a bit slow while rank, bumped with MONA
LUNA soon after, moved up towards the leaders while about three wide, steadied back near three furlong marker, angled out, circled four wide into the lane,
shifted out advancing past mid stretch, loomed and continued willingly. SEVILLA SANGRIA disputed the early pace between runners, vied inside a rival into
the turn, chased while saving ground into the lane, shifted out and churned on to make a mild comeback. FULLMOON BAY vied outside SEVILLE
SANGRIA while under early rating, shook clear past the five sixteenths, entered the lane three wide, drifted out a bit when collared past mid stretch and
faded late. MONA LUNA broke slowly then bumped with DETERMINED HEART, moved up a bit between foes early on, angled four wide past the three
eighths but lacked a further response. SICK SOCIETY saved ground pursuing the pace, stayed in touch for three furlongs then faded.

LITTLE MISS RAELYN set the pace in the two path, repulsed bids nearing the lane and held clear under a drive. BUNTING chased the early pace between
foes, came out briefly nearing the half-mile pole, angled into the two path entering the turn, angled to the rail near the five-sixteenths pole and finished
willingly to be clearly second. SARAH'S TREASURE settled off the pace along the inside, began angling out nearing the five-sixteenths marker, came four
wide into the lane and was along for the show. ELLANATION settled in midpack down the backstretch, steadied when forced out near the half-mile pole,
made progress three wide around the turn, bid nearing the quarter pole then flattened out in the lane. ONE TWO THREE GO was briefly forced out nearing
the half-mile pole, angled back to the two path entering the turn and made little further impact. SNIPPETY prompted the pace outside of the winner in the
three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and retreated.

SENIOR INVESTMENT broke a step slow, was hustled up soon after and prompted the pace three wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths, bid
three deep to gain a narrow advantage nearing the lane, dueled outside TOUGHEST 'OMBRE from the head of the lane to inside the sixteenth marker then
edged clear under a drive. TOUGHEST 'OMBRE , under a snug hold stalking from the inside, bid inside a pair of rivals mid way on the final turn, dueled past
the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. JEFAZO , between rivals, edged up past the five eighths, steadied when in close near the half mile marker,
shifted out and chased five wide outside rivals past the five sixteenths, kept on trying and earned the show. HAN SENSE pulled his way clear into the first
turn, set the pace two wide, came under pressure past the three eighths, dueled between foes heading towards the stretch, stayed on willingly to about the
furlong grounds then faded. TYBALT lost ground four wide, moved up outside foes nearing the half mile marker, chased between runners near the five
sixteenths but came up empty. ISOTHERM steadied along the rail near the seven eighths marker, edged up past the three quarter pole then had to steadied
briefly near the five furlong pole, raced in range into the lane but came up empty.

DAY THE MUSIC DIED settled in range of the pacesetter outside, made progress four wide around the turn, seized command leaving the three-sixteenths
pole, quickly drove clear and held clear under mostly hand urging in the final sixteenth. KNEESINTHEBREEZE lacked early speed, saved ground
throughout and rallied inside the winner to gain the place. YOU CAN NEVER TELL chased the pace three wide between foes and finished evenly to
maintain the show. BROOKS ROBINSON sprinted clear early, set the pace in the two path and surrendered readily in upper stretch. THREE PHASE raced
off the pace two wide, angled widest in upper stretch and never threatened. MAYHEM LIKE ME was outrun while racing three wide. MYSTIC TIMES had
early speed two wide and was through early.

Footnotes
SLEWZER took over early and set a rated pace two wide, handled outside pressure into the turn, shook clear heading to the quarter pole, dug in when
confronted from the inside leaving mid stretch, kept on under left handed rousing and gamely prevailed. SPLENDOR GAL , taken to rate while saving
ground, moved through along the rail advancing to the head of the lane, threatened the winner from the rail leaving mid stretch, kept on willingly and saved
the place. BARBSGRAY LION tracked two wide just behind the leaders, shifted out into the lane, moved up and had aim in mid stretch, drifted out some,
was corrected and continued with effort while just missing second. MAJESTIC PIC , sluggish from the gate, was steadied off heels after a sixteenth of a
mile, dropped well back while saving ground, commenced a run into lane, angled out late and gained between foes. SHECOR , in mid pack three wide,
angled out around the turn, circled five wide into the stretch lacked a solid response. FLIRTATION WALK , away alertly, forced the pace three wide outside
the winner, drifted out some in upper stretch and weakened. BOOM BOOM GONE broke awkwardly, raced off the pace while three wide, angled very wide
into the lane but failed to menace. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) , between runners into the turn, pursued off the rail mid turn and gave way. SOMMER
SOMETHING , four wide pursuing the leaders, was under pressure leaving the far turn, failed to kick on and dropped back.

of the winner, settled back while still at the rail around the turn, re-bid inside in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner but dug in to hold
second. SMOKIN HOT FACTOR was taken four wide nearing the turn, bid four deep nearing the five-sixteenths pole, could not go with the winner in upper
stretch, kept trying outside but was outfinished for the place. LA MAQUINA GRIS had speed three wide between foes but lacked a closing bid. SWING
STEP lacked early speed while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, raced widest in the lane and lacked a rally. IT'S THE JOURNEY
was bumped at the start and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
CHARGIN STORM tracked four wide, moved up under a light hold entering the stretch, moved to command past the three sixteenths, shook clear under left
handed rousing, lugged in late and prevailed. CERULEAN SPRINGS rated inside, edged up past the five sixteenths, steadied briefly off heels nearing the
lane, regrouped and advanced along the rail past the furlong grounds, shifted out late and finished well to gain. W W SPRINGTIME sped to the front, set the
pace off the rail while handling outside pressure, ceded command past the three sixteenths but kept on trying to the wire. CONFESSOR drafted back off the
early pace and was taken in hand, angled out a bit and edged up between foes leaving the three eighths pole, swung out to be about six wide in upper
stretch and rallied. FOLLOW THE DOG , bumped at the break, pulled his way forward in the opening quarter mile and stalked inside, eased out into the
lane, gained some near mid stretch, shifted back in but was out finished. SARATOGA BOB lost ground four to five wide, chased outside rivals around the
turn, moved up in mid stretch then flattened out late. SANAVI lost ground five to six wide and lacked a rally. FORT FORTITUDE forced the pace outside W
W SPRINGTIME, failed to kick on in upper stretch, gave way and was being eased in the final furlong. WORKIN ON A DREAM , bumped and pinched back
at the break, moved up then steadied in close quarters near the five eighths pole, dropped back into the turn and failed to recover.
