Footnotes
GORGEOUS ROAD raced four wide the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage in the three path of the far turn,
dug in from the head of the lane to take the lead later yards and held on. UAINTSEENMECRAZYET saved ground off the pace the opening turn then eased
outward into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, circled rivals seven wide on the far turn, steadily gained through the lane to finish
well and took second the final yards. LADY'S LADY rounded the first turn five wide then stalked three wide into the backstretch, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn, got up for third in the final yards but was outfinished for the top two positions. GOIN GANGSTA rated s short
lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn but was caught in later yards
in spite of steady stretch handling. YODEL LADY was crowded at the rail early on then stalked into the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole but lacked a clear path through the stretch. HATTA DOUBLE settled off the pace about the three path then picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, angled six wide into the stretch but showed little more. LIMEHOUSE LOUISE stalked the pace two deep the first
turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
PUNK ROCK PRINCESS tapered to the inside to rate the pace, was given rein to keep ahead of Whoisaprettygirl through the backstretch, pulled clear of
that one into the far turn and proved much the best with steady stretch handling. OLIVE'S BUMPA stalked the pace inside then bid into the backstretch,
raced in the four path of the far turn, drifted outward leaving the turn but dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. WHOISAPRETTYGIRL broke
awkwardly and out to make contact with Be With Us then stalked the pace three wide, challenged the winner past the half mile pole but dropped back into
the far turn and flattened stride down the lane. BE WITH US was bumped leaving the gate, saved ground off the pace and showed little response through
the backstretch. ULTIMATE JUSTICE settled off the pace in the three path the first turn then started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, entered the far turn
in the five path, was carried wide leaving the turn and showed little more.

with Mayan Queen, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail through the far turn, angled three wide into the lane, took over second later

Footnotes
LA MEDALLA DE ORO pressured the pace three wide and dueled to even terms two deep past the quarter pole, then dug in under determined handling to
take the nod inside the sixteenth and was inching ahead through later yards. NICE N' BROAD set a pressured pace and dueled at even terms leaving the
three eighths pole, then dug in gamely to deep stretch before yielding; reluctantly. NELLYSFORD pressured the pace inside and dueled at even terms from
the three eighths pole, but, dropped back at the rail nearing the quarter, continued at the rail through the turn, eased out into the lane and showed little
more. HOT POSSEBILITY gave chase from the inside and showed little in the lane. HOUSE OF LOVE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the
turn in the five path then flattened. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW gave chase off the rail then flattened stride into the lane. MY LIDO LADY saved ground. After
reviewing a claim of foul against the rider of Nice N' Broad, lodged by the rider of Nellysford for alleged interference in the vicinity of the quarter pole, the
stewards found no cause to take action.

Footnotes
FAPPIANO ROCKET rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and held well with steady handling. CRYPTOSONDE
settled back in the three path the opening turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and took second inside the sixteenth.
BRUTUS BRAE rounded the first turn in the four path and raced off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the
three path of the far turn and passed some faders. THE BIG STORM drifted into the first turn then stalked the pace entering the backstretch, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened out the final furlong. BROTHER DAN raced in the four path the opening turn
and showed only mild response through the backstretch. QUICKEN RUNAWAY exchanged contact with Global First Class leaving the gate then never
factored. KING OF BLUES saved early ground and was through after a half mile. DEPUTY BEE raced well off the pace and never factored. FAST RIDE was
carried wide the first turn and never factored. GLOBAL FIRST CLASS exchanged contact with Quicken Runaway which caused the rider to lose balance
and come off shortly after the break. After a thorough stewards examination of the start of this race, no change was made. In addition, due to the loose
horse tripping the photo electric timing eye, this race was re-timed by hand.

NOT A SECRET stalked the pace off the rail then bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved in the five path of the far turn then dug in through the lane to
take the nod the final strides. TIZ JOHNNIE raced four wide the first turn and settled just off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled close two
deep rounding the far turn, took the lead just inside the eighth pole and dueled determinedly to put Rocket Thunder away, but picked up the winners'
challenge inside the sixteenth pole and gave up the nod to that one under the wire. GAB'S LIL LEAGUER settled back about the three path then eased out
into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn six wide then dueled through the stretch for third. WHIZ PASS saved ground
off the pace the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved five wide on the far turn but was outfinished in a stretch long duel for third.
MADEITOUTTAHARLAN saved ground off the early pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path but flattened later
yards. LIL SWEETHEART rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, ceded control past the pole and gave chase from
that point but faded through the far turn. ROCKET THUNDER settled close in the three path then challenged toward the three eighths pole, contested a slim
lead nearest the rail on the far turn but weakened from the head of the lane. OUR BAD GIRL stalked the earlier pace in the three path, gave chase from the
three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. RETURN TO DENIS steadied at the start then saved ground.

then drew clear into the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. GREELEY AND ARIANA settled off the pace in the three and four paths then bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, proved no match for the winner, though, held on for second. NURSE TOMPKINS rated close inside then bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. HOPEFUL ANGEL settled well back from early contention
while saving ground, bid mildly from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. LONGSTORYLUCY saved ground and
showed little response through the backstretch. HAY BABY GIRL rated the pace inside and came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, gave
chase at even terms past the pole but dropped back into the far turn then faded at the rail through the turn. SAINTE THERESE raced off the pace in the two
and three paths and showed only mild response. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW mostly saved ground. DISTINCT APPROVAL stalked the pace from the seven
eighths pole then gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths, though, faded approaching the far turn.

paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved in the three path of the far turn, dueled to a slim brief lead inside the sixteenth pole but was caught in the
final yards. CAT CAT'SHORSEPLAY raced off the pace in the three and four paths then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the
four path, finished well for third and was gaining on the runner-up. KATEANDLILLIAN took the lead nearing the three quarter pole then angled to the inside
to rate a clear pace, came under pressure from the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail, was steadily encouraged through the lane but flattened out
the final sixteenth. SHALL WE DANCE leapt from the gate and raced well off the pace, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the
far turn in the seven path then passed some rivals down the lane. LIMIT MONEY (DOM) saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole,
