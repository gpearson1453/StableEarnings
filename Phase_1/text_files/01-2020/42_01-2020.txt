GALILEO'S AFFAIR set the early pace, then tracked inside, made a rail bid entering the far turn, dueled with KABUKI, took over, pulled away, held on late
driving, then had the rider lose his balance right after the wire and fell off. SYDNEY TIME was outrun early, made a four wide run on the far turn, rallied
outside, closed steadily and was gaining at the end. KABUKI tracked in the early stages, moved up outside to contest the pace, took over, dueled with the
winner on the far turn, weakened and held for third. FLEUR DE FORCE raced three wide early, stalked four wide, chased three wide on the far turn and had
no rally. HALLUCINATION raced four wide early, settled off the pace inside and failed to threaten. OWESAYCANYOUSEE tracked inside, then raced two
wide and faded. PRETTY COOL CAT stalked two wide and gave way.

IRISH RIVIERA didn't break sharply, was three wide early, bumped KID MACHO on the far turn circled foes racing into stretch, quickly opened a long lead
under strong rousing and then was taken in hand through deep stretch. KID MACHO raced wide, was bumped on the far turn, continued outside and gained
place. GAUCHO, in the four path just off pace, split rivals moving, challenged but then gave way. RONIN WARRIOR raced outside while just off the pace
then tired. BEST START, racing in the four path, split rivals entering stretch and was never a serious threat. GRANDE GATO came in start, bumped foe and
caused his rider to lose his right iron briefly, was outrun to stretch and passed tiring foes. ELITE MISSION stalked the pace two wide then tired. LEYENDA
AZTECA raced wide and failed to menace. BREW DOG also raced wide and failed to be a serious threat. PROTA set the early pace just off the rail then
stopped. SOMETHING PENTO, bumped leaving the gate, had brief speed.

RULER OF THE NILE, three wide second flight, was carried out near stretch, closed determinedly inside leader and was just up. FLASHY KYEM, between
second flight, drifted out drawing clear through early stretch, just failed. DIRT IN YOUR FACE, between foes, steadied on the turn then made up some
ground. ALL STAR RED raced wide early, angled in early stretch then faded. WILD CARAMELO set the pace in three path, drifted out and tired. GET THE
W, just off the rail, steadied briefly near furlong grounds and dropped back. QUALITY ASSET, racing just off the rail, failed to menace. TREASURY STOCK
was never a serious threat. KRAKOV, very wide, tired badly.

CROWHEART BUTTE trailed the field, raced two wide on the backside, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, dug in gamely
outside in the final furlong and was just up after a long drive. WISE JUDE raced off the rail, off the pace, bid four wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch,
dug in gamely between rivals in the final sixteenth and just missed. JANE'S FACTOR raced four wide early, then stalked three wide, bid two wide on the far
turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely inside rivals and weakened late. PETER G. FOX raced off the pace inside, failed to threaten and bested the
others. CURLIN'S KNIGHT stalked two wide, chased the leaders on the far turn and lacked a bid. MR CLASSICAL raced off the pace inside, bid three wide
on the far turn and faded. OBVIOUSLY DRAMATIC set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
PLAY ME A MEMORY set the pace two wide, repulsed repeated challenges and edged away late. LIL MISS HOTSHOT stalked the pace from the inside,
was unable to match strides but was up for place. PEACH ALLEY raced wide while never far back and finished willingly. FLASHNDYNAMITE raced outside
while just off the pace, loomed with a furlong to go and gave way grudgingly. BARLEY JACK, three wide in second flight, weakened late. BREE'S GOT
HEART, between foes, failed to be a serious threat. ANNIKA GOLD saved ground and showed little. CRAZY DAISY, in the four path while just off the pace,
tired. SINGLE BROAD raced wide and showed little. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LIL MISS HOTSHOT AGAINST PLAY ME A MEMORY WAS
QUICKLY DISMISSED.
