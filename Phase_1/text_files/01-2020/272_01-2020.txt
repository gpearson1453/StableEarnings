Footnotes
LUCKY POLLY was away in good order then settled near mid-pack down the backstretch, picked up the pace and hustled along three wide going by the
quarter pole, advanced to second position then headed in pursuit for the leader, was set down for the drive, seized command from STUNTING in late stages
and finished clear. STUNTING cleared on top shortly after the start and angled inside entering the first turn, set the uncontested pace down the backstretch
then held firm around the far turn, put to a drive at head of the lane, stayed on with response but could not hold off the winner in late stages. FRESCO
settled nicely while rated near mid-range down then backstretch, launched a bid around the far turn, gained closer contention then continued a steady four
wide bid through the lane. WICKED MERCURY raced in range and tracked the top trio to the far turn, hustled up along the rail, cut the corner entering the
lane then chased on evenly in late stages. WASIYAH raced off the pace and saved ground to the far turn, was put to a drive along the rail in the far turn,
continued a bid up the inside in stretch run and improved position without threatening. ACOUSTIC SHADOW settled off the pace through early stages then
lodged a bid between foes entering the final turn, responded evenly then kept under a drive three to our wide and failed to threaten. FORCED FAMILY FUN
tracked the top two leaders down the backstretch, launched a bid along the inside around the far turn, failed to kick on then drifted out wider and gave way.
LOOKINTOGETLUCKY got brushed between rivals just after the start then angled inside to save ground, remained unhurried near the rear and saved
ground down the backstretch, was put to a drive five to six wide in the lane and failed to rally. MADAME MOON raced in the back then hustled along five
wide into upper stretch and failed to move on. LOOK ME OVER was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch,
launched a two wide bid for command in the final turn, could not gain closer order then steadily faded. EMPRESS AMELIA raced off the early pace then
urged for response near the half mile marker, failed to advance position then raced wide and steadied upper stretch.

Footnotes
ANOTHERSONGNDANCE began moving on the turn while swinging five wide near the quarter-pole, rallied steadily through the stretch on the wrong lead,
overtook NENITA from outside entering the final furlong and moved clear under a drive. DIXIELAND DREAM was never too far back, entered the stretch in
the three-path and finished willingly to be along for second. NENITA tracked outside the leaders three wide, bid between horses a quarter-mile out, reached
a short lead through upper stretch but yielded late. WATER WIZARD raced in the second flight two to three wide for a half-mile, and rallied mildly on the far
outside for a share. SIGNING BONUS altered course off the rail at the top of the stretch, and showed some late interest in the three-path. HARTS N
FLOWERS raced four wide around the turn, and lacked a solid late response. SWEET BELEN hustled up to vie for the early lead, dueled inside HAPPY
LOUDON around the turn, and gave way through the stretch. KINGSTON TIME saved ground in the middle of the pack early, moved out for the drive and
had no rally. LADY DENISSE broke slowly and was outrun inside. QUEEN MARCELLA brushed the left side of the gate at the start, and was outrun five
wide. HAPPY LOUDON vied outside SWEET BELEN through the turn, and faltered after a half-mile. GLITTER GIRL was hard to load, and retired early four
wide.

Footnotes
BEACH DREAMING was allowed to settle out of the gate then angled inside leaving the first turn, steadily advanced along the inside to race in close
contention moving through the backstretch, was patiently piloted awaiting a clear path around the far turn, cut the corner then made a game bid up the
inside of ADAMENT, dug in under pressure, assumed command past the furlong marker and edged away. ADAMANT was away in good order and matched
strides for the lead with FULL COUNT in the opening furlong then cleared on top and set the pace along the rail to the far turn, repelled the bid from FULL
COUNT near the quarter pole then turned for home two wide with the advantage but could not move on when BEACH DREAMING advanced along the rail
to seize command past the eighth pole. VITAEMI was unhurried and raced in the back two to three wide to the far turn, saved ground then launched a bid
along the rail at head of the lane, gained closer contention then switched out a path and kept on with response. PAINT THE CORNERS raced in contention
and tracked the pace down the backstretch, raced between foes entering the far turn then angled out and hustled up leaving the turn, was set down four to
five wide for the drive, remained in close contention then ran on evenly in late stages. MUCH ABOUT IT raced off the pace and saved ground through early
stages, began to creep up a bit closer along the outside late far turn, floated out seven to eight wide into upper stretch and produced a mild bid. FULL
COUNT vied for the lead around the first turn then edged just off the pacesetter and stalked rival down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for
command around the far turn, failed to advance on the leader then flattened out in the lane. ENLISTING raced in range through early stages, hustled up
three to four wide around the final turn, fanned out wider entering the stretch and gave way. DIXIE PRINCESS lunged at the start and lost ground, settled off
the early pace, moved into stretch run six wide and failed to kick on under pressure.

COMBINATION ranged up four wide to contention after a half-mile, overhauled the leaders from outside through the furlong grounds and skipped away
rapidly on the wrong lead. WHY TRUST bumped with HIGH RIDER at the start, rallied to a short lead four then three wide around the turn, proved no match
for the winner past the eighth-pole but dug in for the place. STARSHIP TAXI was forwardly placed from the start, challenged for command between horses
near the quarter-pole, battled on to mid stretch and weakened in the two-path through the late stages. REVOLVING STAR trailed to the top of the lane, and
went by tired horses on the far outside. BULLGRATS bumped with DAMIANO at the start, cleared to the lead moving in from the four-path early on the turn,
and faded through the lane on the rail. MONEY COME checked in tight between horses just past the seven-sixteenths, and tired through the drive.
TAYLORSINITIATION hit the left side of the gate at the start, and was no menace five wide. OFF THE MARK saved ground to no avail. HIGH RIDER
bumped with WHY TRUST at the start, showed early speed inside, and dropped back with no response to urging late on the turn. DAMIANO bumped with
BULLGRATS at the start, and gave way three wide after a half.

LUCKY DIME was off to a good start and switched in a few paths while forwardly positioned on the leader, continued to force the issue to the far turn then
edged up to match strides at the quarter pole, shook clear turning for home, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. SPARTANKA raced in range
positioned five to six paths wide in early stages, hustled up going by the half mile marker, moved into upper stretch five wide under pressure, continued a
steady bid and edged by foe in late stages to take place. MYLASTFIRSTKISS switched in a few paths from the widest position in opening stages, raced
outside in aim and prompted the pace to the far turn, was under a ride three wide while poised to strike mid-turn, could not gain equal terms for the lead but
continued with interest and cleared show. ERV'S WENCH raced in contention through early stages and hustled along the inside around the turn, shifted out
wider upper stretch then had no late kick. PILOT EPISODE cleared on top and crossed over to the inside at the start, set a pressured pace through early
stages then vied for the lead with eventual winner around the turn, could not move on with LUCKY DIME turning for home then gave way. TOPO GRIGIO
raced off the early speed and saved ground, was coaxed along the rail around the turn and into the stretch run but failed to kick on. GIRARDI raced two to
three wide in the last flight, moved into upper stretch four wide and failed to move into contention. STARSHIP MALLOMAR raced off the pace and inside
then two wide and failed to factor. TESTIMONIAL raced three wide near the rear, moved into stretch five wide and lacked a needed rally. CAREFREE
HIGHWAY steadied shortly after the start, raced in the back and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BLAZING DESIRE sped to the front after the start, rated along in the two-path to the stretch, and responded well to remain clear. DANZING DUNHILL
chased outside the winner throughout, and kept on gamely through the stretch. CASTAGNO had the two-path for nearly six furlongs, came four wide into
the lane and rallied mildly. VINTAGE KITTEN was slow into stride, raced three wide on the turns and finished evenly. K W CAPTAIN FLINT broke outward,
raced two wide on the turns while in range, and faded in the stretch. REBELDE saved ground throughout and was not a factor. LIKE YOU stayed in range
for six furlongs, but lacked a late response. POPPY'S BOYS was keyed up under a firm hold going to the first turn, moved out to the five-path leaving the far
turn and had no response.

Footnotes
FREE TO FLY held a slim lead in opening stages then conceded position to CRUMB BUN and settled back under slight restraint to rate off the front-runner,
saved ground along the inside and remained confidently handled still unleashed moving through the turn, tapped on the shoulder and raced in aim for the
lead near the furlong marker, prompted right handed, assumed command and finished clear. CRUMB BUN took over the lead from FREE TO FLY in
opening stages and dictated the pace to the far turn, repelled bid from DANA GRACE near the three eighths pole, kept clear entering stretch run then got
collared by FREE TO FLY past the furlong marker and settled for second best. JANET B DOESIT ALL was allowed to settle in early stages and raced two
wide then shifted out five wide moving through the backstretch, launched an outside bid entering the turn then kept under a drive five wide in the lane and
gained share. MY SEBASTIANA was a bit erratic at the start then shifted to the inside to save ground, prompted along the rail entering the turn, responded
and moved into contention then failed to sustain bid mid-way through the lane. CHUTZPAH chased in range through early stages then dropped to last after
the half, was under a ride racing wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE was positioned as a strong contender while
tracking the early pace, launched a three wide bid entering the turn, failed to gain closer contention then steadily faded. DANA GRACE hustled along and
raced in close contention behind the leader, moved up to race in touch with rival then came up empty upon entering the turn, quickly retreated and eased
across the wire.

HONEY WON'T broke to the lead, rated along slightly off the inside to the stretch, and widened steadily under pressure. ARMCHAIR JOCKEY saved
ground unhurried to the far turn, was guided out three wide approaching the stretch, and rallied to be along for the place while never a threat to the winner.
TY RAN A HOMER went along under a firm hold early between horses, followed behind the leader at the top of the lane, moved to the rail and was
outfinished for second. BOLD PAYNTER bumped with PREACHER MARSEE at the start, raced three wide on the turns and lacked a late response.
MALIBU MUSIC stayed in range for six furlongs, and had no response through the lane. SNAP HOOK gave chase outside the winner for six furlongs, and
tired. TOUPHA was under a firm hold early inside, and never reached contention. BOSTALETO bumped twice with PREACHER MARSEE and checked
back at the start, and was never close. PREACHER MARSEE was bumped between BOLD PAYNTER and BOSTALETO at the break, bumped solidly with
the latter again and checked a couple strides after that, and was finished before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
BABIE MONSTER raced along the outside and rated near mid-range to the far turn, headed in pursuit and loomed up closer near the quarter pole, kept
under a ride and moved up to briefly match strides with BROOKES ALL MINE in late stages then edged away under a driving finish. BROOKES ALL MINE
held a narrow lead out of the chute then vied for the lead with inside running DURLYN, shook free from rival nearing the half mile marker and held firm over
challenger's around the turn, continued on top with a furlong left to run, fought back when BABIE MONSTER moved up to challenge but failed to hold off the
winner. GRACE'S DRAMA was unhurried and saved ground down the backstretch, shifted out and headed in pursuit around the turn, swung wide into upper
stretch, gained momentum under pressure and rallied along the far outside to take show. KINDHEARTED KOTA was reserved near the rear through early
stages, launched an outside bid and circled up into contention around the turn then evened out in late stages. LEDECKY rated off the pace to the far turn,
prompted three to four wide then came out wider for the drive and lacked the needed response for late impact. COTTON TOOYAH raced in range near the
inside then steadied slightly mid-way down the backstretch, launched a bid on the turn then kept on three to four wide in stretch run and failed to threaten.
WATCHIN THE WHEELS raced in range and tracked the top trio to the far turn, roused for more and raced in striking range of the leader on the turn then
failed to sustain bid and gave way in the lane. QUICK POINT raced along the outside in the back, was under a ride four wide upper stretch and failed to
move into contention. DURLYN raced along the rail and vied for the early lead with BROOKES ALL MINE, could not move on with rival near the half mile
marker then dropped back. MOTION'S FIRST was forwardly placed down the backstretch then came up and retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
HAY DAKOTA advanced to contention around the far turn and awaited room behind the leaders, cut the corner and found a seam in upper stretch, forged
through a narrow opening between CELEBRATION and SOMBEYAY past the eighth-pole struck twice left-handed, and edged away hand urged.
SOMBEYAY eased back off the leaders midway up the backstretch, rallied three wide to challenge a quarter-mile out, reached a short lead in deep stretch
but could not match strides with the winner through the final yards. PROLIFERATE was unhurried early, entered the stretch in the three-path and finished
well. AQUAPHOBIA lagged well back to the stretch, and gained belatedly on the far outside. SAYYAAF was outsprinted to the first turn inside, moved out
four wide with a mild run on the far turn, but lacked a solid late kick. CELEBRATION (GB) set a rapid pace inside, and faltered through the final furlong.
WESTERLAND (GB) was void of speed for a half-mile, put in a mild run in the three-path coming off the far turn, but flattened out late. SUENO had a rail trip
and posed no threat. HIGH RATIO (AUS) pressed the pace outside CELEBRATION to the stretch, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
AFRICAN HERITAGE gained a contending position out of the gate and saved ground on the first turn, rated under slight restraint while positioned in range
down the backstretch, was patiently handled around the far turn, given cue up the inside at the head of the lane, seized command near the furlong marker
and finished clear. LONESOME FUGITIVE (IRE) raced off the pace near the inside down the backstretch, switched out and headed in pursuit late far turn,
raced wide into stretch, rallied while lugging in through stretch run and got a nose up for place. BATTALION led the way and crossed over to the inside
entering the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead with SCANNO around the far turn, battled back into stretch, was no match for the
winner but kept on with response and got nipped for place. SCANNO was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the leader to the far turn, advanced
to duel for the lead with BATTALION, continued to fight back into stretch then weakened late. SKYRAY raced off the pace and saved ground, launched a bid
around the far turn, was under a drive five wide entering top stretch then shift in and flattened out. SEE THE PYRAMIDS raced in the back and saved
ground, hustled up along the inside around the far turn, had a mild improve but needed more for impact. SOUPER ENERGIZER tracked the pace along the
outside, raced in close contention then prompted on the far turn, failed to advance position, remained in range at the furlong marker then failed to move on.
CENTURION raced off the pace, urged for response around the far turn and lacked response. TOLKIEN raced in range to the far turn then failed to respond
when called upon.
