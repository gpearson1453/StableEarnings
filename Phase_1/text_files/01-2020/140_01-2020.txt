Footnotes
DERBY DOG quickly went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. AMANDAS LIGHTENING bumped at the start, pressed the
pace, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. PALMY SUNDAE broke in at the start, racing in the middle of the field, came around the turn
four wide, made a late gain, but proved no match for the top two. LIKEN IT bumped start, pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, but lacked a late
kick. LUCKY BIG DADDY raced near the back in the beginning, made a mild bid and finished evenly. BOSTON BOOM raced evenly near the back and was
no factor. MORO PHAROAH pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. MINISTER MICKEY hopped at the start, broke in, bumped rival, raced
within contention and faded. WENDY'S WILL void of early speed and was never a factor. KIP ROYALE void of early speed and trailed the field.

Footnotes
MR. GRACEFUL unhurried in the early going, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch and drove clear before the wire. NIPPY RED raced within
striking distance, moved up three wide around the final turn, made a bid down the lane and got up for second. GRACIDA had a tight start, racing in the rear,
rallied late and was outfinished for second. CAJUN CARMELIZED challenged for the early lead, saved ground and lacked a late kick. MY BOOK raced in
the back of the field in the early part, showed late interest, but was no factor. RUN ROCKET raced near the back, finished evenly and was never a factor.
GUITARZAN dueled for the early lead and faded. KING'S SHARE pressed the early pace, racing four wide around the first turn and was finished early. IN
CHARGE HALO pressed the early pace and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
COSTA ALOT pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear and won under steady urging. GO GET THAT raced within striking distance,
moved up on the outside around the final turn, couldn't catch the leader, but was a clear second. DYNA GHOST lacked early speed, racing in the rear,
made a steady gain, but couldn't catch the top two. U COMPLETE ME raced in the middle of the field in the early going, came around the final turn wide,
made a mild bid, but was no factor. HAPPY JOURNEY was bumped at the start, racing in the rear, showed late interest, but was no factor. HONOR MY
SPEED challenged for the early lead and was finished early. STEEL DRUMS went to the front, saved ground and faded. LA CLEVER pressed the early
pace, faded and was no threat late. RELENTLESS ATTACK void of early speed and was never close. MY PAL KAY broke out, bumped, quickly retreated to
the rear and was eased to the wire.
