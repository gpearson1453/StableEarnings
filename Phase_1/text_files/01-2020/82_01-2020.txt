stretch but flattened stride later yards. MAYAN QUEEN was forced outward into the opening turn and raced in the five path of the first turn then stalked
three wide into the backstretch, dueled at even terms nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn then
weakened. QUEEN BOBBY was bumped outward and into Baytown Vi Vi then rated a slim lead inside, picked up the chase past the half mile pole,
continued close through the backstretch and raced at the rail through the far turn, then weakened. WINDY CITY KITTY veered out at the break and raced
off the pace, bid into the backstretch but factored little. BEYOND PRETTY was shut off at the break and angled out into the first turn, then, never factored. S

Footnotes
RELAUNCHING was bumped outward and into Swiss Thunder leaving the gate then picked up the chase, raced at the rail on the turn, dueled to the lead
mid-stretch and held on well. SATAN'S LAST TRAIN ducked in to make contact with Swiss Thunder then picked up the chase outside, raced five wide on
the turn and dug in to take second mid-stretch while outfinished for the win. BADS LIL LADY broke outward to make contact with Relaunching then picked
up the chase toward the outside, drifted nearing the head of the lane and entered the stretch extremely wide, and was along to take third the final strides.
SHARP'S MISSION set a pressured pace inside and contested the edge at the rail rounding the turn, drifted a path leaving the turn, was caught mid-stretch
and flattened stride the final sixteenth. HONEY CHILD R V F pressured the pace two deep while between horses and contested at a close disadvantage
three wide through the turn, but, flattened out the final furlong. MY SWEET MAGGIE gave chase inside and was not a factor. KYETHI pressured the pace
three wide through the backstretch, continued in the four path of the turn but drifted a bit leaving the turn and weakened. SWISS THUNDER was pinched
back at the break causing the rider to lose a stirrup and lost any chance.

Footnotes
CHARITABLE ROSE stalked the pace off the rail and started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, swept to the lead midway on the far turn, raced clear
toward the top of the lane then kept alert to draw off. GREELEY AND ARIANA saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
three path of the far turn but proved to be no match. BELLE NATION saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and showed little in the lane. CATHERINES WARRIOR rated a clear pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was
caught midway on the far turn and weakened from the eighth pole. PRINCESS NEKIA raced off the pace in the three and four paths and showed little
response through the backstretch. SHALL WE DANCE raced well off the pace. BIZZY BELLE stalked the pace for the opening half mile then faded past the
nine sixteenths pole. LITTLE MAXIMOVA mostly saved ground. ELLIE'S CORK was not a factor. Due to an equipment malfunction, this race was hand
timed.

yards. IT'SMYINTENSION gave early chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the four path and took second under the wire. THREE BOPS set a
pressured pace inside, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn, was caught mid-stretch, showed little further response then nipped from

Footnotes
RELENTLESS STRIKE angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole and held well under steady stretch
handling. COBH stalked the pace from the four path the first turn then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path but
couldn't close in the lane. TRAVEL TRUE stalked the pace off the rail then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path and showed little more. THE IRON BANK saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and could
only improve his position. MACANAO raced well off the pace, bid only mildly from the three eighths pole but flattened stride in the four path of the far turn.
JAI BLUE showed little response through the backstretch and weakened leaving the far turn. BIG BAD DUDE became edgy in the gate and was through
after three eighths. I CAME TO PARTY was not a factor.

Footnotes
LITTLE BIG SIME rounded the first turn in the four path then settled outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, progressed
through the far turn in the seven path then dug in under steady left hand encouragement to get up the final yards. NO MORE TALK stalked the pace in the
three path and challenged leaving the three eighths pole, took the nod at the five sixteenths pole, raced clear midway on the far turn, drifted outward from
the head of the lane and was outfinished through the final yards. HUNTIN'THEHOLIDAYS saved ground off the early pace, started a bid toward the quarter
pole, improved in the six path of the far turn, finished well to take third later yards and was gaining on the top two. GIO DUDE saved ground the first turn
then started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn, was carried out entering the stretch, lost momentum off the heels of No
More Talk mid-stretch then flattened out later yards. DIONYSUS' CHALICE raced with the pace off the rail and took the lead past the seven sixteenths pole,
but, gave up the nod toward the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn, drifted a bit into the lane then weakened. FLORIDA BOYS saved
ground the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. NEW WINDSOR took over at the rail into the first turn, was caught passing the
seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point then faded into the far turn.
