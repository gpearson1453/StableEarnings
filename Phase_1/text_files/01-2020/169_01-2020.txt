Footnotes
KILL SWITCH, urged inside foes in the opening stages, conceded the lead to track just inside a rival through the second furlong, was urged to prompt that
rival along the inside nearing the turn, eased back, then shifted out three wide on the turn and continued with a steady late response to wear down FOOT IN
THE DOOR to wrest a clear advantage under firm encouragement. FOOT IN THE DOOR, forwardly placed three deep racing just off the pacesetter in the
opening quarter, angled in a bit to press that rival racing into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't fend off the
winner. GETTININTOMISCHIEF was rated out of striking distance along the along the rail in early stages, came around a tiring foe racing into upper stretch
and continued with interest inside the top pair to improve his position. JOHNNYTHETIREMAN was urged to the lead while angling inwards in the opening
stages, dueled for command racing a bit off the rail into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. YOU'LL LIKE IT tracked the leaders five wide in early
stages, continued three deep into the turn and faded nearing the lane. NATION U S A, restless when being saddled in the paddock, tracked off the leaders
three wide between foes to the turn and emptied out into the lane. TOXICOLOGIST stumbled badly at the start and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE
RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
GLOBAL ENTRY tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages, advanced to press the issue three wide racing into the turn, continued
to dispute the issue past midstretch and edged forward in time under firm right handed pressure. GAME DAY DRAMA broke sharply, angled inwards to
dictate the pace between foes on a narrow margin just off the inside racing into the turn, resisted the winner's bid through the turn past midstretch but came
up second best nearing the wire. MEILLEUR, bumped by AMEN ALLEY in the opening stages to drop out last, switched to the outside while being collected,
was prompted to advance splitting foes three deep racing through the turn and continued to gain some position inside the leaders racing into the stretch.
CRAZY FRANK C ducked out at the start, tracked just off the leaders racing five wide, then four wide into the bend but steadily faded nearing the lane.
GREELEY'S FAREWELL bobbled slightly leaving the gate, tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch.
AMEN ALLEY ducked in early bumping MEILLEUR, was urged inside the pacesetter prompting that foe through the backstretch into the turn and emptied
out after a half. DARN THAT PARKER dropped out of contention early.

Footnotes
CROWN AND SUGAR tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance inside rivals racing to the first turn, steadily closed the gap on the leader nearing
the far turn, switched outside that foe to press the issue through the second bend, took over racing into upper stretch and edged away under firm right
handed encouragement. TIZAPRINCESSA was rated well off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out three wide
entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, then continued to make steady progress in that path to gain terms with the winner nearing the wire.
DISTINCTIVE FLOWER broke readily, pulled her way well clear racing to the backstretch, briefly resisted the winner's challenge on the far turn but
weakened late. MAGIC HATTER settled outside foes in the last flight early, shifted out to advance four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn to upper
stretch but finished evenly in the final stages. MONKEY MIND tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance between foes, then outside the eventual
winner into the backstretch, continued between foes into the far turn but steadily faded nearing the lane. ANTALYA, reserved last along the inside early,
never gained contention. CALLIE CALIFORNIA tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the first turn, dropped back from that position while
angling to the inside after a half, saved ground on the far turn but steadily faded late.

ROL AGAIN QUESTION, in touch with the pacesetter from the outset attending that rival's pace on his own courage while racing in three path through the
backstretch, pressed the issue racing into the turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch, then edged forward to a clear advantage late under strong
handling. PUDDING, bumped at the start while momentarily dropping out last, was urged along to regain a contending position between rivals tracking just
off the leaders racing into the turn, shifted out to briefly loom outside the eventual winner nearing midstretch but flattened out when appearing to fail to
switch leads. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS was prompted to gain a position tracking just off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out nearing
upper stretch and gained some position three deep between rivals late. LUDINGTON tracked off the second flight three deep early, angled out five wide
nearing upper stretch and gained some position in an even effort. MOOJI MOO JR. broke outwards bumping PUDDING at the start, was quickly righted,
then urged along the inside disputing the pace inside the eventual winner into the turn but gave way into upper stretch. CLOUDED JUDGEMENT tracked off
the first flight racing four wide to the turn and faded between foes in that path into upper stretch.

PALLAS ATHENE tracked just off the second flight three deep racing to the backstretch, steadily drew into striking distance three deep leaving the far turn,
shifted out four wide in upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest command and go clear in time under firm handling. CLEAR AS DAY,
held up just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, stalked just off that rival three deep into the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path racing
through the far turn, moved to wrest the advantage midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the pacesetter. AVA MALONE was rated between
foes in second flight in the opening half, split foes while angling to the rail leaving the midway point of the far turn, raced in close quarters inside foes while
being prompted to advance in upper stretch but was just outkicked by the top pair late. FACTOR AROUND angled in sharply leaving the chute while being
urged to the lead, set the pace along the rail racing to the far turn, dueled for command while shifting out a bit racing into upper stretch and gave way
between foes late. KEY TO GOLD was settled last to the backstretch. angled outside rivals racing into upper stretch but offered no closing bid. MISS
HANNA JO was steadied off the pacesetter in early stages, then was urged to terms prompting that foe between rivals to the backstretch but gave way
racing intot he far turn. GENTLE TOUCH settled near the inside early and offered no rally. CLEVER TALE tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second
flight, was prompted inside foes nearing the far turn, emptied out quickly on the second turn and was steadied slightly in close quarters while giving way.

Footnotes
SUPER CUTE was switched off the inside racing to the first turn to track just off the second flight between rivals in the opening half, shifted out three deep
on the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide in upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to reel in the pacesetter
and go clear in time under firm left handed encouragement. ELUSIVE AMELIA broke sharply, set the pace racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, repelled
a rival's challenge leaving the far turn to go clear again between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner. DIVINE MARTHA reared at the start, was settled
last to the far turn, came around a tiring foe, then angled to the rail racing into upper stretch to bid inside foes, couldn't gain terms with the top pair and
drifted out late into the path of RED VENUS while edging that rival for a share. RED VENUS tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight under light
rating in the opening half, was prompted to challenge the pacesetter racing through the far turn but came up empty in the drive, then was carried out a bit
nearing the wire. EVOCATIVE tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. NATOMA,
caught four wide racing through the first turn, tracked just off the second flight three, then four wide into the far turn and emptied out early.

Footnotes
YABBA DABBA DUDE, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that foe to the first turn, was eased off the leader nearing the backstretch to stalk that foe
under light reserve for a half, was prompted to make a steady advance racing into the far turn, gradually moved to terms with the leader in upper stretch,
then took over and went clear late under firm encouragement. DOPO LAVORO, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground gaining
position inside foes on the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch while being roused to advance bumping ROMANCING THE CAT in the furlong grounds but
continued with a steady effort to secure the place honors late. STUNNING BABY sped to the fore along the rail, went clear racing into the backstretch to
open a commanding advantage. held sway to upper stretch but faltered leaving the furlong marker. ROMANCING THE CAT tracked off the second flight
while angling inwards to race between foes under light reserve, steadily gained position between rivals racing into upper stretch, was bumped midstretch
and lacked the needed final kick. MORE THAN TEDDY broke awkwardly while hitting the gate at the start, settled last to the backstretch, swung out five
wide racing into upper stretch and displayed some late interest. MYSUREWINWILLIAMS angled to the inside tracking the leader as part of the second flight,
saved ground through the far turn and steadily faded in the drive. SON OF SO, urged to gain a forward placing between foes racing to the first turn, tracked
the pacesetter between rivals in second flight to the far turn and gave way into the lane. RUN SIEGER RUN tracked the leaders four wide to the
backstretch, then to the far turn and gave way. LUCKY DUCKY proved no factor. HAY BO, caught widest leaving the chute, dropped off the second flight
and retreated early.

Footnotes
FIRST OFF, in touch between rivals three deep attending the pace in the opening stages, shifted inwards dueling for command inside a rival racing into
upper stretch and edged clear late under brisk left handed encouragement. DO WHAT IT TAKES was urged inside rivals in the first flight prompting the pace
into the turn, lost ground to the leaders midway through the bend, shifted out three wide racing into the lane and continued willingly to edge a rival for the
place honors. FLAN, in touch with the first flight four wide attending the pace, pressed the issue outside the winner while shifting inwards racing into upper
stretch, then weakened in late stages. ANIMAUXSELLE tracked off the first flight just off the inside racing to the turn, shifted out midway through the bend,
was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and lacked the needed closing bid. WILLS BOOST, urged between rivals disputing the pace from the outset, lost
the advantage entering the turn, shifted outside the leaders to race four wide nearing upper stretch and soon gave way. EXTRA SALSA angled to the inside
early but never gained contention. ENDUROS TIGRESS brushed the gate at the start, tracked off the first flight outside a rival, was caught wide racing into
the turn and soon retreated. GUCCIGUCCIGIRL proved no factor. GRACE'S WILD CAT threw her head while breaking awkwardly, lost position to the field
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JACKIES DREAM, reserved off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, gathered momentum while switching off the inside, swung five wide
racing into upper stretch and produced a solid rally to wrest command in time under pressure despite being bumped approaching the wire. IMAGINARY
FRIEND (IRE) angled inwards in the opening stages while moving to a forward placing, stalked just off the pacesetter to the far turn, took over nearing upper
stretch, held sway to late stages, then drifted out bumping the eventual winner while just failing to contain that rival. TREASURE CAT settled well off the
second flight in early stages, steadily gained position between foes racing into the far turn, lost some momentum when awaiting an opening nearing upper
stretch, then angled out five wide racing into the lane to continued with a mild bid. DARESCA, held up avoiding close quarters early, was prompted to
advance outside foes nearing the far turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. EYE ON THE FINISH angled inwards in
the opening stages to track just off the first flight to the backstretch, shifted out to lodge a brief bid three wide racing into the far turn but soon flattened out.
MIGHTY FROSTY tracked off the first flight along the inside, came under pressure racing into the far turn but quickly emptied out. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL,
caught in tight quarters, then held up between foes in the opening stages, shifted out three wide to track the leaders as part of the second flight, was urged
to advance between foes nearing the lane but offered no rally. AWESOME THE MARIA, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin
racing to the far turn and emptied out. ADALIDA caught wide racing to the backstretch, bore out racing into the far turn and quickly dropped out. RABBIT
TWENTY TWO trailed throughout.
