Footnotes
TENSAS TODDY sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task, proving much the best. OUR PRINCE pressed the pace,
followed TENSAS TODDY throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SCRIMMAGE broke in, raced within striking distance, made
a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. BROKEJAW lacked early speed, racing near the back, made a late gain, but was no factor. RUNCIMAN
raced in the middle of the pack, finished evenly and lacked a late kick. ST BASIL had an awkward start, racing in the back, moved up and hung. BAYOU
RUBY raced within contention and was finished early. RICHARDS DREAM raced near the middle of the field, faded and finished evenly. ROBBER hesitated
and hopped at the start and was never close. TDZ WHAT A DREAM dwelt at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DUEPEG unhurried, raced four wide around the first turn, moved up on the outside around the final turn, rallied and drove clear before the wire. SILVER
SIREN raced within striking distance, waited around the final turn, blocked, split rivals down the stretch and finished willingly. TEMPLE OF ROSES raced
within contention, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead early in the final stretch, but couldn't match strides with the top two. CUSTOMS IN DIXIE
brushed at the start, vied for the early lead and weakened. LADYGOGENTLY broke near front, quickly dropped back, improved position and finished evenly.
MITCH'S PINS brushed at the start, dueled for the early advantage and was finished early. PADDY O'BELLE broke a step slow and was never a threat.
ROLL ON BABY always raced near the back and showed little.

couldn't gain on the top two, but proved third best. CATBALEE raced within striking distance, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. U THOUGHT U

Footnotes
CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL vied for the lead from the beginning, raced three wide around both turns, pulled away entering the home stretch and was ridden
out. WHY GOD unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second.
PRAETORIAN dueled for the early lead, saved ground and got caught for second. FULKERSON raced within striking distance, made a late bid and finished
willingly. NASTIDA MAST void of early speed and was never a threat. DREAMER'S POINT dueled on the front end in the early going and dropped to the
rear.
