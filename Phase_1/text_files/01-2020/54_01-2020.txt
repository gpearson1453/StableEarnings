Footnotes
SAPPHIRE SHILLING rated close up while between rivals into the turn, dropped in and tracked around the turn, bid inside the dueling leaders into the lane,
gained as slim lead past the three sixteenths, battled with GREEK GOD from there and held firm after an extended drive. GREEK GOD , with the pace four
wide outside rivals, vied three wide outside BEST OFFER mid turn, gained a slim lead into the lane, dueled outside the winner through the final quarter mile
and kept on gamely to just miss. STOLEN LOVE stalked the pace three wide outside foes, was under pressure mid turn, shifted out a bit in upper stretch,
progressed between runners and churned on. QUIT YOUR MOANIN settled off the pace, angled out leaving the three furlong marker, circled five wide into
the lane and had belated action. BEST OFFER took over at once, set the pace off the rail, was joined nearing the turn, sparred between runners into the
stretch then weakened through the final three sixteenths. BLAME THE KIDS , under a snug hold early while saving ground, raced close up into the turn,
failed to kick on while under a ride mid turn and faded.

BIGDADDYSGLORY saved ground around the turn, found ample room along the rail through the stretch, closed inside MY LILA and was up late. MY LILA
saved ground disputing the pace, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened late. POLICY MISTAKE , three wide on the turn, challenged for the lead
entering the stretch and weakened late. LUCKY EMBER lacked speed, circled the turn four wide and passed tired horses. SPECIAL POWER , four deep on
the turn, chased the pace and gave way. UNSTOPABULL BELLE , outrun, was five wide entering the stretch. LONG KEY , three to four wide on the turn,
was not a factor. CANT HOLD HER BACK was outrun. DOWN WITH BROWN disputed the early pace in the two path between horses and gave way
leaving the turn.

Footnotes
LITTLE LAUGHS pulled her way clear soon after the start, set a rated pace off the inside, wandered outward through the final furlong and held sway under a
drive. PRINCESS A'GO GO broke awkwardly and towards the outside, corrected and settled well wide, commenced a run leaving the half mile marker,
circled four to five wide into the stretch and closed steadily. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ chased the pace, raced three wide under pressure into the stretch but
went evenly through the final furlong. IAM A DANCER , off the pace, was under a ride mid turn, came four wide for the drive but lacked a solid response.
GO WILLOW GO stalked the pace, saw the winner get away around the turn and weakened in upper stretch. ESTRELLA GRANDE dropped back early.

Footnotes
COURTESY SHUFFLE sped clear in the opening furlong then secured the rail, set the pace under a light hold, moved away around the turn, was put to a
drive in upper stretch and was all out to hold sway. BABY BAM BAM , inside rivals stalking the winner nearing the half mile marker, eased out past the five
sixteenths and closed steadily. HOSS KITTEN broke a step slow, rushed up between rivals soon after, chased off the inside around the turn, came about
four wide for the drive and slowly gained. MEET MICHELLE , three wide between runners nearing the turn, raced four wide pursuing into the stretch, shifted
in some late and had a slight kick. MELISANDE , brushed at the break, raced five wide outside rivals heading towards the turn, dropped back around the
turn and lacked a rally. BOW MAKER came out at the start and brushed with a rival, raced four wide between foes, checked near the half mile pole, faded
and wandered outward late. SHE WORKS ALL WEEK , well wide nearing the turn, dropped back.

Footnotes
SPARTY assumed the early lead, saved ground on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, was engaged by BOBBY G in mid stretch, dueled with that one and
determinedly prevailed. BOBBY G stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, floated to the four path in upper stretch, bid for the lead in mid stretch,
dueled and just missed in a game effort. SPRING EMPEROR saved ground around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and finished willingly.
CLOUD CHASER chased the pace outside the winner around the turn and gradually weakened in the drive. THREETHEHARDWAY , three wide on the
turn, was not a factor. INCORPORATE raced along the inner rail around the turn and was outrun. LINDA'S NEKIA , four deep on the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
ESTERINA bobbled at the break, sprinted clear early, set the pace slightly off the rail, drifted out turning for home, was under urging in the drive and
remained clear while drifting out near the sixteenth pole. FAIRY WISH , patiently handled down the backstretch, circled the turn four deep and rallied. OUR
STAR hugged the inner rail and failed to rally. LUNAR RILLE , three wide entering the turn, chased the pace and gave way. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK , two
wide on the turn chasing the pace, failed to keep up, swung to the five path in upper stretch and weakened.
