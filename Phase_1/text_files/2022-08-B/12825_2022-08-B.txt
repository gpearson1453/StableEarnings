Footnotes
HOLIDAY AROUSAL away quickly then chased the leader into the first turn, pulled in the two path around the bend and into the backstretch, stalked
between nearing the far turn, was closest in pursuit and took aim at the leader three wide entering the stretch, drew alongside past the eight pole and drove
clear late. WALL STREET TRADER broke a step slow and bumped with inner rival, pulled hard prior to the turn, chased three wide then was keen to go on
and went up to take control on the backstretch, held a comfortable lead through the far turn, led clear into the final furlong, challenged from outside soon
after, relinquished control to the winner but was clearly second best. WESTPHAL traveled along the inside then shifted out and bothered rival on the first
turn, traveled off the rail near the back of the field, continued wide around the far turn and went five wide into the stretch and was along for third.
MONOLOGUE stumbled leaving the gate, tracked three wide early, lost ground on the far turn and entered the stretch four wide and flattened. STAR
ENTRY broke a bit slow and bumped with rival, traveled two wide early, raced on the inside into the far turn, eased out and came three wide into the drive
and lacked a rally. ARTHUR SPOONER sped clear and crossed over, lost command and chased inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
turn and weakened. IN THE MIDST stumbled in the beginning, went two wide into the first turn then got forced out shortly after, trailed five wide into the lane
and tired.

Footnotes
WARRENS WORLD broke inward and was quickly corrected and set to the front, showed the way on the inside into the turn, met the bid from CANDY'S
WILD CAT on the turn, disposed of that rival at the top of the stretch and widened under right-handed urging. CANDY'S WILDCAT stalked the leader up the
backstretch, bid from outside on the turn, could not keep up at the top of the stretch and stayed on to secure second. CHAOKOON got knocked into outside
rival at the start and dropped back early, went four wide into the turn, angled in some then came back out and entered the stretch four wide and rallied for
the show. REEF CITY got bumped hard from inside leaving the gate, sat off the pace in the early going, went four then five wide around the turn and got
outkicked by CHAOKOON for third. KING ZOG got knocked into outside rival at the start, chased two wide or outside a rival on the turn and lacked a rally.
START THEM UP chased on the inside, paused late on the far turn inside a rival, roused again into the stretch and never responded when called upon.
MISSING THEM tracked the top pair early on, asked three then four wide on the tur and weakened. ANGELA'S ANGEL veered out and bumped hard at the
start, trailed three then two wide on the turn and had little left for the drive. THERE WAS AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START AND AFTER A REVIEW
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH ANGELA'S ANGEL DID VEER OUT AND CAUSE A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN SEVERAL RUNNERS,
ANGELA'S ANGEL FINISHED LAST SO THERE WOULD NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
EMERALD LAKE chased on the inside and became rank entering the stretch for the first time, trailed up the backstretch, gained through the far turn, rallied
inside the top trio with a furlong to go and kicked clear. YOUTE away quickly in the beginning then ceded control to CALLHERCONTESSA, stalked the
leader from inside then moved out and launched bid from outside into the far turn, fought through the bend and into the stretch, took over at the eighth pole,
lost the advantage at the sixteenth marker and held the place. SKY ON ICE chased between then moved inside, tipped out into the stretch, challenged four
deep entering the final furlong and lacked the needed late kick. CALLHERCONTESSA hopped and came away last, chased five deep leaving the chute then
went up to clear the field and steered inside, showed the way up the backstretch, responded when challenged into the far turn, fought to upper stretch then
relinquished control at the eighth pole and flattened to fourth. QUEEN OF POMPEII tracked three deep into the stretch for the first time, traveled between
foes in the two path on the clubhouse turn, spun three wide into the lane and failed to rally. SUNSHINE BABE chased four then three deep early, remained
off the rail and came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. JOYMAKER stalked in the two path early on, went three deep in the far turn, dropped back
late on the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
DERBY QUEST broke a step slow and brushed at the start, dropped back and steered inside, tipped out late on the turn, angled outside the leader in the
stretch, overhauled that foe midstretch and drew away. SPANISH CHANNEL dueled for the lead from outside, disposed of inner rival with a quarter mile left
to run, urged left-handed in upper stretch and led clear to the eighth pole, yielded to the winner midstretch and stayed on to hold the place. FOR LOVE NOT
MONEY stalked the top pair outside a rival, took the turn three then four wide and lacked a bid in the furlong grounds. BACK ON THE STREET was off slow
to begin, chased two wide into the turn, dropped back and entered the lane four wide, then churned on to pass tired rivals and earn a minor award.
WHISKEY BLUE broke a step slow when brushing with rival at the start, chased three deep into the turn, traveled four then five wide on the turn and made
no impact. MACHTENHAIRONFIRE stumbled leaving the gate then lugged in early, went up to duel from inside, lost touch with outer rival nearing the
quarter pole and gave way. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE tracked four deep into the turn, exited the bend six wide and weakened.

Footnotes
DAMAZIO stalked six deep up the backstretch, bid five deep on the turn, led four wide into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted to the inside and
held on. QUEEN'S CODE tracked between well off the rail, bid four deep around the turn, got put in tight at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the leaders past
the quarter pole, came again in deep stretch but was too late. ALWAYS LITT got bumped at the start, dueled for the lead from outside then vied between
rivals around the bend and into the stretch, then flattened to third. BIG GUN sat off the pace, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the lane and
needed to find more in deep stretch. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME tracked outside rivals early on, went five wide into the turn, remained wide into the drive,
missed a minor award and failed to threaten. BIG SPIN was off slow in the beginning, climbed early on, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch and improved
position. MASK OFF bumped outside rival at the start, dueled for command on the inside, vied through the turn, then weakened in the drive. TORRID
TOMMY was off slow and shifted out at the start, was rank up the backstretch while climbing, taken out very wide by the rider, angled back in some on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch and was not a factor. DADSTAR pressed the pace three deep up the backstretch and on the turn, could not keep up
with a quarter mile left to run and weakened. MOURVEDRE stumbled leaving the gate but quickly recovered, traveled in mid-pack off the rail into the turn,
came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. GO LAKER GO chased off the rail, dropped back between on the turn and faded.

LEXINGTON HUMOR stalked the speed outside a rival, moved out in the lane, closed well and drew clear in the closing moments. BABY STEPS dueled for
command from inside, battled to upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth and was overtaken by the winner. SHES'A PERFECTLADY bumped leaving the
gate, chased two wide to the stretch, angled to the inside and finished willingly for the show. TOM'S BEAUTY brushed in the beginning, tracked on the
inside up the backstretch, got shuffled near the three-eighths pole, swung out into the stretch, launched a mild late bid and missed the show. CANAM GAL
chased outside a rival, tipped out and kept on through the lane but needed to find more late. FULMINATE dueled for command from outside into and around
the turn and into the stretch but weakened in the late stages. WOODBINE WAY traveled three deep in mid-pack, checked between rivals on the turn, got
carried out into the stretch and lacked a rally. ICONIC SKY broke in and bumped leaving the gate, stalked the top pair from inside, cut the corner into the
stretch and lacked a late bid. GET ON THE BUS was off slow and bumped from outside, steered down to the inside trailing the field, saved ground to the
stretch and failed to menace. DEL MAR DRAMA broke in and bumped rival, raced outside a rival near the back of the pack, got forced out at the
five-sixteenths pole, angled back down to the three path and was not a factor. OVER ATTRACTED dropped back early, got blocked and had to check
behind a steadying rival, went two wide into the lane and was never a threat.

FASHIONABLY FAST stalked the top pair to the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, rallied in the lane and dug in for the victory.
LETSGETLUCKY was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside on the turn, lost contact at the top of the lane, came again in deep stretch but got
outkicked by the winner. HOWBEIT chased three wide into the turn, angled out and exited the bend six wide, rallied widest in the furlong grounds and
finished a game third. KID CORLEONE set the pace early on, responded when challenged on turn, moved clear at the top of the lane, resisted into the final
sixteenth and yielded late. TIGRE DI SLUGO took back in the beginning, trailed early, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the inside then steered
back out and came six wide into the stretch and was not a factor. DESMOND DOSS was off a bit slow from inside, chased two wide into the turn, came four
wide into the drive and flattened out. APPREHEND chased outside rivals out of range, moved out four wide early on the turn, got floated out seven wide late
on the bend and had little left for the drive.

LAUREL RIVER forwardly placed early, stalked the top trio into the turn, waited for room behind the top pair past the five-sixteenths pole, gained an opening
and split the leaders with a quarter mile remaining, took over leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away under a tap of left-handed
urging and strong handling. AMERICAN THEOREM settled outside rivals then moved into range up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, roused
nearing the quarter pole, tipped out and came six wide into the stretch, finished determinedly in the lane and bested the rest. SENOR BUSCADOR came
away slow from outside, sat off the pace outside rivals, raced wide through the turn and entered the stretch seven wide, offered a mild response to urging
and gained the show. SPEAKER'S CORNER sped to the front and showed the way early then got pressured from inside, dueled through the turn and vied
four wide into the lane, could not go on with the winner in upper stretch and flattened to a minor award. THE CHOSEN VRON tracked between foes then
three wide through the turn and failed to summon the needed rally. DEFUNDED raced up close outside the top pair, chased five wide into the lane, lost his
path near the eighth pole and churned on through the late stages. GET HER NUMBER climbed early near the back, went three wide into the turn, five wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. C Z ROCKET was off slow and inward at the start, tracked on the inside then two wide into the lane and never
responded to urging. PRINCIPE CARLO chased the leader early then went up to duel for command from inside, fought along the rail through the turn, then
gave way in the stretch run. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE was off a bit slow to begin, drifted out while trailing up the backstretch, went five then six wide
around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BORDER TOWN was off a bit slow to begin, became a bit rank when trying to be reserved near the back, swung out into the stretch, closed fast and got up
in time. CANE CREEK ROAD led four wide leaving the chute, cleared inner rival and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear into the final
sixteenth and got nailed in the final moments. SWORD ZORRO (IRE) raced in range outside a rival, chased two wide into the stretch, stayed within striking
distance through the final furlong, gained ground late but lacked the needed late punch. PRODIGAL SON tracked three wide the moved into the two path,
entered the lane three wide, moved out in the drive then drifted and caused TABLE FOR TEN to check and finished willingly. TABLE FOR TEN stalked off
the rail then moved inside, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out into the stretch, forced to check by PRODIGAL SON late which halted any momentum.
CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE was off slow to begin, unhurried in the early stages on the inside, moved out for the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and
lacked a rally. THRESHOLD raced along he inside near the back, tipped two wide leaving the far turn, altered in at the eighth pole then lost his path late.
TED broke well and was prominent leaving the chute, ceded command and started to pull, stalked in hand outside a rival on the backstretch, went three
wide into the lane and weakened. CONO was a bit fractious in the gate, became rank entering the stretch the first time, continued pulling chasing behind the
leader, asked along the rail entering the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong.
