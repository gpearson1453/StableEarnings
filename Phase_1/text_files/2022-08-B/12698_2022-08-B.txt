CRESCENT WILDCAT set all the pace, was clear to the stretch then was tiring but held safely. SNICKER'N DAN chased the winner throughout and was
gaining on that tiring one. MR MEMPHIS was outrun early, settled, came two wide to the stretch and gained some late. ZOE'S PAPA CEE also was outrun,
settled just off MR MEMPHIS, saved ground to the stretch and closed the gap without threatening.

FLASHY PASS contested the pace from the rail to the second turn, drifted out into the stretch forcing HEY WILMAAA off her path, then dug in determinedly
to hold. SOMARA chased the leaders to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then was forced out by HEY WILMAAA in mid stretch, recovered and
nipped that one for second. HEY WILMAAA attended the pace outside FLASHY PASS to the second turn, was forced off her path in upper stretch and got
nailed late for second. KAYLA'S COWGIRL drifted five wide to the backstretch, tracked to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch but lacked the
needed late response. COWLITZ was on the pace between rivals to the backstretch, dropped back nearing the second turn and weakened in the stretch.
The jockey on SOMARA lodged a claim of foul against the winner and following a review the stewards disqualified FLASHY PASS from first and placed her
third.

KEEN JAMES dueled for the lead early then edged away on the backstretch, responded and remained clear driving. ABADON tracked the pace to the
second turn, came two wide to the stretch but did not threaten the winner while besting the others. HAKUNUI chased from the rail to the stretch but lacked a
closing response. ONE LAST THOUGHT hustled early to duel to the first turn but bore out six wide to the backstretch, remained well wide throughout and
was never a factor. MR. MERCEDES had no speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
TIMBERLAKE GAGE dueled for the lead to the backstretch, pushed to the front, saved ground then responded to kick clear to the line. MERGIE TROID was
chasing to the backstretch, came two wide to the stretch then responded when clear and surged late to get the nod for second. PULPIT SINGER had no
speed, settled to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. MORNING BLURS contest the pace early then
pressed the winner to the second turn, got outkicked to the stretch and weakened late. SECRETLY PARANOIDE was chasing early, bid three wide on the
second turn but lacked the needed late response. TIGER MOM was four wide to the backstretch, remained four wide throughout and did not rally. GEMMA
ROYAL had no speed and was not a factor.
