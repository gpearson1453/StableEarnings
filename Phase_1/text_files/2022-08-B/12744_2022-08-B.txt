SKY FACTOR away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, maintained a
clear advantage while saving ground at the rail through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late while proving best. ANAAMY stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and while no threat to the winner, finished
gamely two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. GWEN steadied briefly when put in tight quarters along the rail approaching the wire the first time,
before racing into a stalking trip from along the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. FLICKER DANCE unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, bided her time at the
back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing three wide in
the drive to just miss the show position. DEVINE DANCING broke sharply and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from
the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong, while continuing with a three wide trip throughout.

BIG UNION broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, set sail after the leader two wide entering the
final turn, collared that rival leaving the turn, and inched clear late over a very game FINDING WAYS. FINDING WAYS away alertly and raced to the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was collared by BIG UNION leaving the turn,
and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch while proving clearly second best. MACHINE stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two
out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. SLEW'S DA BOSS unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing four out from the rail in the drive.
DRILLER stalked the leader from along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and was outfinished over the
final furlong.

BE QUICK broke sharply and raced to a pressured lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to set a contested pace from the
inside of NINE ONE ONE in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, began to get the better of his pace rival straightening for home, and
inched clear late over a very determinedly rival. NINE ONE ONE away well and pressed the pace three wide entering the stretch the first time, continued to
force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with BE QUICK turning into the lane, but
fought on stubbornly through the lane to prove easily second best. MOUNT ASGARD unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid two wide
approaching the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. EDDIE WHO stalked the contested early pace while racing one out from
the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked
the needed closing response when called upon. ALL LIQUORD UP away alertly and dueled for the lead from between rivals entering the stretch the first
time, before easing into a tracking trip from along the inside in the run to the second turn, began to drop back in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer
late.

ICE BREAKER tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and wore down SILK STILETTOS late to prevail. SILK
STILETTOS broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of KOALA through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off the late surge from ICE BREAKER in the
closing strides. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained her position in the
run down the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to be along for a share. WALKINTHEWALK
unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide from the back of the pack entering the
final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. KOALA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first
time, set a pressured pace through the lane the first time and in the run down the backstretch, battled from the inside of SILK STILETTOS entering the final
turn, was unable to match strides with that rival leaving the turn, and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
BUCK IN COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, and ran on gamely to fend off a late surge from LEGACY SQUARE to prevail. LEGACY SQUARE stalked the leader
through the first turn while being forced four wide into the backstretch, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside while steadying slightly
midway to the final turn, rallied smartly three wide through the turn, and finished full of run but was unable to get the better of a stubborn foe. BAK TO
LIBERTY tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, shifted four wide briefly four wide midway down the backside while
forcing his stablemate to steady slightly, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share.
LOGICAL AL was bumped slightly off stride entering the first turn, before settling towards the back of the pack, rallied three wide through the final turn, and
improved his position over the final furlong while finishing five eide in the drive. COUNTERACT was bumped solidly entering the first turn, but raced into a
tracking trip one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive.
TIME TICKER broke sharply and shifted out slightly entering the first turn while bumping with LOGICAL AL, settled well off the leaders while racing just out
from the rail in the run down the backstretch, saved ground into the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. MAGIC ROAD drifted
out entering the first turn while bumping COUNTERACT solidly, raced into a stalking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, but faded over the
final furlong. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into an incident entering the first turn. After review there was no change
made to the original order of finish. The three quarter split for this race was currently unavailable

LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND tracked the leaders into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, held her position in the run t o the final turn, split rivals
while commencing a two wide bid entering the final turn, quickly took control leaving the turn and drew clear as much the best. MATSQUI settled off the
early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from just off the rail through the final turn, tipped four wide entering
the lane, and closed willingly to get up for the place. LICORICE away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, shook off her pace
rival entering the final turn, but was quickly tackled by LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND, was no match for that rival in the late stages, but battled gamely two
wide in the drive to garner a share. ISLAND LIVING settled off the contested early pace while racing three out from the rail in the run down the backside,
rallied smartly four wide through the final turn, but was unable to sustain her bid late while continuing five wide in the drive. AIR FORCE broke sharply but
was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, checked
when lacking room midway through the turn while attempting to split rivals , and finished three wide in the drive. HIGHER IMAGE unhurried early while
dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. FILLY FATALE stalked the
dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, saved ground entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon. CALYPSO PRINCESS away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of LICORICE entering the first turn, continued to
force the issue from the outside of that rival to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's
claim of foul. The rider of FILLY FATALE lodged a claim of foul against the rider of AIR FORCE for alleged interference on the final turn. After review the
claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish

DAPHNE away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from the outside of KLOEPATRA entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace in the run
down the backstretch, held a clear lead into the final turn, and held WE B THREE safely at bay late to prove best. WE B THREE stalked the leaders through
the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, raced herself into a tracking trip two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through
the final turn, and closed from just off the rail in the drive to prove second best. MARYS TAPPIN SHOES unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. KLOEPATRA away well and
tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, chased the pacesetter through the second turn while continuing to save
ground, lost position on the pacesetter in the run to the final turn while still at the rail, and was outfinished over the final furlong. VISENYA broke sharply and
stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, struggled to keep in striking position in the run to the final turn, and
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. AMANDA settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first
time, bided her time well off the leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when
called upon. The one mile split for this race was currently unavailable
