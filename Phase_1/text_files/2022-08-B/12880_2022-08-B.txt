DISTORTED LIMITS was reluctant to load, raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed steadily
outside and was up late to win going away. MR. EXTENSION chased the pacesetter, bid on the turn, took over, drew clear, dug in gamely in the stretch and
yielded grudgingly. TIZ HANDSOME raced two wide off the pace, rallied mildly on the rail and got up for third. HOPE FOR GOLD raced off the pace inside,
advanced two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and flattened out. I'M OVER U raced two wide off the pace, saved ground on the turn, angled
out entering the stretch and lacked a rally. POP POP SUSI set the pace on the inside and gave way in the lane. CLASSIC ESCAPE was fractious just prior
to the start, hit the gate and was off poorly, then outrun.
