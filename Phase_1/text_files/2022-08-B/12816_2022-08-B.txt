Footnotes
MAPLE LEAF MEL coaxed from the gate, dueled early on four then three wide with SONG PARODY to her inside, shook off that rival five furlongs from
home and showed the way tucking to the two path through the turn, steadily came under pressure from LADY MINE to the outside, swung three to four wide
into upper stretch let out for the drive, rebuffed the challenge and edged clear under a drive, then got geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish.
LADY MINE coaxed from the start, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced to
issue a challenge five-sixteenths from home placed to coaxing, swung five wide into upper stretch, got rebuffed by the top one straightened away and
chased the winner home clear for the place honors. MIRACLE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the turn put
to coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. LES BON TEMPS coaxed from the
gate, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. SONG PARODY was hard to load prior to the start requiring the use of a blindfold and some spinning
before being loaded, got coaxed from the gate and dueled briefly three then two wide with MAPLE LEAF MEL to her outside before being shaken off five
furlongs from home, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
KANT HURRY LOVE was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage while well out in the track, controlled the action in the two path
around the turn, extended the advantage three wide into the stretch, shied out when flagged with a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, was given
one pop of a right-handed crop inside that marker, shied out again when flagged with a left-handed crop just inside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady
urging. PHOTON was urged from the gate then allowed to settle off the pace, saved ground around the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came
under the crop in upper stretch, gained in the final furlong and finished with good courage but was too late while clear for the place. FUNNY HOW broke in
and brushed the gate then was hustled, established a good position just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was given her cue at the
five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch under a drive, pursued the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the
show. VOLEUSE broke out at the start, dropped to the rear then settled at the back, went four then five wide around the turn, was roused seven wide into
the stretch and finished with late energy to just miss the show. MISCHIEF MOTION was hustled from the start, moved outside the leader at the five-eighths,
chased the pace three wide through the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole
and tired. UPTOWN EXPRESS was last to commence, raced towards the rear under urging, went three then four wide around the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. UNKOALAFIED was urged along towards the rear, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn, spun three wide
into the stretch and was no factor. LAOCHI settled on the outside, tracked four wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, dropped back six wide into
the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES tossed his head and lunged at the break getting away last and conceded two to three lengths to the front, raced just off the
inside at the tail of the field through the first turn before tipping three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked back to the two path through
the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when tipping out three then four wide inside that station, angled seven to eight wide into upper
stretch, rallied with good courage to take command just inside the eighth pole and edged clear under a drive to prevail. BARESE three wide through the first
turn, dueled four then three wide with MONTEBELLO to his inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive continuing to knock heads and was overtaken in tandem by the top one, ran on to safely secure the place honors. MONTEBELLO coaxed
from the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn, then dueled three then two wide with BARESE to his outside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in clinging to the front when overhauled by the top one just inside the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. PRICE DISCIPLINE along the rail into the first turn, tipped to the two path for the majority of the run around the opening bend,
raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch advancing to briefly latch on the duel five furlongs from home before being shaken off near the half mile
pole, came under coaxing four wide at the seven-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch in retreat and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
BOSS JIM bumped with a rival at the start, displayed good speed, set the pace under pressure from both sides, vied in the two then three path around the
turn, shook clear in the four path into the stretch, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and held under strong urging. CHULLIGAN
broke in then made light contact with a foe, settled well off the pace under some urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide late
on that bend, drifted inward in upper stretch and finished with good energy to get the place. JACKSON HEIGHTS was ridden along on the outside, went five
then six wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive while outside in the stretch and lacked the needed kick but narrowly earned the show. QUICK
TO ACCUSE broke awkwardly then bumped with a foe at the start, pressed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail early on the turn then
moved to the two path, was roused at the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner while shifting three wide into the stretch then came a path further out,
chased in the drive and just missed the show. WITH KNOW NAME broke out at the start, was urged along on the outside, dropped from the three path to
the rail around the turn, gained to reach a reasonable striking position in upper stretch but flattened out and just missed the superfecta. MAX FOSTER broke
in at the start, chased the leading trio from fourth, went three wide early on the turn then moved to five wide, continued five wide into the stretch, moved out
some inside the three-sixteenths and weakened. FLASHY ALEX was hustled from the start then corrected with a tug of the right-rein, raced at the rear
under urging, went four wide on the turn and was no factor. STOW ON THE WOLD broke out and hit the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped
back four wide on the turn and retreated. MICHAEL LEIS was ridden along towards the rear, dropped back in the two path on the turn and faltered then was
eased but walked off.

FINGAL'S CAVE lightly coaxed from the start, raced three wide through the first turn latched on the leader before tipping five to six paths off the inside down
the backstretch easing off that rival to track in closest aim, tucked four wide nearing the far turn and advanced to latch back on the leader with
seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got floated out six to seven wide into upper stretch to the outside of LET HER INSPIRE
U, dug in under a drive head to head just inside the eighth pole and came inwards under a right handed crop nudging LET HER INSPIRE U when seizing
command just outside the sixteenth marker and gamely inched away to prevail at the end. LET HER INSPIRE U coaxed from the gate, established the front
just after the break and showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn under some pressure from the aforementioned foe before that rival
backed off, raced four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the far turn coming under increasing pressure to
the outside from FINGAL'S CAVE, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and floated her main danger out at the top of the stretch when swinging five to
six wide for home and carrying FINGAL'S CAVE six to seven wide, dug in under threat clinging to the front a furlong out, then got carried inward and
bumped just outside the sixteenth pole as FINGAL'S CAVE came in under a right handed crop and was headed for the front at that station, fought on
gamely to the end to be along second best when clear of the rest. VENTI VALENTINE three wide through the first turn, chased five wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while isolated and well clear for the show honors. SHESASCOLDASICE
got bumped at the start by GALAXINA, who broke inwards, raced two to three wide through the first turn and then six paths off the inside down the
backstretch steadily growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked three wide through the far turn and went four wide into upper stretch, tired in the drive.
GALAXINA broke in at the start bumping SHESASCOLDASICE, chased just off the inside through the opening bend and then four then three wide down the
backstretch, tucked back to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide for home and tired.

ANDIAMO A FIRENZE coaxed from the gate, raced among a quartet early on before settling in closest aim of a duel five then four wide down the
backstretch, went four wide through the turn taking over command at the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive
shying in under a right handed crop a furlong out and then again a sixteenth from home before being geared down in the late going. DONEGAL SURGES
six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. ACOUSTIC AVE hustled from the gate, chased
along the inside early on until tipped two to three wide nearing the half mile pole, continued to tip out once in the turn to be four to five wide midway when
placed to light coaxing, went seven wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. GENERAL BANKER six to seven
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to be along the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into
upper stretch, offered up a bid improving position to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. BELT PARKWAY coaxed from the gate, vied briefly
early on before emerging to duel four then three wide with I'M WIDE AWAKE to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when displaced from
the front in concert with his main pace rival, spun three wide for home and tired. I'M WIDE AWAKE coaxed from the gate, vied briefly among a quartet
before dueling from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his outside, got displaced in tandem with his main pace rival at the five-sixteenths, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole and went five wide for home, then drifted out when giving way and was eased home to the finish.

MAKE MISCHIEF came away in front, showed the way in the two path on the first turn, lost the advantage late on that bend then was eased back off the
pace, switched out before the three-quarter pole, tracked outside from that point, moved up with five furlongs to run to prompt on the outside, vied in the four
path on the far turn, took the lead under her own power inside the five-sixteenths, shook clear while set down into the stretch, drew away under a drive into
the final furlong then was placed under a moderate hand-ride while widening to win ridden out. ICE PRINCESS went around the first turn in the two path,
settled comfortably in third position, traveled in the two path early on the far turn, was roused coming to the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide, was
driven five wide into the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. WASP leaned out at the start, moved up in the three path around the
first turn, took the lead late on that bend then moved clear, was challenged on the outside with five furlongs to run, vied in the two path on the far turn, was
asked under heavy threat at the five-sixteenths then lost the advantage to the winner, dropped back into the stretch and weakened but was well clear for
third money. WAR CANOE saved ground around the opening bend, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside early on the far turn, shifted three wide
before the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS broke a bit awkwardly, went four wide around the first turn, settled on the far
outside, was urged five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
SLOW DECISION bobbled at the break, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive taking command near the eighth pole, then edged away to the finish kept to task. BOINTHEBACK three to four wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. WHISKY WARRIOR chased just off the
inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered up
a mild bid. HERONEANDONLY bumped at the start by DRESSEDFORTHEFIFTH, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths when under pressure for the initial time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, then
weakened in the late stages. ADDICTED TO YOU stumbled at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. DRESSEDFORTHEFIFTH broke in at the start bumping HERONEANDONLY, chased three to four wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenth and briefly went five wide through the turn until tucked back four wide near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper
stretch and came up empty. DON BERNARDO broke out a step at the start, chased three wide until put to coaxing tucked inside half a mile from home,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. STAND UNITED five then four wide through the first turn, chased four wide down the
backstretch until tucked to the two path put to coaxing half a mile from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, faltered and was eased home to the
finish.
