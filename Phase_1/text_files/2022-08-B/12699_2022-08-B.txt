JOHNNY LONGBOAT rated from outside, angled in entering the second bend, came off the rail leaving that turn, battled three wide through the stretch,
bumping several times with TRY TRY AGAIN and edged ahead late. TRY TRY AGAIN kept close between rivals, went for the lead outside PRINCE OF
MAYHEM after a half mile, engaged that one on the second turn, fought on even terms in tight quarters between horses, bumping several times with the
latter and JOHNNY LONGBOAT and narrowly missed in a game effort. PRINCE OF MAYHEM was sent to get the lead, showed the way in hand on the
backstretch, was roused leaving the second turn, dueled gamely through the stretch, bumping several times with TRY TRY AGAIN and did not have enough
left in the waning yards. JOEY B raced in contention from inside for nearly six furlongs, angled out leaving the second turn and steadily faded. PENALTY
SHOT pressed the pacer three and four wide then gave way the last two furlongs. ROAR OF THE LION saved ground and showed little.

Footnotes
BOWS N LACE stalked the early speed from outside, commenced her bid after a half mile, took the lead into the second bend, quickly moved clear, was
under a drive through the lane, drifted out some deep stretch under left-handed pressure and got the nod at the wire. KIMBERLY FRANCES settled at the
back, picked up her pace after a half mile, rallied steadily from outside, was all out in the lane, just missed but proved easily second best. WATCHIN THE
WHEELS was boxed in behind the pace in the early going, gained a clear path nearing the second turn, was two wide taking that bend, no match for the top
pair but pulled away from the rest for third in the stretch. HIDENSEEK SALLY broke in the air then tried to buck again on her landing, chased from off the rail
and was not a factor. TEMRIK broke on top and was quickly clear, showed the way from inside, was overtaken into the second bend then continued to
steadily give way the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
WEEKEND PASS pressed from outside, took over two wide on the second turn, floated out some entering the lane, steadily drifted out despite right-handed
pressure but held sway. BEZEL SET rated off the early speed, also made her move on the second bend to vie for the lead outside WEEKEND PASS, did
not keep up leaving that turn, steadily angled out to keep a clear path outside the latter in the stretch and did not have the extra needed in the waning yards.
SIMPLY FAST progressed from outside, reached contention four wide on the second turn, fanned out further into the stretch, altered in when the top pair
continued to come out with a sixteenth left, finished evenly but was easily best of the others. MEXIA advanced between rivals on the backstretch, was two
wide on the second bend, lost ground swinging outside SIMPLY FAST for the stretch run, moved inside for a clear path inside the last furlong and also had
no late bid. THEYCALLHERPINKY broke on top but retreated from outside on the backstretch and had no stretch rally. THE MORE I BURN soon had a
clear lead and the inside but gave way before finishing six furlongs. LILLY BELLE steadily faded from inside, distanced herself in stretch and was walked off
after the race.

KHOZIE'S GHOST sprinted clear after the break, showed the way in hand on the backstretch and second bend, was roused at the top of the lane then
steadily lengthened command while kept to task until near the wire. CARSON RESERVE forwardly placed from outside, made her bid just outside
KHOZIE'S GHOST on the second bend, was no match for that one when set down for the drive and could only just hold her position late. AROSE FOR
LYLA came into contention from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the second turn, took over third along the rail upper stretch, leveled off late
but lasted for the show. LINDALOUIMAGE was prominent just off the inside for five furlongs, failed to stay with the top pair on the second turn, fanned out
some for the stretch run and was closing in for third in the waning yards. WAR COLORS broke awkwardly and was always outrun.

PERFECT LIMIT was kept close between rivals, three wide taking the turn, took the lead under urging nearing the furlong marker and gradually opened up
while kept to urging until the waning yards. WITCHING settled outside, picked up her pace two wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, took over
second inside the last eighth then could only hold her position late. FRIEND jostled with DOLLY'S LINE shortly after entering the main track, was steadied,
altered out, lost ground four wide through the turn, gained third nearing the sixteenth marker, finished evenly but was easily best of the rest. DOLLY'S LINE
jostled with FRIEND when her path was compromised shortly after entering the main track, was also steadied, altered to the inside, took the lead two wide
on the bend but flattened out from inside the final furlong. HALLIE'S RAINBOW quickly sprinted clear but began to fade from inside before finishing a half
mile. LORI ATTACK bobbled slightly as she broke on top, was quickly chasing HALLIE'S RAINBOW, altered out shortly after entering the main track to race
in contention two wide, gave way from inside with three furlongs to go, her rider lost his whip on the bend, she swung to the outside entering the lane and
had no late bid.

RATTLE N ROLL was bumped and forced into STRIKE HARD at the break, settled back, advanced from outside on the backstretch, put to urging five wide
on the second turn, took over upper stretch and drew off inside the last eighth while kept to task until the waning yards. WAR CAMPAIGN settled between
horses, angled in some midway on the backstretch, picked up his pace after a half mile, came into contention four wide on the second bend, fanned out
further entering the lane and gained second deep stretch. BRIGADIER GENERAL bumped several times with ST ANDREWS going to the first turn, was well
placed from inside, took the lead along the rail into the stretch, was overtaken approaching the last furlong and began to wear down in the late going. BIG
BLUE LINE broke inward, bumped solidly with RATTLE N ROLL, prompted the pace four wide, vied for the lead on the second turn then flattened out for the
drive. CHILENO was void of speed, though hustled along on the backstretch, four wide through the second bend, angled to the outside upper stretch and
passed tired ones. HERN prompted ONE TIMER from just outside, vied for the lead briefly between rivals on the second turn then gave way for the stretch
run. STRIKE HARD bumped at the start, faded from just off or along the rail on the backstretch, was three wide through the second turn and had no late bid.
ST ANDREWS was caught in tight between horses shortly after the break, jostled with BRIGADIER GENERAL nearing and into the first bend, made his bid
three wide on the second turn but gave way into the lane. ONE TIMER quickly circled rivals to gain a clear lead, showed the way just off the inside, was
challenged from both sides on the second bend and quickly yielded the last two furlongs.

KHOZAN'S VALENTINE stalked VALIANT VINNY from outside, came to that one on the bend, moved clear when asked leaving the turn then steadily
widened command while kept to urging in the lane. TETSU rated from outside, was three wide on the turn, forced out some nearing the quarter pole, rallied
under hand urging in the stretch and edged ahead for second inside the last seventy yards. TETSU'S rider returned after the race without his whip. MARK
OF THE Z pressed the pace from just off the rail, came into the lane from path three, was no match for KHOZAN'S VALENTINE and gradually wore down
inside the final furlong. W W HOTSHOT forwardly placed just off or along the rail, swung out behind MARK OF THE Z into the stretch, altered in some soon
after and flattened out. W W CANDY chased from just off the inside, brushed with TETSU as he tried to force his way between horses nearing the quarter
pole, was steadied briefly, followed TETSU into the stretch and lacked a rally. VALIANT VINNY was sent to gain the early lead, was headed from outside on
the turn and gave way the final two furlongs.

Footnotes
CALL ME DROSSEL rated on the front end from outside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, came into the lane from path four, drifted out upper stretch,
was straightened inside the last furlong and kept MUNCH at bay under a drive. MUNCH prompted the early pace, gained second three wide on the bend,
lost ground staying outside CALL ME DROSSEL entering the lane and lacked the extra needed deep stretch. COPPER CROSSING moved to the inside
midway on the backstretch, closed the gap upper stretch but could not sustain his bid late. BLOOMING GARDEN inattentive in the gate, was a step slow at
the start, advanced between horses on the backstretch, was three wide taking the turn, passed between a couple tired rivals upper stretch, finished evenly
but was easily best of the others. EVIDENCE was prominent just off the inside, failed to keep up leaving the turn, continued to yield in the lane and finished
on even terms with RAZ COUNTRY. RAZ COUNTRY in contention early from outside, progressed four wide on the bend, lost more ground fanning outside
MUNCH into the stretch, gave way. OFF TO THE BEACH gradually retreated from between rivals on the backstretch, was widest taking the turn and had no
late bid. SWEET LITTLE RUE was soon well back, had the rail on the turn, swung out for the stretch run and had little to offer.
