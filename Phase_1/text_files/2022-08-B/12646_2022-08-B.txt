Footnotes
SNAP DECISION settled near the rear in the very early stages just after the start before jumping well at the first flight, then ranged up four wide into the first
turn when his rivals appeared hesitant to show the way and seized command himself tucking to the two path midway on that bend before making his way to
the inside, jumped well to maintain a carefully measured advantage under his own power briefly coaxed into fence three to build a safe buffer between
himself and his nearest rival, raced in hand holding sway until jumping early at the final flight as rivals in behind came under busy urging, widened away
through the final turn now in the flat and went clear in hand to prevail impressively and comfortably at the end. GOING COUNTRY (IRE) led early on before
settling just off the inside just off the pace, tipped out to the three or four path with each approaching jump and jumped well to maintain position with the
exception of flight seven when jumping late requiring brief coaxing to keep pace, came under urging clearing the final flight and tucked inside through the
final turn chasing the winner home while shaking off the rest to run on and secure the place honors. REDICEAN (GB) two to three wide ibn pursuit from near
the rear of the field, jumped well to maintain position and keep pace with the field, came under taps to the right side from the crop after fence four when
attempting to get out slightly, got urged along after clearing the final fence and improved position in the flat to procure the show honors. BELFAST BANTER
(IRE) tracked the pace along the inside jumping well with the exception of fence four when hurdling that one late, came under urging once in the flat after the
final flight and passed tired rivals to the finish. SONG FOR SOMEONE (GER) a bit washy prior to the race, tracked the pace along the inside jumping well
throughout, came under urging at the final fence and chased just off the inside through the last turn but tired in the drive. DOWN ROYAL saved ground in
pursuit from mid pack, came under light coaxing after clearing the final fence and went three wide through the final turn before tiring in the flat. CHIEF
JUSTICE (GB) led briefly just off the inside at the first flight before being displaced by the eventual winner into the first turn, tracked that rival along the
inside from a loose pocket, came under urging at fence eight, continued along the inside through the final turn and faltered in the flat.

QUICK RETURN showed good speed on the inside of a foe, was eased back outside the five-eighths then switched to the outside, moved up to make a bid
with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path around the turn, gained the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, kicked clear while still on his inside lead in
upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead outside the furlong marker and drew away under a strong hand-ride to prove much the best. WINNING DRIVE
was hustled from the gate, moved out under urging early then settled off the pace, went three then two wide under coaxing around the turn, dropped to the
rail in upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. O'TROUBLE was hustled from the start, moved out outside the five-eighths
then tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired while able to get the show.
CASALSA displayed good speed, moved clear when the winner was eased back outside the five-eighths, was challenged by that foe at the half-mile pole,
vied in the two path while under threat on the turn, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole and gave way. MANIFEST DESTINY settled well behind
while on the far outside, angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under urging and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
KEMBA went to the front, showed the way in the two path while a few paths inside of a foe to her outside, moved to the three path midway through the far
turn, responded well when asked in the five path into upper stretch, was shaken up more coming to the furlong marker, came under one pop of a
right-handed crop nearing the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a confident hand-ride to the wire while holding sway. I'M BUZZY broke a half-step slow,
went three wide around the opening bend, was reserved on the outside then inside a foe starting at the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the
final turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into upper stretch, remained on her inside lead until inside the three-sixteenths then
swapped to the proper lead, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well but was too late while clear for the place. FREEDOM MACHINE brushed the
outside of the gate at the start then brushed with a rival, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under encouragement inside the
five-sixteenths, spun into the two path entering the stretch then was corrected with the left-rein, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly to just
get the show. TALES OF MAKENNA bumped hard with a rival at the start and was off a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved
outside down the backstretch, moved up at the nine-sixteenths, was asked in the three path at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch, held a
reasonable striking position the final furlong but lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. FRENCH FRANC (FR) went three wide around the
opening bend, settled just off the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked
the needed response. SYNONYMOUS bumped hard with a foe at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused near the half-mile
pole, went two then three wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, moved out some around the furlong marker and failed to rally. MISS
INVINCIBLE broke in at the start, raced in the four path around the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the three then four path on the
far turn, spun six wide into the stretch, dropped back while still on her inside lead until outside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead while tossed
in by the rider near the furlong marker and tired. LEMON TAFFY brushed with a rival at the start, was taken in hand between horses early, raced just off
heels in the two path into the first turn then was reserved under restraint, leveled out before the five-eighths, was urged along while saving ground on the far
turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LEGENDS CAN'T DIE went to the front, showed the way on the inside with an uncontested advantage, controlled the action through the far turn, responded
well when asked at the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and proved much the best under strong handling. MACKILLOP
tucked into the two path entering the first turn, moved to the three path later on that bend, was rated on the outside, raced between foes passing the
half-mile pole, was asked in the three then two path on the far turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and proved no match while able to get the
place. MO REWARDS was reluctant to load, steadied in traffic nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was reserved towards the back,
came under urging at the half-mile pole, shifted from two to four wide late on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved with late energy for
the show. ANALOGY raced between horses in the three path around the opening bend, was reserved towards the back, traveled four wide on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. WISH ME HOME went four then three wide around the
first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back in the two path on the far turn and tired. EMBOITE (IRE) was taken up along the hedge early then
dropped back, moved from the inside to the two path around the opening bend, settled outside towards the rear, was urged three then two wide on the far
turn, gained some coming to the eighth-pole, altered out twice while lacking optimal room from that point to the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten.
MARITIME WINGS (IRE) moved up while tugging hard at the bit, raced between foes in the two path while pulling into the first turn, dropped to the hedge
midway through that bend, was rated off the pace, came under urging leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under
a drive, remained on his inside lead down the final straightaway and lacked the needed kick. HASHTAG NO WONDER went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was roused four wide on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into the stretch and
capitulated. SEAL BEACH moved from the rail to the two path around the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went three wide while roused on the far turn
and failed to respond.

Footnotes
U GLOW GIRL hustled from the gate, dueled in hand from the three path with RULER OF THE NIGHT to her inside, took over sole command near the
three-eighths marker and tucked to the two path at that station, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and drew
off under a drive to prevail. RISK FREE chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one while offering up a mild kick. CRYPTO MAMA coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. OH
DONNA away to an awkward beginning, lost her lane at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch and weakened. HAPPY WARRIOR broke out at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the nine-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the drive. RULER OF THE NIGHT coaxed from the start, dueled from the two path with U GLOW GIRL to her outside while coaxed
along from the get go, got displaced and nearing the three-eighths pole and tipped three wide at that station, faded and went five wide into upper stretch,
then folded in the stretch. RED HOT CHICK coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the nine-sixteenths, tucked inside
through the turn remaining along the rail into upper stretch, then made no impact. AMAZON BARBIE broke in at the start brushing OH DONNA, chased two
to three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SUNSET LOUISE brushed the outside of the gate at the start then bobbled and was off a half-step slow, bumped with MIA BEA STAR in the three path on
the first turn, tracked outside down the backstretch, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied outside two foes in the three path on the final turn, took the
lead in the four path while under the crop into upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, drifted in under one final pop of a
right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire while much the best. CARAMOCHA went three then two
wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied between foes under urging in the two path on the far turn, held a slim lead from the
three-eighths to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match
while clear for the place. U GUYS ARE NO FUN raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn,
swung six wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while along for the show. GRINGOTTS traveled around the opening bend in
the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. SILKEN DOLLAR dropped to the rail on the first
turn, showed the way with company to her outside, was urged along against the rail while inside of two foes on the far turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths,
dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. MIA BEA STAR bumped with SUNSET LOUISE while four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was given her cue in the four path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS

start bumping DAKOTA GOLD, settled just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and

three-eighths and came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide for home and offered no kick. CAGNEY tracked the leader in closest aim

Footnotes
GO BIG GREEN saved ground on the first turn, settled off the rail at the rear down the backstretch, was urged three wide around the far turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, rallied into the final furlong, moved out while gaining into the final sixteenth and closed well to get up late. OCEAN AIR
established a forward position early, went three wide around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in three path on the far
turn, gained to take the lead outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while just able to save the place. CAFE FLEUR (FR) was
bumped at the start then taken up while squeezed back between horses, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the two
path near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, chased the runner-up in the drive and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get
the show. DIXIE CANNON was hustled to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way with an uncontested advantage, vied inside
on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the furlong marker and was out-kicked
then missed the trifecta. PRINCESS PINKY tucked into the two path on the first turn, settled without cover on the backstretch, was roused three wide on the
far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BOCA was coaxed early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved under a
tight hold, saved ground while asked on the far turn, moved to the two path late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally.
FUNWHILEITLASTED moved from the two path to the four path around the first turn, lost action and took a few awkward strides near the three-quarter pole
then had the rider look back in case of needing to pull up his mount, regained stride then settled outside down the backstretch, dropped back four wide on
the far turn and failed to respond. BELLS ON HER TOES broke in and brushed the gate at the start, showed speed on the inside, was taken back under a
vigorous hold on the first turn, raced in a good position down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn and came up empty.
