Footnotes
CRYSTAL SHIP sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. MIDNIGHT
CHOIR well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then was no match for the winner and held the
place. FLOAT AWAY rated back early, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, drifted back in under right
hand urging, angled further out and missed the place. KIVALINA tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, weakened and held a share. ALATION well placed early, dropped back through the turn, then improved position in the lane. SWEET AMY passed a
tiring rival. VAN HAVEN stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
CHEAP AND CHEERFUL stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, then the lead outside a drifting rival
into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and held under steady pressure. LA PANDA well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn,
exchanged bumps with PARISIAN SUMMER into the stretch, then made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. WINE WITH A ROSE mid pack,
moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and edged up for the show. PARISIAN SUMMER dropped back in
the early going, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, exchanging bumps with LA PANDA, then weakened inside and held a
share. NOT LIKE MY ROAD broke awkwardly from the gate and improved her position. AIR ONE set the pace on the inside, drifted out into the stretch and
faded. FUNNEE was no factor.

YADI rated inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked lugging in, got through inside the leader late
and drove clear. SIDE TRACKED well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady
gain, then lacked the needed late kick, while edging up for the place. ATLANTIC SUN (GB) sprinted to a clear lead while racing, held sway to the final yards,
weakened and held the show. ST. PADDY'S DADDY unhurried, looped to position four wide through the second turn, drifted in to the three path into the
stretch and held position without gaining. HONOR COLLECTION passed tiring rivals. LOYALTY SPIRIT tracked the pace and faded through the second
turn. DAHOG was pulled up and vanned off.

HONORABLE sprinted to a clear lead quickly, held sway without challenge, drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. GREY INVASION unhurried early,
saved ground through the turns, came through inside, was bumped and hit the rail into the stretch, then could not gain on the winner and held the place
safe. SPEED WAY rated close up, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the lane and had a mild late gain.
GOLOVKIN well placed, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. LAKE NAKURU allowed
to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, angled widest in the stretch and improved his position. SUMMER PALACE passed tiring
rivals, inside. LUIS TWO GUNS rushed up outside to stalk the pace, then drifted in, bumping a rival into the stretch and faded. LUPI was a brief factor.

Footnotes
C C'S KITTEN mid pack, looped up five and six wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late. FAST AXTON
vied for the early lead on the inside, moved up and shook clear into the stretch, then was no match in the late going and held the place. AMERICAN CHAOS
tracked the pace, angled out three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then lacked the needed late kick. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN mid pack,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened inside and held a share. LEGIO mid pack, moved up three
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. SUMMER BOSS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside and improved his position. OVER IT well placed and inside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and faded. KIANG set the early pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded the final furlong. AUDACIOUS ANTOINE
well placed and outside, held position four wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. MAGICSTICK broke a step slowly from the gate and was never
involved. KOOSMAN well placed and outside, faded three wide through the turn.
