Footnotes
QUICKLY PARK IT broke a step slow and brushed in the beginning, settled off the pace, closed in through the far turn, challenged four deep into the stretch,
took over and cleared in upper stretch and held the runner-up at bay. GRAZED MY HEART stumbled leaving the gate, tucked inside off the pace, tipped
between rivals on the far turn, steered out at the three-sixteenths pole, rallied from outside, drifted inward late and could not get by. WARREN'S PARADICE
fractious in the gate, bumped leaving the gate, angled to the rail tracking out of range, paused behind rival at the five-sixteenths pole, remained inside after,
lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out and finished willingly for the show. LOYAL TO A FAULT was a bit fractious in the gate, away quickly then ceded
control and chased in the two path early, coaxed around the far turn then had to pause at the quarter pole, found an opening and bid between runners into
the stretch but faltered near the inside. MISS KALINE was off slow to begin, lagged behind early, trailed to the far turn, moved out then swung widest into
the stretch and improved position. MOOREA TIME got bothered from inside and steadied early, unhurried in the beginning, steered to the inside, moved off
the rail for the far turn, raced three deep at the quarter pole then got floated out into the stretch and lacked a rally. SARANDE broke in and bumped with
rivals on both sides at the start, pulled chasing two then three wide early, tugged the rider forward early on the backstretch, bid two then three wide into the
stretch and weakened. CHERRY CHAOS got bumped from outside, became rank while going up to take the lead from inside, showed the way on the inside
to the stretch then folded.

BEAR CHUM (AUS) stalked the lone leader from inside, tipped two wide and took aim into the stretch, drew alongside while being floated out mildly by the
leader and drove past. CAJUN BROTHER sped to the front from inside, showed the way in the two path into the turn, led clear a bit off the rail into the
stretch, drifted out in the lane and lost command midstretch but finished gamely to the wire. STAY HAPPY chased three deep early, took the turn two to
three wide and held the show. CAJUN TREASURE bobbled at the start, chased five deep then four wide around the turn and got edged for the show
honors. STORMINSIDE stalked the pacesetter in the two path, angled to the rail around the bend and failed to rally. PERFECTO AMOR chased four deep

Footnotes
SMILING MOLLY set the pace under pressured, maintained a short lead along the rail through the turn, cleared at the top of the stretch, drifted out in deep
stretch and held safely. GOOD BOO JOO stalked outside a rival, steadied between at the three-eighths pole, angled to the inside, tipped out in the lane,
steered inside the winner in the final sixteenth and finished gamely. AVERY BLUE got crowded between rivals early then chased from off the pace, traveled
outside a rival into the turn, shifted three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, got floated out a bit when rallying between rivals with a sixteenth remaining and
gained the show. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE chased on the inside then eased off the rail and entered the lane three wide, got floated out in deep stretch and
lacked a serious bid. ADAM'S CREED broke slow, settled on the inside, checked behind rival at the five-sixteenths pole, stayed inside to the stretch and
kept on through the final furlong. GRAZEN TOUCH pressed the winner from outside, lost touch with that rival at the top of the stretch, continued to give
chase in range through the lane, got floated out at the sixteenth pole and flattened. SCARY FAST RIDE came away slow, traveled near the back off the rail,
rounded the bend two to three wide and failed to threaten. STRAWBERRYONTOP away well in the beginning, raced up close outside the top pair, chased
four wide into the drive and weakened. IPANEMA GIRL broke slow, stalked on the inside, moved to the two path on the turn, tipped out into the stretch and
failed to menace. SHEZMISBEHAVING was off very slow, trailed on the inside to the stretch and never got involved. QUICKLIKEABUNNY was off a bit
slow, raced off the rail near the back then angled to the inside for the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
LEYAS CANDY led early outside a trio of rivals, dueled outside RAFIKKI into the turn, cleared that rival at the five-sixteenths pole, led two wide into the lane
and drew away. LEMON SUSHI chased inside the top trio then got shuffled back near the half-mile pole, tipped out and rounded the turn two wide, finished
determinedly down the stretch and got up for the place. MAGNIFICENT RIDE tracked out of range early on, navigated the turn four wide and got edged for
the place. AMERICAN CAT raced up close between rivals early, got shuffled back a bit at the seven-sixteenths pole and raced along the rail into the turn,
moved out and went three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. DONNER LAKE bumped both sides at the start, sat off the pace early on then got
bumped by outer rival near the half-mile pole, went two wide around the turn and improved position. CAROL'S COMIC broke out and bumped rival, traveled
in mid-pack well off the rail, moved into three path on the turn then came four wide into the drive and failed to rally. MARS ON FIRE bumped in the
beginning, raced off the pace and bumped with rival near the half-mile pole, entered the lane five wide and lacked the needed response. RAFIKKI pressed
three deep early, dueled inside the winner into the turn, failed to keep up at the five-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the stretch while losing positions and
faded. CLUBHOUSE CAT got pinballed at the start, dropped back early, went between runners then angled to the rail, tipped to the two path and had little
left for the drive. L'ENFANT DIT chased early then began to climb behind rivals and dropped back, eased around the turn, pulled up midstretch and walked
off.

Footnotes
READY JET GO got crowded between rivals and steadied back early, steered to the inside, saved ground through the turn, launched a rail bid in upper
stretch, took over at the eighth pole, cleared midstretch and held off the runner-up. DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) stalked the pace early, got boxed in on the turn,
angled out and brushed rival entering the stretch, closed fast but was too late. FLAME MCGOON chased between foes then got shuffled back at the
seven-sixteenths pole, chased off the rail on the turn, got brushed four wide into the stretch, finished well and gained the show. ROSES AND CANDY lacked
early speed, looked to start a run but lacked room behind a wall of rivals with a quarter mile left to run, angled widest and summoned a mild rally.
TWENTYSEVENTROUTS stalked outside rivals, took aim four wide into the stretch, drifted inward and faltered. VA VA VOOM tracked between foes then
came three wide into the lane, lost her path and altered out from behind a rival with a sixteenth remaining and could not rally. SWEET CALIFORNIA chased
off the rail or outside a rival, drew alongside and headed the leader at the quarter pole, took over and led into the stretch, lost command at the eighth pole
and weakened. R GIRL'S WERTH IT stalked the pace on the inside, waited two wide into the stretch and never found room until it was too late. CAL
showed the way up the backstretch, challenged from outside on the turn, overtaken late on the bend, fought between to the eighth pole and weakened. SHE
LOVES KARAOKE was off a bit slow to begin, raced off the rail near the back, traveled four deep then five wide into the lane and failed to menace.

weakened through the lane. JOE DON LOONEY brushed leaving the gate, chased wide into the first turn from off the pace then moved into the three path,
entered the lane two wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
OPENING BUZZ pressed from inside then went up to duel leaving the backstretch, took over on the turn, disposed of VASCO entering the stretch and drew
away. BIG SUMMER chased from inside off the pace, drifted in a bit but almost made contact with the rail, suffered a slight shuffle with three-furlongs
remaining, tipped out in upper stretch and closed well to prove second best. QUEEN MOLOTOV stalked on the inside, angled out and came three wide into
the stretch and was along for the show. VASCO took control early then set the pace outside OPENING BUZZ, dueled with that rival into the turn, lost
command on the bend but fought back to the stretch, then flattened to fourth. LADY MARYANN chased outside rival out of range, left the turn four to five
wide, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch and could not rally. WRONG TURN CUPID chased on the inside then got shuffled early, steadied briefly at the
three-eighths pole, urged around the bend then had to pause at the quarter pole when anticipating a tight spot but never got put in tight and lacked a rally in
the stretch. CURRENT MOOD broke a bit slow, got crowded between rivals early, angled out and failed to threaten. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA was a bit slow,
tracked between rivals then got shuffled back the three-eighths pole, continued off the rail into the drive and failed to menace. DANCING SOUL stalked off
the rail, driven three wide into the lane, got bumped in upper stretch and lacked further response. THE GREAT HAYNES hopped and was off slow to begin,
angled in and advanced inside on the turn, urged in the lane but rider may have felt something off and wrapped up nearing the sixteenth pole, pulled up
early in the gallop out but walked back to be unsaddled. ORISSA was off a bit slow to begin, dropped back early, saved ground on the inside through the
turn but was never a factor.

Footnotes
EDGEWAY stalked outside the top pair up the backstretch, bid three deep on the turn, dueled outside SLAMMED past the five-sixteenths pole, battled down
the stretch under right-handed urging and inched ahead in the closing moments. SLAMMED stumbled leaving the gate then went up to press the pace from
outside, dueled into the turn, vied between rivals then dueled inside EDGEWAY past the quarter pole, battled gamely along the rail through the lane and
yielded grudgingly in the final strides. COVER VERSION got crowded leaving the gate and dropped back early, took the turn four then five wide and gained
the show. EMPIRE HOUSE broke out, stalked the speed two wide into the turn, moved out and lost ground under urging on the turn, came four wide into the
lane and weakened. DANCE TO THE MUSIC set the pace under pressure from SLAMMED early, dueled with that rival into the turn, relinquished the lead
with three furlong left to run, could not keep up with the top pair past the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
FEATHERS (IRE) got shuffled between runners in the chute, steered to the inside at the back, had to pause behind a rival at the three-eighths pole, lacked
room from the top of the stretch to the eight pole, gained a clear path, then flew late between rivals and got up at the wire. VAROMA traveled along the
inside near the back, took closer order on the backstretch, had to steady at the three-eighths pole, tipped three wide into the lane, rallied and took a brief
lead late but got nailed by the winner. ALOHA KITTEN sped to the front from inside, lost command first time in the stretch and chased into the clubhouse
turn, coaxed along in traffic on the far turn and was in a bit tight at the quarter pole, bid outside at the top of the lane, cleared with a furlong remaining and
yielded to the top pair late. XYLOPHONE was off slow to begin, moved into the two path sitting off the pace, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, went
three deep into the far turn, angled six wide into the lane, summoned a mild response but lacked the needed late kick in the final sixteenth. ABOVE ALL
NAMES pulled a bit on the inside first time in the stretch, waited for room on the far turn, lacked room at the eighth pole, tipped out but could not regain
momentum and coast in late. ZABAVA tracked two wide early, three deep on the backstretch, angled five wide into the drive, lost her path at the sixteenth
pole and could not regain momentum. BESTRELLA (IRE) came away slow, forced to steady behind rival early, traveled two wide near the back then
between rivals, steadied off heels on the far turn, left the far turn four to five wide and could not rally. FLORAL ESSENCE stalked off the inside then went up
to vie between rivals, fought through the far turn, overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. RCAPTIVATING was off slow to begin, traveled three deep at
the back into the clubhouse turn, trailed outside a rival on the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and was not a factor. KUORA (PER) broke a bit slow
from outside, raced up close four deep first time in the stretch, went up vie for the lead outside a pair of rivals, fought back around the far turn, lost touch into
the lane and tired. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) chased leaving the chute then went up to taken command first time through the stretch, vied with a pair of rivals
to the far turn, stayed on to the quarter pole then lost touch late and faded down the lane.
