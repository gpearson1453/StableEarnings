HOTASAPISTOL, off last, angled to the inside soon after the break, tracked the leaders inside foes into the turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane and
found a solid late response to prevail in time under firm encouragement. PRINCESS LIVIA, urged to the lead along the inside racing through the
backstretch, held sway past midstretch but was collared late. EMERALD PRINCESS, urged to a forward placing pursuing the pacesetter into upper stretch,
had no final kick. MISSYINTOMISCHIEF tracked the leaders between foes through the backstretch to the turn but offered no rally. OWEN'S PLEASURE
was settled last outside foes on the backstretch, angled to the inside racing through the turn but had no rally.

POCKETFULLOFPOSIES angled to the rail in early stages stalking the leaders under light reserve to the backstretch, continued with a ground saving trip
through the far turn, tipped off the inside entering upper stretch, split foes bidding for command in late stages and narrowly prevailed under firm handling.
BAILOUT KELA, in touch with the leaders three deep racing to the first turn, was rated dropping off the first flight nearing the backstretch, steadily advanced
in the three path through the far turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage between foes midstretch but was outkicked.
DIGGS WON settled last while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch, moved to challenge for command
leaving midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. STRABELLA settled in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside leaving the six
furlong marker, saved ground gaining position into the lane, was urged to advance between foes near midstretch, then altered course five deep in late
stages. PICAFLOR, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn into upper
stretch and gave out late. SASSY BANKER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the backstretch but faded early. BALIMOS was urged
prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the far turn and gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
KID'S INHERITANCE, held up avoiding tight quarters in the opening furlong, was reserved off the second flight while angling to the inside on the first turn,
steadily gained position along the rail under patient handling racing through the far turn, then responded when presented an opening racing through the
stretch to challenge for command inside foes and go clear under firm encouragement. ROCKTIZWAY was urged along the rail into the first turn disputing
the pace, dispatched a rival on the far turn, dueled for command inside a rival into upper stretch, tipped off the inside resisting a rival's challenge, couldn't
contain the winner but narrowly prevailed for the place honors. SIERRA HOTEL came through close quarters racing to the first turn to track the leaders
three wide in second flight into the backstretch, continued in that path to make a steady advance into upper stretch, gained the advantage midstretch but
was outkicked by the top pair. MY BOY LOLLIPOP, bumped at the start, was settled last while angling to the rail in early stages, tipped off the inside nearing
the lane, was fanned six wide midstretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. ATOMIC CANDY hopped at the start, was righted to track the
leaders between foes in second flight to the far turn and faded into the stretch. OPTIMISTIC VALOR tracked just off the first flight inside rivals to the far turn,
shifted out four wide racing through the stretch but had no rally. KRAMDEN made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide into the first turn but dropped out
early. BOURBON TAN was urged prompting the pace outside a rival from the outset to the far turn and gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT, angled to the inside in early stages tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced along the rail on the turn to bid for command that rival nearing
upper stretch, wrested the advantage entering the lane, then shook clear through late stages while being kept to brisk encouragement. TIGER DAD was
urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off rail racing into the turn, dueled outside the winner into upper stretch but proved no
match in the drive. MINISTER OF SOUL, off slowly, switched outside rivals early while being prompted to a contending position, continued in pursuit of the
top pair three deep into the lane and faded in the drive. CENTRAL PARK stumbled at the start, then was held up off rivals in early stages, swung out four
wide racing into the stretch but offered no rally. DAME PLATA dropped out early.

DEVOTED TO YOU was urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted to the rail once gaining a clear advantage nearing the backstretch,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside into the far turn and gamely fended off several challengers to prevail under strong handling. DELFT
BLUE, off a step slowly, settled into stride racing to the backstretch, split foes three wide racing into the far turn commencing a steady advance, shifted in
splitting foes nearing upper stretch to gain terms with the pacesetter, pressed that foe to late stages but failed to gain even terms. BROTHER HAROLD was
urged to a forward placing along the rail, racing into the first turn, tracked just off that foe to the far turn, bid for command inside foes racing through the lane
but was outkicked by the top pair. FEEDING FRENZY, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and steadily
improved position to the end. WHERE'D THE DAY GO angled inwards racing to the backstretch to track off the second flight between foes, continued under
patient handling into the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance but lacked the needed late kick. MYSTIFIER
switched outside the leaders early to track off the first flight, advanced to striking distance four wide racing through the far turn, was carried out by STAR
MISSION racing into upper stretch and quickly came up empty. STAR MISSION shifted out four wide racing to the first turn while being prompted to a
forward placing, made an early three wide move to prompt the pacesetter to the far turn, drifted out impeding a rival entering upper stretch and soon gave
out. TRADIN UP, caught four, then five wide racing to the backstretch, never gained striking distance. DA GHOST tracked just off the second flight along the
inside to the backstretch and retreated after a half. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN trailed the field to the stretch. MYNAMEIS PRINCE switched out four wide
racing to the backstretch dropping off the second flight and emptied out after a half.

INDY'S STAR tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight racing into the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but continued with
a steady late response to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. STONE ARCH BRIDGE angled inwards in the opening stages settling into
stride off the second flight, was prompted to advance along the rail when presented an opening nearing upper stretch, tipped out splitting rivals to gain the
advantage between calls late but just failed to contain the winner. OLIVIAN was urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset into the turn, edged
clear into upper stretch while shifting to the inside but was collared by the top pair late. FROST WARRIOR tracked just off the leaders along the inside
racing into the turn, shifted out to the three path in upper stretch, was caught in tight quarters momentarily leaving midstretch but lacked the needed final
kick. MAKEMEBELIEVE settled along the rail racing into the turn, shifted outside a tiring foe racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. NIP NAP, urged
along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. VOODOO FIRE proved no factor. NAUGHTYNAUGHTY made
brief pursuit of the leaders three wide racing into the turn, drifted wide leaving the quarter mile maker and abruptly gave out. SAINT SARENA broke slowly
and dropped out early.

Footnotes
YAK, forwardly placed along the inside, switched out nearing the backstretch stalking the pacesetter under light reserve, was prompted to close the gap
racing into the far turn, took over midway through the bend, went clear into upper stretch and held sway on a commanding margin under left handed
pressure. CASHANOVA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, continued with a steady effort into the lane and proved best of the others. BIG
LEAGUE BENNY tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out three wide in the lane and continued well enough to
prevail for a share. TALLESTOFTHETALL, off slowly, settled last to the backstretch, switched out racing into the stretch but never gained contention.
SMART CALL was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace racing to the far turn and gave out entering the lane. HATTIES JEWEL
hopped at the start breaking a bit slowly, tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the backstretch but emptied out early.

Footnotes
FLASH FLOOD was urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset, shook clear along the inside racing into the backstretch, held sway on a
comfortable margin into the stretch while being kept to pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. ICYWILBURNYEH tracked off the second flight
along the inside to the backstretch, switched outside a rival nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. THAT
WOULD BE NICE angled to the inside racing to the backstretch tracking the leaders out of striking distance, tipped out racing into the stretch and continued
between foes to prevail for a share. I CAME TO SHAME, off slowly, settled last to the backstretch, angled three wide racing into the stretch and continued
with an effort to improve position. SURELY A LEGEND, urged inside the eventual winner prompting the pace into the first turn, gave way early. NOTE PAD
tracked the leaders outside rivals behind the second flight racing to the backstretch and dropped out early. GIVE EM SHADE made brief pursuit of the
eventual winner three deep into the first turn and retreated after a half. THE EIGHTH RACE WAS DELAYED DUE TO WEATHER.

Footnotes
NEW DICE, caught five wide in the opening stages racing just off the first flight, steadily worked his way nearer to the inside racing into the bend, shifted to
the rail nearing upper stretch, tipped outside the leader racing through upper stretch and continued with solid momentum to wrest the advantage and go
clear under firm handling. IRISH TUFF was hustled up the rail disputing the pace from the outset into the bend, edged clear racing into upper stretch but
proved no match when confronted by the winner. KOVACS, forwardly placed four wide racing through the backstretch, continued in that path into the bend
and kept on for a share in late stages. MARK OF VALOR broke outwards bumping BIT COINER at the start, was urged between foes disputing the pace
into the turn but emptied out nearing upper stretch. POVERTY FLATS broke slowly, then was shut off at the start, angled to the inside while being prompted
to advance racing into the bend but lacked the needed late response. BIT COINER, bumped at the start, tracked just off the first flight between foes in early
stages, was urged to lodge a brief three wide between foes racing into the turn but gave way abruptly after a half. PER RULING FROM THE MINNESOTA
RACING COMMISSION, NEW DICE IS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
