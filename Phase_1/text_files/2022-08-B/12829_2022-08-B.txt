Footnotes
HUASTECO bumped with rivals on either side entering the first turn before being rated into an inside stalking position around that bend, tipped outside of
the embattled pair entering the far turn, chased a clearing CALRIN CLAN through upper stretch, grinded away through the final furlong to bid inside the final
sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. CARLIN CLAN prompted the pace along the inside early on, allowed an outer FRANK 'N BOOTS to go on before
reengaging from the outside entering the backstretch, vied two wide around the far turn, gained an advantage entering the lane, kicked clear at the furlong
grounds as an outer HUASTECO pursued, but failed to resist that foe's late bid, and was worn down strides from the wire. HOUSED moved forward after
breaking a bit flat-footedly, took a bump from an inner foe into the first turn, tugged to a tracking position while tucking four to two wide around that bend
came into the backstretch between, horses, then tucked to the rail whilst in pursuit into the far turn, shifted back off of it in upper stretch, and stayed on well
while cutting into the top pair's advantage. LORD GRANTHAM broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the four path, pulled to a three wide tracking
position entering the backstretch, but tired entering the lane. CAMBIASO bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, chased
the main group from the three to five path around the far turn, and failed to factor. FRANK 'N BOOTS bumped with an inner rival at the start, then nudged an
outer foe entering the first turn while tucking to the fore, cleared around that bend before meeting CARLIN CLAN's outer bid entering the backstretch, vied
around the far turn, but was headed nearing the lane, and weakened at the furlong grounds. MOJITO broke slowly and showed little. LIBERTY HALL was
outrun along the inside and eased through the lane

Footnotes
THOUGHT set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressers around the turn, met theirs', as well as BEYBLADER's, bid entering the
lane, shook clear in the two path in upper stretch, and held sway through the final furlong. BLOW TORCH pressed the pace-setter from the outside, then
from between horses around the turn, inched closer to bid entering the lane, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, dueled for place inside of BEYBLADER
through the final furlong while sustaining his pursuit, and gamely held that position. BEYBLADER tracked two wide and between horses down the
backstretch, tipped four wide at the five sixteenths pole to range up to the leading trio nearing the lane, chased the clearing pace-setter through upper
stretch, then battled for place outside of BLOW TORCH through the final furlong, but was denied via a narrow photo. STAR ENTERTAINER stalked along
the inside while about a path off of the rail, cut the corner entering the lane as the pace-setter vacated the rail, but lacked the needed rail kick to produce a
bid, and chased evenly. BLUNDER broke a step slowly, stalked four to three wide and outside of foes, inched closer to press around the turn, but was
roused to sustain his bid at the quarter pole as an outer foe ranged up alongside, hung on his left lead while chasing between horses in upper stretch, and
weakened at the furlong grounds. SECRET EDGE stumbled at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THERIDEOFALIFETIME came out a bit and brushed an outer foe soon after the start, stalked behind the trio of dueling leaders while in the two path around
the turn, shifted to the six path to be outside of those rivals while inside of others entering the lane, rallied in midstretch in pursuit of a clear REAL NEWS,
ranged up to that foe at the sixteenth pole, drew clear in the late stages, and fended off his outer rallying counterpart thereafter. MR SIPPI broke a length
slow, laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn, fanned to the eight path entering the lane while being floated wide by inner foes, then rallied
outside of rivals while chasing a gaining THERIDEOFALIFETIME, and reached place at the wire. REAL NEWS dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals
around the turn, drew clear of them while tipping to the three path in upper stretch, maintained a clear margin inside the final furlong, but met
THERIDEOFALIFETIME's bid at the sixteenth pole, yielded soon after, and was nailed on the wire for place. IAN GLASS tracked in the three path while
outside of the eventual winner around the turn, got floated to the seven path entering the lane by that rival, and lacked a kick between horses. TRAPPE
VALLEY lagged behind the field while saving ground around the turn, improved inside of rivals in upper stretch in hopes of vying for show approaching the
final sixteenth, but flattened out without menacing. MAJOR WAGER bumped with an inner foe at the start, dueled for the lead three wide, but failed to keep
pace with his innermost counterpart whilst in the five path in upper stretch, and yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. STAYED IN FOR HALF was
bumped by rivals on either side at the start, dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper
stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL set the pace in the two path from a pressing VIGILANTIA, drew clear of that foe entering the lane, maintained a clear margin
under driving pressure through midstretch, and held sway. FIDDLE dislodged her rider in the post parade without running loose, broke a step slowly, rushed
along the inside to achieve a pocket stalking position into the turn, saved ground, gained place from an outer foe in upper stretch while in pursuit of a clear
BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL, but failed to progress on that rival through the final furlong, and held place. CAUSE CELEBRE laid off of the pace along the
inside, tracked in the two path turning for home, smoothly tipped to the four path in upper stretch, rallied with a mild kick in pursuit of FIDDLE for place in the
final furlong, but leveled off. GET BY brushed with rivals on both sides soon after the start, settled far back, took the turn in the three to four path before
swinging to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. PARK ANGEL laid off of the pace two wide, improved inside of foes in midstretch,
altered course out from behind a tiring foe at the sixteenth pole, and stayed on. VIGILANTIA prompted the eventual winner from the three path around the
turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and weakened through the final furlong. TIME FOR CUPID chased three wide and between horses, but faded
in the four path at the five sixteenths pole. STRAWBERRYLEMONADE tracked four wide, got floated to the five path at the five sixteenths pole, then
weakened in the six path in upper stretch. JUNELLIA tracked two wide and from between horses, tipped outside of the top pair at the five sixteenths pole,
but lacked a kick and faded in the five path in upper stretch. DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE broke slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
SALUTE THE STARS stalked from the three path while tugging keenly around the first turn, ranged up three wide turning for home to gain an advantage in
upper stretch then kicked clear at the furlong grounds, and pulled away while shifting out soon after. SOLOMON VANDY bumped an inner foe at the start,
saved ground while tracking in midpack, produced a bid for place along the rail at the furlong grounds as the leader kicked away, then chased that foe home
to prove second best. ST. NEOTS tracked two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, but only
produced a mild chasing kick, gained show at the sixteenth pole, and fended off an inner foe for that position late. CABALLO FELIZ broke a step slowly, laid
off of the pace in the two path, then three wide and between horses around the far turn, rallied through traffic to bid for show in the final sixteenth, but
missed. PADDOCK BOSS began slowly while breaking outwardly, rated far back in the three to four paths, then shifted out in midstretch and stayed on
willingly. OSCAR ECLIPSE was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, got keen after nudging the fence entering the first turn, settled off of the pace
along the inside, but steadied again when the rider lost balance entering the far turn, saved ground around that bend before tipping to the two path in upper
stretch, and surged between horses with a stout rally in the final furlong. DRAMA CRITIC bumped an outer foe at the start, then steadied when put to tight
quarters along the rail nearing the wire for the first time, settled far back along the inside, took the far turn in the four to five paths, but lacked a bid.
COLLECTORATE stalked along the inside, tipped two wide while inside of the eventual winner into the far turn, but was outkicked nearing the lane,
weakened, and steadied when shying from an outer foe at the sixteenth pole. GHENT cleared around the first turn, showed the way around the far turn, but
caved between horses at the furlong grounds. SUITABLE settled off of the pace in the three path, saved ground around the far turn, but hung on her left
lead in upper stretch and failed to menace. ENGLISH PAINTER broke slowly and was outrun. EASY BIG BOY tracked in the four path, but weakened
around the far turn.

Footnotes
FAMED broke a bit flat-footedly while being subtly floated inward as the last one away, rushed leaving the chute to achieve an inside stalking position at the
eleven sixteenths pole, tracked intently from behind the leaders around the turn, tipped two wide nearing the lane to bid outside of CANCEL THIS entering it,
then drove clear at the furlong grounds, and lugged in while hanging on her left lead. CANCEL THIS set the pace along the inside, but proved no match for
a bidding FAMED at the furlong grounds, and remained well clear of show. FINE FAMILY laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted inwardly in upper
stretch to bid for show at the furlong grounds, and prevailed for that position. TAIGA tracked four wide, then from between horses in upper stretch before
vying for show at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner bidder. I CROSS MY HEART laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer five
wide turning for home, vied for show outside of rivals at the furlong grounds, but flattened out. LAURA'S CHARM stalked three wide, but tired between
horses through the lane. NAPA CANDY broke a bit inwardly at the start, raced at the rear in the two path, and never got involved. SOLAR REIGN stalked
two wide and between horses, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
REAGAN'S DECISION prompted the pace setter from the outside whilst taking the three path, vied entering the lane, drew clear at the furlong grounds, and
held from a pair of chasers late. CHIONE stalked along the inside, then from the pocket around the far turn, tipped outside of the top pair in upper stretch,
chased the clear leader while outside of HONEY RUN, grinded away at the margin in the late stages along with foe, and prevailed for place. HONEY RUN
saved ground at the back of the pack, improved inside of rivals entering the lane, chased the clearing leader from the rail through midstretch, shifted outside
of that foe in hopes of producing a late bid between horses as CHIONE rallied alongside, inched closer late, but was outfinished by his outer chasing
counterpart for place. SOCIAL DILEMMA rated at the rear two wide, moved forward two to three wide and between horses around the far turn, got brushed
by an inner foe entering the lane, yet rallied willingly thereafter. THREE TIPSY CHIX laid off of the pace two wide, got caught four to five wide around the far
turn, and moved up. GIANNA'S GIFT set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the
furlong grounds. CHARLEE O stalked two to three wide, but gave way in upper stretch. ZANDREA'S tracked in midpack along the inside, floated three to
four wide and between horses around the far turn, and failed to factor. MISS BELLATRIX tracked two wide, brushed an outer foe entering the lane, and
weakened.

Footnotes
TUANIS set the pace, led from a pair of vying rivals around the far turn, got headed by ASCENDING MOON leaving the quarter pole, fought back to regain
an advantage in upper stretch, and drew clear through the final furlong. ASCENDING MOON tracked in midpack two wide and between horses early on,
inched closer into the far turn to bid three wide at the five sixteenths pole, forged a narrow margin leaving the quarter pole, but failed to kick on, lost the
advantage to his inner counterpart approaching the furlong grounds, and held place. READY TO ROLL stalked along the inside, tipped three wide in upper
stretch, and chased the top pair home. BIG BLUE laid off of the pace along the inside, inched closer in the four path around the far turn, and stayed on to
reach a minor share. GROOM LAKE prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, but weakened nearing the lane. STOCKPILER
broke slowly, trailed two wide, and moved up in the four to five path around the far turn. HORSE DADDY never threatened. OVER PROTECTIVE tracked in
midpack three wide, but faded early. FROOME (IRE) broke a step slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, but never got involved. MO BETTA laid off of the
pace while in the six path and multiple paths away from inner foes, remained well away from others down the backstretch while being done early, then was
eased through the lane.
