Footnotes
BREAKWATER brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the outside up the
backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the stretch and kicked clear in the final furlong under a drive. CHENTI raced in the two path
around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path around the far turn, could not go with the
winner in late stretch and chased that rival to the wire. QAADER raced in the two and three path early, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack,
angled in to save ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane. ELUSIVE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and was empty from there. MOTANAAFER raced off the pace on
the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. JAHEZ led the field from the rail around the first turn
and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. VALENTIN C trailed the field the entire way around the oval
and, despite saving ground, was never a factor.

HIGHER AUTHORITY stalked in the three path, was cued while making a bid two wide at the top of the lane, and drew clear. IT'S FATE tracked inside,
tipped out three wide into the lane, and ran on for place. ELEVATED FOREVER led from inside, was coaxed from the two path into the lane, but yielded late
for show. FOREVAMO rated from the three path, was ridden four wide into the stretch, but finished evenly. ZONIC trailed from three path into the stretch but
was never a threat. STUNNING BABY chased from the four path, swung five wide into the lane, but was empty.

length of stretch, drifting mildly late and holding her margin to the wire. MAGNOLIA ROAD raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace, began a bid while racing three wide approaching the quarter pole and dueled down the lane, narrowly missing. SUWANNEE

pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second bend from the three path and finished evenly. LOTTACLASS LILSASS was
bumped hard by the horse to her outside, forcing her into the horse on her inside as well, trailed the field while saving ground in the early going, switched
out to the four path for the run around the far turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and passed tiring from there. SATISFIED tracked the leaders on the
outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and faded in the lane. RIGHT TO
ASSEMBLE saved ground around the firs turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far
turn and was empty in the stretch. LLUVIA veered in and bumped hard with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, checked several times the first time by
the stands, settled in on the rail for the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired from
there. A TRAINER OBJECTION WAS FILED BY THE TRAINER OF HORSE SIX, MAGNOLIA ROAD, CITING INTERFERENCE FROM HORSE SEVEN,

FLYING FORTRESS was hard held while leading from the three path into the first turn, opened up slightly into the stretch, and held gamely. COMMUNITY
ADJUSTED tracked in the three path, was cued from two wide into the stretch, and kept on for place. LONGPANTS REQUIRED trailed from inside, was
ridden from the three path into the lane, and improved for show. GO BIG BLUE NATION hopped at the start, was wellback in the three path, was driven four
wide into the stretch, but finished evenly. STAR RULES stalked from inside, was coaxed while saving ground into the lane but faded. UNADULTERATED
prompted the pace in the three path but backed out rounding the far turn.

NEXT EPISODE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, dueled down the lane and just held the victory.
LA TACHE tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole,
angled out in upper stretch and dueled to the wire to just miss. SAENGER STAR stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three
path around the turn and kept on in the stretch. MY BATON ROUGE chased the leader between horses in the early going, raced in the two path around the
turn and was outkicked in the lane. REPLICATED bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the stretch. PUSH veered in and bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate,
recovered to lead the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. SHE'SSODONETALKING
raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and was empty from there. LADY KITTY bumped with the
horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path and made
no bid. THEOLA FUGGINS bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, raced in
the three path around the turn and never threatened. LIL ALMA trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, fell near the eighth pole
and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CIVICS CLASS led from the two path, opened up into the stretch, and was geared down late. BRUCE BANNER bumped with an inner foe, chased from the
five path, ranged up four wide around the turn, and ran on for place. WONDER WATER chased from inside, was driven from the two path into the lane, and
kept on for show. PRACTICAL SENSE stalked in the three path, was driven in the four path going into the lane, but flattened. TARAASHOQ bumped an
outer foe, raced in midpack from the four path, raced between rivals around the turn, but was empty. DIAMANTE DE ORO lost the right iron shortly after the
start, bolted to the right, and was no menace. CALIPARI was taken out shortly after the start by the bolting horse and was never a factor.

JUSTIN'S QUEST led the way while saving ground throughout, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off to the wire. SUPER E saved ground around the
first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, switched outside in upper stretch
and gained ground late. HONOR MY WORLD raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, could not go with that rival in lane and kept on from there. BARAHIN chased the leader on the outside through the opening half mile,
navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, was outkicked by the eventual winner and finished evenly. VINTNER
raced into traffic coming around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the
two path and made a mild improvement of position in late stretch. MCQUEEN'S BULLITT bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the
two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, raced in the two and three path around the far turn and was empty in the lane.
BLUE BONZAI bumped lightly with the horse to his outside at the break, raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid. MEAN MACHINE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, trailed the field
the entire way around the oval, saved ground and was never a factor.

TOLAGA BAY rated inside, waited for room while moving up from the three path into the lane, and rallied to get up late. DREAMIN OF SEVILLE tracked in
the three path, was coaxed from inside at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. PRIORITIZATION trailed from the two path early, swung out to the six
path into the stretch, and kept on for show. SOROLLA raced in midpack while three wide, was ridden from the five path into the lane, but finished evenly.
SPRITZER set the pace in the two path but yielded going into the stretch. AKINGISALWAYSKING prompted the pace two wide, was roused from the three
path into lane, but faded. VOTETHEMALLOUT stalked from the two path but was done early.

Footnotes
HEARTBURN led the field from the two path the entire way around the oval and remained in command through the stretch run. MORENA DANCER broke
slowly, saved ground ground off the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching
the quarter pole and gained ground in the lane while proving to be no match for the winner. COUNTESSOFLOVELACE saved ground around the first turn,
stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and kept on in the stretch. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS saved
ground around the first turn, chased the front runner on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and weakened
while racing in tight quarters in the final furlong. CODAS HONOR raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the
outside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. FIRST LADY DI DA tracked the leader on the outside
through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there. BASHFUL MARIE
trailed the field throughout saved ground and was never a factor.
