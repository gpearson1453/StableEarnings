ARIZONA ANDREW sprinted clear to set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew off for a long lead and held safely. CHARLIE'S MAN broke
slowly and was crowded at the start, saved ground while racing in the back, finished well inside and got up for place while no threat to the winner. JOHN'S
KID bid between horses entering the turn, lacked a late response and just held for show. DAHLIA'S DANCER bore out along the backstretch, swung wide
entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. HERSABIGGIRL was crowded after the start and failed to menace in an even effort. PANZER PRIDE was
never far off the pace, went four wide entering the turn and lacked a stretch response. LA HERMOSA was hustled along while racing inside, fell back on the
turn, bid and came up empty. LOTSA LOU raced close to the pace, rallied on the turn to loom a threat and stopped. JUST EZ hesitated at the start to be off
slowly, bore out entering the turn and was not a threat. Hand timed.
