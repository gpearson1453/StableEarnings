Footnotes
QUARANTENA BAMBINO broke sharply, was urged clear along the inside racing into the turn, held sway on a clear margin into the stretch and was kept to
firm hand urging while his rider flashed a right handed whip. TRIPP WILDCAT was urged pursuing the pacesetter three wide into the turn, moved to close
the gap on that foe on the turn but proved no match in the drive. CAUSEWAY SURPISE, a bit outpaced early, saved ground to upper stretch and gained
some position along the inside late. WILD TIME tracked the leaders along the rail racing to the turn, tipped out entering the lane but had no closing bid.
PRESTIGIOUSLY WILD tracked the pacesetter between foes racing into the bend, shifted three wide in upper stretch and steadily faded.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S MAGIC broke readily, sprinted clear of the field along the rail to the backstretch, holding sway on a commanding margin, set the pace into upper
stretch, was headed nearing the furlong marker but produced a solid late response to turn back the challenge of BACK TO SELLING in the closing stages to
prevail under strong handling. The latter tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance along the inside to the backstretch, switched out nearing
upper stretch steadily advancing on the leader, moved to wrest a brief advantage midstretch but flattened out late. HARMON KILLER BREW switched
outside foes racing to the first turn racing behind the second flight, continued three wide on the far turn into the lane and finished well enough to prevail for a
share. TAHKODHA KNIGHT broke out bumping KAL EL, was righted to track off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, continued in pursuit
of the inside into the lane and faded in the drive. KAL EL, bumped at the start while shifting into the path of SCREAMIN JALAPENO, was reserved while
angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane but offered no closing bid. SCREAMIN JALAPENO, bumped at the start, dropped
out early.

ROMEO'S GLORY vied for command three wide between foes in the opening stages, dueled between foes into the bend, edged forward racing into upper
stretch and maintained the advantage under firm encouragement. IZZY IN A TIZZY settled along the rail early, saved ground advancing on the turn
advancing to contention, briefly awaited an opening nearing the lane, tipped out entering the stretch and continued with a steady effort to narrowly prevail for
the place honors. UNTOLD STORY tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the bend, shifted out three wide entering the lane and was outkicked
for second. MORANT, off a step behind the leaders, was urged along the rail disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, couldn't match the
winner in upper stretch and gave way in late stages. BIG PETE, in touch with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, eased off the leaders while
shifting out four nearing the turn and steadily faded into the lane. STORM'S REFLECTION was urged to force the pace four wide, then three wide into the
turn and emptied out early .

MARTINI BLU, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, forged clear into upper stretch and widened the margin under hand urging. GIVE
EM HECK BECK stalked the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out to bid between foes racing into the turn, couldn't gain terms with
the winner but proved best of the others. SOUTHERN PECAN tracked off the second flight along the inside on the backstretch, saved ground to upper
stretch and edged rivals for a share in late stages while never a serious threat. TWILITE LIASON, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the
three path on the backstretch, steadily faded between foes into the turn. LAPIS LAZULI broke slowly, switched outside foes to make brief pursuit of the
leaders four wide into the turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
HARD ATTACK was settled well off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum on the far turn, swung four
wide racing into upper stretch advancing to challenge, lugged in under pressure crossing the path of KID FROSTIE racing past the sixteenth marker but
continued with a steady effort to wrest the advantage nearing the wire. CALIBRATE tracked off the first flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch,
tipped out entering the far turn gaining position between foes, moved to challenge for command entering the stretch striking the front nearing the furlong
marker but proved no match when confronted by the winner. KID FROSTIE was rated along the inside just off the second flight in the opening half, tipped
out splitting rivals nearing upper stretch, shifted to the three path entering the lane to challenge for command between foes but was steadied late when
losing his path to the eventual winner. BIGFOOT CITY attended a rival's pace under firm rating to the backstretch, edged clear racing into the far turn, held
sway into upper stretch but yielded in the drive. DEVIL VISION settled along the inside early, saved ground throughout and ade an effort to gain some
position inside foes into the lane. IOYA AGAIN was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. PINTXOS
was urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. NORTHCUT tracked the leaders outside a
rival as part of the second flight, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DASTARDLY DEEDS was hustled inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled along the rail through the bend, shifted off the inside
racing through the stretch but edged forward under steady pressure. HURTS SO BAD, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into
the turn, dueled for command past midstretch but proved only second best. NOTACRY tracked off the first flight along the inside in early stages, saved
ground into the lane and continued with a mild bid inside foes nearing the wire while just missing for second. PRIZE FIGHTER tracked the leaders outside
rivals in second flight racing three wide into the bend and continued with interest to gain position between foes in that path nearing the wire while racing in
close quarters late. TIZ'A STELLAR DUDE was urged three deep pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and
faded leaving the furlong marker. BOSTON WALLY tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and moved to close the gap while racing in
close quarters through the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY A. TRAIN broke readily, conceded the lead to attend a rival's pace in the opening quarter, pressed the issue on the turn into upper stretch to
wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and edged clear under firm encouragement. BOOZIN AT BOZOS angled to the inside in early stages
tracking off the first flight, shifted out three wide racing into the turn and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire.
QUE PASA MUFASA, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch and faded leaving the
furlong marker to lose second at the wire. ME SAY SO came under pressure early pursuing the leaders in the three path racing into the turn but had no
closing bid. REESE C flashed brief pace three wide pursuing the leaders in the opening quarter but dropped out early. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE, restless in
the gate prior to the start, stumbled at the break losing her hind footing, dislodged her rider from his irons and quickly lost contact with the field.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
