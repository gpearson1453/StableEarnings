Footnotes
MAY MAYS CASTLE saved ground just off the early pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, drew
clear into the lane and held on with steady handling. NINETY PROOF settled back in the two and three paths the first turn then eased out entering the
backstretch, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and was gaining through later yards. NEW AGE BAD GIRL
stalked three wide, took the lead into the backstretch and came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far
turn then flattened the final furlong. JUJU ON DA BEAT saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail
but showed little more. KEY TO THE CASTLE raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. DIVA ROSE came away
a bit awkwardly then stalked two deep, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole but faded through the backstretch. CHURCH KEY took the
lead at the rail into the first turn, but was caught leaving the turn and faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
KARPATHIAN DREAM tapered in and stalked from the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide toward the quarter
and dueled from that point to draw clear later yards. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS took a quick lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure leaving the half mile pole, dueled from there to put Power Sonde away midway on the far turn but gave way to the winner in the duel through the
stretch. HOOK THE CHAIN rounded the first turn in the four path, eased out leaving the turn and bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail and came along for third the final yards. POWER SONDE stalked two deep and challenged leaving the half mile pole, dueled at even terms from the
three eighths but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened inside the eighth pole. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET saved ground off the pace, bid leaving
the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, but showed little more. CHOPRA rated close to the early pace inside, though faded
through the backstretch. VIEDMA settled back in the two and three paths and never factored.

approaching the quarter pole, but was met mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. WEST VIRGINIA PAM rated close inside, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. HANDSOME JOANIE rated the early pace inside, was met into the

the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and left the turn widest. LOVE

MISSIONSNINETYNINE rated close two deep and took the nod into the backstretch, dueled from the half mile pole and inched clear toward the head of the
lane, was steadily handled to mid-stretch then taken in hand later yards. FREEDOM RIDER settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the half mile pole,
came through the far turn about the three path and finished well. PISTOL P rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point,
but dropped back at the rail toward the top of the lane and flattened the final eighth. DIVINING DANCER saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. GOT FLOFFY rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn. POLITICAL DECISION rounded the opening turn in the three path and showed little

Footnotes
LACE REVOLUTION settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, closed to a slim lead in the
three path leaving the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on under steady handling. VILLAREGGIA steadied off the heels of Lace Revolution and
came out a path or two into the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, angled to the four path into the lane,
dug in for second later yards and was gaining on the winner. MIDNIGHT REGRET rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths
pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, was caught leaving the turn and flattened the final sixteenth. WICKED WISDOM was roughed and angled out from the
heels of Villareggia into the first turn then moved back to the inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail
but showed little in the lane. MUSICAL CAT angled around errant rivals into the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of
the far turn and showed little in the lane. CHESAPEAKE STORM stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on
the far turn. GOSSIPING ducked out at the break then saved ground. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Lace Revolution for alleged
interference into the first turn, lodged by the rider of Villareggia, but determined there was no foul.

pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught flattening stride the
final yards. FEEL THE LOVE settled back off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail,
eased outward through the lane and finished well while gaining on the top two. FORTUNATA ITALIA saved ground off the pace on the first turn, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little more. MY JUBA rated close to the early pace, picked up
the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then weakened. SUPERSTASIA rounded the first turn about the four path and
proved no factor. SOMEDAY IS TODAY stalked the early pace about the three path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but gave way into the far turn.

Footnotes
NEVER COMPROMISE tapered in to stalk from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn,
took the nod past the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. LOST IN MANHATTAN was bumped outward and into Bassett then settled in
the three path the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path, finished well to take second later yards and was
gaining on the winner. AUTS REVOLUTION rated close toward the inside, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path, drifted leaving the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second but came along for third the final yards. BETTER BOOGIE
broke in and exchanged contact with Bassett leaving the gate then angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the quarter pole,
ran at the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod past the eighth pole then weakened the final sixteenth. LIQUID LOUIE stumbled leaving the gate then saved
ground well off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. BASSETT was
bumped outward and into Better Boogie and stumbled as a result, then dropped well back, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn
and showed little more. BRUTUS mostly saved ground. DYNAMIC DAY broke outward and into Lost In Manhattan then saved early ground, gave chase
past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME rounded the opening turn about the four path, left the turn
outside and showed little response.
