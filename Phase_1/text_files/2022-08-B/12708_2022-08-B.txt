Footnotes
TATANKA set a loose lead, was cued from inside at the top of the lane, drifted out and bumped with BROCK ON BY passing the eighth pole, and held
gamely. BROCK ON BY stalked in the two path, made a bid two wide at the top of the lane, was bumped by TATANKA passing the eighth pole, but hung
late. CAIRO WARRIOR rated from the two path, saved ground around the turns, was cued from inside in upper stretch, and ran on. U S NAVY CROSS was
unhurried from the three path, swung into the five path coming into the stretch, and improved late. RANTHEREDLIGHT hopped at the start, raced in
midpack while saving ground, tipped into the four path at the top of the lane, but flattened. COLOSI tracked from the three path, was ridden three wide into
the stretch, but faded. SUNRISE KITTEN chased in the four path but was empty at the top of the lane. THERE WAS AN OBJECTION AS THE RIDER OF
BROCK ON BY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER TATANKA FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE EIGHTH POLE BUT THERE WAS NO
CHANGE.

stretch, but hung. C C THE BARTENDER set the pace in the two path, lost the lead around the turn, but kept on for show. BIG TINY rated in the four path,
swung four wide into the lane, but finished evenly. COCO LOCO MAMA chased inside, was coaxed from the four path into the stretch, but flattened. THE

the pace three wide, bid three wide into the lane, and kept on for place. OCTAGON pressed two wide, was driven from the two path into the lane, but
finished evenly to show. FOOL'S MIRAGE trailed from the four path, was ridden inside into the stretch, and improved. PRAIRIE DOLLAR stalked from the
two path, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, but flattened. EARS TO ME tracked in the three path, was cued in the two path into the stretch, but
weakened. VLOCK chased in the five path but never threatened. DARN LIQUOR rated in the three path but was never a factor. BIG DADDY HACK bobbled
