Footnotes
RECKLESS RANSOM was off slowly, raced off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced five to six wide in the drive and edged clear late
under steady pressure. I'LL RAISE YOU chased the early leader, moved up three wide through the far turn, challenged near the eighth pole but couldn't
match strides to finish second best. CAJUN BERTI showed good early speed to cross over, set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
PERFECT PERIGEE was coaxed along early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, took aim at the top trio and flattened out in the drive. DONNA'S
COURT was allowed to settle early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch run and had not enough. TRUMP MEDIA
dropped back early on, raced four wide around the far turn and never was a factor.
