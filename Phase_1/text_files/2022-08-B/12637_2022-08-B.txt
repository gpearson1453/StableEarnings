Footnotes
TOM HAGEN led in the two path, opened up into the stretch, and was geared down late. SPERLE stalked from the two path, was ridden from the two path
into the lane, but finished evenly to place. SIR TERRE raced in midpack inside, was hustled three wide around the far turn, tipped out to the four path into
the lane, but flattened late to show. MINT GAME rated inside, was roused from the two path into the stretch, but weakened. ULTIMATE IRONY tracked in
the three path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but was empty. MY WAY OR NO WAY prompted the pace in the three path but backed out
rounding the far turn. GENERATOR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LADY AZTECA saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn, launched a bid from the rail in upper stretch and pulled clear to the wire while drifting out mildly late. MORGAN'S BLUFF raced in the
two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch, and gained ground
in late stretch. NUWANDA saved ground around the first turn, raced off pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three
and four path, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground late. BALI BALIFLY saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the
backstretch, began to improve position while running in the two path around the far turn, led the field in midstretch and weakened in the final furlong while
drifting out. ZITA OF BOURBON stumbled mildly while racing in the three path around the turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch and around the far turn and finished evenly. BANK BUSTER saved ground in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile, moved up to
challenge from the three path coming around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. HAINT BLUE hopped up slightly leaving the gate, trailed the field
while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch while
never threatening. MISS GRAND SLAM saved ground around the first turn, raced inside up the backstretch, moved up slightly while coming around the far
turn and faded from there. AIR ONE led the field from the three path around the first turn, opened up coming up the backstretch, angled in to save ground
around the second bend, folded entering the stretch and tired to the wire.

SPEAK YOUR MIND led from the two path, opened up into the stretch, and held gamely. JACK'S LILLY prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed
from inside into the lane, and ran on for place. GENIUS tracked in the four path, was roused from three wide at the top of the lane, and kept on for show.
BLOKE chased from inside, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, but finished evenly. SAMURAI ISLAND trailed into the stretch and was never a
threat. SCOOBER pressed from the four path but faded at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
GALAXY MUSIC pressed two wide, led from the four path into the lane, opened up slightly in midstretch, and held gamely. SATURN BOY rated in the three
path, was coaxed from three wide at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. ALL ABOUT LUCKY tracked from three wide, was ridden from the two path
into the stretch, and kept on between rivals for show. CITY HUMOR set the pace from inside early, was cued from the two path into the stretch, but yielded.
MILLERS RITE raced in midpack while two wide, steadied slightly around the turn, but flattened. DUKE OF DOOLY trailed from the five path into the stretch
and never theatened. LE GRIFFON was wellback in the four path and never a factor. JIMBO'S DREAM chased from inside but was empty going into the
stretch. PORCH SWING reared at the start, was pulled up, and walked off. PORCH SWING WALKED OFF. THERE WAS AN INQUIRY LOOKING INTO
THE START OF PORCH SWING AND ULTIMATELY THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

PICKFORD rated from the two path, was hustled from three wide rounding the far turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and rallied.
THOMOND PARK chased from two wide, was roused while three wide into the lane, and ran on for place. GOLDEN DECISION pressed inside, made a bid
from two wide at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. CLEAR N CONVINCING trailed from inside, was coaxed while tipping out to the six path in
upper stretch, and gained late. MISSIN THE BIG DOG set the pace from the two path, was cued from inside at the top of the lane, but yielded. STUNNING
BABY was wellback in the three path and never threatened. TY RAN A HOMER stalked from the four path but dropped out around the far turn. IT'S FATE
tracked inside but was empty at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
GAGETOWN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three and four path, swung wide entering the
stretch, gained ground on the outside to pull clear and held that margin while drifting mildly in the final furlong. LIKE A SALTSHAKER broke sharply, took
back to stalk the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and chased the winner to the wire. LONGSHADOW raced
off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gained ground steadily late. BEVERLY PARK trailed the field through the
opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. TROPHY CHASER chased the leader on
the outside in the early going, dueled from the three path around the turn and weakened late. UPHOLD THE LAW dueled on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch and folded in the final sixteenth of a mile. MUCH BETTER dueled for the lead
between horses in the opening stages, battled from the two path around the turn and faded in the lane. SWING SHIFT pressed the pace between horses up
the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and was empty from there.

ALEXIS S tracked from the three path, was ridden three wide into the stretch, and drew clear. ROCK WITH YOU bumped with PER DIEM just after the start,
prompted the early pace, bid from the three path into the lane, and ran on for place. CATCHTHISWINNER set the pace from inside, yielded late but held on
for show. LUNAR DASH chased two wide, was coaxed from the four path at the top of the lane, but was one paced. BUDDY BUDDY stalked inside, was
hustled saving ground rounding the turn, but finished evenly. DOM GERVASIO was wellback in the two path, swung into the five path into the stretch, and
improved. I'M JUNETEENTH raced in midpack between foes, was driven from the three path into the lane, but weakened. CELTIC SEA rated inside but was
no factor. PER DIEM bumped with an outer foe at the start, was unhurried from the five path and no threat. TO LIVE IS TO LOVE trailed throughout.
