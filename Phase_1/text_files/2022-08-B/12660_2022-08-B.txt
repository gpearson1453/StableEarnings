urging to win going away. LITTLE RONS ROCKET was bumped at the start, stalked the early pace, loomed boldly between horses two wide nearing the
quarter pole then was no match for the winner. OKLAHOMA JOE bore in at the start bumping his stablemate, lead along the rail on the clubhouse turn, kept
pressure into the far turn then faded in the stretch. INDY CARR slow early, passed tiring rivals in the five path. FAST CLIP broke sharply, set the pace two
wide then along the inside for nearly six furlongs then was used up. HARSH TRUTH stumbled inward bumping INDY CARR at the start and was always
outrun. RIVERANDFAIRMOUNT was no factor. WHO CAN'T WAIT was through early.

GALTERO away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside, drifted to the middle of the racetrack in the stretch and just lasted. ADANO close up along
the rail, drifted to the four path entering the stretch, rallied determinedly and just missed. IMTHEPRINCE was antsy in the gate, trailed far back for six
furlongs then closed determinedly late along the rail. MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE pressed the pace three wide, was carried out to mid track at the top of the
