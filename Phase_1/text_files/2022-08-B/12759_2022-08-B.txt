Footnotes
ARCHIEMYBOY set the pace in hand from inside, was challenged on the bend, roused with two furlongs to go, drew clear and was kept to urging until the
final seventy yards. ONE WAY HOME prominent from outside, went for the lead on the turn, drifted out some at the top of the lane, was straightened, no
match for ARCHIEMYBOY and lasted for second under steady handling. BEL BIMBO was urged along to stay close in the early going, did not keep up
along the rail on the burn, took over third upper stretch and was closing on ONE WAY HOME late. FIXICO hesitated then tried to buck a couple times at the
start, was soon far back, picked up his pace after two furlongs, was two wide on the bend, closing in for third midstretch but could not sustain his bid in the
waning yards. LINE OF DENHAMS pressed from between rivals on the backstretch, began to yield on the turn, fanned outside entering the lane and
steadily gave way.

Footnotes
LASTFORTINOFAMILY hustled early, stalked the early leader three wide, was roused leaving the second turn, battled upper stretch then shook free inside
the last furlong. SHOBIZ STAR set a pressured pace just off the inside, was overtaken from outside upper stretch, began to wear down inside the last
furlong but lasted for the place. AMERICAN SUCCESS well placed from inside, did not keep up after a half mile, came again along the rail upper stretch,
edged ahead for third midstrech then could only hold his position late. ANTRIM'S GIANT raced in contention four wide from the early going, fought for third
in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. LEMON BLITZ prominent behind the early speed, faded two wide on the second turn. DANG IT CASSIE
advanced to contention from outside on the backstretch but gave way three wide on the second bend. DUE TO RIDING CROP VIOLATIONS BY THEIR
JOCKEYS, LASTFORTINOFAMILY AND SHOBIZ STAR WERE DISQUALIFIED, LEFT UNPLACED AND THEIR EARNINGS RETURNED AND
REDISTRIBUTED.

NOT AGAIN JACKIE reluctant to load, was jostled briefly leaving the chute, rated from outside, went for the lead three wide on the bend, took over entering

into the lane, was caught in tight quarters upper stretch, jostled briefly with W W RUSSIAN GOLD, got through between horses with a furlong to go, gained
second at the sixteenth marker and drew away for the place. W W RUSSIAN GOLD forced in some leaving the chute, bumped with
RICHIESONARAMPAGE, raced in contention four wide, did not keep up into the stretch, was jostled while in tight quarters upper stretch, altered out some
and pulled away for third in the waning yards. RAHFEE TOWN broke alertly, disputed the pace from outside, was between rivals on the bend, no match for
NOT AGAIN JACKIE when set down for the drive and flattened out the last furlong. WILD WES broke inward, bumping STOSH, vied for the lead between
horses on the backstretch, gained the rail into the turn then flattened out for the stretch run. MADE TO FIT inattentive in the gate, was away slowly, rushed
up from inside to contest the pace, did not keep up into the bend, angled out, came widest into the lane and gave way. RICHIESONARAMPAGE caught in
tight quarters leaving the chute, jostled with NOT AGAIN JACKIE briefly and bumped with W W RUSSIAN GOLD leaving the chute, soon retreated, stayed
wide the rest of the way and showed little.

KIANA'S LOVE broke a step slow and inward, quickly recovered and soon gained the lead, showed the way from path on the backstretch and through the
turn, was put to urging entering the stretch, lengthened command and maintained full control while kept to task. APOLLO U ANYWHERE broke on top, was
soon chasing KIANA'S LOVE from just outside, lost ground staying outside the latter on the bend, was no match for KIANA'S LOVE in the stretch but
steadily pulled away for the place. SUPERSTAR DIVA prominent running widest, moved clear for third while still widest on the turn then could only hold her
position late. ARCHIE'S GIRL forwardly placed just off the inside, faded two wide on the turn and drifted out under left-handed pressure upper stretch.
DEAUVILLE MIST forced in at the break, raced in the second flight along the rail on the backstretch but gave way on the bend.

Footnotes
AFTER MY BROTHER pressed the early pace, went for the lead outside CYCLONE ATTACK on the turn, was forced out by KEEP ATTACKING entering
the stretch, came again to the latter in the late going, bumped with KEEP ATTACKING with seventy yards left and edged ahead nearing the wire. KEEP
ATTACKING advanced between horses to vie for the lead inside CYCLONE ATTACK before finishing a quarter mile, edged ahead on the turn, drifted out
into the lane, was straightened, fought gamely to hold on, floated out a bit deep stretch, bumped with AFTER MY BROTHER, did not have enough left but
was easily second best. BRIANS WAY pressed the pace from inside, angled out on the bend, took over third, altered outside AFTER MY BROTHER at the
top of the stretch and pulled away for the show the last furlong. TRUIST crowded by MAGNA LEE at the break, was steadied, settled at the back, picked up
his pace along the inside on the turn and improved position without threatening in the stretch. DEORA STORE in contention early, advanced four wide on
the bend, fanned out further into the lane and flattened. CYCLONE ATTACK broke alertly, was challenged from inside before finishing two furlongs, gave
way from between rivals midway on the turn and was being eased late. MAGNA LEE stumbled badly at the start and lost his rider. There was a stewards'
inquiry into MAGNA LEE'S start and the bumping between KEEP ATTACKING and AFTER MY BROTHER deep stretch. After their review, no action was
taken for either incident.

Footnotes
TALIS PARK GRAD rated on the front end from outside, was three wide on the bend, asked leaving the quarter pole, took the lead upper stretch then drew
off under mostly hand urging the final furlong. SHANGHAI POINT broke on top, set a pressured pace toward the outside, was just off the inside on the turn,
floated out some for the drive, was no match for TALIS PARK GRAD the last eighth but proved easily second best. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN forwardly placed
from inside, came off the rail on the bend, lacked a serious stretch bid but gained third nearing the sixteenth marker. D'ARCHER was hustled early to
prompt the pace from inside, did not keep up on the turn and began to wear down inside the final furlong. KARAYEL raced in contention between rivals but
faded three wide on the bend.

Footnotes
GO MADI GO boxed in behind the pace in the early going, altered out into the turn, progressed four wide under urging, fanned out further entering the
stretch, made a strong move inside the last furlong and swept past BOBBIE TOO TOO nearing the wire. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke alertly and was quickly
clear, was challenged from outside on the turn, floated out some into the lane, lost her advantage, regained the lead nearing the final sixteenth but was
outfinished in the waning yards. MISS WINDY SLEW prominent between rivals, went for the lead on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch but could not
sustain her bid the final sixteenth. MORNING LINE NEWS raced in the second flight between horses, retreated two wide on the bend and ran evenly the last
quarter mile. DIAMOND GUCCI hesitated at the start, recovered to be a factor from outside on the backstretch, failed to keep up after two furlongs, moved
to the inside into the turn, angled back out with three furlongs to go and improved position three wide in the stretch without threatening. WILDCAT BOBBIE
hesitated then bore in at the break, was straightened, rushed up from inside to help prompt the pace but began to fade with three furlongs to go.
GHAALEB'S CITY forwardly placed from outside on the backstretch, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned outside MISS WINDY SLEW for the stretch
run and gave way.
