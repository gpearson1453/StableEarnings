off the rail through the turn, angled to the outside into the stretch and finished well with only hand urging. COWGIRL SHINE chased inside, raced near the
rail on the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. LOOKING FOR FLARE chased inside, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened later yards. SUPER

Footnotes
MAKE WAY broke in and made contact with Righteous Man then stalked off the rail, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and raced close two deep on
the far turn, dug in under determined stretch handling and took the nod through later yards. REY O REYES rated the pace inside, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely through the stretch but reluctantly ceded later yards.
RIGHTEOUS MAN was bumped at the break then saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced a close factor through the far
turn, angled out from the heels of the top two finishers leaving the eighth pole and finished evenly. FRONT PORCH rounded the first turn in the three path
and rated close, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened in the lane. STEP OUT DANCING
saved ground early on then eased out into the backstretch, bid mildly from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path. VITO ANDOLINI
came through the opening turn in the four and five paths then stalked into the backstretch, though, faded toward the three eighths pole.

turn in the four and five paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path, dueled for third mid-stretch
then flattened stride. COMEONTURNMELOOSE rounded the first turn in the three path then eased outward into the backstretch and bid toward the three

pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. QUIET JUSTICE entered the opening turn in the five path, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. KID GENIUS stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole,

WISH FOR PEACE rounded the first turn in the four path and stalked from the seven eighths pole, bid leaving the three eighths, came through the far turn
off the rail and dug in to take over later yards. MR HOOVER stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, challenged nearing the three eighths pole,
took the lead two deep toward the five sixteenths, raced clear at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught later yards.
FRANKEE MERCH rated off the pace inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth.
TIZBIT rounded the opening two turns in the four and five paths, took the lead three wide at the nine sixteenths pole but was caught past the three eighths
and weakened near the rail on the far turn. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF was not a factor. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE alternated for the early lead inside, was
caught at the nine sixteenths pole then weakened approaching the far turn.

CAPE LOOKOUT stalked from the three path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced three wide on the far turn, took the lead past the eighth pole,
cleared mid-stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. NOVA BOY settled off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced four
wide on the far turn and finished evenly to take second mid-stretch. KING NEKIA saved ground well off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, eased outward at the eighth pole and closed for third late stretch. AUBURN MILL took a quick lead and angled
to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught leaving
the eighth pole and flattened stride. PROTA stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on
the far turn before weakening. FIRE DOWN BELOW rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, came through
the far turn in the five and six paths and showed little in the lane. MY SACRED PLACE and RISING PERRY were not factors. JAMMIN JIMTOWN bore out
and was eased nearing the three eighths pole then walked off while appearing sore.

Footnotes
WALK THE BANK raced well off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn, drew to
even terms mid-stretch and edged ahead through later yards. SCAREDY CAT stalked off the rail, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the
lead past the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail, was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. GABBYS BIG NOTION settled off the rail the first
turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, eased outward leaving the far turn and cleared third inside the sixteenth pole.
THEHEATOFTHENIGHT rounded the first turn four wide and stalked into the backstretch, took the nod nearing the three eighths pole, was caught past the
five sixteenths but remained close two deep on the far turn before weakening. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR saved ground well off the pace, gave chase from
the three eighths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn but showed little in the lane. GOLDEN APPEAL became a bit anxious in the gate then rated
close to the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. MIDNIGHT SHIFT took a quick lead and rated
the early pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead toward the three eighths, was eased past the five
sixteenths, unsaddled after the wire and walked off.

C R'S UNCLE LINO settled off the rail the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still just off the rail and dug in determinedly
to nose out EPIC TIME under the wire. The latter stalked off the rail early but was brushed outward into the first turn, took the nod at the seven sixteenths
pole, raced clear at the three eighths, came under pressure toward the far turn and raced at the rail through the turn, dug in under steady stretch handling
but was nosed out under the wire. WELL EQUIPPED saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the
four path, angled in at the head of the lane and finished well for third. NOID bobbled at the break and rounded the first turn in the three and four paths,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and ran evenly in the lane. MASTER THIS raced well back from
early contention inside and could only improve his position. CHANGE YOUR LUCK stalked the early pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole then
faded at the rail on the far turn. PRIMETIME JET set the early pace inside then drifted out and brushed Epic Time into the first turn, was caught at the seven
sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
ROCKET'S CASTLE angled to the inside and raced with the pace, took the edge at the five sixteenths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the
far turn and dug in under determined handling to eke out the nod over the game effort of FELICIAS CASTLE, who raced with the pace and took a slim lead
two deep leaving the nine sixteenths pole, was met at the five sixteenths, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dug in gamely to
the finish. SUGAR LIPS raced close to the early pace inside, steadied at the rail leaving the five eighths pole, gave chase from the seven sixteenths,
rounded the far turn about the three path, angled to the five path leaving the turn, closed to take third later yards and was gaining on the top two. MIO
GRACELAND came in on Modern Day Romance and had his heels clipped by Rocking To Home entering the first turn then stalked three wide into the
backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. SARGENT
KOBE raced in tight quarters into the first turn then moved to the inside leaving the five eighths pole, picked up the chase toward the three eighths, rounded
the far turn near the rail then weakened mid-stretch. ROCKING TO HOME was squeezed, clipped the heels of Mio Graceland and bobbled outward into
Modern Day Romance entering the first turn and lost any chance. PULL UP MY SOCKS saved ground. MODERN DAY ROMANCE was forced in and into
Rocking To Home then bumped wide into the first turn. The Stewards posted the inquiry and disqualified Mio Graceland to last place for causing the incident
into the first turn.
