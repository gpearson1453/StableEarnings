Footnotes
BELLAMUNDO set the pace while racing in hand while slightly removed from the rail, responded when asked and maintained a safe advantage.
CROSSFIRE COWGIRL was allowed to settle in stretch, rallied along the inside and finished fast. SEVENTH ST DIAMOND was off a step slow, then was
unhurried, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out to come six-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. NEW MEXICO LINDY was four-wide on
the turn and finished in a mild rally. MISS FLUFFY was prominent early racing along the inside and weakened. I WIN LIKA GIRL raced between horses
early, was in tight nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out four-wide entering the stretch and failed to threaten. DIZCATLIKESMONEY broke out then
raced five-wide on the turn and tired. MOTORIZED dropped back early, came eight-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SINGING DELIGHT
prompted the pace to the stretch while racing three-wide and gave way. VIPERS PRINCESS was finished early after being forwardly placed.

Footnotes
D'TATWAY was allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth. MINDOFMYOWN vied with
Arranged Vows for the lead from along the outside, gained a slight advantage at the three-eighths pole, continued to duel for the lead into deep stretch, but
was unable to resist the winner in a game effort. ARRANGED VOWS dueled for the lead from along the inside and from the stretch and held on stubbornly
during the drive. INVODKAWETRUST hopped at the start, then was forwardly place to the stretch and weakened. WAGES was unhurried early, rallied
five-wide into the stretch and was not a threat. CRITICAL DECISION dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to factor. JERRYS
WAY failed to menace while saving ground.

bumping with Attila the Start, then was allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch, split rivals during the drive and finished strongly. SUPER HUNK
vied for the lead into the stretch while racing two-wide, was unable to match strides with the winner but continued on well for the show. EIGHT MAKAR was
reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. WILDCAT ECHO forced the pace to the stretch while racing
four-wide and weakened. EXTREMELY WICKED settled in the middle of the pack while racing two-wide and failed to threaten. BITTEN dueled for the lead
to the stretch from along the inside and tired. ATTILA THE STAR was bumped at the start, then was prominent early while racing between horses and gave
way. LEA COSTA ME dropped back early and failed to factor. KATRAKA lacked early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
AR YA WEEGEE was off a step slow, moved up along the outside on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch then came in slightly to bump with M G
Lookingood leaving the three-sixteenths pole and gradually drew clear late. M G LOOKINGOOD was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the
stretch, was bumped from between horses by Ar Ya Weegee and Remember Sixtytwo leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly when clear.
REMEMBER SIXTYTWO dueled with Clue for the early lead, opened clear on the turn, then came out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole with M G
Lookingood and held on fairly well during the drive. PLAYTHEMARKER raced four-wide on the turn, offered a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out.
CLUE vied for the early lead from along the inside and tired. GONE PROSPECTING lacked room on the turn while racing between horses, angled out to
come five-wide into the stretch but was unable to threaten. TATAS JOE MARK was prominent early while racing two-wide and gave way after three
furlongs. ARBITRO steadied in tight nearing the half mile pole, dropped back and was unable to recover. MAMIE'S LAST HOPE was four-wide turn, came
six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EL OCHO broke slowly to get away well behind the field and failed to menace. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY AND THE JOCKEY OF M G LOOKINGOOD LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE
FILMS, THE STEWARD MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

ROLL ON CAMRON set the pressured pace from along the outside of Bikiniless, shook that one off leaving the eighth pole and won drawing clear.
BIKINILESS disputed the pace from along the inside, could not stay with the winner late but continued on well for the place. LITTLE PINCH saved ground
while being allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out for the drive and finished strongly. RESTLESS MOVER was never
far back, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. I FORGOTTOREMEMBER was prominent early while racing three-wide but lacked a
rally. ANNIE GET UR GUNS raced between horses on the turn and failed to threaten. RELEASE THE GENIE was forwardly placed to the stretch while
racing two-wide and tired. SINGING ARROW was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. LEONA dropped back early, came
eight-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BRAVE CINDERELLA was bumped by Miss Glorious and carried into Lady Commissioner at the start, then was unhurried, rallied three-wide into the
stretch, drifted out during the drive and was up in the final sixteenth. GUARDING ELK CAMP dropped back early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and
finished fast. STACI'S RED DRESS broke out sharply bumping Miss Hard Knocks carrying her into Lady Commissioner, then dueled for the lead from along
the inside into the stretch and held on fairly well. FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START, STACI'S RED DRESS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND
PLACE FOURTH. LADY COMMISSIONER was pinched back at the start and fell well behind her field, closed some ground along the inside on the turn and
found her best stride too late. MISS GLORIOUS came in at the start to bump with the winner, then prompted the pace from along the outside to the stretch
and tired. MISS HARD KNOCKS was bumped at the start by Staci's Red Dress, then was forwardly placed early and gave way.
