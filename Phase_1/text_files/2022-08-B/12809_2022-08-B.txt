turn, angled out and bumped AWESOME CRUSADER midway down the backstretch, pressed the pace two wide around the far turn, turned for home on

Footnotes
FULTON MARKET stalked the pace three wide, reached near even terms outside of foes near the quarter pole, dueled from there to the wire, exchanged
several light bumps with GREAT ADVENTURE through the stretch and was game to finish on even terms outside of that foe. GREAT ADVENTURE dueled
two wide between foes, exchanged several light bumps with FULTON MARKET through the stretch and dug in gamely to hold a share of the win. TREVESS
had her head turned at the start, raced well back inside, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY raced off the pace
three wide, came six wide into the lane and was one-paced through the lane. KINGSTON QUEEN set a pressured pace along the rail and weakened in the
drive. FROSTY BREW chased the pace two wide, swung five wide nearing the head of the lane and lacked a closing bid. FRANKIE'S GIRL hopped at the
start, raced four wide and never threatened. DEMURELY trailed throughout. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF FULTON MARKET AGAINST
GREAT ADVENTURE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.
