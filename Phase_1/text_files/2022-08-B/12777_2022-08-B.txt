Footnotes
CAPTAIN CHAZZ moved between rivals to the front into the far turn then edged away under . UNCLE MANNY dueled along the inside, angled out stretch,
second best. KNIGHT LEGEND lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn with mild rally. UNCLE GARY G prompted pace four wide and proved empty in
the stretch. INVENTIONIST saved ground off the pace and never a factor. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM chased extremely wide on the turn and lacked a rally.
CALCULATED BREEZE earned narrow advantage outside to the far turn and faded.

WENTZ hustled to the front, vied after half mile to midstretch then rallied clear while kept to his task. MY FRIENDS BEER stalked the leaders wide
throughout, bid on the final turn and was up for the place. JAMMINWITHBRANDON engaged the winner after half a mile, dueled and weakened late. BIG
BEAUTIFUL WALL inside early, angled very wide on the final turn, bid then flattened out. JARLIAN moved close up between rivals then was finished by the
far turn. JACKS AMERICAN PIE lacked usual speed and was never in contention. SAILOR AGAIN saved ground off the leaders and gave way readily.

evenly late. DISTRACTANDATTACK pressed the winner outside for five furlongs and faltered. READY REWARD raced within striking range for three
quarters and gave way. NIANGUA lagged far behind throughout. HARD STRIKE raced inside then weakened steadily loosing contact with his field.

BROAD JUMPER settled inside, angled three wide rallying on the turn, challenged the pacesetter and quickly drew off. SEA PINES controlled the pace
inside, lost the lead into the stretch and just held the place. RISQUE'S JEWEL dropped back outside then offered some late energy. LIAM'S LADY prompted
pace along the rail to the stretch and faltered. GET HER READYEDDIE broke slowly, moved up inside then weakened. LULINDA'S HEART was urged just
off the pacesetter outside then proved empty in the lane. RISEN CHANGE lagged far behind then caught a stopping rival. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD coaxed
wide off the leaders, moved inside on the turn and stopped.

sprinted away, remained clear to the final sixteenth but tired. LADY BERNADETTE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and continued willingly. JALEBI
BABY saved ground within striking range but lacked a closing kick. CAPE COD SALLY raced off the pace in the two path, was urged on the turn but was no
threat. GONE DREAMING saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. MISS ALEX dropped back early and was always outrun. LOVE THAT FACE
chased off the inside and weakened steadily. STARSHIP CHARLY dropped back early and trailed most of trip

Footnotes
R BOY CHEEKUM well placed off the dueling leaders, took over into the stretch, pulled clear and stayed safe. KODAPENDENT lacked speed outside, then
closed with a rush too late. MIDLANER saved ground off the leaders and finished willingly. DONT BREAK THE LAW broke very poorly, circled his field on
the turn and closed well. PARDSY dueled outside to the stretch and weakened slightly. SPLITZVILLE advanced wide on the turn then faded in the stretch.
SPECTACULAR KID raced outside and faded after half a mile. FORMAL ORDER broke sluggishly and was always far back. HANEY BOYS earned a
narrow advantage inside to the top of the stretch and gave way.

ROB THE RICH settled inside the leaders, bid three wide on the turn, quickly reached the front and drew away handily. SUPER JOHN vied along the rail,
could not resist the winner but finished gamely for the place. HEIR PORT alternated for the lead in the two path then weakened in the stretch. JAKE ROCKS
chased outside and gradually weakened. STRUM AND PLUCK lagged far behind throughout. KOBE B lost his action leaving the chute, was eased and
subsequently vanned off. The stewards conducted an inquiry involving the eased runner.
