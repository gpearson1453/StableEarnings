A LATE ONE set the pace holding daylight on the backside being pressed from the inside into the far turn tightening rival on the rail there kicking clear in
upper stretch being ridden out along the inside. WILD WINE stalked the pace engaging from the inside into the far turn being tightened along the rail near
the three eighths pole, dispatched by the winner in upper stretch angled out past mid track hanging on for place. MR GHOST slow early rallied on the far
turn losing ground into upper stretch bidding evenly late in the nine path. QUIDPROQUO JOEBLOW tracked the early pace gaining on the far turn losing
momentum in upper stretch finishing evenly in the three path. STRUCTURAL DAMAGE stalked evenly through the far turn fading on the inside to upper
stretch. I HAVEWHATIT TAKES was never involved. WATTS OF ENERGY always outrun raced very wide through the lane. DOWNTOTHEHONKYTONK
bumped at the break played no factor. PRETTY LOUD struggled throughout. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF WILD WINE AGAINST THE RIDER

through the far turn dueling into upper stretch extending late in the three then four paths staying on to the wire. DON'T POKE THE CAT advanced into the
far turn drawing even outside of foes in upper stretch dueling to the wire at mid track. UNBRIDLEDSELECTION bumped at the break rallied into the far turn
angling out down the stretch vying willingly late in the six path. GRACEFUL KITTEN pressured the pace dueling along the inside through the far turn into
upper stretch ceding grudgingly late to outside pressure. CORAL LEGACY a step slow through the far turn raced eight wide down the stretch. SHOSHA
stalked the pace advancing to the far turn vying in the four path upper stretch fading late. DEPUTY BEN ducking out at the break was rushed wide through

MUDSLIDE WICKED rushed up on the rail wresting a clear lead on the turn, challenged into upper stretch swung out seven wide then drifted nine wide
while clearing late. DE PURA SANGRE pressed on an early lead ceded on the turn extending in bid upper stretch going all out in the three then two paths
proving no match for a wide running winner staying with it to salvage place. SHYLA GIRL chased the pace cutting the corner to bid along the rail in upper
stretch extending there weakening late. LA LIMA pressed early then chased on the turn weakening in the seven and eight paths down the lane. RUTHYLA a
step slow throughout proved no menace. DISTORTED SPLENDOR trailed throughout.
