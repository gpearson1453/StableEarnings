PEPPER SPRAY was up close early, raced five wide into the turns, shifted out in mid stretch, was gaining late and surged clear late. CREATIVE BID set a
clear early pace, raced four wide into the turns, opened up in early stretch, drifted out and finished second best. KEEN CAT tracked the early pace, raced
six wide into the second turn, angled in and was along for third. LIGHTNING STRUCK was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the second
turn and was empty late. PICK A LANE FRANK was void of any early speed, made a move from between horses into the final turn and flattened out.
