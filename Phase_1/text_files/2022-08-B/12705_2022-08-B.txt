Footnotes
PICKING ROSES was out alertly to set the pace along the rail into the first turn, then dueled on late back stretch, was headed by the dueling foe at the top
of the far turn, came on again, and held on gamely down the home stretch to prove best in the end. MORE ICE pressed the pace from the two path into the
first turn, then moved up to duel with the leader, took command at the five sixteenths pole, then gave way on the far turn but closed strongly down the lane
to hold onto the place prize. SUPER WISE chased the pace from the inside on the backstretch, came out to the two path entering the second turn to rally in
the stretch and was closing willingly just missing second place. GOBLER tracked the pace while three wide, was moving up on the backstretch to rally on
the far turn in the home stretch but it was too little too late. SPACE MOUNTAIN tracked the pace from the inside on the backstretch, then menaced on the
far turn into the early stretch then flattened out in the end. GOLD INCLUDED tracked the pace behind the field while two to three wide, then bid on the far
turn and failed to menace in the stretch.

the home stretch and was just up at the wire to prevail. LOU'S ARROW set the pace while two wide, was in a long drive, cleared the far turn then continued
to hold onto the lead grudgingly down the lane but was caught at the wire. HELIOCHROME stalked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, was in a
hard drive on the far turn to menace in the upper stretch, was used up and flattened out in the end. DUDE DROP KID raced while three wide then made a
mild bid on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. MORO COOL tracked the pace while two wide then faded entering the second half of the course

SCARLETT O'HARA stalked the pace from the four path, was gaining gamely on the turn, took command at the quarter pole, then was challenged to keep
the lead down the stretch and held on grudgingly to the end. MY SISTER ANNETTE stalked the leader while three wide then vied for the lead on the turn,
was in tight, came out to the four path, re rallied and was closing willingly and hung in the end. OUR LOST LOVE lead the way from the inside, was in a
hard drive on the turn to keep the lead, was used up and gave way in late stretch. VISIONOFWILDTIMES pressed the pace from the two path into the turn,
was hard used and weakened in the end. SCAMPERING GRAYCE was unhurried early and never fired in the stretch.

IMA BIG BOPPER was unhurried early, was steadily urging on the far turn to menace in the home stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail in the
end. BEAUREGARD settled on the backstretch while two wide, was gaining ground on the far turn to closed belatedly in the home stretch and was second
best. WHITAKER saved ground from the inside on the backstretch, was moving up to gain command at the top of the far turn, continued to dig in gamely
down the lane but was caught in the late stretch. COWBOY RIDGE was away well to press the pace from the inside, was in a hard drive on the far turn then
weakened in the home stretch. WAR COUNT hopped at the start then set the pace in the two path, was in a steady drive on the backstretch, was headed at
the top of the turn by an outside rival, rallied but was used up and tired in the end.
