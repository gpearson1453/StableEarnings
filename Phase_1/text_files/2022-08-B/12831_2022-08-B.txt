Footnotes
FAREWELL TIME took command soon after the start, continued to show the way onto the main track, held sway the final furlong while continuing between
rivals. JAKE THE BAND MAN broke on top, relinquished the advantage soon after, pressed the winner throughout from the outside, could not get to that
rival late while maintaining the runner up spot. TAPIZARS SECRET broke back, rallied while remaining widest throughout. TALE OF A STORM within
striking distance inside the winner and between horses, lacked a closing punch. SPECTROLITE went evenly while racing toward the inside. ROCKY BAR
SIX forwardly placed early, weakened final sixteenth. PAPA BRO last to leave, was never a threat while racing toward the inside. SHADES OF TRUTH
remained back in lacking a rally. ADIOS YANKEE broke back, trailed throughout. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HILLCREST DRIVE bit fractious loading, gained the advantage soon after the start, continued to show the way through the turn toward the inside and under
light restraint, extended that advantage by midstretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. FOOLISH BOY chased the winner off the inside,
lost contact with that one nearing the furlong marker then was carving into that margin late, clearly second best. WILTON second flight between foes, in a bit
of traffic exiting the turn, finished up best of the rest when clear, no threat to the top pair. CATINANDSCATIN forwardly placed while three wide through the
turn, lacked a winning response in the drive to finish up evenly. BOBBY MERLOT went one paced throughout while three out to four wide through the turn.
TIME TO MOVE in the second group while inside, continued to save ground into the lane, had little left in the run to the wire. NOT A NYKI in mid pack
outside, four out to five wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. WIN AGAIN remained always back. REAL MAGIC also never threatened to be always
outrun. FRIEND'S DO CARE balked at loading, last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
ELIZABETH RENEE outrun early off the inside, moved out a bit more to be four wide into the turn, came six wide into the lane when beginning to advance,
outside bid past the furlong marker, kicked clear. LES AND MADGE broke back, lacked speed in trailing early, traffic late in the turn, came five wide for the
drive, finished willingly while widest through the lane to be clearly second best. T R'S FIRST broke back, also was devoid of early foot, waited briefly behind
horses turning into the stretch, rallied through traffic to improve through the lane, just up for the show. STOP SHOP N DROP another who broke in the back,
lacked speed, steadied briefly in that same traffic jam late in the turn, split foes, dropped to the rail late, missed the show. REBECCA G pressed the early
leader off the inside, dueled turn, gained the advantage upper stretch, faltered in the late going to quickly lose several positions. TRICKY MOM moved up to
mid pack after the start, raced four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. ROARING QUINN set or forced the pace for four furlongs along the inside
and gave way. MYDEALOFTHEDAY within striking distance early while four wide into the turn, backed up through the stretch. JULIO CHOICE in mid pack
early while between horses, began a steady fade before a half. TWO PUNCH FIST in the second group for a half, stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
BET ON BOURBON broke forwardly, steadied ever so slightly when in a bit tight before a half, moved up to take command soon after, extended that
advantage into the lane and steadily drew out under pressure. SEEMYVALENTINE pressed the issue from the three path early, continued to vie between
rivals turning for home, could not keep pace with the winner, clearly second best. SABERFIGHT prompted the pace while four wide into the turn, remained
with the first flight outside, came three wide for the drive, proved no match for the top two, narrowly saved the show. FIELD OF LIGHTS in the main body for
a half off the inside, three wide into the turn, angled out four wide turning for home, rallied, narrowly missed the show. KASENS TRIBE in main body outside
up the backstretch, four wide through the turn, asked entering the stretch, lacked a closing punch. PENNIE'S MAGIC went one paced throughout while
racing three wide. MY ROYAL PRINCESS broke back, raced back and in hand early, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting, improved slightly without
posing a serious threat. BRI last away, continued to trail, came four wide for the drive, passed some tiring rivals late after the issue had been decided.
LUCCA'S LILYBY remained back in failing to threaten. ATLANTIC BAND in the second group early toward the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.
TENPINS TEMPEST remained always back while saving ground. STELLAR FANTASY underwent a shoe repair in the paddock. broke alertly, narrowly set
the early pace, stopped.

Footnotes
CONGA BOY closed from the start exiting the chute, early bid from between rivals into the turn, dueled into and through upper stretch, edged clear under
steady handing. ARGYBARGY BUCK broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, vied into the turn closest to the inside, dueled with the winner the
middle three furlongs then could not keep up from midstretch in. CALLTHEWOLFE broke back, was outrun for five furlongs while saving ground, shifted out
when straightened for home, launched a belated rally to be well clear of the others while not a serious threat to the top pair. TRAELEE away in good order,
pressed the issue up the backstretch from the outside, vied three wide turn, gradually weakened. CARIBE NIGHTS last to leave,moved up in the run up the
chute to race in mid pack, one paced inside, had little left for the drive and faded late. HAIL SOUTHERN turned in an even effort off the inside in lacked a
closing kick. CYBER GUN was not dangerous while racing three out to four wide. F J'S GEM broke back, lacked speed well out in the strip, five to six wide
exiting the turn, remained back in failing to rally. COACH HUDSON tired after a three wide trip. BAND BOSS was finished early to trail home.

Footnotes
SNOWBALL close from the start, slipped through along the inside onto the backstretch, clear before a half, rated in the run through the final turn, shrugged
off nearest foes into lane, clear again a furlong out, enough left to hold the runner up safe lte. TECATE TIME void of speed, continued back into the far turn,
swung out five wide turning for home, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. BLAZING CHARM in the second flight, moved closer three wide
through the second turn, within contact of the winner into the lane then could not keep up or contain the runner up, finished up best of the rest. JUST
PASSING THRU lacked early foot, moved a bit closer after a half in the three path, went evenly in the drive in lacking further response. ALLIACEOUS went
one paced throughout in lacking a rally. KIND WAYS vied up front early three wide, chased the winner the middle half then gave way. ROCKETT MAGIC
showed the way early when rank and in the two path, remained forward the second quarter then began to stop.

Footnotes
BISPING broke out but sharply, set or forced the pace up the backstretch in the two path, disposed of the other speed turning for home, fully extended to
hold the runner up safe late. THE BOSS SOSS closest to the dueling leaders early, came in the two path for the drive, chased the winner past the furlong
marker, then mounted a late surge to be rapidly getting to that same rival late from the outside. KAJUN KARMA within striking distance off the inside, came
three wide and between rivals into the lane while between rivals, proved game for the show while not a threat to the top two. RANCH WATER behind the
first group outside, came four wide for the drive, long drive for the show, outkicked for that position. STAR SYZYGY in mid pack early toward the inside,
behind some traffic to briefly wait late in the turn, when evenly through the stretch when clear. FREE FROM GUILT broke back, lacked speed, improved
position slightly while not posing serious threat. EASY CHANCE away well, moved up to put a head in front along the inside, vied into the turn, fell back off
the winner by late in the bend, weakened in the drive. SWIFT N TRAFFIC bothered slightly when the winner broke out, raced near the back early, failed to
rally. TUCKER THE GRUMP void of speed, never threatened with a four wide trip. THROWIN' SHADE last away, remained sluggish for three furlongs,
never close. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE stopped after a quarter, walked in.

Footnotes
KATIE'S C showed the way into the first turn between foes, garnered a slightly larger advantage onto the backstretch, stretched that lead out into the far
turn when closest pursuer pulled up, coasted home under intermittent urging. ST. MONICA off the early pace, began to move closer just before a half,
bothered slightly when a stricken rival pulled up into the far turn, chased the winner into the lane, could do nothing with that one through the lane, remained
far clear for the second spot. SADIE'S PORT one paced while three wide through the first turn, continued outside, three wide again through the second
bend, finished up best of the rest. SHOOTING STICK broke sharply, raced forward early had little left for the stretch run. GRACE'S VISION void of early
foot, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. PERFECT PUDDING off a step slow, advanced into a position in the middle of the
pack early, bothered slightly by the stricken foe three furlongs out, tired through the stretch. TAP YOUR FRONT five down to four wide in the first turn when
well back, was never a factor. RAYNEITE trailed well back, eased into the stretch after losing contact with the field, walked in. PAGE SIX PRINCESS
closest to the winner, appeared to take a bad step then was pulled up into the far turn, vanned off.
