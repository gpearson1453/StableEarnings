GREELEY WENT WEST was well rated behind the duel, made a four wide move on the far turn, then dueled with WISE ANCHOR by the quarter pole and
then drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a mild drive. WISE ANCHOR dueled outside a rival on the first turn, then made a bid on the turn and
dueled on the inside of the winner to the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rival but clearly second best. CYPRIANO was reserved early,
advanced mildly three wide by the quarter pole and then lacked a late response, bested rest. JUSTA SWINGING was allowed to settle early, made a five
wide move on the far turn and then tired. NOW NOW MAN dueled for the lead to the inside of a rival while racing in the two path and then gave way on the
turn.

Footnotes
TEXAS BLUEBONNET was rated along three wide early, then was between rivals from the half mile marker to the quarter pole, then made a four wide bid
leaving the turn and gained a short lead by the furlong marker, then wandered out and then was given a few pops right handed with the crop, got back into
the bridle and held on late to prevail. SHE A HOT MESS set a pressured pace on the inside but while racing off the rail, then was in the two path on the turn
and dueled for command, then battled on to the wire and just missed. HAVE I EVER was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide, then went up to
press the pace four wide on the backstretch, then made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command but faded in the drive. LADY JEOPARDY chased
the early pace and made a five wide bid on the turn but flattened out. MY FRIEND MR. JIM pressed the early pace three wide, then dropped to the inside
nearing the three eighths marker and was empty. DARLING JOANNA was allowed to settle four to five wide and had no rally. MISS EMPIREMENT chased
the pace on the inside and steadied around the three eighths marker and weakened. PUMPKIN BREAD stumbled badly at the start, not a threat.

Footnotes
GOOD OLD CHARLIE was well placed on the inside, eased out to make a three wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the turn and drew clear to prove
best, driving. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF was away alertly to set a pressured pace while getting over to the inside, proved to be no match for the winner late
while running on to be clearly second best. SY MICHAEL stalked the pace three to four wide and weakened, held show award. CROOKS REBEL was
allowed to settle while three wide, then was two wide on the turn and had no rally while just missing the show award. WESTERN STAR was allowed to
settle four wide, then was three to four wide on the turn and lakced a rally. JUDGMENTAL was reserved early, then was four wide on the turn, angled in
leaving the turn and had no rally. KINGPRIN pressed the pace three wide and tired. C. F. CONGRESS showed little while wide.
