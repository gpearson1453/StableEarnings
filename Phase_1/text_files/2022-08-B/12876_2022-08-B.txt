CHANCEWORTHTAKING settled off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch proved best. VERMONT HOLIDAY
forced the pace, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the four path in upper stretch but was outgunned. BELLE FEMME was away alertly, saved
ground on the turn and was up for show. COSMIC SHOT was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. OUR
STORMY SOPHIA was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.

Footnotes
HIATUS set the pace, took command on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. SOBERANO (FR) had no speed and
moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. DETERMINATOR was away alertly and a factor on the
far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. CALMING INFLUENCE was in touch but chased on the far turn and had no rally.
FEDERAL LAW was in mid pack and raced evenly on the far turn but failed to fire. GIANT MINE was unhurried early and showed little while outrun.

WICKED CRAZY was unhurried early, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. INNUENDO off the pace
and dueled on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. STREET MAX was well back and closed the gap on the far turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. HIGH RESERVE was up close early but chased on the far turn and weakened through the
stretch. MR. DYNAMIC set a pressured pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty. ASCOT BAY stumbled at the start and lost the rider. A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
ROYAL BIZ showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. NOT A GAME was unhurried
early, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. JOCULARITY stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. PAPERBACK HERO was off the pace and roused from the inside on the turn but needed
more. SUPER BREW was well back, trailed the field on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and was no threat. MAMMOTH SPRING settled off the
pace and was hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact. CORA was up close early and raced evenly on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

HASN'T HIT ME YET showed speed from the inside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. FLECK
was well back, closed the gap on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. BLONDE ATTITUDE tracked the early leaders
and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. MISS TEA BLONDE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn
but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. CASSIE'S RAINBOW was in range but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of
the stretch failed to fire. MARTINI SUE was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was outrun.
ERRATIQUE stumbled at the start and had the lead on the turn but came up empty.

EVER SO D'WILD was off the pace, gained ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch drew off. MY FINAL TRICK stalked the
early leader, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch but failed to hold. CINDERVELLA was in mid pack, roused
on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. LIME was hustled early and had the lead on the turn but gave way at the top of
the stretch. STORMY SUZIE had no speed and saved ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no threat. KOZY KAT was up
close early but chased on the turn and had nothing left. NEW YORK MINT was unhurried early and raced evenly from the inside on the turn but was not a
factor. GOLDEN GARTER was well back, showed little and was never in contention.
