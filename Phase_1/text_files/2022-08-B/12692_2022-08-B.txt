BREAKFAST RIDE bore out at the break brushing and forcing out RHETORIC, corrected and prompted the pace outside the leader, moved to engage three
furlongs out, dueled then wrested command near the quarter pole, shook clear soon into the lane, widened a bit in mid stretch then was fully extended to
hold sway. STREET RUCKUS settled in the two path, edged up into the far turn, eased out three wide mid way on the turn and took aim, kept grinding
through the drive and slowly gained. RHETORIC , brushed and forced out by the winner at the break, regrouped and raced four wide into the first turn,
continued four wide while making a mild advance to the half mile pole, angled five to six wide for the drive and churned on to gain the show. RESULTANT ,
off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, angled out near mid stretch and kept on with some interest between runners. ECHOSMITH (IRE) , well placed
three wide stalking the pace, shifted four wide and was under pressure past the five sixteenths, chased into the lane but came up empty. LAMMAS (GB)
cleared early and set a rated pace towards the inside, was hooked by the winner into the far turn, grimly held the advantage past the five sixteenths, kept up
the fight to the three sixteenths then faded. ROCKS AND SALT , carried out at the break, dropped off the pace while three wide, was under a ride into the
far turn but lacked a response.

Footnotes
QUEENZY , taken back soon after the break, rated in last while off the inside, picked things up and moved in hand four wide leaving the far turn, sustained
and rolled up to bid outside rivals nearing the furlong grounds, took a short lead outside BOLD CONNECTION soon after, dueled and held firm under a
drive. BOLD CONNECTION settled off the pace while three wide, responded when given her cue into the far turn, moved up to loom a solid presence into
the lane, took a slim advantage between rivals nearing the eighth pole, fought gamely inside the winner from there but wasn't quite good enough.
CAHUILLA settled inside, edged up soon into the lane, angled out for the final furlong and kept on with good energy. THREE STRANDS tracked inside,
swung out entering the lane, straightened to be about five wide but failed to seriously kick on. TEA N CONVERSATION stalked outside a rival, was under
coaxing between runners mid way on the final turn, angled out then faded. ACCELERINA settled off the rail, raced between runners leaving the far turn,
angled four wide for the drive but lacked a rally. ALWAYS AT EASE grabbed command early and set a pressured pace towards the rail, dueled inside LA
PALOMA BLANCA from five sixteenths, ceded command in mid stretch and weakened. LA PALOMA BLANCA prompted the pace outside the leader,
moved to near even terms past the five sixteenths, sparred to about mid stretch then gave way. I'M STILL IN IT saved ground without menacing.

KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT advanced inside a host of rivals and put a head in front after a furlong, took some early pressure then went clear into the turn,
spurted away a bit while coaxed along mid turn, kept on under stout right handed asking past the furlong grounds and dug in to prevail. EVERLYS GIRL had
speed then rated just off the leader while about two wide, tracked in hand around turn, was put to firm asking leaving the three sixteenths, continued gamely
and steadily gained. NEVER SWAY , in hand between runners, dropped in entering the lane, came back out and finished willingly. CORUSCATION stalked
three wide between rivals, angled four wide approaching the lane, failed to kick on and gave way in the final furlong. TAPIT DOUX rated in range while
saving ground, crept closer mid turn, angled three wide into the lane, lacked a punch leaving mid stretch and weakened. TALKATIVE GAL , hustled along
off the rail, raced three wide leaving the half mile marker and faded. LOVEHERHEART saved ground and failed to menace. AMANDA ROSE lost ground
four wide while pursuing, stayed in range to mid turn then faltered.

Footnotes
COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) eased back off the leaders heading to the first turn and secured the inside, raced under a firm hold just behind the dueling
front runners past the half mile maker, moved through an inviting seam along the rail soon into the lane, overtook the leader leaving the furlong grounds,
spurted clear under right handed asking, wandered outward late and held off QUATTROELLE (IRE). QUATTROELLE (IRE) settled off the pace while saving
ground, cut the corner advancing into the lane, came out and worked between foes near the eighth pole, leveled off nicely and gained. FEARLESS GIRL
(IRE) settled outside a rival while not far back, angled five wide under a ride into the lane, straightened and rallied mildly. CHARGES DROPPED disputed
the pace under rating and to the inside of MALIBU MARIE, took over from that one around the far turn, edged clear under a ride past the quarter pole, came
two wide into the lane allowing the winner a path, dueled past mid stretch then weakened late. EVER SMART stalked three wide, angled four wide under
pressure for the drive, failed to kick on past mid stretch, faded and had her rider lose the whip in deep stretch. MALIBU MARIE gained a short lead early,
dueled outside CHARGES DROPPED from about the three quarter pole to the five sixteenths, gave chase past the quarter pole then weakened.

Footnotes
CLASSICAL CAT drifted out soon after the break, was corrected and tracked the pace while about five wide, dropped in around the turn and edged up to
take aim on the embattled leaders, moved to the attack three deep with a quarter to go, struck the top into the lane, spurted clear soon after then held firm
under a steady drive. HEJAZI broke a step slow, recovered and accelerated to hold a brief lead near the five eighths, eased back off rivals to his outside
nearing the half mile marker, stalked towards the inside, shifted out three to four wide to have aim into the lane then gave willing pursuit to the wire.
EASTBOUND , sluggish from the gate, dropped well off the early pace, swung six wide into the lane, straightened away and closed steadily on his left lead.
OMNIPRESENT , between runners early, chased two to three wide into the lane and kept on with some effort. STORM THE NIGHT broke a step slow, was
sent up soon after and contested the pace off the rail and to the inside of NULLARBOR, dropped in around the turn and continued the scrum, held a slim
lead approaching the quarter pole, ceded soon after, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave way. DELIBERATE RISK , four wide under hustling ride, raced
forwardly leaving the far turn, failed to kick on nearing the lane and gave way. LOCO LUNA , inside chasing the early pace, dropped back leaving the far
turn then came up empty. NULLARBOR had speed outside rivals, gained command past the five eighths, dropped in a bit and dueled outside STORM THE
NIGHT, was surrounded while battling near the quarter pole, failed to go leaving the three sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
GILLIAN ELIZABETH settled outside a rival, took closer order leaving the far turn, eased out and was put to pressure, knifed her way between runners
approaching the lane, swung six wide, closed sharply and overwhelmed the dueling leaders to take control in mid stretch, powered away under solid hand
encouragement then was taken in hand for the final few strides. SWEET AND CHEEKY rated close up while saving ground, moved through along the rail to
challenge in upper stretch, dueled on a slim lead inside the three sixteenths, faded late but managed to save the place. FOUNDER'S DAY , fractious pre
race, was rated along and held up a bit between foes near the half mile marker, edged up about two wide into the lane, lacked room nearing mid stretch,
dropped in and finished well through the final seventy yards. DANCING DANA cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, dueled under a hearty ride
while two wide past the quarter pole, was hooked from her inside in upper stretch, battled to mid stretch then faded. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT settled
early off the rail, moved up past the five eighths, progressed four wide between runners to loom in upper stretch then flattened out. TARANTA (IRE) saved
ground, moved up a bit into the lane then lacked room in mid stretch. IDA CLAIRE prompted the pace two to three wide outside DANCING DANA, moved
alongside through the backstretch run, dueled around the final turn, drifted a bit into the lane then gave way. MAGICAL PATH drafted back off the pace, was
under asking leaving the far turn, saved ground into the lane but failed to menace. A THOUSAND DREAMS , three to four wide, moved up to be in range
after a half mile, pursued past the quarter pole, was fanned wider into the lane then weakened.

Footnotes

of a mile, dropped in towards the rail going clear, set a rated pace around the turn, responded when shoved on entering the lane, quickly widened, was kept
alert with a right handed ask inside the furlong grounds then continued to eagerly increase his advantage while kept alert. THIRSTY PAPPY saved ground
and was ridden along leaving the far turn, moved up while saving ground into the lane and kept on willingly to gain the place. TOM HORN prompted the
pace outside the winner, was under asking three wide mid turn, stayed on willingly past the three sixteenths then faded. DUTY FIRST , bumped at the
break, raced between foes mid turn but failed to menace. REGULATION DAZED , outrun early while saving some ground, angled three wide and had some
belated interest. STAY IN THE GAME , bumped at the break, lost ground four wide chasing, angled wider for the drive and weakened. REIGN OF SPEED
came out at the break and bumped a rival, straightened and hustled up to chase towards the inside, angled out leaving the far turn and weakened in upper
stretch. VINCE'S CORNER , bumped and off slowly, was outrun. MENTIROSA , four to five wide, tired nearing the lane and was eased late. EDDIE'S LAST

Footnotes
SPENDARELLA relaxed in the clear while tracking a contested pace, cruised up three wide to engage CAIRO MEMORIES entering the lane, forged to
command past the three sixteenths, powered away under a drive past the furlong grounds and proved clearly best while kept to task. BELLABEL (IRE)
came out at the break and bumped with a rival, gained a good spot along the rail and settled nicely, edged up leaving the far turn, eased out to advance
between rivals and finished up willingly to be second best. CAIRO MEMORIES disputed the pace to the inside of GRACELUND GRAY, shook clear near the
five sixteenths, failed to contain the winner's surge in upper stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final furlong. TEZZARAY (GB) settled then raced
in the clear heading to the three eighths, gained along the inside into the lane, eased out for the final furlong but flattened out. BALLET DANCING , bumped
and pinched back at the break, regrouped and settled two wide, angled three wide leaving the three eighths, swung five wide nearing the lane, drifted in
advancing near mid stretch and churned on. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) was rated back from between rivals early and a bit difficult to settle, swung eight wide for
the drive and had belated action. LADY CLEMENTINE (GB) , unhurried early, moved up a bit to the inside of rivals in upper stretch but failed to seriously
menace. SIXTEEN ARCHES (IRE) saved ground, eased out near the quarter pole and lacked a bid. ISLAND OF LOVE (IRE) , bumped at the break, saved
ground early, eased out and advanced around the final turn then steadied when put in tight in upper stretch. TXOPE (FR) , three wide, gained between
runners into the far turn, chased past the quarter pole then gave way. GOLD DRAGON QUEEN , off the pace, was under pressure around the final turn and
was not a factor. LADY T drifted in at the break and tightened a rival, corrected and stalked outside, was under pressure leaving the far turn, drifted and
gave way. GRACELUND GRAY vied outside CAIRO MEMORIES, failed to kick on with that one past the five sixteenths, chased and faltered.

Footnotes
HIGH HEATER , three to four wide, picked up the pace after a half mile, steadily advanced to take aim approaching the stretch, switched over to his correct
lead while sustaining under pressure leaving the eighth pole, took command soon after and drew out. LITTLE DEMON set a pressured pace while off the
inside, moved clear after a half mile, widened past the quarter pole, dug in when confronted near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. HAPI HAPI lagged
well back, moved up towards the rail into the lane, steadied when blocked, altered out and finished well. ACTIVE ACCOUNT saved ground early, moved up
to the inside of a rival around the final turn but failed to follow through in the final furlong. OUTRIGHT broke awkwardly, lagged back, swung five wide into
the lane but failed to menace. DR. TROUTMAN rated off the leaders, angled well wide to chase, bid outside the leader near the half mile pole, gave hard
pursuit past the quarter pole then weakened. GRAY MAGICIAN made a mild inside run near the half then faded. SECRET TOUCH moved up between rivals
near the half mile pole, shifted four to five wide and came up empty. OF GOOD REPORT , off the pace, raced four wide into the far turn and gave way.
MARINERS WAY bid outside the leader into the first turn, vied about four wide heading to the half mile pole then faltered.

Footnotes
BELLE CHERIE prompted the pace outside the leader, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, dueled, took over soon into the lane, edged clear
in mid stretch then dug in tenaciously under strong handling to prevail. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) stalked inside, eased out for room into the lane and brushed
with VIVANDO, straightened to work between runners leaving mid stretch and finished gamely. VIVANDO steadied off heels near the three quarter pole,
edged up three wide leaving the far turn, angled out a bit and progressed four wide into the lane, brushed with a rival to her inside and churned on.
INFINITE EMPIRE , a bit rank early, moved up between foes leaving the far turn, angled five wide for the drive, ranged up late then hung. ALBAYAADER
(IRE) rated in the two path, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied. TAKEMEBYTHEHAND (GB) , patiently rated two wide, moved up to be in range into
the far turn, shifted in past mid stretch then flattened out. MAEVE OF CONNAUGHT (IRE) hopped at the break, settled off the pace, raced off the rail past
the three eighths, angled four wide into the lane and had a mild run. WISHING ON A STAR bobbled at the break, saved ground from the half mile pole to
upper stretch, angled out but failed to threaten. HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS saved ground, moved up under some asking into the far turn, remained towards
the inside into the stretch but came up empty. QUICK ROMANCE sped clear, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure then dueled leaving the far
turn, sparred with the winner into the lane, kept on gamely past mid stretch then faded late. FIRST POINT lagged back, saved ground into the lane but failed
to menace. WISTFULLY , four to five wide, moved up mid way through the backstretch run, drifted out while failing to kick on leaving the far turn and
faltered.
