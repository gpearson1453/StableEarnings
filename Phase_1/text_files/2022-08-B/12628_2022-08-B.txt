C C'S COWGIRL was taken back early and moved to the inside, settled into a nice stride, was coaxed along on the turn while still on the inside, swung out
four wide leaving the turn, closed well under mild right handed crop urging to get up late and edge clear to prove best. MAGICAL STARDUST vied for the
lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn and gained a short lead but could not hold off the winner late, second best. MISS CHECKMARK was
settled while three wide, swung out six wide for the drive and was along for the show award. NAVAGATIONALBEACON vied for the lead on the outside,
was two wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. STORMY SUNRISE was rated early two wide, then shifted to the outside and was five wide on the
backstretch, then moved four wide on the turn and weakened. SOCO UNBRIDLED steadied into the first turn, then was two to three wide and had no rally.
WHO DAT GREY was four wide into the first turn and stalked the pace four wide and tired.

FOUR O SIX CREED prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then took over leaving the turn and drew clear under
mild left handed crop urging. BRAVE MAGIC broke in at the start, then set the pace along the inside and dueled for command on the turn and proved to be
no match for the winner while clearly second best. PRINCE COSMO was off a step slow and bumped at the start, chased the pace on the inside and
weakened, bested rest. ACCRUAL chased the pace three to four wide and weakened. FANCY PAYNTER was off slowly and bumped at the start, then
shifted to the outside on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, no threat. PER RULING 25046 FOUR O SIX CREED WAS DISQUALIFED FROM
FIRST TO UNPLACED FOR A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

Footnotes
CABOT was reserved early, advanced nicely on the inside on the turn, came off the inside when straightened and closed well under mild urging to edge
away late to prove best. SPECTROLITE dueled for the early lead three wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn, then drew out by the furlong marker but
had nothing left late, caught and stayed for the place award. MCLEAN was off a step slow, saved ground on the turn and angled out in the drive and finished
well late. SECRETARY AT WAR was settled back early, then had a late gain on the inside. NATE'S WAY was settled early and came five wide into the drive
and had a mild late kick. MAXI MOON was settled back early and had no rally while improving position late. THATSAFACTJACK dueled for the lead on the
inside and weakened. HUG THE MUNNY chased the pace three wide and weakened. HALFMOON REEF was wide and not a factor. The rider on number
two claimed foul against the rider of number four, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the objection was disallowed.

best, driving. SHEZA HUNK set the pace on the inside and was headed by the quarter pole, could not go with the winner while being second best. CAVIAR
RESOLUTION bumped at the start, then went up between rivals at the half mile marker, then was three to four wide on the turn, then finished well to best
the rest. LADY LUTE stalked the pace three wide and weakened. ROYAL BONUS was settled early, then was four to five wide on the turn and had no rally
while finishing on even terms for the fourth position. FIBRILLATOR was allowed to settle between rivals early, then was on the inside by the quarter pole
and had no rally. DONTFORGETRDREAMS was bumped at the start, then raced five wide into the turn, then was six wide by the quarter pole and was not
a threat. DAD'S STAR CAT chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

but was caught late. GUITARTUITION PLZZ was settled early, then raced five wide on the backstretch, then was four wide on the turn and had a mild late

rivals. CAMEO DANCER was well placed on the inside and tired. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS was settled back and asked nearing the three eighths marker while

SERGEANT RECKLESS was well placed on the inside, then eased out to be two wide by the quarter pole, tipped out three wide leaving the turn, split rivals
nearing the sixteenth and got up to prevail under a drive. OGRE'S LION KING chased the early pace to the outside, made a four wide move on the turn,
came five wide into the lane and finished willingly but was out kicked by the winner. WHITEROSE JEWEL was four wide into the first turn, pressed the pace
three wide and made a two wide bid by the quarter pole, took a short lead leaving the turn and gave way grudgingly. UNIFIED ASSETS was four wide on
the first turn, tracked the early pace and then went up to prompt the pace four wide on the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn and came four
wide into the lane and faded late. SHARP DOUBLE EDGE set a pressured pace on the inside and faded in the drive. BIG JABOT was allowed to settle early
and was two wide on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive and had no kick. AIR FORCE ANGEL was off slowly, then made steady advance three wide
on the turn and came four wide into the lane, angled out widest in the drive and had a belated rally. HEMPSTEAD failed to menace. KING ARTHUR RIDGE
was not a threat. MR. WIMBLEDON BAY was rank early and then was eased in the lane, walked off.
