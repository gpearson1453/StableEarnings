TAPSOLUTION set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, drew off, then lasted under steady pressure. EXTRA MEDIUM mid pack, moved up
two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, closed well late and missed. WATCH THE DIP tracked the pace,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out. LEAVEITALONELARRY well placed and outside, moved up on
the two path through the turn, came three and four wide into the stretch and had a mild late gain. ANOTHER SOFTBALL allowed to settle, angled out while
moving up through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved his position. COOPER'S CRESCENT stalked the pace outside rating, then faded
into the stretch. LEBASI broke slowly from the gate and was never involved.

allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, responded to left hand urging and closed fast for the place.
LOOKING FOR LOVE sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, then weakened late and held the show. BELLE'S KINGDOM well placed, moved up three
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had a mild gain. KEEP SCROLLING allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and had a mild late gain. GUCCI GAL improved position, inside. WINNING TOUGH ran evenly. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER
passed tiring rivals. RUNAWAY PHYLLIS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and faded. FASTELLE well placed and
