Footnotes
GANDI was rated along two wide, angled out leaving the three sixteenths, closed well under a few left handed pops with the crop to edged clear late.
CHAMPION BY DESIGN prompted the pace three wide and then was gaining late to gain the place award. KHAKI JACK set a pressured pace on the inside
and kicked clear leaving the turn but faded late and was caught, then lost the place award on the wire. MAKOTO chased the early pace on the inside,
steadied nearing the three eighths marker, then shifted to the outside on the turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
LADY OUTOFTHE BLUE was rated along the inside, awaited room leaving the quarter pole, then shifted out three wide, then lugged in while trying to switch
leads around the furlong marker, then leveled out and closed with a rush to get up in time under hand urging, green. QUEEN LUCKY was allowed to settle
on the inside, made a four wide move nearing the quarter pole, dueled for command by the furlong marker, got that better of that rival late but was denied
late by the winner. NATURE TRAIL tracked the early pace, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled for command by the furlong marker and
was outkicked late, good effort. HEYBACKATCHA pressed the early pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn, angled out leaving the furlong
marker and faded. CHASING ARTEMIS was reserved early, came four wide into the drive and had a belated rally. SULTRY SKY passed the tiring rivals.
RIPPA failed to menace. LUCYS GIRL set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. CIRCLE OF COURAGE was not a factor and eased late, vanned
off.

ARCTICA set the early pace on the inside and dawdled along on the front end, turned back the bid from GINGERONMYMIND leaving the quarter pole and
drew off in the drive to prove much the best under a drive. GINGERONMYMIND prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but proved to be
no match for the winner while clearly second best. OH SO JAZZY was allowed to settle early, made a mild three wide bid and then lacked a late response,
bested rest. HERE I COME tracked the pace on the inside and tired. SEEKING THE THRONE tracked the pace and was in between rivals at the half mile
marker and tired. HONESTA failed to menace.

Footnotes
LADDIE LIAM bobbled at the start but quickly recovered to go up and prompt the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn when ready, drew clear
and then was kept to right handed crop urging to late to remain well clear. COLONEL MOORHEAD was settled on the inside, shifted out at the half mile
marker and advanced two wide, then split rivals by the quarter pole, then finished willingly but failed to gain on the winner while clearly second best.
FLIMFLAM MAN was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide and weakened. CONTRAFLOW was well placed on the inside and tired. HOT N
SPICY LOVE failed to respond. ALL TACKED UP set a pressured pace on the inside and stopped.
