Footnotes
INTEND tracked the pace from the inside, then came out three wide to rally in the early stretch, gained command, was challenged by an inner rival in the
final furlong and was just up to prevail. PURE TAP was unhurried early, was gaining from the inside on the turn to menace gamely in the stretch, dueled with
the outer rival in the last sixteenth but hung in the end. PLEMMONSTON was bumped on both sides then chased the leader while in the three path, faded in
the late backstretch, then came on again in the early stretch and closed willingly for the show prize. DROP ANCHOR broke outwardly at the start and
bumped rival, then chased the pace while two wide, bid mildly on the turn then flattened out in late stretch. MIGHTY CONTENDER broke inward and
bumped rival, then chased the pace in the four path, was urging on the turn to bid in the stretch but needed more. LAMP OIL lead the way from the inside,
was in a hard drive on the turn, was used up and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
ADIOS ASHER lead the way from the inside, cleared the turn and was kept to task down the lane under a strong hand drive. MATERS N TATERS chased
the pace from the inside, then steadied on the turn, angled out to the two path, dug in gamely and closed well in the end. TRAINER PLEASE broke
awkwardly at the start, then tracked the pace while two wide to bid five wide on the turn, menaced in the stretch and held on for the show prize.
DEUTERONOMYSTRONG was unhurried early along the inside, then swung three wide on the turn, angled out to the four path and closed willingly in the
stretch but it was not enough. ALWAYS HOPEFUL pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, was hard used then stopped. INDIA INK stalked the pace
from the three path, was in a steady drive on the turn then weakened in the late stretch. Race was hand timed.
