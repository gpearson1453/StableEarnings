Footnotes
OBVIOUS took command of the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, drew clear in mid-stretch, felt pressure in the final sixteenth from the
runner-up, was all out in the final strides and just held on for the win. AMADMADWORLD rated off of the early moderate pace, saved ground through the
turn, shifted out a path in mid-stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth to confront the winner and just missed on the line for the win, while besting the rest.
SEENEVA THE CAT stalked the moderate pace, improved position along the turn, was set down for the drive inside of the furlong marker and was
outfinished in the final sixteenth, while clear of the rest for third. TRIBUTE TO AFLEET saved ground while chasing the moderate pace and lacked a late
response. AM SCRAY was a bit slow into early stride and was green early on, chased the pace two wide to the stretch and did not offer a late rally.
AFRICAN PRINCE was crowded a bit leaving the break, was forwardly placed to the turn, lost ground three wide nearing the top of the lane and faded in the
final stages.

Footnotes
ROARING TIGER was away in good order and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, shook free from
FORGOTTEN VOWS nearing the top of the lane and pulled away in the drive. STRAUS'S PLACE bumped with FORGOTTEN VOWS at the start, settled
just off of the pace, improved position in upper stretch, was no match late for the winner but stayed on to secure the place. FORGOTTEN VOWS was
bumped at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be close to the early pace, kept close attendance to the pacesetter into the far turn, was asked
for run leaving the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages, while clear for third. MADE THE TEAM stalked
the solid pace outside of rivals, lost ground three wide nearing the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch. TIZ A THRILL was allowed to settle, saved
ground into the second turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

PRINCE HUSSAR was hustled to show early speed, took command of the early lead and set solid fractions through the turn, was asked for run at the top of
the lane and drew away in the final furlong. CLASS PROOF broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, advanced on the turn to come within range of
the leader nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in mid-stretch and held for second. MY LITTLE TAYLOR settled off of the early pace, improved
position three then four wide on the turn, ran evenly through the stretch and was up in the final strides to get third. TOM'S MOON lacked early speed, saved
ground through the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, encountered a bit of traffic in the final sixteenth, offered a mild late rally and just missed for the minor
awards. DRUMADOON was forwardly placed while saving ground, lost ground on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch while still in contention and did not
produce a late rally. SPLIT ACES chased the early pace to the turn, dropped back midway through the bend and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
YODERANDO broke sharply and was hustled to be prominent early, ceded the early lead to the turn, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter
marker, took command into the drive, was headed by JERSEY BIRD in mid-stretch and dug in late to prevail. JERSEY BIRD tracked the early pace,
advanced on the turn to press the pace while three wide, headed YODERANDO nearing the furlong marker, battled with that rival into deep stretch, was
bested in the final strides and held on to secure the place. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE rated off of the early pace, advanced on the turn and lacked room
nearing the top of the stretch, angled out in upper stretch and finished well late, just missing for second. A ROUSING BABE was a bit slow into stride early
on, saved ground through the turn, lacked room nearing the top of the lane and did not mount a late rally. MIZZDYNA broke out at the start and was off a
step slowly, tracked the pace outside of rivals, could not match strides into upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. DANZING ROAD was sent to
contest the early pace, took the lead into the turn, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off the winner leaving the bend and gave way
in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TRIBAL NATION broke alertly and cleared the field into the first turn, set solid fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, extended the lead into
upper stretch and was kept to task through the final stages as much the best. MAGIC TIGER was a bit rank into the first turn, settled off of the pace through
the backstretch run, advanced on the second turn, was no match for the winner in the late stages but stayed on to be best of the rest. SAFE COMBINATION
tracked the solid pace through the backstretch run, could not keep pace with TRIBAL NATION on the second turn, yielded in the drive but was clear in the
end for third. DR. HOFFMAN was unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the second turn and did not produce a late rally. HARBOR SKY stalked
the early pace outside of rivals, maintained position through the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TEAM CONCEPT was asked for early speed and went to the early lead, set solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, was roused at
the top of the lane and held foes at bay through the late stages to prevail. ON VACATION settled off of the early pace, saved ground into the second turn,
advanced in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final furlong, while holding safely for place. BIG ROSIE stalked the solid pace, came two then three
wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and just held for third in the end. RIVIERA SUNRISE rated off of the early pace, advanced
on the second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch but re-rallied in the final stages while lacking the needed late response. DARK INTENT was bumped and
shuffled back at the start and was off slowly, settled off of the pace, came three wide along the second turn, swung widest into the drive and offered a mild
late bid. CHELINA lacked early speed, saved ground to the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
A MAN'S MAN broke alertly and was forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the solid fractions through the backstretch, was roused nearing the
quarter marker, overtook the pacesetter into upper stretch while in hand and was ridden out through the stretch run as much the best.
ROCKTILLYOUDROP settled off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, improved position two wide on the far turn, was not
match for the winner in the drive but kept on to be best of the rest. GOVENOR'S PARTY was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the second
turn, rallied in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong but stayed on to just get up for third. CLAIM OF PASSION stalked the pace from a ground
saving path, could not muster a late rally but passed tiring foes late to just miss for third. POUR ON THE COLE stalked the pace three wide on the first turn,
improved position along the backstretch run, continued that bid while two wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and gave way in the
final stages. LIL MIRACLE MAN was hustled leaving the break and was sent to the front, set decent fractions while prompted by A MAN'S MAN, was
overtaken by that foe nearing the quarter marker, stayed on to mid-stretch and tired late. OUR BOLD PRINCE tracked the decent pace from a four wide
path early on, gained ground three wide on the second turn, could not sustain that run in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. BUENISIMO tracked the
early pace from a ground saving position, was asked for run on the second turn while along the inside and did not have a late response. SACRED RIDER
lunged at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, maintained position through the backstretch,
came three to four wide along the far turn and was unable to produce a late rally.

Footnotes
PERSUASIVE LIPS was a bit slow into early stride, was roused leaving the three-furlong marker and gained ground nearing the top of the lane, swung
widest into the drive, continued a steady bid to mid-stretch, matched strides with ATLANTIC STRIKE to the final stages and made a late push to prevail.
ATLANTIC STRIKE tracked the early pace, improved position on the turn, continued that bid into upper stretch, matched strides with the winner to the final
yards but was outfinished late and was second best. SEGURO tracked the solid pace from mid-flight, came in tight and steadied briefly midway through the
turn, improved position in upper stretch, was outkicked by the top pair in the final furlong but made a late grinding rally to get up for third. BENGAL TIGER
broke out at the start, showed good early speed and set the quick and contested early pace, shook free of pressing rivals in upper stretch, came under
pressure inside of the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off the top pair and was just edged at the end for third. LOUD FUSAICHI raced close to the early
pace and pressed the quick fractions through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. PHANTOM INDIAN lost her path
leaving the break and was off a bit slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, came three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, was unable to make a late
impact but improved position late. GOING TO SHABOOMS chased the pace from toward the rear, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.
ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD broke alertly and showed early speed while disputing the quick pace, lost ground along the turn and weakened in the stretch
run. PERFECTLY JULIE tracked the quick pace from the inside, dropped back on the turn and tired in the stretch drive.
