Footnotes
J P CORNETTA settled off the pace inside, bid at the rail around the far turn, reached even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch,
dueled inside of POETIC CODE throughout the lane and prevailed. POETIC CODE settled off the early pace while racing two wide, bid three deep midway
around the far turn, took a narrow lead near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled outside of the winner from there to the wire and just missed. VOICE OF NOW
raced off the pace four wide around both turns and rallied for the show. KING D was bumped at the start, raced three and four wide and rallied belatedly.
EDEN PARADISE was bumped at the start, raced two wide and was no threat. FIRST TEAM broke awkwardly then steadied soon after the start, raced off
the pace two and three wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. NIPPON broke in and bumped at the start, chased the pace two
and three wide and faded in the lane. PAPA CHARLES was outrun inside. J T'S MY BOY played no factor while racing four and five wide. GO CRISTIAN
saved ground and failed to menace. ANYTHINGBUTSUBTLE chased the pace three wide and faltered around the far turn. CORPORATE AFFAIR set a fast
pace off the rail and stopped midway around the far turn.

near the quarter pole and held well enough to preserve the show. ELLIEREESEASTON failed to menace while racing four wide. THRILLING BABY played
no factor while racing two wide. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE prompted the pace from the rail and was through after a half. MONTANA JOYCE was outrun while
racing three wide. TRULY was outrun inside.

SOUPER DUPER READY set the pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. HURRY UP DEAR broke in and bumped CROOKLYN into SHES SKY
HIGH, raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and was inching closer through the lane. SHES SKY HIGH was bumped at the
start, saved ground off the early, went three wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. DISCO QUEEN went evenly while racing three and four wide.
CROOKLYN was bumped at the start then steadied soon after, raced off the pace four wide around the first turn, went in the two path around the far turn,
swung widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. PRETTY DEVIL prompted the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. KATNISS was up
close inside and faltered nearing the lane.

FULTON STREET set the pace along the rail, drew off under a drive and held well clear. KUHL STAR chased the pace three wide, was no match for the
winner but stayed on to preserve the place. SANDY DUDE was devoid of speed, raced five wide around the turn and rallied for the show. SIXTY ONE gave
distant chase two wide and lacked the needed rally. CONGRATS AGAIN was outrun inside. ONWARD AUSTIN pressed the winner two wide and retreated
through the lane. GRAN ANDREWS was in range inside and had no response. DOUBLE BLESSING stopped midway around the turn and was eased
through the lane.

LIVE IS LIFE pressed the pace two wide, drew off around the turn and just lasted. PEREGRINO G settled off the pace while racing four wide, closed
through the lane and just missed. BELTS 'N BROOKS veered out at the start and slammed into BROOKLYNS FINEST, set a pressured pace inside, could
not keep pace with the winner around the turn but churned on for the show. BROOKLYNS FINEST was slammed at the start, raced well back two wide,
angled four wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. CHACHARERO failed to menace while racing two wide. MAKE 'EM TAP was outrun while
racing three wide. SMOOTH RICO had brief speed inside. MR. AMERICAN chased the pace three wide and was through after a half.

and could only gain mildly in the stretch. EXCHANGE DAY steadied at the start, raced off the pace three wide, shifted widest in upper stretch and rallied
belatedly. LOYAL LOUIE went evenly while racing two wide. HOPE IN HIM set the pace in the two path and weakened in the lane. TRINNI SUMMER trailed

SEA ART raced well back outside, circled four wide around the turn, closed outside and was up and clear late. POIEMA set the pace along the rail and led
until deep stretch. ALLURAMORE advanced inside down the backstretch, appeared to hit the rail entering the turn, tracked inside around most of the turn,
tipped out nearing the lane and was one-paced between the top two finishers. OUR FANTASY tracked the pace two wide and weakened through the lane.
STARSHIP NUGGET failed to menace while racing two wide. CHASING HAPPINESS had brief speed three wide and was vanned off after the finish.
MORE GLORY reared at the start and was always outrun. ANNA'S DREAM had early speed but retreated inside around the turn.

Footnotes
NIGHT JUMPER was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced four wide around the far turn came widest into the lane, swept to the
front near the sixteenth pole and drew off under confident handling. K. C. CHIEF set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and held well for the
place. INVISIBLE WAR was in range four wide around both turns and lacked the needed stretch kick. VALIANT AVENGER chased the pace two wide and
was one-paced through the lane. HONESTO was bumped between foes early, steadied entering the first turn, raced off the pace three wide, steadied near
the quarter pole, angled to the rail entering the stretch and had no rally. CAXAMBAS CANDY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. GRANNY
MAKES CENTS prompted the pace two wide between foes and tired in the lane. SUN VIKING was bumped early, stalked the pace three wide between foes
and came up empty in the lane. RUSSIAN TO WIN had only brief speed inside.
