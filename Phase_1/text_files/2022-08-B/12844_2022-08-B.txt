Footnotes
VERIFYING broke in then went to the front, showed the way off the rail with some company to both sides, traveled around the turn in the two path, came
under increased threat when TRACK MATE was hustled closer nearing the five-sixteenths, leaned in on that foe while confidently ridden into upper stretch,
was roused outside the furlong marker, disposed of the runner-up in the final sixteenth and put his ears up while moving clear late with something left.
TRACK MATE was hustled from the start, pressed the pace under urging while at the hindquarters of the leader, was asked to move forward along the rail
at the three-eighths, squeezed through inside of the winner to turn up the pressure coming to the five-sixteenths, brushed with that foe into upper stretch,
fought on well while dueling into the final sixteenth but was outfinished late while clear for the place in a good effort. DIDINGER pressed the pace on the
outside then in the three path around the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, dropped back outside the quarter-pole, chased the top two while
remaining on his inside lead to the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. KING'S
GLORY chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. GAME WARDEN settled towards the
rear, bumped with a rival outside the half-mile pole, bumped again with that foe into the turn, saved ground while roused on that bend and came up empty.
STANDARD OF PROOF was urged along on the outside, bumped hard with a foe leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, dropped to
the two path into upper stretch and failed to rally. NARCISO DALI was awkwardly and slow into stride, raced at the rear while hard ridden, bumped with a
foe outside the half-mile pole, bumped hard with a rival while also bumping with another foe in the two path leaving the backstretch, shifted four wide at the
three-eighths then five wide shortly thereafter and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
FUNTASTIC AGAIN a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, bobbled at the break getting away last, made a three wide sweep to the front with seven furlongs
to go and tucked to show the way from the two path down the backstretch settling in hand, had TRIPLE START advance inside to get on near even terms
half a mile from home and got let out a notch in response shaking off that rival into the far turn and tucking to be along the inside midway on the bend,
remained patiently handled and had TRIPLE START advance once more to latch on at the quarter pole and came under coaxing spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch, shook off his main rival with three-sixteenths to go roused to a drive and drew off under a drive getting geared down in the late stages.
TRIPLE START chased along the inside, came under light coaxing at the nine-sixteenths and advanced to get on near even terms half a mile from home
before being shaken off by the top one, tipped to the two path near the three-eighths marker as the leader took closer order to the rail and got placed to
more vigorous coaxing to offer up a second bid latching on FUNTASTIC AGAIN when spinning three wide into upper stretch, got repelled at the
three-sixteenths proving no match for that rival and ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. READ ON three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home and tired while along for the show honors. SCAT TU TAP broke in
brushing the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside growing detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the half mile pole improving
position midway on the turn, continued along the inside into upper stretch and tired. AMERICA'S GUEST just off the inside through the first turn, chased four
paths off the inside down the backstretch coming under coaxing half a mile from home, made no headway and was not persevered with from the
three-eighths pole, went five wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the wire.

the turn, moved clear at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch, was pulled in by the rider to get him to the proper lead inside the three-sixteenths
and drew away under strong urging. G MUNNING showed speed between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, lost touch with the winner under urging
at the five-sixteenths and proved no match while able to hold the place. GREAT WORKOUT broke out at the start, was urged along while well back on the
outside, moved from three to five wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved position for the show. ON THE HILL showed
speed on the inside of several rivals then chased the pace, moved out at the nine-sixteenths then bumped with a foe, went four wide under strong urging
around the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and lacked the needed response. COLLOQUY was bumped just after the start, angled in at the
rear near the three-quarter pole, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. MR. KRINGLE settled well back in
the field, raced between foes in the two path leaving the backstretch and early on the turn, remained in the two path into the stretch and was no factor.
BOLD JOURNEY broke in at the start then was hustled, showed speed between horses then inside of multiple foes, was allowed to drop back along the rail
at the three-eighths, moved out four wide around the five-sixteenths and faltered. TOMMY THE TORCH showed speed between foes then chased the pace,
was forced out late on the backstretch then bumped, dropped from the five path to the three path on the turn and also faltered. COLORMEPAZZI was

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) established the front shortly after the start and showed the way rated in hand three then two wide through the first turn and
just off the inside down the backstretch through sensible splits under attendance from OUR FLASH DRIVE to the outside but facing little pressure save
through her presence, remained patiently handled as her four rivals got busy in behind her with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and was roused for the drive straightened away, edged clear under a drive getting shown the crop to the right side and drifted out four paths through
to the finish under late threat, held safe to prevail. FLUFFY SOCKS lunged at the break getting away last and conceding only two lengths to the front, settled
along the inside through the first turn before tipping two to three wide down the backstretch unhurried at the tail of the field, came under coaxing just off the
inside with five-sixteenths to go, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong issuing a challenge to threaten for it all inside the
final sixteenth but was ultimately rebuffed at the end while well clear of the rest for the place honors. HIGH OPINION along the inside through the first turn
under reserve, tracked the front just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go and came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LEMISTA (IRE) led briefly just after the start before easing off as
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS took over, went just off the inside through the first turn before chasing three wide under reserve until put to coaxing with
five-sixteenths remaining, angled four to five wide at the top of the stretch and offered no kick. OUR FLASH DRIVE forwardly placed three wide through the
opening bend, attended the leader in hand to the outside three wide coming under urging at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide at the head of the stretch
in the midst of being shaken off and weakened to the finish.

CODY'S WISH was fractious in the gate, settled nicely towards the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths,
swung seven wide at the quarter-pole, rallied outside under a left-handed crop in upper stretch and closed strongly to get up late. JACKIE'S WARRIOR lost
his footing ever so slightly at the break but came away towards the front, disputed the pace on the inside of PIPELINE, vied in the three path while still inside
that foe around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under increasing encouragement, battled under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong then shook
clear shortly thereafter, was put to a right-handed crop under threat from the winner just inside the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken while clear for the
place. PIPELINE came away well, disputed the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, was carried five wide into the stretch under
pressure, battled outside of the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong then weakened but was well clear for the show. BABY YODA settled just off the
pace on the inside, was asked midway through the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. DRAFTED settled at the rear, saved
ground around the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path then moved out a bit more and failed to threaten.
THREE TWO ZONE settled just off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch under
a drive and capitulated. KNEEDEEPINSNOW was coaxed along while tracking the pace on the outside, came under stronger encouragement around the
nine-sixteenths, dropped back four wide under strong urging on the turn and had nothing left. PER HISA RULING, DRAFTED WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIFTH AND MADE UNPLACED

Footnotes
NOBLE EMOTION was restless in the gate, came away in good order, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, was eased back nearing the
seven-sixteenths, drafted along the hedge around the turn, moved out adeptly behind the leaders while asked into upper stretch, rallied outside under a
right-handed crop and closed well to get up in the final strides. COMEDY TOWN tracked the leading duo on the outside, came under coaxing in the three
path around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, took the lead into upper stretch, was given pop of a right-handed crop at the furlong marker,
switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, led to the final strides but was denied while clear for the place. CAZADERO was off slow and
spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside
in the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner the show. RANGER FOX disputed the pace on the on the outside, moved clear at the
seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked while being headed once straightened for the drive, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. BATTLE STATION was hustled from the start then urged along on the outside, chased four wide around the turn, dropped back under a drive
into the final furlong and tired. DISCREET TUNE was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused for his best in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. CHARMED (GB) was restless in the gate, settled off the pace, was roused two then three wide on the turn, came
four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to rally. OLD CHESTNUT was restless in the gate, angled in towards the rear early, went around
the turn in the two path, was roused near the five-sixteenths and was no factor.

Footnotes
JACK CHRISTOPHER led briefly just after the start before conceding the front to CONAGHER settling three wide in closest aim of that rival, advanced on
the leader into the turn and was floated out four wide three furlongs from home latched on to the outside, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole
taking over narrow command at that station, swung four wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive and held safe kept to task. GUNITE bobbled at
the break, chased four to five paths off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four to five wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick cutting into the winner's margin while clear for the place honors. RUNNINSONOFAGUN got bumped between foes who
each broke his way at the start and got away last, advanced along the inside under light coaxing to be forwardly placed just off the top pair, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch moving into prominence straightened away for home, dug in under a drive running on
willingly through to the finish to be along clear for the show honors. CONAGHER broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe in tandem with
ACTUATOR, ranged up after the start to take over command just inside six and a half furlongs to run and showed the way in hand along the inside through
swift splits, had JACK CHRISTOPHER advance outside and floated two then three wide carrying that rival four wide near the three-eighths marker put to
coaxing, swung three wide into upper stretch yielding the front right at the quarter pole, then weakened in the final furlong. ACCRETIVE five wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered no response. HAPPY JACK three wide in pursuit, came under
prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TOTALIZER two to three wide in pursuit, came
under a long drive from the half mile pole, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. ACTUATOR broke in at the start
bumping RUNNINSONOFAGUN in concert with CONAGHER, who broke outwards, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went
three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MALATHAAT was hustled from the gate, angled in nearing the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, settled into a comfortable stride down the
backstretch, was coaxed along passing the half-mile pole, tracked the leader while inside on the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, chased
outside under a left-handed crop, drifted in while gaining coming to the sixteenth-pole and got up under good handling. SEARCH RESULTS stalked the
pace on the outside in the three path, was given her cue with three furlongs to run, took the advantage in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop
outside the furlong marker, led to the sixteenth-pole then was caught while clear for the place. LETRUSKA went to the front, showed the way in the two
path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the runner-up under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was
outfinished while well clear for the show. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL went four wide around the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under urging leaving the
backstretch, went two to three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. CLAIRIERE became very fractious in the gate and hit the front of the stall door
twice, had the right shoulder of the assistant starter contact the head of the jockey leaving the gate, angled to the rail early, dropped well behind while
sluggish on the inside, lagged at the rear under some coaxing, saved ground under stronger encouragement around the final turn, was put to the crop
outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GUFO settled just off the inside near the rear of the field tucking to the inside past the stands for the first time, saved ground through the second turn, tipped
to the two path five furlongs from home, came under coaxing tipping three then four wide at the five-sixteenths getting position on BROOME and floating
that rival out without making any contact but by just taking the right angle, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close stoutly outside
collaring the leader seventy yards from home and dug in to prevail at the end. MIRA MISSION tracked the front two to three wide from just off the pace,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three then two wide into upper stretch rallying to take command just inside the three-sixteenths marker,
edged clear under a drive a furlong from home, dug in under threat and was caught with seventy yards to the finish, ran on to safely secure the place honors
on the wire. SOLDIER RISING (GB) settled unhurried just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under a drive at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and closed well outside to secure the show honors in the final jumps. BROOME (IRE) broke a half a beat slow and bobbled at the start getting
away last, came under brief coaxing and settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths three wide and was
floated four then five wide by GUFO who got position along his inside and got the lane without need of making contact, swung seven wide into upper stretch
and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. CROSS BORDER saved ground near the rear of the field, got steadied briefly off the heels of GUFO past
the finish line the initial time, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, dug in under a drive improving position to the wire while outkicked by the top
quartet. TRIBHUVAN (FR) established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside uncontested through sensible splits, got given a notch to work
with at the seven-sixteenths and slipped away through the final turn briefly before coming under threat when set down taking the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in and was collared just inside the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the final furlong. COLD HARD CASH tracked the leader along the inside
from the pocket, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. ADHAMO (IRE) tracked the
pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing tipped to the two path at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and weakened to the finish. CHANNEL MAKER forwardly placed in the two path in closest aim of the leader, got called upon with five-sixteenths to
run, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
EPICENTER tucked in behind the early pacesetters passing the wire for the first time, was well placed while rated in the two path, came under urging
around the three-eighths, gained to make an outside bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear while shaken up in
upper stretch, drew away while kept to the task under a hand-ride into the final sixteenth and proved much the best. CYBERKNIFE was carried in at the
start then coaxed to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path, moved clear with seven-sixteenths to run, was challenged by the winner at the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match but just held the place.
ZANDON angled in towards the rear early, went four wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped from three to two wide on the far turn, was
roused while moving to the rail coming to the quarter-pole, came off the inside while put to a drive in upper stretch and just missed the place while narrowly
able to get the show. RICH STRIKE broke in at the start, settled on the inside, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, saved ground under strong
urging on the far turn, shifted three to four wide into the stretch and just missed the trifecta while clear for the last spot in the superfecta. GILDED AGE broke
a step slow, dropped well behind early, lagged at the rear while inside to the two path on the turns, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
ARTORIUS settled into stride early, rounded the first turn in the three path, traveled outside down the backstretch, was urged three wide early on the far
turn, shifted five wide around the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to respond. AIN'T LIFE GRAND was hustled from the
gate, prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, dropped back leaving the backstretch, fell further back in the three path around the final turn and
tired. EARLY VOTING went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back four wide around the far turn and faltered then was
eased but walked off.

FEATHERS ROAD struck the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, offered up a mild kick to close in tandem with a pair and was just up in the final strides to score. KREESA chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide for home, closed well in concert
with a pair on the once clear leader and just missed at the end. EMPIRE SKY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to
six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside a pair to engulf the once clear leader in the last jumps to the finish and just missed on the line. FUOCO
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, slipped away through the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch let out for the
drive, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole dug in under threat from a trio growing leg weary a sixteenth from home and was nailed in the last strides
by all three and forced to settle for the last major share. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF hustled from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, made headway with a mild bid to the finish on a weary leader but was outkicked. HEYMACKIT'SJACK
two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response while appearing to make
ground on a weary front. STEERAGE bumped at the start by SIR JOHN who broke outwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SIR JOHN broke out at the start bumping STEERAGE, chased four wide until

Footnotes
WICKED GROOVE bumped with a rival early, raced between horses in the two path around the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging while
two then three wide on the far turn, rallied in upper stretch, closed well to get the lead into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. PARNAC (FR)
was rated while saving ground, moved off the rail outside the quarter-pole, was asked in the three path into the stretch, chased into the final sixteenth,
gained on the winner late and finished willingly to just get the place. MISS TAPIRADO was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace in the two path under
tight restraint, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, lugged inward into upper stretch, remained on her inside lead while still in front to near the sixteenth-pole
then was overtaken and just lost the place while clear for the show. INVINCIBLE GAL (GB) broke out and hit the gate, saved ground around the first turn,
was reserved towards the back, bumped with an opponent near the half-mile pole, raced inside on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then moved
off rail under a drive in upper stretch and improved to get the last spot in the superfecta. JOIN THE DOTS bumped with foes on both sides early, was caught
four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
RHOMBIQUE angled in nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was reserved off the pace, bumped with foes near the half-mile pole,
started the far turn in the two path, moved three then four wide later on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SALIMAH (IRE)
bumped with a foe early then became keen under restraint, went three wide around the opening bend, was reserved on the outside, bumped with a rival
near the half-mile pole, moved from three to five wide on the far turn, dropped inward in upper stretch, drifted in late and failed to rally. RUNAWAY
ROCKETTE moved out down the initial straightaway, traveled three wide around the first turn, stalked outside under a tight hold, moved up to make a bid in
the three path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty. A LITTLE FAITH was sent hard then angled in while going to the front,
set the pace on the inside with company to her outside, lost the advantage under pressure at the five-sixteenths and faded.
