MIDNIGHT TROUBLE was rated under a firm hold down the backstretch while racing to the inside of Wildhunch, dug in past the eighth pole while continuing
to the inside of rival, raced well off the inside through the stretch run and prevailed late under all out pressure. WILDHUNCH showed good early speed while
racing off the inside down the backstretch, continued to race well off the inside in the drive and finished gamely to just miss. MOTIVATING stalked the pace
from the outside down the backstretch, raced towards the outside into the upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair. MY LAST HOPE stalked the
early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and lacked a bid. CESAR was allowed to settle early on, ridden along near the three eighths pole and
lacked a rally.

THREE COINS settled off the early pace, made an advance towards the leaders through the far turn, raced from the outside while racing six wide near the
three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under strong handling. CULDEE was unhurried early on, made a quick move near the five sixteenths pole,
raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. EVER SUMMER stalked the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide in the
stretch run and kept on to the wire. MARTINI'S AMICA stalked the top pair early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted five to six wide in the
drive and flattened out. DETERMINED CHARM tracked the early leader from the outside while racing in hand, ridden along through the far turn and
weakened the final furlong. KAZACHAN raced off the early pace, was five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. PRINCESS VOODOO showed
good early speed from the inside to set the early pace and gave way the final quarter of a mile.

CYBERVIKING , found very nice three wide stalking position into turn, sent to the attack midway around the turn, drew even with leader entering the stretch,
locked in a tussle through the lane, went clear under a steady drive. WHERE PARADISE LAY tracked the leader into turn, from the two path took control at
the quarter pole, felt pressure from the outside entering the stretch, dug in gamely inside rival, stayed on well, conceded to winner late. NO SABE NADA
stalked the leaders into the turn, inside position around the turn, felt heavy pressure from the outside midway on the turn, could not quicken with top pair,
raced on the wrong lead through the stretch, clear third under wire. FAST BOB lacked speed after start, raced off the pace into turn, called on after leaving
the quarter pole, passed weary foe late. THE KING CHEEK showed good early foot, raced along the inside entering the turn, came under heavy outside
pressure leaving the three eighths pole, faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
MOSALAH was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up around the far turn, raced six to seven wide through the upper stretch to circle the field,
shifted in a bit through the drive and proved best under strong handling. SOLEADA raced off the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn, made
a good rail bid through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. VODKATINI showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside, dug in near
the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly late. POUNDING MUSIC stalked the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled four wide in the
drive and kept on willingly to the wire. DOWNTOWN KATIE was unhurried early on, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch, shifted in, was blocked
near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. KILLY START stalked the pace, raced from the outside around the far turn through the stretch run and had no
final winning bid. CASTILLEJA stalked the pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened. GOGO CHANEL settled to the middle of the
pack early on, raced in traffic, checked sharply near the three sixteenths while racing four wide and no response thereafter. PAYNT BY NUMBER tracked
the early leader down the backstretch and weakened through the stretch run while racing three to four wide. PRACTICALLY THERE was unhurried early to
race at the back of the pack early, raced along the inside through the far turn into the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
MAPACHE G tracked the duel around the first turn, raced off the pace down the back stretch, moved inside while passing rivals at the three eighths pole,
shifted out four wide while moving past the leaders, cleared off at the top of the stretch, came home under a steady hand ride. ROCKY DICE stalked along
the inside, found clear racing room down the backside, moved inside far turn, followed the leaders every move, could not stay with the winner, steadily
gained ground through the stretch, up late for the place money. I AM IT had the inside position while dueling down the backside, raced along the rail around
the far turn, briefly took the top spot, came under outside pressure nearing the quarter pole, could not stay with winner, fought on hard through the stretch,
yielding the place late. SUPER NECESSARY slow to begin, raced well off the pace, coaxed into action entering the far turn, moved inside at the quarter
pole, passed leg weary foes, raced even through the wire. MIDNIGHT TRICK slow away from the gate, could not make any headway down the backside,
outrun through the stretch. KING FORCE raced between rivals early on, stayed between foes entering the far turn, came under a drive at the quarter pole,
steadily faded through the lane. KENTUCKY KNIGHT coaxed along around the first turn, raced middle pack backside, outrun. RUN HAPPY STAR tracked
the leaders around the first turn, urged on backside, lost contact with field, outrun.
