Footnotes
RISKY WHISKY tracked the embattled duo up the backstretch, given cue along the rail leaving the turn, roused forward to take command in the upper
stretch, edged away and held clear. LUCKYHOTSTUFF dueled outside of TROUBLE IN RED in opening stages raced in striking distance around the turn,
sustained a three wide bid through the lane and finished clearly second best. TROUBLE IN RED dueled inside of LUCKYHOTSTUFF up the backstretch
and held a slim lead around the turn, drifted two to three wide entering the lane, got collared by rail running RISKY WHISKEY in the upper stretch,
weakened and held show. CAN'T MAKE ME was off a step slow at the start, raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
RAINBOW DASH raced in the last flight, was ridden along four wide into the lane and never threatened.

the lead from MISS ALPHA BETA and edged away. MISS ALPHA BELLA led the way around the first turn, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch and
held clear around the far turn, fought back briefly when confronted by the winner in the final furlong then failed to contain rival late. LIL DITTY'S KITTY rated

MYSTERY MAN set a pressured pace up the backstretch and held a slim lead around the turn, widened advantage in the upper stretch and kept to task
under steady urging. BROADWAY PETE applied pace pressure to MYSTERY MAN in opening stages and continued to force the issue around the turn,
hustled along two wide turning for home, chased the winner through the lane and held place. ALEX'S STRIKE raced off the pace and saved ground, shifted
out late on the turn, coaxed four wide into the lane, gathered momentum under a drive and edged closer in final stages. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER tracked
the clear top pair into the turn, hustled along three wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. NEWS BOX raced off the early pace, chased three to
four wide into the lane and never threatened.

MY GOLDEN DAY was well rated in early stages and raced three to four wide around the turn, was ridden along five wide entering the lane, raced in striking
distance a furlong out, dug in determinedly and kicked clear. SHEMEANSBIZNESS was was well placed tracking the leader around the turn, hustled along
four wide into the lane, raced near the lead at the eighth pole then got outkicked by the winner. SAMIRA was forwardly placed in opening stages then
flattened a bit midway around the turn, launched a two wide rebid in the upper stretch and ran on for a share. DEMIDANU raced off the early pace, coaxed
three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GIRLS IN CHARGE hustled up to the lead at the start, set the pace and held firm around the turn,
came three wide into the lane, got collared leaving the furlong marker and weakened. SABRIA raced midpack and saved ground around the turn, cut the
corner entering the lane, briefly edged closer then gave way. SHELBY TO lacked speed and raced in the back, came two wide into the lane and never
threatened.

Footnotes
CHICAGO CHROME quickly cleared out of the gate and crossed over to the inside, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch and held clear around the
turn, stayed sharp under steady pressure and finished well clear. CYCLONE MESA hustled along in pursuit of the leader around the turn, sustained a two
wide bid for CHICAGO CHROME through the lane and finished second best. BRASSY FIRE got bumped at the start and raced off the early pace, hustled
along three wide into the lane and gained show. ARBUCKLE OUTLAW lacked early speed, saved ground into the lane and improved position. WAR
REPORTER got carried out by outside rival at the start and raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the lane and had a mild improve. OH
LITTLE BRUTHA raced midpack into the turn, coaxed two wide into the lane and gave way. WIN IN THE CITY raced midpack along the inside and faded in
the lane. WORTHTHEMONEY raced off the pace, came five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. FIFTY TWO PICKUP raced in early contention then
came up empty late on the turn, reported to have bled during racing and vanned off.
