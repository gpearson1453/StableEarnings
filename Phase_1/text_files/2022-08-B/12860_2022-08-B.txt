Footnotes
GO VAIDAGIRL tracked leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid three wide at the top of the lane, responded to
urging and surged in the final yards to nail leader. TIERNA away well and sent clear, continued clear to the final sixteenth, started to get tired late and nailed
at the wire in a tough loss. THISONESFORBARRY hopped and came away slow, advanced on the backstretch two wide, entered turn two wide and
continued to advance along the rail, entered stretch in the two path and outclosed by outside rival while improving. WINDANSEA away ok and chased
leader along the inside, continued near the rail on the turn, in range in the two path entering the stretch and weakened under pressure approaching the final
sixteenth. GODDESS APHRODITE saved ground throughout and showed mild gain along the rail in the stretch. FOR MY BROTHER ducked out three lanes
at the start, settled into stride stalking the pace three wide, continued three wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN N. BARRON led a contested pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to hold the rail on the turn, responded to urging and opened up
in upper stretch and drew off. WHATWASITHINKING assistant starter was late to let go and horses head went up in air causing WHATWASITHINKING to
come away slow, recovered to stalk trio two wide on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and swung into the four path in the lane, responded to
urging to be a clear second. RAYRAY pressed pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, proved no match for top two and
drifted in two paths in final sixteenth while managing to save show. BAM BAM AGAIN away ok, stalked trio of leaders along the rail on the backstretch,
continued along the rail on the turn, appeared to have run and lacked room in upper stretch, found room briefly and began to advance only to have to steady
again late in the stretch. CHIEF EAGLE EYE away cleanly, pressed leader in between rivals, continued two wide on the turn and steadily weakened in the
lane.
