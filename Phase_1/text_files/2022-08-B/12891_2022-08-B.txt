Footnotes
DOODLE DANDY was well back, gained ground on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch drew clear. PURE ELEGANCE tracked the
early leaders and was a factor on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. PRINCESS MORO was off the
pace and roused on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. REIGN BY REIN forced the early pace and dueled on the far
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. COCOTARA set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but came up
empty.

AWESOME MINER set the pace, took command on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. TORPEDO MAX was
hustled early, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch held place. FREE SPEECH was in range and raced evenly on the turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. SILENCE BREAKERS was off slow, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the
stretch. STRIBLING was in touch and roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no response. GLITTER MOUNTAIN was off
the pace, drifted out on the turn and had no impact.

ARTIE MY BOY stalked the early leaders, had a slim lead on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch proved best. THY KINGDOM was in
range, roused on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. READY AT DAWN showed speed from the inside, dueled on
the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. VERRAZANO LEGACY was in touch and saved ground on the turn but was no real
threat. ABSTEMIOUS was away alertly and had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch weakened. HEY MICKEY was off
the pace, showed little and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BLIND TRUST was off slow, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. THELONIOUS was unhurried early,
gained ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was second best. PARTY OF NO was hustled early and roused from between
foes on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. INVISIBLE FRIEND tracked the leaders from the outside and was a factor on
the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch faded. RAYO COLORADO was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but was not a factor. WILD
RIVER WOLF was away alertly but chased on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was empty. STRONG ATTITUDE settled off the
pace and showed little in a dull effort.

QUIET WYATT was hustled early, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. JAMAICAN JIMMY
was away alertly and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. DOCTOR WU was in mid pack, had a
good position on the turn and was up for show. M C JACKHAMMER set a pressured pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. SPIRAL STORM was well back, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. ARTIE'S ALL IN was off slow and
saved ground on the turn but had no impact. WE WANT ACTION was off the pace, chased on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch
failed to fire.

GIMBALA showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. FRERET
tracked the early leaders from the inside, a factor on the turn and was clearly second best. HIGH SOCIETY GIRL stalked the early leader and raced evenly
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SILENT GUROO was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch had no response.

Footnotes
JACK BEANSTALK was away alertly, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK
stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. DILETTANTE was in touch
and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. DE ONLY SOLUTION was hustled early and roused on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch had no kick. GOLD VENTURE showed no speed and had a mild gain on the turn but from the eight path at the top
of the stretch was no threat. FAFA FOOEY was in mid pack and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact.
PERLARANA was well back, showed nothing and was outrun.
