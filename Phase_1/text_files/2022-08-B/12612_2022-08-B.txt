in the stretch and finished well. WHAT'S MY CATEGORY Broke slow, two path on the turn and failed to threaten. TAPIT HAPPY JOHN Broke sluggishly,
four wide on the turn and finished wide. BODE O Broke slow, two path on the turn, was not a factor. VICTORY BUILT Tracked four wide into the turn, three
path around it and tired. BIJEMINI SLEW Broke slow, saved ground, was outrun. PRODUCTION CREDIT Stumbled at the start, four wide on the turn and
