pace and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. CRUMLIN JET was in touch, had a mild gain on the turn
and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. HALTON had no speed and was hustled along on the turn but was no real threat. WICKED
LITTLE GIRL was well back and showed little in a dull effort. LAPIDARY was in range and raced evenly on the turn but weakened.

SHANGHAI KIMMY set a pressured pace, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. MISS TEA BLONDE was
unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch rallied late. MARTINI SUE was off the pace, roused on the turn and
from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. MISS SURPRISE showed speed from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch flattened out. J M R BOLD VISION was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but was not a factor. ROSIEJEWEL DANCER
was away alertly and hustled along on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch faded. SUBZERO PLUS had no speed, chased on the turn
and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no factor.

BLACK SUN stumbled at the start, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up in time. GUS'S GAMBLE was away alertly
and had the lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was caught late. LETS SAY THIS tracked the early leader and was a factor on
the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. HIGH RESERVE was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was never a
threat. RUSHING RIVER was off slow and showed little while outrun. SHOOT FORTHE MONEY was off slow and showed nothing in a dull effort.
