ROAD TO DREAMS closest in pursuit of the loose pacesetter, bid into the stretch and drew away through the final eighth. MY TRUE PASSION quickly took
control, widened easily on the turn but shortened stride. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE chased wide throughout and easily gained the show award. HAWAIIAN
TALENT dropped far behind inside then passed a stopping rival. STORMIN' ELVIS flashed speed in the opening quarter then gave way. DANA'S BIG DAY
injured herself in the starting gate and was ordered a late scratch.

Footnotes
LITTLE HARBOUR was well placed behind the dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch, wore down the pacesetters and was up late. SNEAKINESS dueled
outside to midstretch, led narrowly then was nailed nearing the wire. TIO WIL saved ground off the pace then then made a gradual gain in the stretch. FLAT
LUCKY trailed for half a mile then split foes rallying too late. FOX RED battled along the inside then weakened slightly in the stretch. JUMP SHOT dropped
back racing wide throughout and lacked a solid bid. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch then faded on the turn.
FRAN'S WORRIER chased under urging off the pace racing wide and stopped.

Footnotes
E T'S SUPER STAR settled three wide behind the dueling leaders, offered a late surge to get up in time. BIRCHMOUNT RD prompted the pacesetter
outside, led into the stretch, pulled clear but was caught nearing the wire. THE METHOD lacked speed outside then finished well through the stretch. WILL
TAKE CONTROL dropped far behind, raced wide throughout with some late energy. WARRANT OFFICER lagged far behind then passed rivals without
menacing. JUST A THOUGHT saved ground throughout, bid closer in midstretch then faded. BUFFALO SHUFFLE rushed to the front inside, lost the
advantage into the lane then faded. RAVEN ROCKS well placed outside the dueling pacesetters then proved empty. BIZZY GILLESPIE dropped back early
and trailed throughout.
