Footnotes
GYPSY LYNN sped to a clear early lead while three wide, dropped down a path and was nursed along around the turn, responded when set down leaving
the three sixteenths, kicked away past the furlong grounds and proved best under left handed asking. BIG JOLT , forwardly placed, secured the rail leaving
the three eighths, crept closer past the quarter pole, steadied when trying to work through a tight seam along the rail in upper stretch, altered out for the final
furlong and kept on with good energy. TAP ME A TEXT , five wide early, stalked four wide leaving the three eighths, was under pressure pursuing into the
lane, stayed on her left lead and faded. SHEMAKESCENTS popped the gate pre race, stalked the winner four wide heading to the turn, was under a hearty
ride chasing three wide into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SWEET HEIDELBERG , forced in a bit at the break, swung eight wide for the drive
and offered a mild kick. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ , bumped at the break, raced well back early on, was sent up between runners mid turn, angled in through
the drive and had belated interest. R SILVER FLASH bumped with WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ at the break, edged up soon after and raced in range past the
half mile pole, was taken to rate a bit nearing the turn, angled four wide mid turn then faded in the drive. DREAMER GIRL lunged at the break, lost ground
five wide around the turn and failed to menace. WIKI WAHINE was sent up between runners early, forced the pace three to four wide and faltered. ROSES
N GOLD drifted in a few paths at the break, saved ground around the turn and was outrun. KEEPURSELF ALIVE was steadied when put in tight at the
break, raced well back then angled wide for the drive. An objection by the rider of BIG JOLT against the winner for alleged interference in upper stretch was
not allowed

Footnotes
ITALIANO tracked a contested early pace, moved up and bid five deep leaving the far turn, battled outside rivals around the turn, gained a slim advantage
inside the three sixteenths, kept on under right handed asking and proved resolute. SELF TAUGHT rated in range of the early three pronged pace scrum,
was sent up and bid four wide between foes past the three eighths, dueled between rivals from mid turn to deep stretch and kept on valiantly inside the
winner. TIZHOTNDUSTY attended the pace inside a pair of rivals early, eased back a bit then rebid along the rail near the three eighths, dueled on near
even terms inside a trio of runners approaching the stretch, remained a solid presence past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly.
HEARTFULLOFSTARS drafted back off the contested early pace, was under pressure four wide into the lane and offered a slight kick. CLEM LABINE
lagged well back as the pace dispute went on up front, came five wide for the drive but failed to muster up a serious run. ALL EYES WEST disputed the
early pace three deep and held a slim advantage three furlongs out, was surrounded around the turn, battled on under a strong ride past the quarter pole
and into the lane then faded. PRIANO sparred early between runners, stopped near the five sixteenths, was eased up in upper stretch then walked off.

FOR A LAUGH (IRE) , fanned four wide into the first turn, edged up under rating while off the rail past the five eighths, worked between runners leaving the
quarter pole, eased out and moved to engage GLENDALE from his outside in mid stretch, got the better of that one inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear
under a drive. GLENDALE prompted the pace, moved to engage from the outside of the leader leaving the far turn, dueled into the lane, gained a brief
advantage between runners heading to mid stretch then stayed on gamely. VALIANCER , bumped and pinched back at the break, altered out five wide
nearing the first turn, recovered and moved up three deep past the half, advanced between runners nearing the lane, angled out and closed willingly.
HORACE MANN saved ground stalking, eased out for the drive but lacked a solid punch. MY PARTNER GLEN drifted in at the break, settled off the pace,
saved ground into the lane, eased out and had a mild response. CORAZON DE LUCIA saved ground early, moved out and raced between rivals past the
half but came up empty. GIACOMETTI , rank and steadying along when pulling his way forward early, was taken four wide near the five eighths, chased and
faded. POST FACTO , bumped at the break, edged forward then steadied along into the first turn, moved up wide nearing the half, wandered very wide
while not keeping pace past the quarter pole and faded. RICH GOLD broke slowly and was not a factor. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) drifted in at the break,
corrected and clear, set the pace towards the rail, was joined leaving the far turn, battled into the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then weakened.

into the lane, closed in under solid handling, collared DISC JOCKEY from his outside near the sixteenth pole, kept on doggedly and got up. DISC JOCKEY
tracked the leader four wide and outside a rival, moved to engage past the three eighths, wrested command nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear soon into
the lane, wandered outward a bit then corrected, dug in when confronted with a sixteenth to go, drifted out while dueling, kept on gamely but just wasn't
quite good enough. BIG BUZZ , two to three wide early, moved closer from between runners nearing the far turn, pursued inside foes nearing the lane then
churned on to gran the show in the final yards. PROVERB , four wide early, raced three deep mid way through the backstretch run, was hustled along
between runners leaving the far turn, angled out a bit wider for the drive but lacked a serious finish. COLONEL BOWMAN broke near the top despite a
bobble, cleared early and set the pace two wide, was joined leaving the far turn, stayed on to upper stretch then gave way through the final furlong. PEACE
OF EKATI prompted the pace three wide, was hustled along leaving the far turn, failed to keep up heading to the stretch and gave way. STAY GOLDEN ,
fractious in the gate, raced forwardly while four deep into the first turn, stalked in the five path through the backstretch, failed to kick on past the three
eighths and faltered.

wide and to the inside of the winner while holding the early advantage, was headed near the quarter pole, fought on past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. SPEIGHT AND MALICE , towards the inside stalking the pace, eased out under pressure into the lane but failed to follow through late.

Footnotes
KING CAUSE rated in range while about three wide, took closer order leaving the half mile marker, came under pressure pursuing past the five sixteenths,
shifted out a bit wider into the lane, rallied to poke a head in front in mid stretch, drifted out some while clear inside the sixteenth pole then prevailed under a
drive. LURE HIM IN settled in the clear into the backstretch, moved up leaving the far turn, worked his way between runners nearing the lane, came out for
the final furlong and closed gamely between rivals. RIP CITY hopped at the break, regrouped and settled off the rail, edged up four wide outside foes
nearing the lane, shifted out and kept on with effort to bridge the gap. STORM THE COURT stalked the pace off the rail, moved to engage the leader
leaving the far turn, pressed, took over into the lane, ceded the lead a furlong out, stayed on willingly a sixteenth further then faded. FLASHIEST , unhurried
early, edged up between foes into the far turn, angled well wide in upper stretch but lacked a serious punch. KENTUCKY PHAROAH saved ground, raced in
range leaving the far turn, eased out for the drive and gave way. TAISHAN saved ground, angled out in mid stretch and faded. ELECTOR took over early
and spurted away a bit near the three quarter pole, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure near the five sixteenths, remained a presence to upper
stretch then succumbed. SURFING STAR failed to menace.

handed nearing the eighth pole, switched over to her correct lead soon after and cruised home as much the best. MONIQUE broke awkwardly, recovered
and rated towards the inside, swung six wide for the drive and finished well outside rivals to gain the place. ELECTRIC GLIDE , bumped at the break, circled
the turn four to five wide, moved up past mid stretch and kept on with interest. BROADWAY GIRLS was taken six wide in the opening furlong, urged along
around the turn, angled a bit wider for the drive and finished willingly. CURL GIRL saved ground off the pace, eased out a bit in the drive, found room
between runners late and finished well. GOOD AS GONE broke on top, disputed the pace between rivals, faded a bit in the drive and angled out. MUTEKI
moved up to the inside of rivals and gained a slim lead near the half, dueled around the turn then faded in the drive. SHE'S INTHEARMYNOW came out a
bit at the break and was bumped, corrected and vied three deep, led nearing the quarter pole, ceded to the winner in upper stretch and weakened. HOUSE
OF MAGIC broke inward and was bumped, chased the leaders four wide and gave way nearing the lane. CARSON JEN , off very slow after being fidgety
and unprepared, raced greenly and got out early, was floated wider, dropped in around the turn then was eased in the lane.

WARRENS CANDY GIRL edged up towards the rail into the first turn then settled, took closer order past the half mile marker, sat patiently near the five
sixteenths, eased out for run heading into the lane and moved up outside rivals, leveled off nicely under left handed asking leaving mid stretch, kept on
determinedly and forged ahead in the final yards. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM , three wide under early rating, moved up into the far turn, bid three deep past the
quarter pole, struck the top entering the lane, quickly opened up then drifted in a bit while on her left lead, corrected and dug in when confronted, switched
over to her right lead and just failed to contain the winner in a gritty effort. BARRISTER'S RIDE saved ground while off the pace, gained some leaving the
quarter pole, eased out and kept on between rivals to gain the show. PULPIT RIDER rated between rivals, angled out under pressure into the lane and
churned. HARPER'S GALLOP opened up into the backstretch and set the pace towards the rail, was joined leaving the three eighths, staved off foes to
about the head of the lane then weakened through the final furlong. SASSYSERB , outside a rival near the half, was under pressure two wide into the lane
but lacked a bid. ROSE DAWSON raced in closest pursuit, bid two wide outside the leader leaving the far turn, dueled between runners into the lane then
gave way. ALL DIALED IN , four wide, dropped back near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
YOUR RINGER chased four wide, angled five to six wide in upper stretch, leveled off to her best stride leaving the furlong grounds, took over outside foes
with a sixteenth to go and drew clear under a drive. WILLAMINA broke slowly, saved ground while well back early on, advanced inside into the lane, angled
out and finished gamely between runners to gain the place. KEEP YOUR COIL , towards the inside mid turn, swung out seven wide for the drive and rallied.
SMILING THUNDER drifted out at the break, straightened and chased three to four wide, steadily closed in and bid between foes with a sixteenth to go but
was out kicked from there. SHVERE ARBETER saved ground under asking around the turn, moved up inside rivals near mid stretch then flattened out.
DRIZELLA drifted out at the break, corrected and sprinted clear, set the pace two wide, was joined by rivals heading to the sixteenth pole and gave way.
PRECIOUS INSIGHT broke outward and bumped with a rival, raced five wide around the turn, was fanned eight wide into the stretch then had a mild late
kick. CARELESS STAR rushed up soon after the break and chased the pace, came three wide for the drive, faded between rivals leaving mid stretch then
steadied. FAST TO FORTUNE , inside into the turn, was not factor. MY SPY hopped at the break then was bumped and pinched back, raced off the pace
while wide and was not a threat. SARATOGA KAREN , forced out at the break, raced off the pace while three wide and failed to menace. LIL'S BIG SHOT
dropped back early and failed to recover.

Footnotes
RHEA MOON (IRE) , patiently handled off the inside, was given her cue past the five sixteenths and moved up between rivals, angled out off heels for a
clear run to be about five to six wide in upper stretch, was given one ask with the left stick, closed sharply to take command outside rivals heading to the
sixteenth pole then drew out under mild hand encouragement. GLENALL (IRE) rated close up, shifted out into the lane, bid between rivals nearing the
sixteenth marker and kept on gamely to be second best. SHE'S A JOKER rated back from between rivals after the break, settled in last, moved out to be
about four wide mid turn, angled six to seven wide in upper stretch and rallied. MISS MATTIE B , off the pace and off the inside, circled five wide into the
lane and had a mild run between foes. SHE'S GOT A WAY stalked the pace, moved to join the leader past the quarter pole, took the lead in upper stretch,
briefly went clear past the eighth pole, was hooked soon after and weakened. DENDERA relaxed in range early, moved up four wide under a ride into the
lane, failed to sustain past mid stretch and faded. KIRSTENBOSCH saved ground early, eased out for the drive but lacked a bid. FORTUNATA TENSIO ,
lightly steadied near the five eighths, eased out off the inside past the three sixteenths, made a mild run then flattened out. ISOLA MIA set the pace towards
the inside, took pressure nearing the lane and weakened. CLADDAGH CURE , between rivals near the far turn, angled in for the drive but lacked a bid.
VINCERO GRANDE , three deep nearing the five eighths, remained wide and gave way into the lane.
