Footnotes
A LITTLE WILD set the pace, tucked down while clearing inner foes into the turn, came under coaxing at the five sixteenths pole as IKE AND JACK
menaced, responded and kicked away from that foe in upper stretch as T MONEY took up pursuit, and safely held sway thereafter. T MONEY took a bump
from an outer foe soon after the start, tracked four wide, ranged up outside of rivals turning for home, but drifted to the six path entering the lane before the
leader kicked away, then chased that foe home while pulling clear of the rest to prove second best. EXTRAVAGATE was void of early speed, raced far back
while taking the turn in the five path, spun into the lane in the six to seven path, and rallied willingly without threatening the top two. PRIVATE CONNIE
tracked from midpack two wide around the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, offered a mild kick to bid for show at the sixteenth pole, but was
soon outkicked by an outer foe for that position. IKE AND JACK bobbled slightly at the start, stalked two wide before offering stern pressure outside of the
pace setter around the turn, but gave way in upper stretch. BRUCE ON THE LOOSE chased along the inside, but gave way turning for home, then
weakened on his left lead through the lane. INDIAN SPRINGS was outrun. TRAFFIC COP bumped an inner foe at the start, chased from midpack three
wide and between horses into the turn, but weakened entering the lane. MAHAL KITA was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, laid close
up two wide for a quarter mile, but steadily faded around the turn.

Footnotes
HURRICANE J rushed between horses after a bit of a flat-footed beginning, dueled for the lead outside of PENSACOLA, sparred around the turn, battled
gamely in the prolonged war through the lane, and prevailed via a very tight photo. PENSACOLA dueled for the lead inside of HURRICANE J, fought
gallantly in the sustained contest with his outer counterpart through the lane, but just barely missed. NO EASY DAYS laid off of the pace in the five path,
tracked in the four path around the turn, gained show from tiring foes approaching the three sixteenths pole, and ran on to secure that position. MACHO
VILLA raced off of the pace in the three path, altered course to the five path and outside of NO EASY DAYS entering the lane, but was awkward to change
leads in upper stretch, then only produced a mild kick. URGENT FURY tracked two wide, but came under coaxing to keep pace at the three furlong pole,
tucked to the rail turning for home, but lacked a bid while one paced through the lane. WINSTON WOLF was ridden along while at he rear of the main group
and in the four path around the turn, was brushed by an inner LOUDMOUTHSOUP, then failed to factor while hanging on his left lead through the lane.
LOUDMOUTHSOUP prompted the pace three wide and from between horses, but failed to keep pace with his inner pair of foes into the turn, chased them
while tucking to the two path at the three furlong pole, then yielded turning for home, then drifted out to the six path in upper stretch and brushed WINSTON
WOLF in the process. MAKING MOVES pressed four wide, chased the embattled leading pair from the three path after the three furlong pole, but weakened
between horses nearing the lane. PRESIDER broke a step slowly at the start, tracked along the inside, but faded around the turn. GIANNIS broke a step
slowly before being a bit crowded between a pair of rivals soon after the start, was very slow into stride following the mild incident despite heavy rider urging,
lagged behind the field around the turn while still under a drive, then cut the gap on the rest in the final furlong.

GAME BOY BENNY prompted the pace two wide and from the three path into the turn, vied between horses around the bend as an outer THE BOSS
FACTOR loomed a danger, sparred with that foe entering the lane after their inner counterpart faltered, gamely clung to an advantage in upper stretch, and
shook clear entering the final furlong. THE BOSS FACTOR tracked in the four path, tugged approaching the turn to press the top pair around it, vied along
with GAME BOY BENNY entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with that one leaving the furlong grounds, and was second best. DAVID'S GEM set the
pace in the two path, felt stern pressure from pair of outer foes around the turn, gave way to them approaching the quarter pole, and managed show through
the lane. BOLD ADVENTURE failed to factor. IMPRESSED stalked the embattled trio from along the inside around the turn, shifted course to the four path
approaching the lane, but lacked a bid, failed to progress in the final furlong before being eased up by the rider in the final sixteenth, and lost fourth at the
wire. RYE HUMOR broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TAP IN FORMATION was briefly dis-jointed with his rider pre-race without incident, sped clear soon after the start, was rated back into the turn allowing a
trio of chasing rivals to close in, felt moderate pressure from a pair of outer hopeful bidders turning for home, swiftly shook free of them entering the lane,
shifted ground outwardly in upper stretch as an inner MULLION took up pursuit, hung on his left lead as that foe closed in inside the final sixteenth, but just
lasted to the wire via a diminishing narrow margin. MULLION tracked the clear leader from along the inside while under moderate urging to hold position
inside of a pair of foes, inched closer as the pace backed down into the turn, stalked turning for home, gained place while chasing inside of the clear leader
in midstretch, grinded away at that foe's margin in the final sixteenth, produced a late bid nearing the wire, but just missed. TEN DAYS LATER laid off of the
pace along the inside, checked off of ENDPOINT's heels into the turn after getting too close to that rival, then split foes two wide turning for home, shifted to
the rail in upper stretch, and stayed on well to gain show at the sixteenth pole. HOW DID HE DO THAT bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased the
clear leader two wide and from between horses, attempted to apply pressure turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader and an inner chasing
foe in upper stretch, faded, and lost show a sixteenth from home. CLEAR THE AIR broke outwardly, stalked three wide, inched closer around the turn, but
stalled out and gave way in upper stretch. ENDPOINT saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. SINGLE RULER bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid
off of the pace in the four path, shifted down to the two path turning for home, and failed to menace. PYRENEES was urged in the three path while off of the
pace, and failed to factor. O GANGSTER never got involved. AFFAMATO raced far back in the three path and was outrun.

Footnotes
LA TOURISTA pressed two wide, vied into the far turn, forged a minor advantage at the five sixteenths pole, inched narrowly clear leaving the furlong
grounds, and held sway from her inner battling-back counterpart. EDGEE ANGEL set the pace, vied inside of LA TOURISTA into the far turn, got headed at
the five sixteenths pole, kept on thereafter, fought back in the final furlong, but was kept at bay. MOONSHINE DREAMER tracked two wide, tipped outside
of the leading pair in upper stretch, but only managed to chase them home evenly. RUNAWAY MOM broke slowly and laid at the back of the pace along the
inside around the first turn, shifted out and gained three wide at the half mile pole to press the leading pair around the far turn, but drifted out a bid nearing
the lane, and yielded in the four path at the three sixteenths pole. ASKEW stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
TWICE AS SWEET stalked the top pair from the three path around the turn, inched closer to take aim on a clearing RACETHROUGHTHECITY in upper
stretch, ranged up to that foe at the furlong grounds, gained an advantage entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. GIRL NAMED CHARLIE tracked
from midpack along the inside, shifted off of the fence entering the lane, split foes two wide in upper stretch, changed leads at the furlong grounds sparking
an acceleration, and surged in the final sixteenth to reach place late. RACETHROUGHTHECITY dueled for the lead two wide, disposed of her inner
counterpart nearing the lane, drew clear entering it as TWICE AS SWEET menaced, resisted that foe's bid at the furlong grounds, but was headed at the
sixteenth pole, yielded soon after, and lost place late. JERSEY PEARL chased four wide around the turn, and pursued the leaders while lacking the needed
punch through the lane. HOLD MY CROWN settled far back four wide, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly outside of foes. LA
CREMA broke a step slowly while last away, raced in midpack two wide, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. TENACIOUS LADY
laid far back three wide, and failed to factor. DELLA LUCE lacked early speed along the inside, and never got involved. ONE STORMY LADY dueled for the
lead along the inside, but gave way approaching the quarter pole, and weakened while the rider lost his crop at the furlong grounds. SONG OF STORMS
was outrun.

Footnotes
REDEEMER stalked along the inside, chased the top pair as they were getting away turning for home, tipped outside of them in upper stretch while hanging
on his left lead, awkwardly changed over at the furlong grounds, rallied in pursuit of a clear DENINGTON in the final furlong, and drove past that rival late.
DENINGTON set the pace, felt moderate pressure from an outer RECKER POINT around the turn, fended off that rival through upper stretch, drew clear at
the furlong grounds, but was worn down approaching the wire. RECKER POINT pressed two wide, attempted a bid for the lead turning for home, but lugged
inwardly at the furlong grounds while failing to keep pace with the leader, and yielded under wraps through the closing stages. FIGHT FIERCELY tracked
two wide, chased the leaders from along the inside around the far turn, but faded. BEN DREAMING tracked four to three wide around the first turn, chased
the leaders turning for home, but weakened through the lane. MAMBA FOREVER was squeezed back between horses around the first turn, laid off of the
pace in the two path, took the far bend in the four path, and failed to factor. LED TASSO laid off of the pace three wide, but came under urging in the four
path around the far turn, and tired. HE'S A GOOD DANCER tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, but faded around the far turn. OLAZABAL
broke slowly and never got involved. INFINITEEXPERIENCE saved ground in midpack, but lost position nearing the far turn, and was done early.
GHOSTSTRYDER was pinched back and steadied between horses early on, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MY ROMEO LIMA dueled from inside, opened up slightly under coaxing into the lane, and held on gamely. ALYANAABI stalked from the two path, tipped
out to the five path into the stretch, and ran on to place. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF dueled for the lead while two wide, was driven from the three path into the
lane, and yiedled late but held show. HEEDING clipped heels when put to tight quarters between horses soon after the start, trailed in the two path early,
saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, but finished evenly. GET THROUGH tracked in the three path, swung out to the seven path for the lane,
but was one paced. GRAND CAY broke a step slow, was wellback and three wide early but never threatened. PRINCE OF GLORY chased from the two
path but was done early and eased.
