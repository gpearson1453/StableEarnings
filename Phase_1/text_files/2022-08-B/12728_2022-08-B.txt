finished evenly. VITA trailed from the four path early, swung out to the seven path into the lane, and gained late. FIANNA HILLS prompted the pace from the
two path but was empty at the top of the lane. SUPER LEGS was unhurried from the two path but never a threat. SUSAN STRONG chased from three wide
