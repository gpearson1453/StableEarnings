then gave way on the turn. ROYAL TO BE stalked the pace between foes, then failed to menace. CORSIDAT pressed early in the two path, then yielded
turn. FOUND MY MAN saved ground to no avail. PRINCESS LENNY broke sharply, stalked the pace in the three path, then faded in the stretch. OXBOW'S
IMAGE broke sharply, then was through early.

CARMICHAEL stalked the pace from the three path, was moving up on the turn to rally gamely in the early stretch then shook clear in the final furlong to
prevail. BEAR OAK dueled for the lead from the inside, was in a long drive entering the home stretch then flattened out in the end and held for place.
ROLLING FORK chased the pace while two wide then rallied on the second turn into the stretch and was closing well but it was too little too late. FIRST
GLIMPSE dueled for the lead from the two path into the first turn, was in a steady drive on the backstretch then bid in the early stretch and gave way in the
end. ESKENFORIT chased the pace from the inside then bore out six to seven wide on the turn and was no threat.

stretch to prove best. CHOCTAW BINGO chased the pace from the inside, was in a steady drive on the backstretch then came out three wide on the
second turn to rally in the stretch and was closing well but it was not enough. DISCREET KITTY settled along the inside on the backstretch then menaced in
upper stretch and was closing willingly down the home stretch. POLKA POLENTA raced evenly throughout the backstretch into the far turn while in the two
path then made a mild bid in late stretch but it was too little too late. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive then faltered
in the early stretch. COMPLETE raced behind the field while two wide, was in a hard drive on the far turn to rally in the stretch but came up evenly and was
no threat. PERTINACIOUS TIZ was unhurried early and failed to menace. MALIBU MARLEE raced in the middle of the field while three wide and was
steadily fading entering the second half of the course and failed to rally. THE BEAUTY'S TALE chased the pace from the two path on the backstretch and
