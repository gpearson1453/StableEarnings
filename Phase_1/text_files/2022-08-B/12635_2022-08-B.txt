HAPPY OUT speed to the front, maintained advantage, widened in the stretch and held sway to the wire under good handling. MI CRESCENDO chased
winner early, took up chase throughout, no match late. IRISH KITTEN slow start, raced back to the turn, rallied in stretch on for show. OLIVIA'S JOY
awkward start rushed to within striking distance, emptied out. BAL A BAE BEE tried to keep up to the turn, gave in and faded back in stretch. MAXIMUM
JOY broke well with a steady fade thereafter. POINT OF INFINITY gave way from inside quickly. YOUDEVILYOUCECILIA broke awkward from the gate,
never menaced throughout. SPIRITED TEARS squeezed back start, never menaced throughout.
