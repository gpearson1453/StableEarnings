midstretch and finished well to gain the place. FUTURISTIC stalked the pace three wide and lacked a rally while holding third. EDEN PARADISE exchanged
several light bumps with THREE CENTS in the opening furlong, raced well back three wide, swung eight wide leaving the quarter pole and ran on willingly
through the lane to just miss third. LAST DREAM failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SHEA D CAPTURE raced two wide and never
threatened. RUNAWAY TOM played no factor while racing four and five wide. SIDNEY'S BID was outrun inside. MINISTER QUINN dueled along the rail
and tired in the drive. CAJUN CRACKER dueled two wide to upper stretch and retreated. THREE CENTS exchanged several light bumps with EDEN

wide in midpack, made some progress four wide around the far turn but faded through the lane. BLUTO'S CANDY stalked the pace three wide and tired in
the drive. TAP N THE GOLD was off a step slow, raced three and four wide and never threatened. STARSHIP SKYWALKER tossed his head at the start
and was off slowly, saved ground and was never involved. LIL CROWN dueled inside of the winner and retreated after six furlongs.

Footnotes
BOUNCER raced off the pace outside down the backstretch, angled into the three path early on the turn, came through inside of foes in upper stretch, took
over nearing the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging and edged ahead. BORIS bobbled at the break, stalked the pace three wide, was floated
six wide near the quarter pole, took the lead in upper stretch, was outkicked by the winner but stayed on to hold the place. BEAST MARKET tracked the
pace four wide, was floated seven wide near the quarter pole, had aim outside of the top two but was one-paced through the lane. DON'T ANSWER ducked
out at the start, raced off the pace five wide and finished with some belated interest. ROLLING ON set a clear pace in two path, drifted five wide near the
quarter pole and tired in the lane. NARUTO failed to menace while racing two wide. SKYHOOPER played no factor while racing three wide. CLASSY BOY
was outrun while racing two wide. ROLL ON BIG JOE chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. READY FOR DIAMONDS was outrun inside.
UNCAPTURED STAR chased the pace two wide and had little left for the drive. PULPMASTER was off slow, raced five wide and made little impact.

FROSTED ARMOUR set the pace in the two path, drew off under a mild drive through midstretch and continued to widen under minimal encouragement in
the final sixteenth. BIG AND CLASSY stalked the pace three wide, was no match for the winner but stayed on to be a clear second. MR MAC QUHAE raced
four wide in midpack, lacked a rally and bested the rest. PROUD CONTENDER failed to menace while racing two wide. MOMZA chased the pace two wide
and retreated after a half. SUMMER ASH trailed in the three path, angled six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. FROLIC MAN had brief speed two
wide. MAJOR FRONTIER checked near the three-quarters pole and was through early.

Footnotes
ACTION WARRIOR bumped with LOVE IN PARADISE at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, stalked at the rail around the turn, came through
inside of the pacesetter turning for home, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, vied inside and edged ahead late. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR set the pace three
wide down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path around the turn, vied outside of the winner through much of the lane and was outfinished. MEKANO
lacked early speed, raced five wide around the turn and rallied through the lane. STONE AGE stalked the pace two wide between foes, tipped out leaving
the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. UP FOR THE CHANCE tracked the pace four wide, was in a bit tight near the eighth pole, angled out soon
after and had no further bids. ASTRAL WEEKS played no factor while racing two wide. FISHING FOR FUN failed to menace while racing five wide. PORK
CHOP was outrun while racing three wide. I'LL FINISH was up close three wide and retreated after a half. LOVE IN PARADISE bumped with the winner at
the start, raced at least six wide and made little impact. FULTON STREET ducked into the gap leaving the chute, lost the rider, galloped along with the field
and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT LEAVING THE CHUTE AND TOOK NO ACTION AFTER RULING
THAT FULTON STREET CAUSED HIS OWN TROUBLE.

Footnotes
THE DISTRACTOR prompted the pace five wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. GANGLY dueled three wide between
foes, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on gamely to hold well clear of the rest. INTER MIAMI bumped with ROYAL HARRY at
the start, was hustled up inside, dueled inside of four foes at the rail around the turn, could not keep pace nearing the quarter pole but churned on to save
the show. AGARRAMESIPUEDES saved ground off the pace, angled out in the lane and passed tiring rivals. JOE DI BAGGIO dueled two wide between
foes and tired in the lane. ROYAL HARRY bumped with INTER MIAMI at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. IF NOT FOR LUCK dueled four
wide between foes and retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
NINJA ABARRIO stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up and clear late. SONICUS set a clear pace in
the two path, led to deep stretch, drifted out and succumbed late. HAY HAY PAULA was off slowly, advanced six wide around the turn and ran on for the
show. FREUDIAN raced off the pace five wide, edged closer under a drive around the turn and was one-paced through the lane. DIGNIFIED failed to
menace while racing two wide. I'M ALREADY TAKEN played no factor while racing five wide. MI NEGRITA prompted the pace three wide and retreated
through the lane. SOPHIA'S STORM was in range while racing four wide and came up empty in the lane. LONGING TO FLY was outrun while racing four
wide. KILLARGUE'S GIRL popped the gate open prior to the start, saved ground and made little impact. DEL REY DOLLY was fractious in the gate, had
some speed outside but was through early and was eased.

mild stretch gain. CENTSATIONAL GRACE failed to menace while racing three wide. FOR EVER OURS never threatened while racing four wide.
SENORITA SALSA was outrun outside. BAHAMIAN BEAUTY made little impact while racing four wide. CAJUN SPICE saved ground to no avail. STONE
