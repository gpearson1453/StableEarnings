HELLEPHENT sped to the lead soon after the start and set the uncontested pace, took on the challenge from UNCAPTURED SKY with a sixteenth left to
run, dueled heads apart, dug in gamely and nipped rival for the win. UNCAPTURED SKY angled inside heading into the turn, tipped two wide and hustled
along into the upper stretch, advanced to challenge HELLEPHANT for the lead at the sixteenth pole, dueled gamely along the outside and just missed.
CLASSIC BET chased two wide between foes around the turn, came three wide into the lane and stayed on for a share. UNCLE RAY got bumped back at
the start, chased four wide around the turn and failed to rally. LUCKY DUDE raced in range three wide around the turn then faded through the lane.

MR FROST sped to the lead at the start and held a slim lead around the turn, drifted three to four wide entering upper stretch, widened advantage and held
late under a driving finish. PRAIRIE WOLF raced just off the leader into the turn, hustled along three wide past the quarter pole, remained in steady pursuit
through the lane and finished clearly second best. FIFTY TWO PICKUP took a solid bump between rivals at the start, raced off the early pace then given
cue three wide in upper stretch and gained show. DRIVER got bumped at the start, raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
BRASSY FIRE raced three to four wide in range around the turn then faded in the lane. HANDSOME HUNTER raced up close along the inside around the
turn then came up empty just past the furlong marker.

SHWEET PERSUASION vied for the lead around the first turn then shook free and set the pace through the backstretch, held clear around the far turn, was
ridden along two to three wide into upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve and pulled away while ridden out. TOUGH COMPANY rated two wide just off the
second flight midway up the backstretch, given cue four wide approaching the quarter pole, responded along the outside and finished second best.
ALWAYS A CATCH stalked the pace through early stages, came under a ride three wide midway around the far turn, ran on through the lane and prevailed
for a share. PRICE TO PAY tracked the pace along the inside, coaxed along the rail around the far turn then weakened and got edged for show. KILLEEN
vied for the lead around the first turn then stalked the leader through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid between foes around the far turn then came
up empty. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE broke on top then quickly faded to the back, trailed the field and never reached contention.

Footnotes
GOTTA LOVE IKE stalked the pace then briefly edged up to put a head in front at the half mile marker, briefly edged back then regained along the rail at the
quarter pole, roused forward to a slim lead, dug in gamely and held on. PROMISING SHOES raced three wide into the first turn and tracked the pace along
the outside, made a midrace move up to challenge for the lead at the half mile marker, dueled with JERRYS PRIDENJOY then took on the added challenge
of GOTTA LOVE IKE at the quarter pole, stayed on determinedly three wide in striking range but failed to get by. JERRYS PRIDENJOY raced in contention
three wide around the first turn then moved up approaching the half mile marker, dueled for the lead around the far turn, continued in striking distance into
the final furlong and yielded late. FOXY ACE rated off the early pace, hustled along two to three wide around the far turn, tipped wider for the drive and
failed to move on. BIG HEARTED FACTOR rated along the inside through the backstretch, flattened around the far turn and continued to tire in the lane.
ROCK CITY ROADHOG settled three to four wide through early stages, failed to respond under pressure midway around the far turn and steadily retreated.
MINE MY TIME showed brief then dropped far back and jogged in.

Footnotes
FLYTA stalked along the inside through early stages, edged forward along the rail to engage rivals for the lead at the half mile marker, dueled with
BAILEYWICK then shook free at the head of the lane and finished going away. BAYLEYWICK dueled for the lead around the first turn and battled through
the backstretch, vied with the winner around the far turn, failed to match strides at the head of the lane but stayed on and finished clearly second best.
ZENCHUA SKY rated off the early pace, hustled along two wide around the final turn, ran on into the lane and captured show in final strides. BOURN
dueled for the lead around the first turn and battled on into the far turn, flattened near the five sixteenths pole, got edged late for show and finished on equal
terms with SHESABIDFORMIDABLE. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE tracked the early pace, urged three wide around the final turn, failed to kick on and finished
on equal terms with BOURN. PREF RIGHT raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide and had no response. DONNA'S HOPE
had no response.
