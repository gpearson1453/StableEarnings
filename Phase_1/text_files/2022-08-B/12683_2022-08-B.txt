MINISTERIAL five paths off the inside through the opening bend, chased five then four wide just off the duel, tucked four then three wide through the far turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive knocking heads with NORTH POLE straightened away
to the sixteenth marker when taking narrow command, then inched away to the finish kept busy to the end. NORTH POLE broke in at the start, then bobbled
just after the start, chased three wide through the first turn and then advanced to duel four to three wide down the backstretch with PSYCHIC INCOME to
his inside, tucked three then two wide through the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide for home, dug in taking narrow
command a furlong out under threat to the outside from the aforementioned foe, got headed a sixteenth out and fought on to the finish to be along clear for
the place honors. STRONG LIGHT saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing half a mile from home and tipped out two then three wide
through the far turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. PSYCHIC INCOME showed the way early on just off the inside
before being engaged in head to head combat by NORTH POLE to the outside, dueled with that rival taking the inside route into upper stretch, continued to
knock heads through to nearing the eighth pole when yielding the front, then weakened to the finish. NO CODE chased three then two wide coming under
taps from the crop to the right side five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path and then to the inside midway on the far turn, continued along the rail into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MISS BONNIE T was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved while unhurried near the back, traveled two then three wide
around the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed strongly to get the
lead inside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to her inside lead while gaining the advantage and moved clear late under good handling. DIAMOND STATUS
bumped with DEVILLY at the start then jostled with that foe early, moved up between horses under urging to take the lead, showed the way in the two path
with a clear advantage, was guided around the far turn under some extra left-rein pressure, dropped closer to the hedge while put to a right-handed crop
into the stretch, switched to a left-handed crop into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to get the place.
BEACHFRONT BID dropped back along the hedge early, saved ground while tugging hard at the bit around the first turn, was keen under stout restraint
passing the three-quarter pole and onto the backstretch, continued towards the back under reserve, drafted inside to the two path while behind horses on
the far turn, remained behind horses in the two path into the stretch, waited despite room to the inside while looking to get out at the three-sixteenths,
altered out and forced a foe out shortly thereafter, rallied into the final furlong and finished with good courage to just miss the place while clear for the show.
BIRTHDAY TIME became unruly in the gate then was backed out and reloaded after being deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, came away in good
order, was well placed on the inside, passed the half-mile pole under urging, saved ground around the far turn, spun into the two path entering the stretch,
pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. FREE CHICKENS went around the first turn in the two path, settled off
the pace, was coaxed along passing the half-mile pole then brushed with a foe, went two then three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, was forced out by BEACHFRONT BID inside the three-sixteenths then had his path taken while dropping back and came up empty. LADY FIREFOOT
broke out at the start, was caught four wide around the first turn, settled on the outside without the benefit of cover, was urged four wide in good striking
position around the final turn, brushed with a foe while shortening stride inside the three-sixteenths, lugged in while weakening in the final furlong and
capitulated. GATHER THE FACTS went three wide on the first turn, settled on the inside of a rival, brushed with a foe inside the half-mile pole which caused
her to swap leads, dropped back in the three path around the far turn, moved to the two path into the stretch and failed to respond. DEVILLY stumbled at
the start then bumped with DIAMOND STATUS, jostled with that same foe early, went around the first turn in the two path, was rated under a snug hold
while tracking the pace, navigated the far turn in the three path while let out, pursued the leader under a drive into upper stretch, brushed with an opponent
inside the three-sixteenths and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TOP OF THE MINT grew fractious prior to the start and broke open his stall door inspiring JOEY LOOSE LIPS to do the same, raced three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued three wide into upper stretch rallying to take command with three-sixteenths to run, then drew clear
under a drive to prevail. HANG TIGHT chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. EMINENCY hustled from the gate, raced four paths off the inside early on until tucked to
the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, saved ground through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered up
a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. NICHOLAS JAMES hustled from the start, dueled inside of JOEY LOOSE LIPS coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened to the finish. INSPIRATION
POINT broke a half a beat slow, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. GOT THE GOLD three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
JOEY LOOSE LIPS got inspired to break open his stall door by TOP OF THE MINT who did as such just prior, leapt up in the gate and bucked his way
through the open door, the rider dismounting as the assistant starter held his charge strongly to keep him on hand and from running off with exceptional skill,
got examined and reloaded, broke in mid pack and advanced to duel two to three wide with NICHOLAS JAMES to his inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch backing away and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FREEDOM SPEAKS hustled from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish kept to task. AMERICAN STARLET coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand just off the inside under pressure early on from NEON SUMMER through swift splits, shook off that rival near the midway point on the turn and was
patiently handled taking the inside route into upper stretch, had the aforementioned foe advance outside and was roused to a vigorous hand drive a furlong
out, got collared with a sixteenth to go and ran on to just hold for the place honors. TUSCAN QUEEN hustled from the gate, chased four paths off the inside
down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick. NAY SAY (IRE) hustled from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through
the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. CAIRONI coaxed from the
gate, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking briefly inside into the turn, tipped out four wide placed to urging at the three-eighths,
swung five to six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the stretch. AMERICAN HEROINE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. CROWDING OUT chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path
at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. NEON SUMMER hustled
from the start, pressed the pace of AMERICAN STARLET from the outside three then two wide, got shaken off near the midway point on the turn and was
coaxed along just off the inside, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. OSIRIA five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LEADER OF THE BAND was brought to the front of the gate then backed into the stall, came under coaxing from the break to establish early position, was
well placed in the two path, drafted behind foes on the far turn, shifted three wide near the five-sixteenths, was asked while swinging five wide into the
stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, had the rider take a confident look behind him coming to the furlong marker then took the lead, was
given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then proved best while placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire. FIRST TO ACT pressed
the pace on the outside in the three path, turned up the pressure on the far turn, gained the lead while asked coming to the quarter-pole, spun four wide into
the stretch, was put to a right-handed crop around the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong, kept on well to the wire but
missed while clear for the place. ENVOUTANTE went to the front, raced inside around the opening turn, showed the way while under pressure from her
outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was given her cue just outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up coming to the
quarter-pole, fought on under the crop into the final furlong then weakened but was clear for the show. BONNY SOUTH was coaxed early, went four wide on
the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, chased in the five path around the far turn, was driven six wide into the stretch
and came up empty. ARMY WIFE brushed with a foe while coaxed along early, settled on the inside, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, moved out in
upper stretch and also came up empty. MISTY VEIL was sent hard from the start, brushed with a rival early, went two to three wide on the first turn, was
urged along down the backstretch, traveled three wide under strong encouragement on the final turn and failed to respond. EXOTIC WEST was caught four
wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, came under urging near the half-mile pole, went four wide while ridden along on the far turn, dropped back into the
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
OXYMORE showed good speed, disputed the pace on the outside, held a solo lead in the two path around the turn, was challenged by the runner-up at the
five-sixteenths, came out into upper stretch then lost the lead narrowly, dueled into the final sixteenth and proved best under a right-handed crop. NO NAY
HUDSON (IRE) was taken back off the pace then stalked on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, was asked at
the quarter-pole, took a slim advantage in upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place.
PRIVATE CREED was hustled from the gate, bumped lightly with a rival early, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, bumped lightly
with a foe at the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out some inside the three-sixteenths, chased in the final furlong and finished
willingly for the show. APPRAISE (IRE) made light contact with a foe early, moved in under urging around the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, was
driven three wide into the stretch, moved inward in the final furlong and also finished willingly but missed the show. NOBLE HUNTSMAN broke a half-step
slow, settled towards the rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
improved position without threatening. FADETHENOISE was off a half-step slow, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, bumped lightly
with PRIVATE CREED at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. PROVE RIGHT was off slow and spotted the front
a few lengths, settled at the rear, was roused two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. CADILLAC CANDY broke a
step slow, settled on the outside, rounded the turn in two path, shifted three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. JEREMY'S JET showed good
speed, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back along the rail on the turn and capitulated.
