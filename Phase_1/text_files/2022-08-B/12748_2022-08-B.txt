Footnotes
AUGER laid close up traveling between horses into the turn wresting the lead outside the quarter pole angling to the three path in upper stretch drawing off
under a drive. QUICK ENTRY pressed three deep into the turn pursuing from the three path in upper stretch angling in as the winner got away late securing
place. HE'S THE SOUPERWON hustled on the outside losing ground to upper stretch finishing evenly in the six path. BLOWING STRONG in a touch close
near the half mile pole would drop back playing no factor from there. BOBBY DON gradually cut across on the lead taking the rail into the turn ceding to
outside pressure there fading from said rail down the lane. DREW folded up on the turn.

PETAL away alertly set the pace holding daylight through the turn widening in the four path upper stretch holding firm the final eighth. ILLUSIONS OF LOVE
stalked the pace through the turn losing ground to the leader in upper stretch needing all at mid track to hang on for place. WHAT A TART a step slow
through the turn raced inside to upper stretch vying from the two path drifting to the rail late finishing well. NO KITTEN chased through the turn coming six
wide in upper stretch weakening there giving an even finish. PIPA PAN slow early failed to menace. WISH FOR MAGIC saved ground to upper stretch
weakening there along the inside. DO YOU LIKE THAT leapt in the air at the break.
