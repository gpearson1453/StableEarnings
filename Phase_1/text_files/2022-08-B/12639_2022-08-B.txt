Footnotes
MIAS MOONBEAM pulled while in traffic and forwardly placed first turn, raced in the second flight up the backstretch while still in hand, asked along midway
on te final bend, three wide into the lane, outside bid, wore down leader late under firm handling. FLASHING ANGELBABY broke alertly, showed the way
into the first turn in the two path, continued to set a soft and pressured pace the middle half while remaining just off the inside, held a narrow advantage
between rivals and inside the winner past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to that one late while edging clear for the place. WILSON TO
LOCKETT broke just behind the runner up, pressed that one from along the inside, continued to hound that one through the final turn and into the lane, not
enough for the top two the final furlong, clear of the others. TENSAS TODDY forwardly placed while racing in the three path and to the winner's outside,
failed to keep pace with that one turning for home to come up empty for the stretch run. COOL INDIVIDUAL within striking distance first turn, was shuffled
back from between horses onto the backstretch, continued back in failing to menace. CALCULATE five wide when with the lead pack in the first turn, fell
back, well beaten.

Footnotes
ROCKY BAR SIX dueled up front closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage into the lane, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, held
the runner up safe late under steady handling. BINDING AGREEMENT last away, raced in the second flight off the inside, came three wide for the drive,
angled to the inside of the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one to the wire, proved determined for the place. JAKE THE BAND MAN in
the second flight early toward the inside, swung out to be four wide turning for home, mild bid outside the winner nearing midstretch, failed to keep pace to
the wire, nipped in the final strides for the second spot. PRIZELESS four wide into the turn when off the pace, three wide into the straight, improved slightly
the final furlong without posing a serious threat. CHANNEL WON lacked speed well off the inside, three wide turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for
the drive. SATURDAY'S GOLD dueled up front for three furlongs outside the winner and then gave way at the head of the stretch. RACE WAS HAND
TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
DINAR settled off the pace in the two path in the run up the backstretch, dropped to the rail while being asked late in the turn, challenged inside the leader
with less than a furlong remaining and edged clear late under steady handling. SMARTY GRIMES sprinted clear soon after the start, continued to show the
way into and through the turn toward the inside, allowed the winner the rail past the furlong marker, could not match strides with that one late, remained
clear for the runner up position. UNION STATION last away, raced back and well out in the strip, continued four wide through the turn, mild rally, gained the
nod for the show while not a serious threat to the top two. POPULIST closest to the runner up while off the inside, three path into the lane, proved no match
for that rival in the run to the wire nor the winner, nipped in the final strides for the show. CLEAR HUMOR off the pace while inside the winner in the run up
the backstretch, followed that one into the lane while continuing to save ground, lacked a significant closing response. SIR SMACK within striking distance
while racing three wide for a half, came up empty for the stretch run. TAPPIN FORA DANCE trailed throughout while racing wide, showed little.

LIFE OF SATURDAYS moved up into the second flight after the start, closer three wide late in the turn, outside bid into lane, long duel to the wire, proved
narrowly best while all out at the wire. MY LITTLE GUERA broke on top, alternated for the advantage up the backstretch off the inside, vied between horses
and inside the winner into the lane, second duel to the wire, narrowly missed in a game effort. EASY IS GOOD lacked early foot, roused three wide while
following the winner into the stretch, proved no matchg for the top two. MISS MIRACLE GIRL away in good order just inside the runner up, dueled with that
one up the backstretch and through the turn, began to weaken in upper stretch, caught latre for the show. CABO SUNSET last to leave, remained back in
faili;ngb to threaten,. CHIEF THE GREAT within striking distance up the backstretch along the inside, was finished before a half, trailed home well back.

Footnotes
HONOR MY SPEED last away while in traffic and steadying slightly, moved up to race in mid pack off the inside, set down for the drive, closed steadily with
good resolve to be up in time while outside the pacesetter. GRACIDA in the rear up the backstretch, asked along turn toward the inside, finished willingly up
the rail to be up for the place. MR. PAYCHECK broke on tiop, set the pace while toward the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, drifted out
inside the furlong marker, weakened a bit to be caught by the top two late while between that pair at the wire. LUNAR LIGHT lacked speed outside, four
wide into the turn, floated five wide into the stretch, loomed a threat while widest in midstretch then flattened out a bit in the late going. OVERDELIVER
lacked speed while three wide early, two path through much of the turn, improved slightly through the stretch while not a serious threat. CURTIN'S UP
chased the leader off the inside for a half and faltered. IRISH EXPECTATIONS inb mid pack off the inside, three to four wide exiting the turn, within striking
distance a furlong out, had little left late. PURE VALOR forwardly placed for three furlong, gave way in the drive.

BARRANCA away in good order, dueled out of the chute and up the backstretch off the linside, disposed of the other speed by late in the turn, drew off
through the stretch to win ridden out. CECE WAVE broke well from the outside, forwardly placed while racing off the inside, chased the winner into the lane,
proved no match in the run to the wire while holding sway for the place. PAT'S EMPYREAN lightly bumped at the break, settled in the second flight early
toward the inside, asked along in the two path turning for home, also proved no match for winner, outkicked for the place position. THE CALLING STONE in
mid pack while racing outside early, four wide through the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. ASK DALE lacked speed,
improved position toward the inside into the stretch, lacked a further response and was never dangerous. STARSHIP NOLA bumped and forced into PAT'S
EMPYREAN at the break to be last away, continued back up the backstretch, angled five wide into the lane, also improved a bit in upper stretch before
finishing out evenly. WINNIE B remained back in failing to threaten. MYLIES STAR made little impact in also remained back. FIELD OF LIGHTS in the main
group early behind the first two flights, began a steady retreat before a half while four wide out of the turn. TALENTS HOT DEAL bobbled and broke in
bumping STARSHIP NOLA, was righted and moved up quickly to duel along the inside, stopped after a half.

EVE'S DELIGHT pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled turn in the two path, shook clear when straightened for home, enough left late to hold the
runner up safe late while outside that one at the wire. CHARLIE T in the second flight while off the inside, encouraged into the lane, steered inside the
winner when advancing past the furlong marker, late bid, gaining. HARRIET'S DREAM broke on top, showed the way early inside, weakened and was
unable to stay with the winner upper stretch nor contain the runner up the final furlong, enough left to comfortably saved the show. SIENNA BREEZE in the
second group along the inside, lacked a closing kick. DUEFORADATE last to leave, trailed while in the three path into and through the turn, also lacked a
closing response.

Footnotes
FOTHERINGAY forwardly placed early along the inside, traffic into the turn, came in the two path out of the turn, engaged the leader from the outside past
the furlong marker, wore that rival down to be edging clear late. HESACALENDARBOY took command soon after the start, continued to show the way into
and through the turn, continued to hold the advantage in upper stretch, could not match the winner in the late going while remaining clear of the others.
SHOETRICK in mid pack while racing off the inside, was four wide out of the turn, managed only a mild rally to hold sway for the show. R T'S D'ORO went
one paced throughout while racing along the inside. SOULOLOGY void of speed, raced three wide through the turn, improved position slightly while not a
serious threat. RUSSET MOON in the main body off the rail, dropped inside late turn, not dangerous. BUBBA SMACK raced back and four wide into the
turn, failed to muster a rally. JOEY'S LIGHTENING pressured the runner up from the outside for a half, gave way in the drive. WILDCARD GOLD last away,
moved outside when void of speed, four wide turn, remained back.
