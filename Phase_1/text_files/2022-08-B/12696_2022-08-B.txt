Footnotes
BLESSED BROTHER was allowed to settle early, circled the field five wide on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, drew off in the stretch to prove much
the best while being ridden out. BOBBY BUCKETS was rated along and made a inside bid nearing the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for the
winner while clearly second best. COWBOY CAUSEWAY stalked the pace three wie, made a three wide bid on the turn and in between rivals by the quarter
pole, but failed to sustain that bid, held show award. TRIBUNAL LOVE set the early pace and was two wide on the turn and weakened. MIDNIGHT LUTER
stalked the pace four wide, then was between rivals nearing the quarter pole and weakened.

award. TOE DANCER chased the early pace, then was four to five wide on the turn and came wide into the lane and had no rally, bested rest. SLICE OF
PIE was keen early and had to steady along the inside and then was empty in the drive.

MAGGIE FITZGERALD was allowed to settle early, eased out in advanced nearing the quarter pole and was between rivals, angled out leaving the turn,
closed well to edge clear late to prove best under a drive. ONEFINEDAY set the pace and got over to the inside, then floated off the inside leaving the turn,
dug in by the furlong marker, but could not hold off the winner while staying for the place award. LIFE'S EMOTIONS stalked the pace and made a three
wide bid nearing the quarter pole but hung the final sixteenth. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL chased the pace three wide and made a four wide bid by the quarter
pole and was pushed out five wide leaving the turn and flattened out. APPOINTED STAR was off slowly, then rushed up on the inside and checked entering
the turn and then weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
MOON CIRCUMFERENCE was four wide into the first turn, then was sent up to vie for the lead three wide by the six furlong marker, then went on to set the
pace while clear on the backstretch, then was headed leaving the turn, then was resurgent in the furlong grounds to edge clear late under a drive. GEBO
was settled three wide, then came four wide into the drive while advancing, then rallied in the drive and got the place award late. WHISPER AND WINK was
well rated along the inside, then was coaxed along on the turn and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, gained a short lead nearing the furlong marker
but hung in the furlong grounds, lost place award late. GHOSTFINDER was away alertly and clear into the first turn on the inside, then vied for the lead by
the three quarter pole, relented to the winner and chased the pace two to three wide on the backstretch, then was on the inside on the turn, angled out in
the drive and was empty. LUCKY CHAMP was reserved early, raced three to four wide and was not a threat. PRINCE SKIMMING was not a factor while on
the inside.

Footnotes
HICKORY WIND was away alertly to set the pace and cross over to the inside, then kicked clear leaving the turn and remained clear to prove best under a
drive. BRANNIGAN was bumped at the start, chased the pace, was three wide by the quarter pole and angled out in the lane and had a mild rally to gain the
place award. CAUSE I'M COOL tracked the pace along the inside but lacked the needed winning bid, lost the place late. LOVE THAT KID was four wide
into the first turn, then settled three to four wide, was four wide by the quarter pole and came five wide into the lane and had no rally. HEFTY GARCIA was
five wide into the first turn, then dropped to the inside and failed to menace. MYSTIC MAG broke inward at the start, settled on the inside and tired.

TRINNI VALANTINE set the early pace while clear, then was off the rail on the turn while still clear, then was kept to his task to prove best while clear.
SALTY DAN tracked the winner three wide early, then was two wide on the turn but failed to gain while clearly second best. ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT was
allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and had a mild late rally on the inside while no threat to the top two. PREDICATION was settled early and
three wide by the quarter pole but had no kick. NUMMY NUM was bumped at the start, settled early and was five wide by the quarter pole but had no punch
in the lane. PERFECT BLEND was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and had no rally. MAHALO ABRAAJ was fractious in the gate, chased the
pace four to three wide and stopped. TWENTY TWO DEAL was off slowly and was not a factor.
