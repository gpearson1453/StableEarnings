alertly, set the pace along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. DEER CREEK ROAD chased the pace in an even effort. IMPERIAL BREW well
placed inside, failed to respond. LORD EDDARD STARK failed to menace. GIO SAMMY had early speed and was through after a half. WISE KHOZAN was

stalked the pace and finished with good courage in the five path. GEH SCHNELL trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals in the six path. SOUL OF

Footnotes
DUKE OF FENWAY stalked the pace for six furlongs under strong restraint, rallied three wide to make the lead in upper stretch then widened the balance of
the trip under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. C C'S CLEAR CREEK pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs then was no match for the
winner. ZINFATUATION with the second flight two wide, passed tiring rivals. DIAMOND MONEY had speed for six furlongs then wilted. KRAZY HAWK was
no factor. TRUMP FLAG was no threat. HEARNS away alertly, set the pace along the inside for six furlongs then stopped.
