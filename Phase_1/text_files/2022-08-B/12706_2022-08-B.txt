chased three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and bested the others. PRETTY SPECTACULAR pressed the pace racing close up outside, chased on the
far turn, weakened and held on for fourth. STILL DOING TIME raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and had no rally.

wide into the lane and failed to threaten. TOURING MARYANNE raced three wide early, then two wide and failed to threaten. MAGIC SURPRISE raced off

MONTAUK SUMMER raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the final
furlong, surged late and was up in time in a driving finish. SHADIZAAR was off slowly, trailed the field, moved up on the far turn, swung wide at the quarter
pole, came five wide into the stretch, closed well late outside and was just up to get the place spot. THERE ARE NO WORDS stalked close up two wide,
then pressed the pace, bid on the far turn, dueled, led into the stretch, shook free, dug in gamely, drifted out a bit late and battled to the wire. TWO
STEPPIN KLUKI pulled early on the inside, then tracked inside, chased on the far turn and rallied between horses in the stretch drive. PASSPORT raced off
the pace inside, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and was outkicked. AGENT CREED raced two wide off the pace, chased between
rivals on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly between foes. DUE VINI set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn and
weakened. LEO MONTE raced off the pace inside, was asked on the far turn and lacked a bid.

urging. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT raced three wide early, moved up four wide to contest the pace on the backside, dueled three wide on the far turn, dug in
gamely and came up second best. DUSTED stalked early on, vied three wide on the backside, dueled between rivals on the far turn, weakened and held on
for third. ONLY GIRL raced four wide early, vied five wide on the backside, chased three wide on the far turn and gained mildly outside in the lane. ROWDY
CACKALACKY raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and gained mildly. WAR IN PARADISE was fractious in the gate just prior to the
start, then broke in air and awkwardly for a terrible start, raced two wide off the pace, moved up a bit entering the far turn, then gave way. FREEDOM'S
ALLURE cleared the field entering the first turn, rated the pace on the backside and gave way readily on the far turn. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start,
the race was declared official.
