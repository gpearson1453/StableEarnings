Footnotes
KING ECLIPTICAL dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn and gained a short lead, then kicked clear in the final furlong to prove best
under a drive. NAUTICAL NATURE dueled for the lead outside the winner, came three wide into the lane and battled on gamely for the place award.
HYMN'S SYLVIA was well placed and on the inside on the turn, awaited room leaving the turn, then made a inside bid but flattened out late. MILITARY
DRILL tracked the pace from between rivals, came four wide into the lane and had no kick. TOMASCO was allowed to settle, then was two wide by the
quarter pole, angled out in the lane and had a mild kick but needed more. HELLO'NDUBAI chased the pace four wide and made a five wide bid on the turn
but flattened out.

SUMMER TO REMEMBER tracked the fast pace on the inside, then made a three wide bid entering the stretch, then prevailed late after a long drive. CALL
CURT was reserved early and got to the inside on the turn, then advanced and loomed boldly by the three sixteenths, was blocked nearing the furlong
marker, then was boxed and finally got through on the inside and just missed. BOAT'S A ROCKIN set a fast pace while clear, then was headed leaving the
furlong marker, dug in gamely but was outfinished. UNCLE ANDREW was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked a rally. DAVIDIC LINE was allowed to
settle four wide and tired. P JS SILVER DUKE showed little.

FLIGHT RISK vied for the lead along the inside, made a bid on the turn to shake clear, then drew clear leaving the turn and drew out in the furlong grounds
to prove best under a drive. MINE TO HOLD stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly
second best. FOR THE MOMENT was off a step slow, four wide into the first turn and chased the pace four wide, dropped to the rail on the turn and made a
mild bid but faded in the drive, bested rest. MEROCKETMAN was settled on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the turn and then lacked a solid rally.
THUNDER GRUNDER was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally. CATTLE DRIVE vied for the lead two to three wide and weakened. DIAMOND
SETTER was not a factor.

Footnotes
HE CAME TRUE was rated along four wide on the backstretch, then advanced three to four wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and closed well
on the outside to get up in time, driving. RUN AWAY EMPIRE was away alertly and set a pressured pace two wide, then drew clear on the backstretch,
drew off on the turn and was well clear leaving the turn, then was given steady left handed pops with the riding crop but had nothing left and was caught on
the wire to just fail. FIFTH ELEMENT pressed the pace three wide and then fell off the pace, chased the pace three wide on the turn and faded, lasted for
the show award. MARC WELLS was reserved early and saved ground and had a belated rally. CROWN'S DEFENDER pressed the pace on the inside and
weakened. GO SKIPPY GO was settled back three wide, then was pulled up leaving the turn, walked off.
