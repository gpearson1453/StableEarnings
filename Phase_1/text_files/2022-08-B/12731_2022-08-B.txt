Footnotes
GREEDY CREEDY was forwardly placed around the first turn then advanced to engage CAESARTHERULER for the early lead, dueled outside of rival
while clear over the rest, shook free at the head of the lane and finished going away while ridden out. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND was unhurried and raced off
the top two flights through the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive, finished with response and gained place. POINT
OF IMPACT raced off the clear top flight through early stages, picked up the pace two to three wide around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane and ran
along for a share. CAESARTHERULER sped to the lead at the start and led the way around the first turn, dueled inside of GREEDY CREEKY through the
backstretch and around the final turn, could not move on with the eventual winner at the head of the lane and faded in the final furlong. GINGER RULES
rated off the top flight through the backstretch, flattened midway around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

final strides. PALACEDANCER sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn, saved ground into the lane, dug in under firm handling and got
edged out late. FIREBAUGH raced in the back in opening stages, ridden along three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and edged closer in
deep stretch. ATOKAD ROSE chased the early pace, came up empty leaving the turn and faded through the lane.

HARD SPIRITS was off slow at the start and raced in the back, circled four wide into contention late on the turn, took over a slim lead at the furlong marker
and kicked clear. SING LUCY SING was forwardly placed along the inside and waited for a clear path leaving the backstretch, tipped two to three wide and
hustled along midway around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and finished second best. MOLLY BYE O tracked the early leader three wide then edged
up to challenge rival midway around the turn, dueled into upper stretch then got headed by the winner a furlong out and weakened to show. UNGLUED
sped to the lead at the start and led the way into the turn, challenged by MOLLYBYE O and dueled past the quarter pole, fought back into upper stretch then
weakened in the final furlong. KID BIZ was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased three wide in close contention around the turn then gave way.
KYLIES HOPE raced off the early pace, came two wide into the lane and lacked a rally.

LADY DAMARIS rated off the embattled top flight late through the backstretch, saved ground around the turn then tipped two wide for the drive, roused
forward to challenge DREAMINONTHENILE in the final furlong, dug in two wide under a mild drive and edged away. DREAMINONTHENILE held a slim
lead in opening stages then dueled inside a trio late on the backstretch, continued to battle with BE SINCERE around the turn, shook free at the head of the
lane and failed to contain the winner late. BE SINCERE dueled outside of DEAMINONTHENILE around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the
lane but kept on and cleared a share. SWEET STROLL raced in striking distance in opening stages and vied four deep for the lead leaving the backstretch,
continued to chase up close around the turn then came up empty. HAPPY STROLL raced off the early pace, coaxed two to three wide around the turn and
failed to respond. KAMEA raced in contention through early stages then weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
SECRET BLARNEY raced in the last flight into the turn, swung five wide into the lane, gathered momentum under right handed pressure, rallied gamely
along the outside and kicked clear. SNAP'N TAP dueled three wide for the lead around the turn and continued up close a furlong out, briefly poked a head in
front then got overtaken by the winner. WAR RON saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, tipped two wide at the eighth pole and
stayed on with response. VOODAYO tracked the embattled trio four wide around the turn, hustled up four to five wide into the lane, continued in range a
furlong out and ran on evenly. RED WHITE AND LOUD dueled inside of rivals for the lead in opening stages, battled on around the turn, held a slim lead a
furlong out then gave way. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE raced in the back along the outside, swung wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. KING DEUCE
dueled between rivals for the early lead, sustained response into upper stretch then faded in the final furlong.
