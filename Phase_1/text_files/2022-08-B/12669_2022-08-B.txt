Footnotes
HANNITY was prominent along the inside before being wrangled back entering the first turn, settled into a pocket stalking position around that bend,
smoothly tipped to the four path to take aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, edged closer to that foe leaving the furlong grounds to bid entering
the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. MARKITOFF set the pace along the inside via a soft tempo around the first turn, showed the way from a
pressing foe while taking the two path around the far turn, shook clear after tipping to the three path entering the lane, dug in to resist HANNITY's bid in the
final furlong, and was collared nearing the wire. MOLIERE broke a step slowly before being taken back from tight quarters between horses at the start,
trailed the field in the two to three paths around both turns, then rallied between horses in the closing stages to reach show at the wire. KENTUCKY COOL
stalked outside of the leader before pressing entering the backstretch, chased in the three path turning for home, but faded after floating to the five path
entering the lane, sustained a chase thereafter while maintaining a minor share, but got nailed at the wire for show. RUDIGER broke a bit out and brushed a
foe at the start, rated off of the pace along the inside while a path off of the rail, improved inside of foes in upper stretch to be in position to produce a rail
charge, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, and failed to menace. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME settled off of the pace in the three path, produced a five wide rally
around the far turn to bid for place in the six path in upper stretch, but leveled off while drifting to a path outwardly and flopping back to his left lead. TIZ
LIGHT THE WAY tracked two wide, shifted four wide and between horses turning for home, but lacked a bid. JAMMERS JUSTICE tracked three wide, but
faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
NEED SOME MONEY settled off of the pace along the inside after leaning a bit inwardly at the start, rated many lengths off of the top trio, quickly cut in to
their advantage around the far turn, but paused once right behind them at the five sixteenths pole, patiently awaited racing room turning for home, slipped
through along the rail in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds as an outer DESTINE TO RACE did the same, and swiftly kicked clear. DESTINE TO
RACE broke inwardly and avoided veering due to the presence of the inner railing, spotted the leaders multiple lengths in the process, shifted out to the four
path while settling outside of foes and the back of the pack around the opening hook, rallied in the five path around the far turn to circle the leading quartet
turning for home, produced a bid nearing the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner surging foe leaving that juncture, and proved second best.
MARSANNE bumped with an outer foe at the start, sped clear in the three path nearing the backstretch, tucked to the two path approaching the far turn as a
pair of foes pressed, clung to an advantage around the far turn, shook free of them passing the quarter pole, but was only clear briefly before meeting a pair
of bids on either side approaching the furlong grounds, and was overhauled. FASHION IDOL stalked outside of the top pair and from the five path around
the first turn, pressed them from the four path around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe entering the lane, and yielded in upper stretch. RUM
RUNNER READY stalked in the four path while inside of a stalking counterpart, inched closer to press the leader from the three path nearing the far turn,
vied between horses around that bend, but gave way entering the lane. SOLO ALBUM bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced far back two wide, and
was outrun.

Footnotes
EYE OF THE CAT trailed after being last away, rated kindly off of the hot pace, gained in the two to three path around the far turn while following bidding
foes turning for home, tipped five wide and outside of them in upper stretch, rallied with a flourish to bid inside the final furlong, dueled with a game TIZ
TACT TOE through the late stages, and prevailed. TIZ TACT TOE settled far back in the two to three path, gained three wide around the far turn to bid for
the lead in the four path turning for home along with an inner FORWARD CURVE, vied with that foe in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead while
receiving a brush from that one at the furlong grounds, gamely battled on from between horses when an outer EYE OF THE CAT joined the fray soon after,
sparred gallantly with that one through the closing stages, but was bested. FORWARD CURVE prompted inside of MY BROTHER CAM into the first turn,
stalked that run-away foe down the backstretch while well clear of the rest of the field, bid for the lead in the three path turning for home as an outer TIZ
TACT TOE loomed boldly, vied with that foe through upper stretch, but came out and brushed him at the furlong grounds, then yielded a sixteenth from
home. EL AHIJADO laid in midpack two wide, tracked while inching closer in the two path around the far turn, but only managed to chase outer leaders
through the lane. MY BROTHER CAM bobbled slightly while still breaking well, vied two wide into the first turn, ran off to a clear advantage around that
bend, but was collared by a pair of foes at the quarter pole, and stopped through the lane. CHISHOLM TRAIL tracked from midpack along the inside, but
was through after a half a mile, and eased turning for home.

Footnotes
RESPECTFUL hesitated and broke multiple lengths slow at the start, steadily gained along the inside once leveling into stride, easily ranged up inside of the
leading pair entering the turn, bid for the lead while in well in hand at the three furlong pole, shook clear of her outer counterparts entering the lane,
responded readily when set down in upper stretch, held sway from a gamely chasing AMARYLLIS KISS into the final furlong, then just lasted to the wire.
AMARYLLIS KISS stalked outside of the leader and from the four path early on, tucked to the three path nearing the turn, bid for the lead approaching the
three furlong pole before an inner RESPECTFUL joined the fray, vied three wide, inched a narrow margin at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by a
ground saving aforementioned foe entering the lane, gamely chased thereafter, determinedly closed in inside the final sixteenth, but missed reeling in that
rival at the wire. TWILIGHT DREAMS was slow into stride in the opening furlong trailed in the three path into the turn, rallied in the five path turning for
home, and sustained a strong charge while cutting the gap on the top pair through the final furlong. INDIGO MISS sped to the front early on tucked from the
three path to the two path entering the turn, met bids from rivals on either side nearing the three furlong pole, vied between horses turning or home, but
gave way to them in upper stretch, then was vanned off. CANDY ISLAND tracked in the five path, tucked to the three path into the turn, but came under a
drive to keep pace at the three furlong pole, and faded turning for home. SURE SHOT ANNIE laid off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved.

Footnotes
MO STASH broke a step slowly before inching closer inside inside of foes to be forwardly placed after a furlong, stalked the top pair from the two path,
tipped outside of them at the five sixteenths pole, sustained his advance to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled with a game inner CUORE SACRO
thereafter, sparred while wandering about a bit in the final furlong, and prevailed nearing the wire. CUORE SACRO dueled for the lead two wide, then from
between horses turning for home after MO STASH bid, gamely resisted that foe's challenge through upper stretch after their inner counterpart faltered,
tenaciously fought on through the final furlong, but was bested while being put to a bit of tight quarters at the wire. THE BOOKKEEPER chased the dueling
pair from the outside early on, got floated four wide while sustaining striking position turning for home, and kept on through the lane to prove best of the rest.
HUNTER'S DRIVE tracked in midpack in the five path, tucked to the three path around the turn before moving back to the five path entering the lane, and
stayed on. SAILOR'S CHANCE raced in midpack in the two path, and failed to menace. ICONICUS leaned outwardly at the start, raced far back in the three
path, came into the lane in the five path, avoided trouble from an ahead drifting foe in upper stretch, and moved up. MEANT TO BE LUCKY broke slowly,
settled far back in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but steadied when interfered by an outer lugging PREMIUM at the furlong grounds.
PREMIUM laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, but lugged inwardly approaching
midstretch. MONEY RUN was hustled along to duel for the lead inside of CUORE SACRO, vied inside of the eventual top pair turning for home, but
weakened in upper stretch. FAST TRAFFIC broke slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
CANT BE TOUCHED quickly cleared, set the pace while well in hand in the two path around the turn, then drew off under moderate hand urging through the
lane. SWEET CONFUSION broke slowly before shying from the inner chain reaction of interfered rivals at the start, trailed leaving the chute, gained three
wide nearing the turn to a tracking position, chased in pursuit of JOY ENAMORADA for place through the final furlong, reached that position at the sixteenth
pole, and just lasted from an inner bidding rival via a tight photo. SENORITA AURORA was bumped and forced out multiple paths by an inner foe at the
start, trailed after a quarter mile, surpassed an inner foe while picking up stride turning for home, shifted inside of a pair of foes at the furlong grounds,
brushed an inner MURGATROYD in the process, then stayed on to bid inside of SWEET CONFUSION for place in the late stages, but just missed. JOY
ENAMORADA came out and impacted a trio of rivals at the start, stalked outside of the clear leader and from the three path around the turn, but failed to
keep pace with that one entering the lane, and faltered between horses a sixteenth from home. MURGATROYD tracked along the inside, but came under
urging turning for home to keep pace, and failed to respond before being brushing by an outer foe entering the final furlong. BEVERLY'S CHARGE shifted
ground outwardly while being bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked in midpack two wide, but was done early.

Footnotes
QUICK MUNNY stalked the clear leader as that one's closest pursuer, ranged up to her turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper
stretch, and held sway safely thereafter. MY MY MUNNY tracked along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane to take aim outside of a newly leading
QUICK MUNNY, but only managed to chase that one thereafter, and denied an inner bidding BITTY BOSS place through the final sixteenth. BITTY BOSS
settled far back in the three path, crept forward in hand while tucking to the two path around the turn, tracked from behind the main group turning for home,
rallied inside of foes entering the lane, took aim between place-vying horses nearing the final furlong, sustained a charge to bid for that position inside of MY
MY MUNNY in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. THE CLUB was void of early speed and trailed into the turn, shifted from the three path to the seven
path in midstretch to rally outside of foes, and produced a good, but belated, kick. BROADWAY BLAZE chased from the three path while between horses,
and failed to menace. STORM CHARGING broke outwardly, tracked in the four path while outside of rivals, got floated to the five path entering the lane, and
faded between horses in the final furlong. STELLA TERESA broke sharply while shifting ground a touch outwardly, quickly cleared soon after, showed the
way before being confronted by the eventual winner at the quarter pole, offered little resistance entering the lane, and caved in upper stretch. SOCIAL
MANDATE raced far back in the two path and never got involved. HOPE AND DREAMS shied from an outwardly-breaking inner rival at the start causing her
to break towards the rear, raced well back while remaining away from inner foes, failed to respond to a tight left rein and a right handed crop nearing the
turn, refused to tuck inwardly entering it, then remained in the six path while outrun around the bend.

Footnotes
MR. CUNNINGHAM stumbled outwardly at the start, stalked the top pair from the three path, assumed command from them at the three furlong pole, drifted
outwardly nearing the lane as TRICOLOUR pursued, dueled with that inner bidding foe through the final furlong while continuing to lug out, yet just held.
TRICOLOUR laid off of the pace along the inside, commenced a gain four wide between horses into the far turn, took aim on a clear MR CUNNINGHAM
turning for home, shifted inside of that lugging foe entering the lane, ranged up to bid in the final furlong, dueled through the late stages, but hung. BEOCCA
was bumped and herded outwardly by inner foes leaving the gates, then clipped heels a few strides later, settled at the rear along the inside, rallied three to
five wide and between horses turning for home, and stayed on well through the final furlong. KEEP ON bumped and shied from inner troubled foes at the
start causing him to come away towards the rear, settled far back two wide, rallied three wide and between horses turning for home to bid for show entering
the lane, but was outkicked in the final furlong. COMMAND CENTRAL tracked two wide, got floated five wide into the far turn, vied for show while tucking
three wide turning for home, but yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. FLAGSTONE was bumped and bothered by an inner foe at the start, laid off
of the pace in the four path, got floated to the six path around the far turn, and made little impact. GO VIRTUAL took up between horses at the start, trailed
in the three path, and improved late. GET US ONE was brushed between horses at the start, settled far back along the inside, but was shuffled back behind
stopping foes around the far turn, and made little impact. BICKELL brushed an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, shifted thee wide and between
horses into the far turn, chased while vying inside of rivals for show entering the lane, but faded. LARK laid off of the pace in the three path, and faded in the
five path around the far turn. MR. MARIAH bumped an inner foe, lost her iron while shifting a path outwardly in the aftermath, yet was prominent early,
dueled two wide after the rider regathered her iron into the first turn, but weakened at the three furlong poel. ARTIE AND JESSIE dueled for the lead along
the inside, but stopped at the three furlong pole.
