Footnotes
YES IT'S ERIE never far back, moved to position on the two path through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain
and drove clear late. SKY DIETY well placed, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
lacked the needed late kick. LADY MARVEL broke out checking on heels at the start, pulled to contention, held position three wide through the turn, shook
clear into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. ODD GAL unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and had a mild late gain. LETS RACE LADYS allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, closed
willingly and missed a share. WILD LOOKER passed tiring rivals. DAVE'S TEXAS LADY sent from the gate, sprinted clear, then faded in the lane. HOT
AUGUST STORM tracked the pace, steadied on heels through the turn, then faded inside.

Footnotes
MUY CHISTOSA well placed and inside, moved to position two and three wide through the turn, angled inside a drifting leader, then made a steady gain
and drew off late. LIBERTALIA well placed and outside, gained a short lead on the two path through the turn, shook clear drifting four wide into the stretch,
then was no match for the winner and held the place. RIO DEL ARMOUR unhurried in the early going, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came
three wide into the stretch and had a mild late gain. OSTARA mid pack, looped four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and flattened out.
SHEER ALICE (GB) sprinted clear early, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded the final furlong. BUTTON CANDY reluctant to load,
improved position. CARINA'S WAY well placed, lost some ground three wide through the turn, then drifted in and faded in the lane. GRAND VENUS passed
a tiring rival. MY GIRL MELLY showed little, inside.

Footnotes
TAP THE TITTLES broke a step slowly loosing her path at the start, was unhurried to the stretch, angled widest at the furlong marker, then made a steady
gain and drove clear. ZIP CODE ENVY allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, angled five wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and edged up for the place. MEGAN MAKIN MONEY set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, drew off in the stretch, then weakened
late to finish on equal terms with WARRIOR'S RANSOM for the show. WARRIOR'S RANSOM well placed, gained a striking position three and four wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and finished on equal terms with MEGAIN MAKIN MONEY. LA PANDA
broke in at the start, steadied on heels into the turn, raced boxed through the turn, came through inside and weakened the final furlong. HONEY HAULER
stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch. AZTEC PRINCESS tracked the pace in the early
going, faded through the turn. FAST MULE loose before the start, was reluctant to load, moved up two and three wide through the turn, then drifted in and
faded in the lane.

Footnotes
RIVERSIDE WALK (GB) sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final yards and lasted under steady pressure. LAWN DART tracked
the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and missed. MERINO WOOL never far back, held position on the two
path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. SWEET MOOCHIE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside into the stretch, angled out and passed tiring rivals. CHEROKEE CHATTER ran evenly for a half saving ground inside, came through
and weakened the final furlong. LITTLEBITALILY well placed, held position three wide through the turn, then drifted out and had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
GINS AND TINS well placed and outside, gained a short lead three wide through the turn, shook clear into the strertch, drew off, then lasted under steady
pressure. LIFE MISSION tracked the pace, raced boxed through the turn, came through, waited, angled out when clear, then angled in late and closed the
gap on the winner. WHERE YOU WAS allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed late kick. BEAT THE DEALER well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had a
mild gain. SUMMERFEST allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled four wide into the stretch and improved his
position. CALL ME LATER mid pack, gained position three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and flattened out. CAJUN
CASANOVA ran evenly for a half and had no stretch rally. PANAMA PAUL set the pace on the inside and faded into the stretch. STEVIS MAN stalked the
early pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path and faded the final furlong.

gain. GENERALONAMISSION allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and evened out. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE improved
