Footnotes
COYSTER was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held off the closing
COWBOY TOBY by a diminishing margin. COWBOY TOBY lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive,
rallied late and was getting to the winner. WILLY TELL HIM pressed the pace of the winner from between foes and gave way after going a half. SOUTHERN
SUMMER was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. OVER EZ showed no early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DECK HUMOR broke sharply to press the pace of HESA PROSPECTOR while racing three-wide, dropped off the foe into the lane, responded to steady
urging and wore that rival down to be going away late. HESA PROSPECTOR was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin
nearing the three-sixteenths pole and yielded to the winner late. DIABOLICAL KING was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for
the drive and failed to gain late. CHAMPITO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. ALMOST A STORM lacked
early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FULL OF DRIVE was off a step slow and lagged throughout.
