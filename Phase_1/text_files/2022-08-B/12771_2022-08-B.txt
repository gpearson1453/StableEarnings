Footnotes
BAILEYS RUN tracked in the two path, bid between foes into the lane, and drew clear. WILLACY chased two wide, was ridden from the three path into the
stretch, and rallied. AGENT MULGANNON prompted the pace two wide, was roused from three wide into the lane, but finished evenly. COMMAND TO
FIRE led from three wide into the stretch but yielded in the final furlong. SWIFT DANCER stalked inside, was cued while saving ground into the lane, but
weakened. CHARMING COUNCIL trailed from the three path into the stretch and never threatened. SERGEANT PARKER raced in midpack from inside but
faded into the stretch.

stretch, gained ground on the outside and pulled clear late. BLACK CURRENCY bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel
up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and chased the winner to the wire while drifting out in the final furlong. KIMSFAVORITESTORM
dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and kept on in the lane. RIGHT TO
ASSEMBLE bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn, swung
wider still entering the stretch and was outkicked from there. NOBLE PRESENT dueled on the inside in the early going, gave way while saving ground
around the turn and faded further in the lane. HOLLYWOOD HONEY dueled between horses in the opening stages, raced in the three path around the turn
and tired in the stretch. EXPECT A CIRCUS bumped with the horses to either side and was forced back leaving the gate, trailed the field on the inside up
the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. FIVE K KITTEN raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the
turn and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
LA SAMANA LAURA led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off under a
drive. SERIOUS MOMENT pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, and chased the
winner home to hold second. FASHIONISTA stalked the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the
turn and finished evenly. HOT BOTTOM GIRL chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and kept on in the lane
despite her rider losing the whip in upper stretch. PIPERS GOLD tracked the leader on the inside early, dropped back and checked mildly in traffic entering
the turn, saved ground from there and was empty in the lane. IMAGINTHEKISS bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, settled off the pace for the
run up the backstretch, raced in the five path around the turn and made no bid. KERFORD'S COMMISH bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the
gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and was never a threat.

SPOTTED CAT stalked inside, was roused while saving ground into the stretch, and rallied. STIMULUS MAKER prompted the pace four wide, was cued
while two wide into the lane, and ran on. MENTALIST led from inside, was coaxed from the three path into the stretch, and kept on. PLAYBOY ROY rated in
the three path, was in the four path going into the lane, and had mild kick. SAM IN STYLE was unhurried from inside, tipped out to the six path into the lane,
but finished evenly. SKYDIVING was wellback and three wide, was ridden four wide into the stretch, but flattened. THE WILD FLYER tracked inside,
steadied into the far turn, and was never a threat. THATZA ALPHA raced in midpack from two wide but was empty going into the lane. SIMILAR TASTE
pressed three wide but dropped out entering the far turn. LOVE ME ARCHIE trailed early and was no menace.

Footnotes
CHORUS GIRL bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up
the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground steadily down the lane to get up
late. ROSALITA led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way on the rail around the second
bend, and raced gamely in the stretch, drifting out and getting caught at the wire. TAKE JOY raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders
between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path and finished evenly. LA SOBRINA pressed the pace from the two path
through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER saved ground around the first
turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. STORMARELLA bumped
with the horse to her outside at the leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, angled in to save ground around the far
turn and was empty from there. LIVELY REMARK hopped up and was away from the gate slowly, raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field
on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
ANTALYA raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the two and three path
around the far turn, gained ground on the outside and pulled clear late. STACK SHACK showed the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued to lead from the rail around the second bend and in upper stretch, was caught with a furlong to go and chased that rival to the wire.
RED WIND hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, challenged from
the two path coming around the far turn and proved to be no match for the top two while finishing evenly. MAP EM UP raced in the three path around the
first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and was outkicked in the lane. OBLIO'S WISH
saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the lane.
KINDA LUCKY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and made no bid. ALL
ABOUT KATHERN saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two
path and was empty from there.
