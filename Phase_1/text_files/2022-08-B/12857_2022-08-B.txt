Footnotes
LYINATTHEBAR bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed early on, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch
run, came within aim on the second turn, made a steady advance on APPLAUD THE BENCH in the drive, overtook that one inside of the sixteenth marker
and edged away late. APPLAUD THE BENCH was asked to show early speed and went to the early lead, set reasonable fractions through the backstretch
run, extended the lead in upper stretch, came under pressure in the final sixteenth, could not hold off the winner late and was overtaken in the final stages
while besting the rest. GOLD RUSH GAL rated off of the early pace while three wide, maintained position into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and
was outkicked by the top pair late, while clear of the rest for third. BREAKFAST BALL was reserved off of the early pace, was a bit hard to place along the
backstretch run, improved position on the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and made a mild late rally but lacked the needed response.
MOONSHINE CAT lunged at the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn and did not offer a late rally. SOUND
OF THE SURF settled just off of the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run, lost contact on the far turn, was eased through the lane and walked
off under his own power.

SHOULD BE ILLEGAL took back off of the early speed, advanced while in hand to confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, overtook
HANDR'SDREAM leaving the turn, opened to a clear lead in mid-stretch and was kept to task in the final stages. HANDR'SDREAM was asked for early
speed and was sent to the front, set quick fractions through the turn, could not hold off the winner leaving the quarter marker, chased SHOULD BE ILLEGAL
into the drive and was no match late for that one but stayed on to secure second. CHIEF JACKSON chased the early pace from a ground saving position,
angled out leaving the bend, could not reel in the top pair late but rallied for third in the end. BARHOPSKY was a bit slow into early stride and lacked speed
to the turn, made up ground in the drive and showed good late interest in the final sixteenth to challenge for third. THEYREMINISCEOVERU raced close to
the early pace, lost ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased the top pair into the stretch run and faded in the final furlong.

OH GREAT (IRE) took command of the early lead, set solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, extended the lead along the second
turn, drew off in the stretch run and was geared down late as much the best. QUE SERA SIR RALPH stalked the early pace from a ground saving position,
maintained position through the backstretch run, improved position in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive and held well for second in
the end. COMMAND A PREMIUM raced close to the early pace, attended to the solid fractions through the far turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and was
clear for third in the end. ETHAN'S ANIMAL settled off of the early pace while maintaining a three wide path, came four wide along the second turn and was
not a late factor. LOVE OF THE SPORT tracked the early pace while three wide, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost position on the
second turn and tired in the drive. HANDS OFF settled off of the early solid pace, saved ground through the backstretch run, was outrun on the second turn,
was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.

AWESOME DUDE took back off of the early quick pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth
and was up in the final strides to prevail. MIKE DAD was asked for early speed and pressed the quick pace, advanced to confront WICKLOW HILLS in
upper stretch, dueled with that rival to deep stretch, took a narrow lead in the final strides and was just tagged on the wire for the win, while holding for
second. WICKLOW HILLS showed early speed and set quick contested fractions through the turn, was confronted by MIKE DAD in upper stretch, dueled
with that foe to deep stretch and was just edged out for the win and place, while holding safely for third. HOLIDAY HUSTLE tracked the quick pace outside
of rivals, lost ground in upper stretch, made a mild late rally but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. CURLY ESA was a bit slow into early stride, chased
the pace from the inside and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
TIZ AN EDVENTURE settled off of the early pace, raced between rivals through the backstretch run, was roused to go two then three wide into the drive,
came within aim nearing the furlong marker, shifted widest in the final sixteenth and showed a good late kick in the end to prevail. LA REINE'S LEGACY
took command of the early pace, set prompted fractions through the second turn, was headed by LA VIKINA in upper stretch, took a narrow lead into deep
stretch, was caught in the final stages and held for second. LA VIKINA was forwardly placed early on, prompted the moderate pace through the backstretch
run, advanced to confront the pacesetter leaving the second turn, dueled with LA REINE'S LEGACY to mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and
held well late for third. FAIRY TALE BLISS rated just off of the early pace, improved position on the backstretch run, ran evenly while along the inside on the
far turn, advanced in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. ASSIGNATION settled off of the early pace, saved ground to the second turn,
improved position in upper stretch but could not muster a late rally. STRIKE AT DAWN raced close to the early pace, was a bit rank along the backstretch
run, lost position three to four wide on the second turn and came up empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TAM'S TIME was forwardly placed early on, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position into the far turn, made a three wide bid into the
drive, headed PICK BYMY FRIEND in mid-stretch, dueled with that rival to the wire and won the nod in the final strides. PICK BYMY FRIEND settled just off
of the early pace, gained ground on the far turn, confronted TAM'S TIME in mid-stretch, dueled gamely while inside of the winner in the final sixteenth and
was bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest for second. DANNY MICHAEL rated off of the early pace, saved ground along the first turn, came
three wide along the second turn, could not reel in the top two in the final furlong but finished well in the end to secure third. SUBITO SLEW was unhurried
early on, was roused four wide on the far turn, improved position while widest in upper stretch and found his best stride in the late stages to challenge for
third. FROMAJACKTOAKING was bothered at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the pace, came four wide on the second turn and offered
mild late rally in the stretch run. OMMANEY BAY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid early fractions, drew to a clear lead nearing the
second turn, could not hold off the top pair in the drive and faded in the final stages. SLIGHT APPROVAL settled off of the pace, saved ground to the
second turn and did not offer a late response. THECHIEFHASTRICKS lunged at the start and bothered FROMAJACKTOAKING leaving the break, came
three wide while off of the pace on the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run, kept that three wide path into the second turn and tired in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
JOHNNY DAR broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well rated while carving out solid fractions through the backstretch run, held foes at bay
through the stretch run and proved best late. THE LONNA RANGER was away in good order and stalked the solid pace from a two wide path, made up a bit
of ground on the winner along the far turn, could not made headway on JOHNNY DAR in the drive and was outfinished in the final stages, while besting the
rest. VANDENBERG tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, improved position on the second turn, was outkicked by the top pair in the drive but
stayed on to hold well for third. BIG BROTHER was crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the early pace, improved position on the
second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. NINE HUNDRED DAYS raced in midpack through the first half-mile, lost position while
three wide on the second turn and lacked a late response. BLUE SILVER stalked the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost
position on the second turn and faltered in the stretch run. COUSIN MARK settled off of the early pace, saved ground through the backstretch run, lost
ground three wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. MAQAMAT broke in at the start and crowded BIG BROTHER at the break, lacked speed
through the early stages, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under his own power.

PLAYING HARDBALL stumbled at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the quick early pace, came two wide along the turn, slipped inside in
upper stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, closed fast along the rail in the final sixteenth and was up in time to prevail. HANDSOME GARY
chased the quick early pace outside of rivals, swung five wide into upper stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final stages but finished well in the end
to get up for second. GREAT STORY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was engaged by QUANTUM QUEST nearing the turn and dueled with
that rival through quick fractions to the quarter marker, shook free in mid-stretch but could not hold off the oncoming top two late and was just edged for
second in the end while holding on for third. RUNKERRY raced close to the early pace, tracked the quick pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch,
was outkicked in the final furlong and was just edged out for the minor awards. MURPHYS TIGER was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn, lost ground
three wide nearing the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. BOBBY'S ALIBI broke out at the start, checked in tight quarters soon after the break and
dropped back to trail early on, chased three wide through the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and showed good late interest while unable to threaten
at the end. QUANTUM QUEST was sent after the early lead and dueled with GREAT STORY through the turn while setting fast fractions, lost ground to that
rival in mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. ROYAL JESTER hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, raced between rivals while tracking the
quick early pace, lost position on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.
