Footnotes
CURL dueled on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn and drew off down the lane. LA DIAMANT bumped with the
horses to either side leaving the gate and was forced back to trail the field early, saved ground around the turn and put in a late run to improve position
through the final furlong. CATTY DOM brushed with the horse to her inside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, switched to the inside in upper stretch and gained ground mildly to the wire. INDIAN AFFAIR dueled for
the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch.
BLUSHING BABE stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leaders on the outside early, raced in the two and three path around the turn and
flattened out in the lane. MISSY MIA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and made
no bid. REBEL RYETTE veered in and bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, chased the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and tired in the lane. TRAVELIN LADY raced off the pace between horses in the early going, began to drop back while saving
ground around the turn and was empty from there.

Footnotes
ABBIE'S WAY chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch
and held off a late closer at the wire. LITTLE SAMURAI raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground late.
TIME IS PRECIOUS tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. BLUE XCHANGE trailed the
field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. ELEGANT CRICKET led the
field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and faded in the final furlong. CARMON'S DANCE raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside in the opening stages, moved up to challenge from the four path coming around the turn and tired in the stretch. RAGTIME RYTHM
raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and was never a factor. PER RULING FROM THE NEW
MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, ABBIE'S WAY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

ANCIENT LAND led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and held that margin to the wire. WILMAS IRISH ROVER
chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained
ground steadily in the lane to narrowly miss. ALL CHROME bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, chased the pace setters between horses
through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. SIGALERT pressed the pace on the outside in the early going,
dueled from the two path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. SEA EMPEROR raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the opening
stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. DIRT ROAD RED trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and
was never a factor. SECRET POTION bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the
turn from the three path and tired in the stretch.

BELLA DONA dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that
margin to the wire. PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and gained
ground between horses late. SHUGS CHARLIE tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and finished
evenly, just missing second. FLAXY LADY trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up while racing in the four and five path
around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and continued to improve position from there. LEMON DROP GOLD stalked the front runner on the
outside up the backstretch, raced between horses in the three path around the turn and faded in the lane. OVERTIDE dueled on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
