Footnotes
SAN NICOLA STAR was well rationed up front setting comfortable fractions early, repelled a minor challenger into the far turn, opened up turning for home
and increased her lead with a sixteenth left going away at the wire. CHEEKY PINT tracked the pacesetters inside with a half mile to run, began to advance
on the fence through the far turn, angled out in the three path between horses for the run through the stretch and could not gain on the winner late.
SAMURAI FIGHTER chased the winner down the backside, was roused midway on the far turn to keep up with the front running winner and finished up
evenly through the lane holding onto third. MUSKOKA LADY stalked mid pack between runners at the three eighths pole, was coaxed on the rail through the
far turn, angled out running down the lane and showed some interest late to get a minor share. IVY'S STAR was allowed to settle at the rear saving ground
on the inside early, offered little when the running started on the far turn and passed only tiring runners in the stretch. SNOW SQUALL rated outside foes
mid pack down the backstretch, contended entering the far turn and when asked for more turning for home had little to give and weakened in the drive.
MAMITA'S CHICA raced four wide throughout, settled near the rear early on, was asked for run in the far turn and offered no response.

Footnotes
SUPREMEACTION was urged along at the break and ridden hard throughout while pressing from between rivals, went three wide on the turn, lost ground
on the leader into upper stretch but kept on to take over past the sixteenth pole and hold safe. TRAGICALLY FUNNY broke out and was in a bit tight early,
switched out and kept wide early, moved back inside to save ground on the turn trailing the field, angled eight wide into the stretch and was gaining but too
late. CHAIRMAN FOX bumped with a rival at the start, moved through inside to contest the lead then edge away to dictate terms racing just off the rail
through the turn, was clear in upper stretch but could not kick on with the top ones. ACTION POINT bumped with a rival at the start, began to advance two
to three wide heading to the turn, angled out nearing the three-eighths bumping a rival hard, moved back in about the quarter pole and kept on inside to just
miss show honors. SCENIC HOLIDAY switched out early, advanced some four to five wide nearing the turn, was bumped just outside the three-eighths
poles, came into upper stretch six to seven deep and ran on. BODIE advanced inside on the turn, came out two to three wide past the quarter pole and
loomed a threat then evened out. NGABE vied outside for the early lead then continued to chase five wide, moved closer four to five deep on the turn, came
up empty. BLACK BOGANDA was forwardly-placed between runners early then chased four wide, dropped back heading to the turn, was bumped hard into
a rival nearing the three-eighths and faded thereafter. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY ACTION POINT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND
PLACED EIGHTH BEHIND BLACK BOGANDA FOR INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN.

Footnotes
OWEN'S SOUPER MOON broke sharp to be in front going into the first turn, surrendered to lead down the backstretch to patiently sit inside just off the
frontrunner, shot up the rail midway on the far turn to assume command coming into upper stretch and was kept to the task to hold off an inside closer at the
finish. PERFECT PLAY settled at the rear early to trail, started to advance up the rail with three eighths to go, found clear running room on the fence through
the far turn and closed well inside down the lane to make it a race for the win at the wire. CAM WOOLLEY pressed the pace going into the first turn just
outside, took over the lead entering the backstretch, was headed at the mid point on the far turn, gave way with a quarter out and held on well down the lane
to be an unchallenged third at the finish. MY REDEMPTION tracked the pacesetters through the half, waited between and behind horses on the far turn,
angled out for run going five wide at the top of the stretch and closed belatedly to get up for a small award. SUMMER SHANDEE began to pick off horses
advancing outside through the backside, was in contention up close to the frontrunners with three furlongs to go, then was ridden hard between runners a
quarter mile out only to yield in upper stretch. BRUTALITY settled near the back in the early stages of the race, commenced a mild rally four wide outside
rivals running on the far turn and stalled in the stretch drive at the furlong marker. LATE SURGE rated mid pack inside in the beginning, was roused on the
far turn to stay in touch with the rest of the field and could not make an impact running to the wire.

Footnotes
OCELOT was urged forward inside to track the pacesetter, switched outside that one three wide past the quarter pole, engaged in upper stretch and took
the lead in mid-stretch then forged clear under steady handling. I'M A CHI TOO got away well, set the pace with some pressure from others, edged clear
heading to the turn racing off the rail, was challenged in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner and just got the nod for second. RACE FOR PINKS
was forwardly-positioned stalking the pace from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, kept on but just missed the place in a head-bob. KID
FORESTER settled off the pace, went four wide now mid-pack through the turn, improved position heading to mid-stretch and ran on. HIGH HEAT settled
off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, was last but one at the top of the stretch but showed late interest to improve position up the rail. BROWNING
ISLAND raced off the pace between rivals to the turn, rated in behind foes two wide early on that bend, came out past the quarter pole and swung five to six
wide in upper stretch, ran on. SEA SCOUT lacked early speed despite some encouragement while trailing the field near the inside into the turn, moved out
four wide past the quarter pole, came out further in the stretch and was never a threat. SOUPER RIVER pursued from mid-pack three wide, weakened in
the stretch. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE chased from the two path inside rivals, came up empty.

Footnotes
SAILOR'S PASSION saved ground through the beginning stages of the race, rallied up the rail with three eighths to go, angled just off the fence splitting
horses at the top of the stretch and was gaining steadily in the last eighth to get up nearing the finish. GENDRAGON tracked the early speed through the
half, began to inch closer to the pacesetter going into the far turn, assumed control at the quarter pole to open up in mid stretch but could not find enough
late to hold off the late closer nearing the wire. STOP THE HUMBUG trailed the field midway down the backside, commenced a run going into the far turn
opting to go outside four wide nearing the quarter pole and could not offer enough finish late to challenge the top two in the end. MASTER SPY was loose
on the the lead in the early stages of the race, was headed on the outside nearing the quarter pole, began to weaken at the furlong marker and was tiring
late in deep stretch holding on for a minor placing. BOKERMIN rated just outside mid field with a half to run, started to make a bid with a quarter to go and
was floated out at the top of the stretch, drifted inwards at the furlong marker while under urging and ran evenly to the finish. KOSMONAVT settled at the
back of the field after the break, was ridden inside on the far turn and could never get into contention through the lane. BEYOND MY DREAMS settled near
the rear in the early stages, was shuffled back to trail into the far turn and while roused in mid stretch lost paths through the run to the wire and could not be
a factor. FAY DAN rated just outside runners mid pack down the backside, was roused on the far turn to keep up and retreated between runners through the
stretch run.

Footnotes
VOLATA was a bit hard to load, got away well and tracked inside, bid along the rail about the three-eighths, drew clear in the stretch and was geared down
late. ADMONISH settled inside off the pace, saved ground through the first turn and into the second, asked for more at the five-sixteenths, shifted out at the
quarter pole coming five wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit and ran on to get up for second. SKINNY DIPPIN set the pace racing off the rail, weakened in
the stretch and lost place late. CARLA'S HONOR was forwardly-positioned outside three to four wide, began to drop back late on the far turn and steadily
weakened. GORMLEY GIRL was up close heading to the first turn three wide, moved in and dropped back off the pace, asked for more three furlongs out,
came out four wide coming to the quarter pole, failed to rally. PHIL IN ECHO was toward the rear outside two to three wide on the first turn, went three to
five wide on the far turn while asked for more at the three-eighths but produced no bid.

Footnotes
DRAGON'S KEY tracked the contesting pacesetters on the rail through the half, began to reel in the top pair turning for home to lead inside the three
sixteenth pole and was comfortably drawing away at the wire. FORITTABLE contested outside for the lead through the first half, put away the inside rival to
briefly lead turning for home but could not hold off the fast charging winner in mid stretch and had to settle for second best. ROOKIE RADAR tracked the
dueling frontrunners just outside early on, flanked the winner outside at the quarter pole and was outkicked running to the wire settling for third at the finish.
PINK GELATO was allowed to settle near the back from the start, began looping horses travelling three wide into the turn, angled out to the six path for the
stretch run looming into contention in upper stretch and levelled out with an eighth to go settling on the fringes. MAGIC SPIN chased the early speed inside
down the backstretch, poked his head in front with three eighths to go, battled for the lead through the turn and gave way on the fence with a furlong to run.
HARDWARE GAP was ridden to keep in range with the field throughout the turn and could not be a factor in the late stages of the race. IT WORKED waited
inside on the rail behind rivals into the turn, had a mild rally midway through the turn and had little to offer through the lane. SPANISH PRINCE trailed exiting
the chute, could not keep up to the field with three eighths to run and was eased through the lane crossing the wire.

Footnotes
BROKEN PROPOSAL stalked two to three wide early, advanced nearing the three-eighths to bid three wide, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, faced an
outside challenger in upper stretch and held that one at bay under steady handling. TARA LUNA raced four wide and just off the pace into the first turn,
settled mid-pack, advanced three wide on the far turn coming out a bit for the drive, made a mild bid but could not get even and was held at bay, saved the
place. FOXY DIVA shifted in two to three wide early, raced between runners up the backstretch, entered the far turn three wide beginning to pick it up,
moved out a bit nearing the quarter pole, continued to gain steadily in the stretch but missed second. TOTAL BETTY stalked early racing off the fence three
to four wide, went two wide on the far turn and within range at the top of the stretch but evened out. HUSHEMUP prompted the pace outside a foe two wide,
dispatched the inside rival on the far turn but was immediately overtaken by an outside one, weakened in the stretch. TENPENNY NAIL shifted in early
lacking early speed, came off the rail for the run up the backstretch going two wide into the far turn, swung five wide turning for home with much to do but
showed some late interest. READY CANDY broke a step slowly and in tight, raced outside three wide early, still outside four wide on the far turn, was never
near enough to threaten. HIT ME UP was in a bit tight along the rail heading to the first turn, thereupon rated inside, came out a path to pass a tiring rival
and failed to rally. TICKLE HER TOE set a pressured pace inside, was done about the three-eighths, pulled up in the stretch and walked off.
