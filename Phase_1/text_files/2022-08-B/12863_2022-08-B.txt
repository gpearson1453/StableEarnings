BRADLEY'S COWBOY rushed up to engage four wide on the turn dueling abreast rival into then down the stretch needing all to subdue foe late winning
clear. DEEP MIND broke sharply leading the way into the turn being engaged outside the quarter pole dueling from the rail down the lane ceding grudgingly
in the final yards. FANCY LANCY bumped hard being pinched back at the break, gave a mild rally on the turn moving evenly down the lane at mid track.
FACTORINO pressed early then was passed on the turn weakening into upper stretch mustering enough to hold the others. FRENCH KID was in tight
bumping at the break, played no factor. J P'S SONG veered out jamming rival jostling and nearly dislodging the rider at the break, hustled early would fade
on the turn. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START AND TOOK NO ACTION.
