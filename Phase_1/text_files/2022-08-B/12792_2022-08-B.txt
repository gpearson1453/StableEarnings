Footnotes
SUPERSONIC coaxed from the gate, dueled from the three path with VINNY TWO CENTS to his inside, got briefly shaken off half a mile from home before
advancing to knock heads once more through the turn taking over narrow command near the quarter pole, swung three then two wide straightened away
into upper stretch let out for the drive, edged clear under a drive to prevail. NECROMANCER coaxed from the start, chased along the inside, had NAKED
AND FAMOUS take to the rail in front near the seven-sixteenths, went to tip out to the two path nearing the three-eighths marker and had NAKED AND
FAMOUS tip out in front to that lane, got briefly steadied and altered back inwards, came under coaxing along the inside at the five-sixteenths, offered up a
bid taking the inside route into upper stretch to briefly threaten the aforementioned foe at the three-sixteenths, then got shaken off and ran on to chase the
winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. MONTEREY PENINSULA coaxed from the gate, raced four wide just off the duel coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, continued four wide into upper stretch and tired while along for the show honors. VINNY TWO CENTS coaxed from the
start, dueled from the two path inside of SUPERSONIC, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole when displaced from
command, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. NAKED AND FAMOUS stumbled badly at the start belly flopping to the ground and conceding
four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, pulled keen early on under a firm hold three wide, tucked to the two path into the turn before making
his way briefly to the rail at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing tipped back two then three wide near the three-eighths unaware of forcing
NECROMANCER to briefly steady and alter inside in behind, swung two to three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
DONTLOOKBACKATALL came away near the back of the field, was reserved on the outside, went three wide while patiently ridden around the turn, was
roused five wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under
strong urging. ELYSIAN FIELD settled well behind the rest of the field, moved from the hedge to the three path around the turn, gained while swinging
seven wide into the stretch, passed foes outside in the final furlong and finished with good energy to narrowly get the place. ESSAOUIRA climbed a bit early
then was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole then came under a drive, moved around the stopping
pacesetter in the two path into the final furlong and finished with good courage to just miss the place while able to get the show. LEXI'S SPIRIT was
recalcitrant behind the gate and reluctant to load, settled towards the rear on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was roused six wide into the stretch,
lugged in some while passing foes, held a good striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick while able to get the last spot in the
superfecta. REFLEXIVITY (IRE) tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, chased four wide into the stretch, pursued
the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. PLAYLIST was coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path
around the turn, gained the lead in the three path into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths pole and gave way. CANT
KEEP ME DOWN was reluctant to load, established a good position down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, tipped to the two path into upper
stretch and came up empty. ROCKET CITY was urged along on the outside, tucked into the two path for the run around the turn, spun three wide into upper
stretch and capitulated. HAT CHECK GIRL was taken up early then reserved off the pace while tugging at the bit, lugged out leaving the backstretch and
was taken up again, went two to three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out before the furlong marker and failed to
threaten. LADY CARAGGIO (IRE) was hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied along the hedge under extra left-rein
pressure while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in the two path into upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ROYAL SPIRIT settled just off the inside near the rear of the field under patient handling until placed to coaxing just outside the quarter pole, angled four to
five wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, had ST. JOE LOUIS come inwards and attempt to hem him in behind MERCI bumping him just at the
eighth pole, gained clearance just after that bump and burst on through the lane to issue a challenge taking command over a host of rivals latched on
seventy yards from home, then prevailed going away at the end. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) settled unhurried just off the inside under reserve in mid pack, tipped
three wide in the clear nearing the seven-sixteenths and nudging ASSIDUOUSLY four wide, made contact with that rival once more when placed to coaxing
three wide at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, came inwards attempting to keep ROYAL SPIRIT in behind a rival and bumped with that
foe a furlong out before getting nudged aside, then offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in a blanket finish to the wire. MERCI three wide
through the first turn, tracked two to three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch,
offered up a bid a furlong from home, then ran on to the finish but was outfinished in the final strides while along for the show honors in a blanket finish.
ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) two to three wide near the rear of the field, got nudged four wide near the seven-sixteenths by ST. JOE LOUIS, went four wide
through the far turn under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid outside to the end. ICARUS
coaxed from the start, tracked the pace along the inside from a loose pocket, came under coaxing three furlongs from home and spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command a furlong from home, came outwards bumping FAST GORDON just inside that station and forcing HARD
RYE GUY to steady in behind, got caught seventy yards from home and was out-finished in the late stages. FAST GORDON just off the inside in closest
aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command a furlong
out, got bumped just inside that station by ICARUS, who came outwards and then weakened in the late going. HARD RYE GUY saved ground near the rear
of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and had a brief seam between rivals before that
seam closed up with three-sixteenths to go, got lightly coaxed along behind foes a furlong out, then got forced to steady when ICARUS bumped FAST
GORDON directly in front near the sixteenth marker and was never clear to the finish. STOP THE SPREAD coaxed from the start, showed the way rated on
the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under pressure for the initial time, cut the corner into upper stretch and was under
assault from a host of rivals stacked across the track a furlong out when yielding command, then weakened through to the line.

Footnotes
WESTERN GHENT broke out while coming out in front then was corrected by the rider, showed the way while off the rail down the backstretch, vied in the
two path on the turn, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the
proper lead inside the furlong marker, pursued the runner-up outside into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late and got up to prevail. EE YAH stumbled
one stride after the start but broke towards the front, tracked the pace on the far outside, engaged the leader leaving the backstretch, vied in the four path
around the turn, took the advantage at the five-sixteenths, came in while asked for his best inside the quarter-pole, shook clear outside the furlong marker
then was put to a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop while drifting in inside the furlong marker, shortened stride in the final sixteenth and was
caught while clear for the place. MR BOB was hustled from the start, showed speed then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. STAR ATTITUDE broke a step slow as three foes left the gate clearly in front of
the rest, was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response then missed the show. ROYAL MOVER
broke a step behind the top three, was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide around the turn and failed to threaten. SECRET THUNDER
was forced out at the start and off a bit behind the top three, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into
the stretch, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and capitulated. ENZO'S WORLD hesitated at the start then was slow into stride,
spotted the front a few lengths, dropped well behind the rest of the field, traveled in the two path around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no
factor.

Footnotes
BESIDE HERSELF went to the front then moved clear, was well rated in hand while setting an uncontested pace from the inside to the two path, controlled
the action through the final turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a
left-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady urging. ROCKY SKY (IRE) broke a bit awkwardly, became keen under tight
restraint early, tucked into the three path into the first turn, moved to the two path later on that bend, was reserved under a strong hold, made his way closer
to the rail down the stretch for the first time, saved ground on the second turn, continued in reserve towards the rear, raced inside early on the final turn, split
foes in the two path while given her cue at the five-sixteenths, came out into upper stretch, passed foes outside in the final furlong and finished willingly for
the place. QUEEN BOURBON moved from the rail to the two path around the opening bend, was rated in third position, went two then three wide around
the second turn, tracked outside down the backstretch, was given his cue in the three path on the final turn, chased outside into upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick while able to get the show. CREATIVE CAIRO brushed with a foe after the start, moved up between foes into the first turn, tracked the pace
in the two path while in hand, was asked on the final turn, chased into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. GOOD MEASURE
bumped with MIA MARTINA at the start, bumped again with that foe early then was taken up briefly, saved ground while unhurried at the back, was roused
late on the final turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. MIA MARTINA bumped with a GOOD MEASURE at the start while
brushing with another foe, bumped again with that foe early, settled outside in the two to three path, continued outside towards the rear down the
backstretch, came under urging around the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the final turn and lacked the needed response. LIGHT STARS (FR)
became rank when taken under tight restraint early, went three wide while tugging at the bit around the first turn, fought the rider while tucked into the two
path down the stretch for the first time, leveled out some before the second turn, continued two to three wide, was roused on the final turn and came up
empty. CHAMPAGNE IVY settled on the inside, was asked on the final turn, came under the crop outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond.

Footnotes
JAMES JONES just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in
behind DRIPPING GOLD, tipped out near the eighth pole to the four or five path and closed well to collar the top pair with seventy yards to the finish and
was up to inch away in the late going to the wire. DRIPPING GOLD tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing near the three-eighths and
bumped IMPULSIVENESS into MODERN SCIENCE creating a lane for himself in the two path, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive taking command a furlong out, fought on to the finish getting caught inside the final seventy yards while along for the place honors. C FALLS showed
the way rated along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, dug in and was collared a
furlong from home, fought on to the finish to be along safe for the show honors. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) broke a half a beat slow and lost his lane at the
start getting forced to briefly take hold, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch
and ran on to just get up for the last major share. DAUNT tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing tipped to the two path nearing the quarter
pole, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS chased just off the inside through the first turn and then three
to four wide from that point on, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no headway. MODERN SCIENCE
(IRE) three wide in pursuit in aim of the front, got nudged four wide at the three-eighths by IMPULSIVENESS due to pressure from DRIPPING GOLD tipping
out at that station, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went four wide for home, then weakened in the late stages. IMPULSIVENESS just off the
inside in closest aim of the leader, got bumped three wide when DRIPPING GOLD decided to make a lane for himself in the two path at that station and in
turn nudged MODERN SCIENCE four wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. SARANAC (FR)
two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went eight wide into upper stretch, then offered no response. DANTE'S FIRE
three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CARLOUN (IRE) three
wide through the first turn, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, tipped five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. SNOW'S

Footnotes
PRECURSORY stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, was given her cue late on that bend, gained to take the lead in upper
stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held off the runner-up
under strong urging. TIZZY IN THE SKY was reluctant to load, brushed the inside of the gate and was off awkwardly, spotted the front a few lengths, settled
well off the pace, moved closer while two then three wide around most of the turn, shifted four wide while asked late on that bend, came under a drive into
upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid late but just missed while clear for the place. LIQUIDITY PROVIDER made light
contact with a foe at the start, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to
the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished while clear for the show. ALESSIA was bumped at the start then forced into another opponent, recovered to
race just behind the leaders under a snug hold, drafted inside around the turn, shifted to the two path while asked outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide
into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. MS. SOLVEIG broke in and bumped a rival, contested the pace on
the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while still inside that opponent on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. LUTE PLAYER
settled in a good position down the backstretch, drafted in the two path for most of the turn, was asked in the three path late on that bend and came up
empty. DOVER DREAMS bumped lightly with a foe at the start, settled well back on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went three
wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. HANDBELLE was bumped at the start then taken up and dropped back, raced at the
rear while tossing her head under tight restraint, saved ground while let out on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GINA ROMANTICA broke a half a beat slow and brushed the off side stall at the start getting away near the rear of the field, tracked the pace along the
inside from near the rear, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to get on track nearing the sixteenth
marker and rolled on by the leader inside that station to prevail edging away at the end. FAITH IN HUMANITY (FR) tracked the pace along the inside from a
loose pocket, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide straightened away into upper stretch quickly collaring the leader with
three-sixteenths to go, inched away shying in under a right handed crop to the rail a furlong out, then got overhauled late by the top one and was able to
preserve the place honors on the wire. A MO REAY two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick and just missed for the place honors while just up for the show on the wire. CUSTOMER LIST (FR) just off the
inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and ran on to close along the outside
but was out-finished in the late stages. WONKA just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper
stretch, ran on through to the finish but was outkicked. CANISY broke in at the start bumping LINDA'S GIFT into SKIMS and squeezing back that pair in
tandem with REPUBLIQUE, who broke outwards, chased along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish when bumped solidly by REPUBLIQUE who came in under a right handed crop near the
sixteenth pole and was along bested for minor shares at the end. SKIMS (GB) broke in at the start and was bumped solidly by REPUBLIQUE who was
breaking outwards then got squeezed back in concert with LINDA'S GIFT as CANISY came in on the pair from the outside sandwiching them in tandem with
the pressure from REPUBLIQUE, conceded six lengths to the front before settling into stride, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked to the finish. REPUBLIQUE broke out at the start and was met
by SKIMS coming inwards and bumped that foe solidly into LINDA'S GIFT before pinching both those rivals back against pressure outside from CANISY,
tracked the leader just off the inside in closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five then four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive prominent to inside the eighth pole, came in when weakening under a right handed crop bumping CANISY solidly at that station, then got paused
through to the finish backing away to the wire. LINDA'S GIFT got bumped and squeezed back at the start as rivals on each side broke her way and
conceded six to seven lengths to the front, tracked the front just off the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
swung three wide into upper stretch, then offered no response. MISSY GREER bobbled at the break recovering outwards and filling the space left vacant by
REPUBLIQUE, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under some pressure, spun three then two wide
into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED AND

Footnotes
DIGITAL FUTURE settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, hesitated some while slipping inside a stopping foe around the five-sixteenths,
was roused four wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead to the eighth-pole then swapped to the proper lead, rallied outside in the final furlong and
closed strongly late to get up at the wire. SANDRONE disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the hedge while still inside that foe around the
turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, disposed of NAPA SPIRIT into the final sixteenth but was denied by the winner at the wire
while able to get the place. AFTER FIVE broke through the front of the gate prior to the start, was brought back around and reloaded, settled towards the
back, saved ground on the turn, was roused while cutting the corner against the hedge at the quarter-pole and finished with good energy to garner the show.
UNCLE GEORGE settled towards the back between horses, went three then four wide around the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and finished well but
missed the show. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) broke in slightly, stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, battled outside of the runner-up
under a drive to near the sixteenth-pole then weakened. SPETTRO was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up in the drive and was out-kicked. FOMO bumped with a rival at the start, settled off
the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MILANO settled at the rear of the field, traveled
three wide around the turn, came out seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. BIG BOSS BEN was urged along on the outside, went four wide
on the turn and came up empty. CIVIL SERVICE bobbled at the start then dropped back while in tight, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the
turn and failed to respond. HEZASTONECOLDFOX hit the outside stall door when it reverberated back in front of him at the start then came out and
bumped with a foe, disputed the pace on the outside, dropped back in the two path on the turn and faded.
