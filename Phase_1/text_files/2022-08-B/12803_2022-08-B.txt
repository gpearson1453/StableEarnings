Footnotes
RED JEWEL settled off of the pace three wide, took the far turn in the five path, then rallied outside of foes in the final furlong, bore down on DIAMOND
DISTRICT nearing the wire, and just got up. DIAMOND DISTRICT tucked down while clearing inner foes entering the first turn to vie for the lead outside of
MIDNIGHT XO, inherited a clear advantage when that foe faltered into the far turn, met BLAME IT ON PARIS's bid turning for home, repelled that foe and
shook clear in upper stretch, maintained a clear margin well into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer on-charging foe at the wire. LIGHTER KNOT
tracked in midpack in the three path, inched closer in the four path around the far turn, but lacked a kick between horses to produce a bid, then got
outkicked for minor placings in the final sixteenth before just reaching a tiring foe for show. BLAME IT ON PARIS bumped an inner foe while brushing with
an outer rival early on, then steadied between horses into the first turn, altered course out to the four path in the aftermath, settled into stride stalking outside
of the top pair nearing the backstretch, ranged up to a clear DIAMOND DISTRICT turning for home to attempt a bid, but was turned away in upper stretch,
sustained place while chasing into the final sixteenth, but faltered late and was nailed for show. REINA BELLA was brushed and floated out by an inner foe
while taking back entering the first turn, tracked in midpack in the two path, chased three wide turning for home, and failed to menace from between horses.
HOLIDAY NECKLACE took a bump to her hind quarters approaching the first turn, stalked in the two path, then chased two wide and from between horses
around the far turn, and weakened through the final furlong. BEST SELLER brushed an inner foe while being rated back soon after the start, settled along
the inside while off of the pace, then took the far turn in the four to five path, and failed to factor. JEFF'S JOY broke a bit outwardly, trailed, cut the gap along
the rail into the far turn, but made little impact thereafter. MIDNIGHT XO vied along the inside, but caved into the far turn.

Footnotes
INSPEIGHTFUL pressed three to two wide into the turn, then from between horses entering the lane as an outer rival ranged up alongside, vied entering the
final furlong, gained an advantage nearing the final sixteenth, and drove clear late. YELLOW CREEK ROAD stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the
top pair at the three furlong pole, inched closer entering the lane, but only managed to chased an inner INSPEIGHTFUL through the final furlong, and
secured place late. FOX CREEK LADY took a mild bump from an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of bidders
entering the lane, but was headed inside the final furlong, and faltered a sixteenth from home. ARNEIS bobbled slightly before bumping an inner foe at the
start, was prominent between horses early on, but failed to keep pace with them while under urging entering the turn, faded turning for home, then
surpassed a tiring foe in the final furlong. TIZMISSBETTY was moving about when the gates opened and broke in the air while spotting the rest of the field
many lengths, then was outrun throughout. DANIELLA'S CAUSE broke half a beat slowly, shifted outside of the leading pack soon after, tracked four wide
around the bend, but drifted out turning for home, tired in upper stretch, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BELLA RUNNER prompted the pace while shifting down the from the three to four path around the first turn, pressed three wide and from between horses
down the backstretch, sustained pursuit of a well-traveling MISSED OPPORTUNITY turning for home, produced a bid for the lead entering the lane, drove
clear leaving the furlong grounds, dug in gamely as an outer MISS EVERYTHING menaced in the final sixteenth, and held determinedly. MISS
EVERYTHING tracked in the two path, tipped to the four path to be outside of the top pair turning for home, ranged up entering the lane to take aim in upper
stretch, chased a clearing BELLA RUNNER through midstretch, inched closer entering the final sixteenth, produced a bid in the closing stages, but was just
fended off. MISSED OPPORTUNITY set the pace in the two path around the first turn, left the rail vacated allowing for AMENSET to produce a rail bid at the
eleven sixteenths pole, vied from between horses down the backstretch as outer rivals pressed on, assumed command at the three furlong pole, traveled
well while well in hand turning for home as BELLA RUNNER inched closer, but met that foe's bid entering the lane, offered little resistance in upper stretch,
and caved at the furlong grounds. AMENSET stalked along the inside, decidedly slipped inside of the pace setter entering the backstretch to vie for the lead
at the eleven sixteenths pole, clung to a margin for a quarter mile thereafter, but weakened approaching the three furlong pole. CONTESSINA laid off of the
pace in the three to four paths, and made little impact. SACRED KITTEN broke a bit outwardly at the start, moved forward outside of foes while achieving a
five to four wide stalking position entering the backstretch, but faded around the far turn.

VINTAGE PRINT leaned a bit outwardly at the start, set the pace inside of a pair of hounding rivals, responded readily when let out at the five sixteenths
pole, swiftly kicked away turning for home, then drew off through the lane under a vigorous hand ride, and was kept to task through the final sixteenth.
CREDIBILITY tracked the top trio from the two path while multiple lengths off, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and wore down a tiring ON A
SPREE to claim place entering the final sixteenth. CIVIL WAR rated far back, saved ground around the far turn before swinging four wide entering the lane,
and stayed on mildly to reach show at the wire. ON A SPREE veered inwardly while outbreaking inner foes, prompted the eventual winner from the outside
whilst between horses, but failed to keep pace with that one at the five sixteenths pole, weakened through the lane, and got nailed at the wire for show.
BLANKET OF ROSES broke half a step slowly, lagged behind around both turns, and never got involved. ARTEMUS EAGLE applied stern pressed outside
of the top pair down the backstretch, but weakened entering the far turn, and was eased through the final furlong. DUE TO AN EQUIPMENT
MALFUNCTION, FINISH MARGINS WERE COLLECTED BY HAND VIA REPLAY.

TOO MUCH INFO set the pace inside of a rival while a path off of the rail, easily shook free of that foe at the five sixteenths pole, held sway from his chasing
stablemate while mildly shaken up in upper stretch, and was ridden out under hand urging through the final furlong. SACRED GROUND stalked along the
inside, claimed place from an outer foe entering the lane while his stable-mate kicked clear, took aim on that foe in upper stretch, but only managed to
chase through the final furlong, and proved second best. ACCIDENT stalked two wide, tipped to the four path to be outside of the top pair turning for home,
but was outkicked by an inner rival for place entering the lane, changed leads at the furlong grounds, and chased while remaining well clear of the rest.
HEZMORETHANREADY prompted the eventual winner from the outside while kept in the three path by that rival, but failed to keep pace at the five
sixteenths pole, and faded through the lane. MENDEAVOUR broke slowly, settled off of the pace along the inside, chased the main group from the two to
three path entering the lane, shifted to the five path in midstretch, but lacked a bid. KELL'S BELLS broke very slow while hopping at the start, raced far back
in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. WOLF WARRIOR was outrun. WICKED REVIEW laid off of the pace two wide, but faded in the three
path around the turn.

Footnotes
HERE MI SONG was briefly fractious awaiting the start without causing an incident, got bumped by an inner foe at the break, laid off of the pace while
outside of foes, commenced a five wide gain to a tracking position into the turn, tucked four wide at the three furlong pole, rallied turning for home to take
aim on the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, grinded away to bid for the lead entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. KAVOD dueled for the lead
inside of MY MAN FLINSTONE around the turn, fought on tenaciously after being brushed and headed at the three sixteenths pole, regained a narrow
margin from his outer counterpart nearing the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked by an outer rallying HERE MI SONG in the process, and secured place. MY
MAN FLINTSTONE dueled for the lead outside of KAVOD around the turn, forged a very narrow margin entering the lane while leaning on his inner
counterpart, sparred gallantly through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, and yielded between horses late. DON'T
FORGET pressed three wide into the turn, chased the dueling leaders around the bend, but was outkicked for show by an outer rival entering the lane, then
kept on. AGGRESSIVITY broke a bit outwardly at the start, tracked two wide entering the turn, tucked to the rail approaching the three furlong pole, then
chased from the two path and behind the top group through the lane while lacking a bid. SOUNION floated out and bumped a rival at the start, then laid off
of the pace along the inside, and never got involved. K J'S NOBILITY stalked four wide, but faded into the turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
JOKES ON BLUE tracked along the inside, gained place from outer foes entering the lane while tipping outside of the well clear leader, narrowed that foe's
margin through the final furlong, produced a late bid approaching the wire, and just got up. TWO MINUTE DRILL set the pace inside of a pressing
ACRIMONY into the turn, drew clear of that faltering foe at the three furlong pole, built a wide margin entering the lane, held sway from a chasing JOKES
ON BLUE through midstretch, but tired in the final sixteenth, met that foe's challenge nearing the wire, and got nailed. FRIGID LADY was pinched back
between horses at the start and raced at the rear outside of foes into the turn, gained four wide around the bend to bid for show entering the lane, and
stayed on to secure that position in midstretch. RIGHT NOW saved ground far off of the pace, improved inside of foes turning for home to bid for show along
the rail at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked for that position in upper stretch. ACRIMONY bobbled a bit at the start while still breaking with the
field, prompted the leader from the outside while clear of show entering the turn, but gave way at tne three furlong pole, and tired. FREE SPIRITED lost her
rider briefly before the race without running off, then raced far back three wide, tucked two wire entering the lane, and failed to menace. ADALINDA bumped
an inner foe at the start, stalked four wide, chased from the four path around the turn, but tired turning for home. GOODBETTERBEST bumped an outer foe
at the start, chased from the three path, tucked to the two path into the turn, bid for show in the four path and between horses entering the lane, but
weakened. BONITA D'ORO chased from off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, and never got involved. TATTERED HEART broke
outwardly at the start, tracked in midpack three wide, but tired. LA SHARK chased two wide and between horses for a furlong, but faltered at the five furlong
pole, was eased around the turn, pulled up nearing the lane, and got vanned off.

lane, came back and took over once in the stretch and drew away late under a steady drive. BRITAIN'S KITTEN raced back early on, was in the four path
into the lane, rallied down the lane and was up for place in the final stages. BLUE NORTHER chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane,
made a bid in the stretch but lost place in the final stages. JR'S GIFT tracked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the
stretch run. ATRAS fought restraint along the first turn then took over command in the backstretch and cleared the field, was on the inside into the lane and
faltered down the lane. WORDS OF WISDOM was briefly steadied after the start, chased the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faded down
the lane. ARROW STRIKE was always outrun and eased in the stretch. SEIZE THE TREASURE was done early and eased in the stretch.
