Footnotes
WINTER SIREN Away on top, showed the way along two path, responded when roused and under pressure proved best. INHONOROFOWENJR Tracked
along the three path, challenged a bit midway around the last turn, chased and finished well. AZOGAR Lagged far back, three path into the lane and rallied.
WILLOW GROVE Well placed along the rail throughout and weakened. TAMI'S ORCHID Unhurried, gained along the two path on the last turn and flattened
out. COUPS DE PARTY Four wide up the backstretch to the lane and tired. PAZZION Hard to load in the gate, broke slow, close up four wide to the last
turn and tired. DONNA'SWAY Three path on the first turn and was done early.
