MUNTIJ rallied to draw even abreast rival on the turn dueling step for step down the lane needing all to prevail at the wire. STARSHIP TAXI pressed to put a
head in front nearing the quarter pole dueling inside of rival from the rail down the stretch battling to the wire in the gamest of efforts. HALO'S DANCE well
back early angled four wide into upper stretch finding late response gaining with every stride before running out of ground. DREW chased early then faded
on the turn racing evenly along the inside down the lane. BOBBY DON led early then was hooked on the inside near the quarter pole wearing out down the
lane. BIG GAME BOB was always outrun.
