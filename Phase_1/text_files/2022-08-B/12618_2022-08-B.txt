Footnotes
MACRELLETTA well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
made a steady gain and drove clear late. FLOAT AWAY sent from the gate, sprinted clear, held sway to the furlong marker, came again and edged ahead
inside, then was no match in the late going and held the place. TOOSWEETFORME tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid
three wide into the stretch, then had a mild late gain and missed the place. DAKOTA DANCER unhurried in the early going, looped up three and four wide
through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and evened out. ICY RAIN was no factor. JACQUELINE ANNE steadied between rivals through the
first turn, moved up into the second turn, then faded.

PEMAQUID PETE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenged and lasted under steady pressure. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE
rated outside the leader, moved to position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. CUZ
tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then evened out and held the show. ENGLISH
CHALLENGE unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled in for clear racing room and missed
the show. WILE E PEYOTE well placed, gained position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. GUACO ran
evenly. BEACH PASS was never involved.

DECEITFUL ANTHONY tracked the pace well back, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and drew
off late. MAKES GOOD SENSE sent from the gate, sprinted to a long lead, then sway to the final sixteenth, then was no match for the winner, while clearly
best of the rest. MORETHANSOULTITLE unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and edged up for the
show. BIG CHICKEN MAN rated inside, angled out and moved up three wide through the turn, drifted out into the stretch and weakened, holding a share.
DORISTO well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened. RUMPOLE
well placed and between, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path and had no stretch rally. TOTAL DISTRACTION ran
evenly for a half and faded.

Footnotes
DR. STEVE unhurried early, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and drew off under mild urging.
SHOOT YOUR CUFFS mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and closed
well for the place. CONCRETE GLORY stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one gaining a clear lead into the stretch, then drifted in and
weakened late. PURE SPRING chased the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out.
LEONARD'S LEGACY allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then drifted in and improved position. RUNAWAY
STAR set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded the final furlong. FIGHTIN PHIL was no factor, inside.
FOLTYNEWICZ well placed and outside, faded through the turn.

Footnotes
OLDZFOURFORTYTWO never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead
late and held. EXTRA MEDIUM allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out, then closed
well late and missed. WATCH THE DIP well placed, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and lacked the needed
late kick. LEAVEITALONELARRY allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and edged up for a share.
BRET'S AT CADDIES vied for the early lead on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, then weakened the
final furlong. I BELONG TO BECKY well placed, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
ANOTHER SOFTBALL mid pack, looped three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled widest and improved position. GOLDEN
EMPEROR set the early pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded late. SMOOTH PAPA well placed, lost ground four and
five wide through the turn. CANDY MY BOY was never involved.
