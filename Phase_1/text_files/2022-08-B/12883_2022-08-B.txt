Footnotes
JUST LIKE TRISTA stalked the leader up the backstretch, advanced two wide to challenge RAISEN RAISEN for the lead at the quarter pole, cleared
command entering the the lane and held late under a driving finish. OLIVE OYL tracked the early pace three to four wide, launched a three wide bid around
the far turn, came four wide into the lane, angled to the inside in late stages, stayed on gamely and gained to the wire. REBEL RISING rated two wide near
midpack through early stages, was ridden along the inside around the far turn, came two to three wide into the lane and ran for a share. MISS PEACH was
unhurried and raced in the back, came under a ride late on the far turn, hustled along three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. RAISIN RAISIN led
the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by the winner leaving the quarter pole and gave way. TAPTHATLUCK rated
along the inside just off midpack up the backstretch, flattened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

STAGE DOOR hustled up out of the gate and raced two wide around the first turn, applied pace pressure to GOD'S PICK up the backstretch, launched a
two wide bid for rival around the far turn, stayed on determinedly into the stretch run, poked a head in front at the furlong marker and edged away under a
driving finish. MAGIC IN A HAT tracked the pace three to four wide up the backstretch, coaxed three wide into the upper stretch, sustained response
through the lane and cleared second best. GOD'S PICK held a slim lead around the first turn and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, took on the
challenge from the winner late on the far turn, dueled in the upper stretch then got headed at the furlong marker and gave way. MOON IN THE SKY raced
off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn, hustled along two wide into the lane and failed to rally. SEE THE PYRAMIDS stalked on the inside
through early stages, flattened around the final turn and continued to tire in the drive. SEAZAN dwelt at the start and never reached contention. STEWARDS

BLUSHING SCARLETT tracked the leader two wide around the turn, given cue in the upper stretch, poked a head in front at the furlong marker and drew
clear. SOYBEAN sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn, saved ground into the lane, got collared by the winner a furlong out and had to
settle for second best. READY TO GET LOUD was off a step slow at the start and raced in the back early on, advanced four wide midway around the turn
and sustained bid through the lane. SHIPS JEWEL raced three wide in contention around the turn then weakened in the final furlong. COLD AS YOU raced
in contention leaving the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure around the turn and steadily weakened. CALL THE SHOTS lacked speed, came four
wide into the lane and never threatened.

OCEAN OF STORMS raced three deep up close around the turn, tapped two wide right handed past the furlong marker, responded gamely, took charge
and powered away to the finish. LUCKY AIN'T ENOUGH sped to the lead along the rail, held a slight edge over duo around the turn, drifted two to three
wide into the lane, could not match with the winner in the final furlong but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY
chased the top trio around the turn, hustled along three to four wide into the lane, drifted in under left handed pressure and prevailed for a share. GUSTAVO
raced two wide in striking distance for the early lead, sustained bid in the upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. HUSKER BUTCH raced off the
pace, was ridden on the outside into the lane and lacked a needed rally. LUV MAP raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and never threatened.
FITZEA lacked speed and failed to move into contention. LAWLESS JOHN raced midpack into the turn then steadily retreated.

JITTERS vied for the early lead then edged ahead and showed the way around the turn, took on the inside challenge of FAST SOPHIA a furlong out, dug in
gamely, turned back bid and kicked clear. FAST SOPHIA briefly vied for the early lead then raced up close on the inside around the turn, roused forward to
challenge JITTERS for the lead a furlong out, dug in determinedly along the rail but could not get by and had to settle for second best. FIREY EMBLEM was
forwardly paced around the turn, ran on three wide into the lane and secured a share. NO ONE CARES was ridden along three wide around the turn, stayed
on the same path into the lane and failed to threaten the top trio. LET'S GO LACEY raced off the early pace, chased two wide around the turn and failed to
move into contention. HOT CAVIAR briefly dueled for the early lead, flattened midway around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. TALLANDLONG
lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, shifted out in the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
GREEDY CREEDY raced up close around the first turn then dueled outside of TIN BADGE up the backstretch, shook free leaving the far turn and pulled
away while ridden out. ALLEN'S ROCKET rated off the top pair up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, sustained two wide bid
through the lane and gained place. TIN BADGE was forwardly placed around the first turn, dueled with GREEDY CREEDY up the backstretch and around
the far turn, could not move on with the winner at the head of the lane and steadily weakened. JOHN R got in tight two wide heading into the first turn and
steadied sharply, raced off the pace to the far turn, saved ground and lacked a rally. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND raced in the last flight, came two wide into the
lane and never threatened. SHUT UP MAN led the way around the first turn and dueled to the midway point of the backstretch, could not move on with the
top pair and steadily retreated. MAHOMES raced midpack along the inside then weakened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
REDNECKERTHANYOU set a pressured pace then dueled around the turn with LAUNCHED, shook free turning for home, widened to a clear advantage
then was all out late and held on. NASTY EXAGGERATOR raced in the second flight midway up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the turn,
steadily edged closer through the lane then surged in final stages and failed to reach the winner in time. DISCREET INVASION broke near the back and
raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the lane and rallied for show. SWEET WHEAT raced off the pace in the opening quarter, chased
three wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for late impact. STORMIN' J. J. raced off the top flight mid-way up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn then flattened and ran on evenly through the lane. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE angled inside soon after the start,
saved ground around the turn then shifted out out three wide and lacked a rally. MATCHLOCK raced near midpack just off the inside, failed to gain around
the turn and gave way three wide through the lane. MAFIA DON was off a step slow at the start, raced off the pace, saved ground and failed to rally.
LAUNCHED prompted the pace up the backstretch, dueled around the turn then came up empty in the lane. PHILLIP JUSTIN got bumped between rivals at
the start, raced midpack in the opening quarter then steadily weakened.
