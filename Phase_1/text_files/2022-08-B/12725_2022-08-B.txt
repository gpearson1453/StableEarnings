Footnotes
EMPRESS ELLIE broke outwardly and bumped PROFIT HUNTER into LOVE YOU LOTS, stalked the pace inside around the first turn, tipped out midway
down the backstretch, took over two wide near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and dug in gamely to just last. MISS YOU ELLA tracked the
pace four wide, was bumped late on the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner, steadily gained through the lane,
reached even terms late and lost the head bob. LOVE HER LOTS was bumped at the start, raced in tight quarters three wide between foes around the first
turn, bumped with MISS YOU ELLA late on that bend, went four wide around the far turn and finished evenly. GRANDMA'S PUDDING chased the pace two
wide and lacked a rally. PROFIT HUNTER was bumped between foes at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled out in lane and never threatened.
SATURDAY NITE GIRL set the pace along the rail and gave way near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
DORTH VADER hit the gate then bumped AVATAL HERO at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, stalked the duel from the rail around the turn,
briefly tipped out nearing the head of the lane but angled right back to the rail in upper stretch, closed inside and was up in the final strides. DEFENDED set
a pressured pace in the two path, put away the pace rival in midstretch, continued on the left lead and led until the final strides. KIKILOVE dueled in the
three path to midstretch and stayed on for the show. ELISSA JOE broke inwardly and bumped LADY PETAL into ANNA'S IMAGE at the start then went
evenly while racing three wide. WICKED ICE steadily faded two wide. LADY PETAL was bumped hard between foes at the start, saved ground and never
threatened. AVATAL HERO was bumped at the start, raced four wide and made little impact. ANNA'S IMAGE was slammed at the start, steadied near the
half-mile pole and trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
ACTION DREAM raced two wide in midpack, swung out in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up on the wire. RARE JEWEL advanced five wide
around the turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, angled into the two path turning for home, shook clear, drifted out through the stretch and led until the
final stride. CAJUN RED hit the starting gate and was off last, bumped with DANGER RANGER not long after, circled six wide around the turn and rallied for
the show. ASTRAL RIDE tracked the pace three wide between foes and lacked a rally. CAMPTOWN RACES failed to menace while racing three wide.
SENOR GEE vied between foes down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the turn and tired in the drive. DANGER RANGER was bumped
early, raced four wide and never threatened. GOLDEN WONDER had brief speed inside. THE BEAST pressed the pace four wide and retreated through the
lane. AREVALO dueled three wide between and faltered nearing the quarter pole.
