around the far turn and dueled down the lane to just hold. BIZZEE CHANNEL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, began a bid from the two and three path passing the three eighths pole and dueled down the stretch to just miss. BUY ME CANDY saved

AND THE OSCAR GOES was unhurried from rail, swung into the five path into the stretch, and rallied. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA chased in the three path, was
driven four wide into the lane, and ran on for place. BLAST THE MUSIC tracked in the three path, bid three wide at the top of the lane, stayed on for show.
DIABLO DADDY stalked from the two path, waited for room into the stretch, and kept on up the inside. ANALYZEYOURVISION was in midpack along the
inside, fanned out to the four path into the stretch, but finished evenly. BIG RED CARDINAL raced from well back in the three path, was cued in the four
path coming into the stretch, but flattened. REAL RICK trailed early, was ridden in the four path into the stretch, but never factored. ICE BAR rated while
saving ground but never threatened. DIVINAS CONNECTION prompted the pace from three wide, but backed out far turn. RIXEY ROCKET led from the two
path but yielded at the top of the lane. GIRO D'ORO pressed in the three path, was roused two wide into the stretch, but gave way.

Footnotes
RED WIND was sent to an early lead while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and around the far turn, kicked
clear entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire. MAP EM UP saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up
the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole and gained ground on the outside down the lane. MISS MORENO
saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and kept on in the stretch. WINDY CITY GIRL
raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn still in the two path and was
outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. CLASSY OF COURSE brushed lightly with AUBURN while racing in tight quarters in the three path around
the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the second bend and was
empty from there. OVER TO YOU hit the gate leaving it, raced five wide around the first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated
the far turn from the three path and made no bid. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the frontrunner on the outside up
the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded in the lane. OBLIO'S WISH brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed
the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, made up some ground while racing up the rail around the far turn and was never a factor.
AUBURN brushed with the horse to her outside at the break, had mild contact with CLASSY OF COURSE while racing four wide around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and tired further in
the stretch.

the two path at the top of the lane, but yielded late. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED prompted the pace three wide, bid four wide into the lane, but finished evenly.

Footnotes
BANDUA was unhurried from inside, moved up to lead from the three path going into the lane, and drew clear. SEISMIC WAVE trailed from the two path,
waited for room around the far turn, shifted in at the top of the stretch, and ran on. HONOR UP raced midpack between foes, fanned out to the five path for
the stretch, but finished evenly to show. JIMMY P tracked three wide, was ridden four wide around the turn, but was one paced. AHNAF stalked inside, was
roused from the two path into the stretch, but was empty. QUALITY CHOICE set the pace inside, was cued from the four path at the top of the lane but
faded. BRAVE DEACON prompted the pace from the three path but backed around the turn. ZARKALLANI (FR) chased three wide but was never a factor.
KID MACHO was well back throughout and never a menace.

Footnotes
FIGHTINIRISHTABIT led the way the entire way around the oval and drew off handily the final time down the lane. MAKE A STAND chased the leader
through the first lap, challenged on the far turn, could not go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. CRITICIZE tracked
the frontrunner through the opening mile, offered a bid racing around the final turn and faded in the stretch. PEAT MOSS (IRE) trailed close behind the field
in the opening lap, fell coming over fence five, was caught and walked off.
