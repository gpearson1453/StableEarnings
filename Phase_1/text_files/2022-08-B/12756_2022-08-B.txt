Footnotes
EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground outside and pulled clear in the final furlong. PALM READER
stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path, could not go with the winner in the lane and
chased that rival to the wire. MO FIRE dueled from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle on the outside around the
far turn and gave way late. REYNA DE VERANO raced in the two and three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, came around the second turn in the three path and finished evenly. HOT CHOICE raced off the pace on the inside in the early going,
saved ground around the far turn and improved position mildly in the stretch while never threatening. TAPERINEA saved ground around the first turn,
chased the leaders up the backstretch on the inside, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the lane. WHITE LILACS saved ground
around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and tired in the stretch. STARTWITHABANG broke slowly, trailed the
field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
G LAURIE raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path
coming around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. DETERMINED CRUSH chased the leader on the inside around the
first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn, couldn't go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival
home. KATIE GOT LUCKY saved ground while trailing the field through the opening three quarters of a mile, swung wide entering the stretch and gained
ground on the outside late. EVERY TIME showed the way while saving ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch out in front, dueled from
the rail around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. WINGS OF A SONG saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was empty in the lane. TROPE hit the gate leaving it, raced in middle of the
pack on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and flattened out in the lane. LUCK IN THE DUSK raced in
the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the far turn
and tired further in the lane.

THANK YA PETE set the pace in the two path, was cued from inside into the stretch, and held gamely. KAMIKAZE FOX prompted the pace from the three
path, was coaxed from two wide at the top of the lane, ran on. MOON SIGN bumped at the start, was unhurried in the three path, tipped out to the six path
into the lane, and kept on. DRAGON RUN bumped at the start, chased in the two path, was ridden from the three path into the lane, but finished evenly.
NORTHERN WEIGELIA tracked in the three path, was driven from the five path into the lane, but flattened. RUFFLESNFLOURISHES rated in the three
path but was never a threat. BREWSINSKI stalked inside but faded at the top of the lane. BREEZE BABY was wellback inside and never a menace. BALI
ROLLING TIDE trailed throughout. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
JUST DEAL WITH IT raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn still in the two
path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, split horses with a furlong to go and got up between horses late. NOBLE CROSS led the way while saving
ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to lead around the far turn and in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly late. FREDISATEN
bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the
run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn and gained ground steadily down the lane. FAST PAYDAY bumped with the horse to his
inside at the break, trailed the field on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the second bend and improved position in late stretch.
ONE LUCKY DAY saved ground at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn, swung wide
entering the stretch and passed tiring horses from there. NOMADIC FIGHTER raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the inside, continued to save ground the far turn and flattened out in the lane. KID BOURBON raced in the three and four path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn, dueled in
upper stretch and weakened late. SIMMS brushed with the horse to his outside at the break, raced in the three path at the back of the pack through the
opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three and four path and was empty in the stretch. CAUSE A STIR saved ground around the first turn, raced
in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and made no bid. STRATFORD trailed the
field from the two path in the early going, came around the far turn in the three path, still at the back of the pack, and was not a factor. CHAOTIC TEMPO
brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back
while racing in the two and three path around the far turn and tired further in the lane.

Footnotes
BALLYHOO PRINCE stalked two wide, slightly steadied into the first turn, swung out to the three path into the lane, and drew clear. UNCLE BERLEY
prompted the pace inside, floated out to the three path into the stretch, and ran on. GENERAL STRIKE set a loose lead, was cued from the two path into the
lane but yielded late to show. BLAME B B raced in midpack from the three path, was driven from the five path into the lane, but finished evenly.
TARAASHOQ trailed from the three path into the stretch and passed tired horses late. COASTAL CHAOS rated in the three path but was never a threat.
THE LAST SCIP tracked from the four path but faded into the stretch. MOTANAAFER was wellback inside and no menace.

Footnotes
TAKAFUMI (BRZ) saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two and three path,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole and got up for the win late. CITY PLAN showed the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dueled while racing inside around the far turn and finished gamely, getting caught late. FARLEY raced in the two path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the two and three path and chased the top two home.
TOE CURLIN' KISS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. ACKER
raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, continued around the far turn still in the two path
and was outkicked in the lane. MIRACLE SILVER raced in the middle of the pack in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, challenged
from the two path coming around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. BIG ONE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up
the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, and faded from there. LOKOYA ROAD saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field from
there, never factored and was vanned off after walking onto the van.

Footnotes
HAD RIGHT bumped with the horse to inside at the break, raced in the two path around the turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack,
launched a bid from the four path passing the three eighths pole, dueled down the lane and got up for the win. GORUN brushed with the horse to his inside
leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to improve position from the four path coming
around the turn and dueled down the stretch to narrowly miss. THE THINKER raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off
the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground late. MINEOLA MIKE bumped with
the horse to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the field from the three path through the early going, angled in to save ground around the far turn and kept
on in the stretch. COCHISE was bumped and forced back at the start, saved ground around the first turn, raced inside at the back of the pack from there,
came around the turn in the two path, angled inside in upper stretch and improved position late. LITTLE G T bumped with the horse to his inside at the
break, raced in the four path around the turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and finished
evenly. RECTANGLE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch,
continued to battle on the inside around the second bend and tired in the stretch. FIRST FORCE bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, raced in
the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace setters between horses up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and was empty
from there. BIG RED CARDINAL saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch and around the second bend and
made no bid. A C'S ANALYZER saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch and faded from there. LUXURY BOY
dueled from the two path through the opening half mile, began to drop back coming around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.
