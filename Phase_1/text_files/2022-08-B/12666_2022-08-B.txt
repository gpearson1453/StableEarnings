Footnotes
CHATTY GAL prompted the early pace from just off the rail, gained the advantage over FAIRY BARB entering the far turn, and prevailed under a drive.
MADE FOR MORE vied hard outside away from the gate, chased the leaders through the turn, drive three wide into the lane, moved up menacingly but was
unable to get by and held on for place. TALA brushed leaving, chased three wide leaving the backstretch, came under encouragement through the stretch
and missed outside. FLASHY BIZ brushed leaving then was brushed again from between foes in the backstretch, went three wide through the turn, was
urged along the rail entering the stretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. FAIRY BARB flashed early speed outside, was unable to move on with rival after
the quarter pole and finished evenly. ENTITLED STAR trailed the field, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and was unable to improve position. MARYAM
lacked a serious bid.

Footnotes
SAVYSKYE saved ground while setting the pace, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, was kept under handling through the stretch, and held under a drive.
LULABELLE sat just off the pace inside, chased leader through the stretch but was unable to stall the winner and held on late for second.
I'MANIMPERIALGIRL stalked the pacesetters while three wide, roused at the quarter pole and lacked the late kick needed. STEAMIN DEMON allowed to
settle early while three to four wide, took closer order but came up empty for the drive. LASKA passed tiring rival late. TOP DEMON saved ground and failed
to threaten.

Footnotes
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER quickly went to the front under a snug, showed the way to the far turn, turned back challenge from SHOTTHRUTHEHEART at
the quarter pole, and drew away in the final sixteenth. SHOTTHRUTHEHEART sat in range while three to four wide, asked to quicken nearing the quarter
pole then moved up alongside ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER to challenge the lead but was no match for the winner through the stretch and just held sway for
second. TANGERINE TAXI hurried away then opted to sit off the pace from just off the rail, urged along inside into the stretch and missed. RED
CHOCOLATE unhurried away, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, and closed gradually. NEVVARE showed interest late. EXHI KID mild late bid.
DURITZ offered little. IGNITE THE MOON trailed throughout.

GREAT VISION contested the early pace while five wide, gained the advantage into the far turn, then drew off in the final furlong and was ridden out. RUN
ROSSCO RUN outsprinted leaving the chute, prompted from the rail, was no match for the winner and held by a nod for place. COSMIC MARINE showed
early speed outside, drifted in while under left handed urging, gained outside and lost the nod. JAKE THE RAKE saved ground inside, swung out into the
lane and lodged a late bid. STREAKIN AGAIN lagged early, bid inside after the quarter pole, and weakened late stretch. REMAIN CALM trailed wide and
offered a mild late interest. MCKENZIE RED sat in striking distance in the two path, and faded.

BIG HUG allowed to settle inside, was asked to quicken nearing the quarter pole, swept the lead into the stretch and won driving. BOOTIFUL ROSE broke
outward then urged to the front, dueled through the turn outside of FASTESTGIRLINTOWN, was overtaken into the stretch, and finished willingly. SINGING
BELL rated off the pace, angled out to the four path and lacked the closing response needed. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN dueled from the rail, and came up
empty in the drive. SUBLIME EUPHORIA lacked early speed and offered a mild late bid. SPIRIT GIRL outrun throughout.

BON PRIX showed the way through the backstretch, was joined by BACOLI in the far turn, kicked clear at the head of the lane, and was kept to task.
PRESS GANG yielded to loose horse leaving the chute, lodged a bid along the rail into the lane, was no match for the winner and finished second best.
FROBISHER BAY reared leaving then was taken up sharply to avoid fallen rider, was bumped the loose horse knocking rider off center, quickly made up
ground through the backstretch, improved position then flattened out. MAKE GOOD CHOICES tracked the pacesetters, hustled five wide leaving the final
turn, improved into the stretch then gave way deep stretch. SILVER SPUN yielded from between loose horse and BACOLI, then was brushed, and rallied
mildly late. BACOLI chased the early pace then moved up alongside rival in the far turn between the loose horse, and had nothing left in reserve late.
SHIMSHINE trailed throughout. MY LUCKY MARK buckled leaving then lost rider, did not finish and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of
Stewards conducted an inquiry at the start involving MY LUCKY MARK, and made no change as MY LUCK MARK was deemed to have had a fair start.

CUBAN COBRA away alertly then attended the pace while five wide, gained the advantage over IT'S A FACT, was given a reminder at the head of the
stretch and kicked clear. READYTOTAPNSING broke inward then bumped LAHUN, chased wide through the backstretch, rallied through the stretch and
was along with time for second. IT'S A FACT contested the early pace, was unable to move on with CUBAN COBRA, and flattened out in the stretch.
SMART CAT trailed early and closed gradually improving late. LAHUN bumped in the early stages, chased four wide in the far turn, moved up menacingly
near the quarter pole before flattening in stride. IT CAN'T HURT showed little. LIL ZAPPER showed good speed inside, was in close quarters into the far
turn, lugged out bumping into REMEMBERTHEALAMO and retreated. REMEMBERTHEALAMO vied wide, and wilted into the stretch.

Footnotes
SANDY BEACH vied for the early lead, showed the way into the far turn, held good margins into the lane then was under pressure through the stretch and
held firm. MOON AMOUR vied outside while angling inward, tracked from the four path, was roused at the quarter pole, and finished well gaining on the
winner. STOLEN JEWEL broke outward the was bumped hard leaving the chute, chased four wide, and kept on evenly through stretch for show honors.
WICKED WOMAN bumped leaving, and closed late. SMOKEDYA sat in striking range while three wide, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and weakened late.
CORDILLERA trailed early, circled rivals off the final turn, and put in a late mild bid. MISS DIRECTED squeezed out in the early stages, and bid belatedly.
SOPHIE MCTROPHY tracked from the rail, and lacked a serious bid. MUSICAL RELOAD bumped away, was jostled between foes soon after, sat mid pack
then angled towards the rail, and had no response when called upon. PRECIOUS NOTES lacked a clear path leaving, chased outside, and retreated with
two furlongs remaining.
