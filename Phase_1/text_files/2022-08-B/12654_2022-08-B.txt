Footnotes
OUR LITTLE GIRL settled behind the early pace while saving ground through the first turn, lost some position late backstretch while continuing inside,
moved out and encountered some traffic three furlongs out while three wide, two path into lane, altered course to the rail when a hole closed a furlong out,
challaged up the inside and drew clear under steady handling. HUSHED COURT ROOM away in good order, narrowly showed the way in the two path
early, continued to set a pressured pace off the inside backstretch and through the final turn, drifted out in midstretch to help close the door on the winner,
proved no match for that rival late, edged clear for the second spot. BURNING DESIRE last away, advanced into a forward position before a quarter, moved
closer and challenged three wide turning for home, drifted in slightly nearing the furlong grounds, lacked a late punch to finish up best of the rest. US
SECOND CUTE PIE pressed the runner up from along the inside for five furlongs, fell back along the rail second turn, moved out a bit to be in the two path
for the drive, finished up evenly to get one position back down the lane. CUSTOM MAIDEN lacked speed off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn,
failed to muster a closing response through the stretch. TABLE ONE fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
BASEBALL LOVER broke on top, soon sprinted well clear off the inside, remained comfortably in front through the turn in the two path then steadily
expanded that advantage down the lane under firm handling til the end. MR. E EDWARDS chased the winner in the three path throughout, proved no match
in the drive, clearly second best. OUT MAKING TREBLE back off the early pace off the inside, three wide through the turn, displayed some modest interest
down the lane to be clear of the others. MAGNOLIA RIDGE broke back, moved up to race in the second flight inside the runner up, continued one paced
through the lane in lacking a closing kick. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE also saved ground to no avail in proving not to be a danger in the drive. VALIANT
DEFENDER last away, failed to menace. HEAVENLY TRUMP tired after a four wide trip.

BIG ACE vied up front out of the chute closest to the inside, continued to set a pressured pace into the turn, shook clear in the two path entering the stretch,
drifted in slightly inside the furlong marker, continued to hold the runner up comfortably safe to the wire. LUCK OF THE STARS with the early pace outside
the winner, fell back off that one late in the turn, dropped inside turning for home, crept slightly closer as that one was drifting in with less than a furlong
remaining, lacked a further advance to prove second best. CASH HOLIDAY broke back, continued to lack speed into the turn, angled out four wide exiting
the bend, slowly getting to the runner up late while remaining out in thge strip. JAYS HOLIDAY within striking distance outside, chased the top two in the
three path out of the turn then had little left to hold off entrymate for the third spot. WILD FIST lacked speed, gave way in the turn, fell far back, jogged in.
BON TON ROULA stopped early, distanced after losing contact with the field, walked in. ONDATRACKPIMPERNEL ducked sharply to the inside at the
break then got out, pulled up onto the main track, vanned off. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE ASSISTANT TRAINER OF THE RUNNER UP
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
GOBOT with the pace from the outset along the inside, continued to narrowly show the way up the backstretch, raced on equal terms with the two other foes
into the lane, long drive, fully extended to prove best. SACRED NATION floated out a bit at the break, was straightened to contest the pace three wide into
the first turn, continued to vie while widest of the lead flight, equal terms with the winner into the lane, spirited duel the final furlong, proved stubborn to the
end. INDEFENSIBLE TOWN balked at loading, last away, trailed into the first turn, continued to track the lead pack the middle half, picked off a single tiring
rival the final furlong while not a threat to the top pair. HOLY PRINCE broke out to float the runner up to the outside, was straightened to contest the pace
while between horses for just over five furlongs, first to blink, gave way.

Footnotes
KING MARVIN broke in but alertly to show the way out of the chute by daylight, maintained a considerable advantage the middle three furlongs, enough left
to hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. ARCTIC ROSE chased the winner up the backstreth along the inside, fell back slightly while continuing to
save ground into the stretch, shifted out a bit for the run to the wire, steadily getting to the winner late, clear of the others. F J'S GEM lacked speed while
racing outside, four wide out of the turn, displayed some late interest to also be closing the gap on the winner. BOURBON ST TAPPIN in the second flight
off the inside early, closer in the two path through the turn, flattened out in the drive. FUNNY ACTOR in mid pack early, failed to respond in the drive.
STAND AND CHEER bothered at the break to be last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LACIS JEWEL maintained forward position from between horses into the first turn, remained within striking distance into the far turn, came three wide for the
drive, challenged outside the two leaders soon after, fell back, made one last push to be up in time at the wire. CRIDER CHASE moved up to duel in the two
path before a quarter, alternated in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, responded when the winner came alongside into the stretch, held a slight
advantage past the furlong marker, expanded that lead a bit the next sixteenth then relented to the winner in the final strides while remaining well clear of
the others. CITIZENS REWARD setteled in the second flight inside, steered out for the drive, up late for the show while not posing a serious threat to the top
two. LIGHT AS A WHISPER dueled up front inside the runner up, continued to contest the pace while saving ground into the lane, faltered the final furlong
and was caught late for the show spot. MISSGREELEY'SSONG void of speed out in the strip, roused while four wide onto the lane, improved position a bit
while not a serious threat. TWO WITH A TEN in the second flight while racing off the inside, had little left for the drive. THINKING OF HER remained back in
failing to threaten. MY REBEL GIRL settled in the main body for six furlongs, had nothing for the drive. EASTER GIRL steadied while rank at the break, fell
further back before a half, finished well beaten.

GLENN'S JUMPER broke on top, soon worked way clear and toward the inside, set all the pace while remaining well in front through the turn and into the
stretch, not threatened to the wire while being kept to task. IN THE ARCH away in good order, closest to the winner in the two path, could do little with that
through the stretch, drove clear for the place. IMPACT PLAYER fell back to trail after the start, split foes when beginning to make a mild advance late in the
turn, finished up with some interest to be up for the show. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER in the second flight along the rail and inside the runner up, weakened
gradually through the stretch to be caught for the third spot late. LOUISIANA HERO off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, came up empty
for the stretch run. BUNKIE'S SONG finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
T J'S SUNSHINE broke well, dueled out of the chute off the inside, shook off the other speed by late backstretch to be clear into the turn, maintained
daylight through the lane while kept to pressure. KASENS TRIBE last away, void of speed for a half, began to move on the outside midway on the turn,
rallied willingly to gain the place, slowly getting to the runner up late. TAP YOUR FRONT in the second flight early out of the chute in some traffic, moved
closer to chase the winner through most of the turn and upper stretch, weakened a bit the final furlong to be caught for the place. LUCCA'S LILYBY broke
back, behind some traffic onto the backstretch, checked up soon after, remained back into the turn, staged a mild rally to improve into lane, flattened out
late. KORAT QUEEN in the second flight early inside, had little left for the drive. IGNITE THE PASSION remained back in failing to menace. HOUSE OF
ZONG broke in good order, dueled up front inside the winner through most of the backstretch, fell back quickly into the turn, passed a tiring rival while never
back in the mix. JOEY'S THUNDER forwardly plced while off the inside, gave way in the midturn. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
LUCCA'S LILYBY AGAINST TAP YOUR FRONT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE CHUTE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
