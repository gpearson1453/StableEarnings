Footnotes
FLORIDA GATOR pressed the pace from the outside of TEXAS HUMOR entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, took control entering the final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to fend off HANKY
PRANKY late to prevail. HANKY PRANKY stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the
run down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to just miss. SLOOP JOHN B away alertly
and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
willingly two wide in the drive to garner a share. BETTER TONE away well, but was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while saving ground at the
rail entering the lane the first time, trailed the field in the run down the backside, commenced his bid three wide from the back of the pack entering the final
turn, and found his best stride late while finishing two out from the rail. COUNTRY COWBOY settled well off the early leaders while racing one out from the
rail entering the stretch the first time, began to advance midway down the backside to gain a striking trip in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through
the turn, but steadied sharply when bumped in mid stretch and never regained his momentum. TEXAS HUMOR broke sharply and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, struggled to match
strides with her pace rival entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry as well
as a trainers claim of foul. The trainer of COUNTRY COWBOY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of SLOOP JOHN B for alleged interference in mid
stretch. After review the claim of foul was upheld, and SLOOP JOHN B was disquallified from third and placed fifth.

Footnotes
OSTRACIZE away alertly and tracked the pacesetter through the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide from the
outside of IRISH LUNA in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn and inched clear late over a determined
pace rival. IRISH LUNA was off a step slow, but rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn
while continuing to save ground, battled down the backside and into the final turn from the inside of OSTRACIZE, struggled to keep tabs on that rival leaving
the turn, but battled determinedly through the lane in a game effort. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS away well, but was taken in hand and allowed to drop back to
trail, began to advanced three wide midway down the backstretch, continued with a three wide bid while looming a danger entering the final turn, but was
unable to sustain her early bid in the late stages. OUREVELADY broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out
from the rail, maintained her position into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide in the drive.
ARTISTIC JEWLER stalked the leaders from along the rail through the lane the first time, continued to save ground through the second turn, rallied two wide
from the back of the pack entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon.

Footnotes
STORMY BLUE broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of VIVA LA VINO through the stretch the first time, continued to battle with that rival in
the run down the backside, put away his pace rival entering the final turn, but was quickly tackled by PAY MY WAY, turned back that challenge leaving the
turn, and inched clear late in a solid effort. PAY MY WAY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rushed
up four wide midway down the backstretch to challenge for the lead entering the final turn, had his bid repelled leaving the turn, but fought on gamely three
wide in the drive to hold the place. PRINCE CAIRO tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, held his position
in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive in a game performance. SMART LAD away
alertly and stalked the leaders while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, advanced three wide midway down the backside, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. WHISKEY TALK settled well off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. VIVA LA VINO raced two wide through the first turn to take a narrow advantage from along the
inside entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with STORMY
BLUE entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of VIVA LA
VINO lodged a claim of foul against the rider of STORMY BLUE for allged interference entering the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed
and no change was made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
INDYGOGOLD settled well off the early leaders while racing three wide entering the backside, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, took control
entering the lane, and held VALUE DANCER safely at bay late to prove best. VALUE DANCER was slow into stride and trailed the field in the run to the first
turn, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove second best. SHOWMAN broke sharply and
tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late
interest three wide in the drive to garner a share. DRILL BABY DRILL settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied smartly four wide through the final turn to loom a danger, was overtaken leaving the turn, and outfinished in the stretch drive. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT away
alertly and raced to the lead while drifting wide entering the first turn, set the [ace from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken
entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. CHAMPIOSA settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BARBERRY BANDIT away well and
tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, battled for the lead from between rivals entering the final turn, but
weakened over the final furlong. UNBROKEN hopped at the start to get away poorly, settled well off the early pace while racing two wide into the
backstretch, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late.

FLORAL was off a step slow, but raced into a stalking trip two out from the rail entering the first turn, rushed up to engage the leaders three wide entering
the final turn, took control midway through the turn and quickly drew clear to prove much the best. THE KAT'S BACK away well and stalked the leaders into
the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched her bid three wide through the final turn, and finished determinedly two out from the rail to get up
for the place in the closing strides. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY broke sharply and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from the inside of LASTING LIGHT in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was no match for the winner leaving the turn, and
just failed to hold the place. LASTING LIGHT away alertly and pressed the pace two wide into the backstretch, continued to battled two wide from between
rivals into the final turn, was no match for the winner late, and just failed to hold the place while finishing two wide in rhe drive. BOUNDFORJAMAICA settled
at the back of the pack while saving ground entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while
unable to mount a serious late bid.

SHARPZAN broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, battled for the lead two wide through the final turn
from the outside of HE'S A SAINT, and prevailed over that stubborn rivals late while getting bumped around in deep stretch. HE'S A SAINT away alertly and
raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied through the final turn from the inside of SHARPZAN, and drifted three wide late while
bumping with that rival, and just failed to last. GREYTOGO away well and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four out from the rail in the drive to just miss. BAKALLEY stalked the early pace
while racing four wide into the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive while unable
to mount a serious late bid. ABRIERWIN settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final
turn, but failed to make his presence felt late in an even effort. SOMTHING ELUSIVE stalked the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch,
continued to save ground through the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. STRIKING VALUE settled well off the early pace while racing three
wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to be a factor. I GOT VISION unhurried early while trailing the
field into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact when called upon.

Footnotes
YOU DON'T OWN ME broke sharply and stalked the contested early pace while saving ground entering the backstretch, tipped three wide midway through
the final turn to launch his bid, and closed steadily three wide in the drive to be up in time. BELLAROO settled well off the leaders entering the backstretch,
rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, swung four wide entering the lane, and closed best off all, but ran out of ground late. LUCKY
LUKE away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, and battled gamely from along the rail in the drive but was unable to fend off the deep closers late in a game effort. RACING RIVER
pressed the pace three wide from the outside of LUCKY LUKE in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle two wide from the outside of that rival
through the final turn, was no match for the top pair late, and checked slightly off heels in the closing strides. SWORD FIGHTER unhurried early while
dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, bided his time at the back of the field in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
and found his best stride late while finishing four wide in deep stretch. THE CHANCES R away alertly and dueled for the lead from between rivals entering
the backstretch, eased off his pace rivals for the run down the backside while settling into a tracking trip, rallied two wide into the final turn, but was unable to
mount a late bid. IT'S IN COMMAND chased the leaders four wide into the first turn before assuming a stalking trip entering the backstretch, launched his
bid three wide approaching the final turn, but weakened badly in the stretch drive.
