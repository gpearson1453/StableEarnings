Footnotes
AH JEEZ forwardly placed outside the top pair early on, challenged three deep on the turn, kicked clear approaching the eighth pole and drew away under
right-handed urging. STORMING MACHINE got bumped around on both sides at the start then bumped again soon after, stalked three deep to the turn,
launched a bid four deep, could not go on with the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to best the rest. KOLOMIO broke alertly then got put in tight and
lost ground, moved inside tracking the pace, lacked room behind the leader entering the stretch, remained inside through the lane and got up for third.
CANDY CARAMEL got bumped hard leaving the gate then bumped again in the early going, chased between foes then waited for room on the turn, tipped
three wide into the stretch, moved out further and bumped rival at the sixteenth pole and was edged for the show. BLUEGRASS RYDER got bumped on
both sides leaving the gate, gave chase two then three wide on the turn, tipped out into the stretch, got bumped by CANDY CARAMEL with a sixteenth
remaining and could not find more late. CROWNING GOLD broke a step slow then hustled to the front on the inside, set the pace under pressure to the
turn, maintained a short lead inside a trio of rivals entering the lane, gave up command in upper stretch and weakened. JERRY JEFF WALKER broke in and
bumped rival at the start, dropped back early, raced off the rail then angled in on the turn and failed to menace. ZOOKEEPER broke well and prompted the
pace from outside, vied between foes entering the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MORNING ADDICTION quickly took control from inside, opened up a comfortable lead, held a diminished lead into the far turn, kicked away when coaxed
along and asked right-handed on the far turn, switched to the left hand in the lane, remained clear into the final sixteenth, shortened late but was able to
hold in the closing moments. JAMMINJL reserved in the early going and tucked to the inside on the first turn, went two wide into the second ben then angled
down to the rail, tipped out to take at the winner in the stretch but was too late. SHE'S SO PRETTY pulled while chasing on the inside early, closed the gap
on the leader leaving the backstretch, saw that rival kick away past the five-sixteenths pole, came two wide into the stretch and put in a mild late bid to close
the gap. OPERATIC broke a step slow, angled down to the inside then moved out a bit while at the back on the first turn, went three deep into the second
bend, tipped four wide to go around weakening rival, steered back in a path leaving the bend, gained a minor award but was no threat. WARREN'S
MEMORABLE tracked three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, moved inside and saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace. SECRET SQUARE
stalked outside a rival early on, dropped back around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
CARMEL ROAD vied for the lead from inside into the first turn then took control from outside pair, lead clear through the far turn and started to inch away at
the quarter pole, then drew off under light coaxing and coasted in late. RIVERSIDE was off slow to begin, had to steady shortly after, tucked inside off the
pace, moved closer in the middle stages, asked three wide around the far turn and gained the place. HARD TO FIGURE vied three deep into the first turn
and began to pull early on the backstretch, chased the winner into the far turn, rounded the bend three then two wide and flattened to third. BLOCKED
pulled on the inside early, stalked behind leader into the far turn, lost ground around the bend and weakened in the drive. ROENICK broke a bit slow and
tossed his head shortly after, got caught six wide outside rivals entering the first turn then moved into the five path, stayed off the rail and went three then
four wide second bend, came three wide into the stretch and improved position. SECRET TREASURE threw his head and came away slow, steadied
between rivals five wide into the first turn, took back and angled down to the inside, got blocked behind a tiring rival midway around the far turn and kept on
to improve placings. DEEP RIVER chased two wide outside a rival early, moved out and went four wide exiting the backstretch, came three wide into the
lane and failed to menace. TELOS vied between rivals early then pressed the pace, chased the leader into the far turn, started to weaken around the bend
and tired. STRUT ON LOUIE was off a bit slow to begin, began to climb and became rank early, raced along the inside near the back into the far turn,
angled out and left the bend four wide and was not a factor. EAGLES LANDING raced three wide around the clubhouse turn from off the pace, dropped
back to last in the middle stages, eased on the far turn, coasted to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
SYNTACTIC tucked inside early, tipped two wide setting his sights on the leader, bid outside into the stretch, took over while brushing rival in upper stretch
and drew clear. STONE POINT was off slow to begin, settled inside then pulled briefly early, moved closer but had to steady off heels at the three-eighths
pole, waited patiently on the far turn, roused in the lane but got boxed in briefly midstretch, gained a clear path and finished willingly for a game second.
TANGLEDUPINGREY sped clear quickly and pulled early setting the pace, showed the way to the quarter pole, challenged into the stretch, brushed with the
winner in upper stretch and relinquished command, kept on through the lane and saved the show. SMOOVE AS SILK broke well and settled into the two
path stalking the pace, took aim three wide leaving the far turn, bid three deep in the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. RECKLESS AFFAIR brushed
leaving the gate, chased while rank early off the rail, steadied off heels on the first turn, continued to pull into the backstretch, entered the lane two wide and
improved position. MY RANSOM hit the gate and brushed with inner rival at the start, got shuffled between foes early, tipped out leaving the far turn and
lacked a rally. WESTERBERG steadied four wide when the rider's right iron slipped but quickly regain his footing on the clubhouse turn, angled in and
saved ground through the far turn and was never a factor. ALMONT broke a step slow, stalked three wide early, lacked while response while pushed upon
on the far turn and had little left in the drive.

upper stretch and widened under right-handed urging and coasted in late. LARIMAR chased off the inside, entered the lane four deep and got up for
second. FLAT OUT JOY was off slow to begin, tracked off the pace and moved inside, waited for room behind a rival on the turn the tipped out and bumped
foe nearing the stretch, rallied between rivals and gained the show. EQUILOVE (IRE) stumbled bit, was closest in pursuit in the early going, chased the
leader into the lane and lacked a late bid. ROSES R BLUE broke a step slow, trailed on the inside into the turn, angled out five wide leaving the bend and
summoned a mild rally. WARM SUMMER bumped leaving the gate, bumped with inner rival soon after, sat off the pace, spun four wide into the lane and
could not rally. MAJESTIC GIGI sped to the front and crossed to the inside, pushed upon with a quarter mile remaining, lost command at the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened down the lane. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN was off slow to begin, climbed a bit on the backstretch, raced near the inside into
the lane and improved position. GAYLES EVENING raced up close between rivals then got crowded a bit early, chased the leaders on the inside to the lane
and faded. FULL OF GRACE bumped shortly after the start, steadied early then dropped back, came four wide into the drive and was not a factor. BUSY
PAYNTER tracked off the rail, bumped while three deep approaching the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. CHERISHED bumped with rival leaving the
gate, sat off the pace outside a rival, raced wide through the turn and came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SENSIBLE MOVE was off slow, racked between foes then outside a rival, exited the far turn two wide, angled out and bumped rival in the stretch, rallied to
the front nearing the sixteenth pole and proved best. JESSEBEAR was rank early and suffered a shuffle between rivals, still was rank early on the
backstretch, went three deep into the far turn, roused in upper stretch, rallied between foes and finished gamely for second. CANDY ON TOP rated in the
two path early, coaxed three wide into the stretch, got pushed out and bumped by the winner in the lane and was outkicked in the late stages. A LITTLE BIT
CRAZY got bumped leaving the gate, became rank early on, settled in a stalking position on the inside, roused into the stretch, tipped out in upper stretch,
took over with a furlong left to run but yielded in the final sixteenth. INFINITE LOVE broke slow and got bumped at the start, became rank early then chased
four to three deep on the clubhouse turn, pulled on the backstretch, raced in range three deep into the far turn, steadied on the second bend, came five wide
into the stretch and flattened out. THREE POINT OH cleared early and angled to the inside, rated on the front end setting the pace under pressure, cleared
rivals exiting the far turn, lost command nearing the eighth pole and flattened out. KOKO'S MOM reserved on the inside, raced in tight on the far turn next to
the rail, put to hand urging in the stretch and lacked a rally. AIRKITA broke in and bumped rival, pulled and became rank early, pressed the pace outside the
leader then between rivals, fought outside the leader on the far turn, then weakened in the stretch run. KAYLAS JOY bothered into the first turn and became
rank, went up to attend the pace three deep, lost ground and chased four wide into the drive and weakened. RYDER'S CANDY threw her head and broke
slow then steadied shortly after, trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. MARGOT'S GIRL was off slow and bumped leaving the gate, went six wide into
the first turn then moved in some while still wide, traveled four deep up the backstretch, came six wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
MAN OH MAN bumped both sides leaving the gate then went up to take control, set the pace on the inside and stayed clear to the wire. MERIT SONG was
closest in pursuit through the early stages, asked two wide into the drive, lacked the needed late kick but was able to hold the place. LET HIM DO settled off
the pace, asked two wide into the stretch, moved out and put in late bid and missed second. SILVER LIGHTENING bumped in the beginning, tracked on the
inside, angled out to the four path into the stretch, drifted out further in upper stretch and lacked a rally. SPIRITIST was off slow and bumped at the start,
advanced four then five wide around the turn, tipped outside drifting rival in the lane and could not threaten. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE broke in and
bumped rival, chased off the rail then angled to the inside and weakened. SMOKIN AMELIA got bumped leaving the gate, steadied between when crowded
by rivals, came five wide into the stretch and was not a factor. PADDLE ON POLLY stumbled a bit leaving the gate but recovered quickly, stalked off the rail,
dropped back on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
IN YOUR FACE rated on the inside stalking the pace, tipped out into the stretch, reached the front past the eight pole and cleared midstretch, then drew
away under a drive. DEAR BEAU (IRE) unhurried on the inside in the beginning, moved closer on the far turn, entered the drive two wide, steered out and
closed well to earn the place honors. ABOVE SUSPICION set the pace on the inside, dueled around the far turn, clung to a narrow advantage entering the
final furlong, was overtaken soon after, flattened in the final sixteenth but held the show. PEANUT BUTTER CUP up close early to the outside of the
pacesetter, challenged for command on the far turn, dueled to the eighth pole, could not kick on with the winner in the furlong grounds and got edged for the
show. LOOKINTOGETEVEN allowed to settle at the back, steered to the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, looked to rally but lacked room and had to
check behind the leaders, angled out late but could not regain momentum. VIOLET STORM brushed leaving the gate, pulled in the two path early on, sat off
the pace to the far turn, had to steady at the quarter pole, went three wide into the drive and lacked a rally. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) rated off the rail early,
came three wide into the lane and lacked further response. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) tracked four wide around the first turn, remained wide to the stretch
and lacked a rally. SUPERCENTS brushed leaving the gate, raced between rivals near the back then in the two path, traveled two to three wide on the far
turn, angled to the inside at the top of the stretch and came up empty. BALI DANCER traveled three deep into the first turn near the back, was eased early
on the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch and walked off. A GOOD LAW Ramon Vazquez was unprepared at the start then hit his head on the stall door
causing him to pull the reins and was unseated shortly after and A GOOD LAW walked off unharmed. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND
FOLLOWING A REVIEW RULED THAT A GOOD LAW WAS UNPREPARED FOR THE START AND IS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
