Footnotes
BALTIMORE BUD sped to the front, set a pressured pace towards the rail, shook clear leaving the far turn, drifted out a bit entering the lane, corrected, kept
on under right handed asking past the sixteenth pole and lasted. PRINCE PIKACHU stumbled at the break, recovered and edged up three deep into the
turn, gave hard chase around the turn, kept on grinding through the lane and had his rally fall just short. DONTFORGETTOBLINK , off the pace and outside
a rival, swung five wide for the drive and rallied. BOLD TREK , towards the inside, moved up past the sixteenth marker then flattened out. HOWARD'S
ROCK lacked speed, angled in early but failed to muster up a serious response. SKY OF GOLD dwelt at the break spotting rivals several lengths, circled
into the stretch and failed to menace. JUST GO WITH IT forced the early pace outside the winner, raced between runners into the turn, failed to keep pace
past the furlong grounds and weakened.

Footnotes
CURLINGTON broke a step slow, was hustled up soon after and gained a good position along the rail, edged up and angled three wide leaving the half mile
marker, moved up and engaged MONYINTHEBANKSEY with three furlongs remaining, dueled under asking leaving the quarter pole, spurted clear heading
to the stretch then held firm while kept to task. IT'S GAME TIME , off the early pace and outside a rival, split rivals commencing a run leaving the half mile
pole, gained three wide into the far turn, gave hard pursuit of the leaders past the three sixteenths and kept on gamely though second best. ONE TWO KID
settled towards the inside, angled out around the final turn, offered a mild response and gained the show over a tiring rival. MONYINTHEBANKSEY had
speed then angled out and prompted the pace two wide, took over heading into the backstretch and kicked clear, was joined by the winner near the three
eighths, sparred to the three sixteenths then weakened. HAYNE'S FEVER , wide all turns, failed to menace. JOJOMAR was hard sent to clear, set the pace
towards the inside, took pressure past the five eighths, ceded the advantage leaving the half mile pole then faltered.

Footnotes
THIEF OF HEARTS , taken to rate off the pace and saved ground early on, angled off the inside for the backstretch run, crept closer leaving the far turn,
gained four wide under asking into the lane, moved to engage R B'S STAR from her outside nearing the sixteenth marker, dueled under left handed asking,
took over late and grimly prevailed. R B'S STAR rated close up then eased out past the half, bid three deep after a half mile, took over with a quarter to go
then cleared, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, battled valiantly but just missed. CLICK TO CONFIRM , off the pace, moved up along the inside and
under asking past the three eighths, briefly steadied off heels leaving the far turn, dropped back a bit mid way on the turn, swung five wide for the drive and
came back on with good energy. ITALIAN DRESSING was squeezed back soon after the break, settled well back, circled four wide with progress into the
stretch then flattened out. BRUNELLA chased the leaders four wide, moved up a bit three wide and under asking nearing the lane, shifted in and faded.
UNREQUITED LOVE prompted the pace two wide, moved to a short lead after a half mile marker, was overwhelmed leaving the quarter pole, drifted in a bit
and faltered. ALWAYS SOMETHING sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, ceded the advantage nearing the five sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
CUPID'S DART came out at the break and bumped with HE ROLLS, corrected and dueled inside a pair of rivals, came out slightly and brushed with HE
ROLLS nearing the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. HE ROLLS , bumped at the break, disputed the pace between rivals, held
a short lead past the three eighths, ceded command leaving the far turn, stayed on to battle, was brushed and floated out a touch nearing the lane then
gave way grudgingly. TWICE GOLD , away slowly, gained towards the inside around the final turn then flattened out late. SYNCOPATED , three deep vying
for command, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faded. BRILLIANT ICE lost ground four wide and failed to menace. IMAGINE IT ALL tossed her head as
the gates opened and was off a bit slow, recovered and pulled her way forward, chased behind the dueling trio while three wide past the three eighths,
stayed in touch to the three sixteenths and faded. EL PATOJO , unhurried early, edged up behind foes into the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole,
again near the three sixteenths and again nearing the lane, shifted out and came on with interest. PHRA PHROM , in the clear three wide into the
backstretch, raced between runners leaving the far turn, drifted in a bit and gave way. An objection by the rider of HE ROLLS against the winner alleging
interference nearing the lane was not allowed

BREVIARY stalked the pace while along the inner rail around the first two turns, moved to the three path mid way down the backstretch, remained three
deep on the far turn, raced on her left lead through the stretch, closed steadily and was up approaching the finish. MALIBU BEAUTY set the pace along the
inner rail, opened up on the far turn and gave way grudgingly. FOOL YOURSELF advanced three deep to challenge for the lead on the second turn,
remained prominent to the far turn then gave way. HYBRID ECLIPSE prompted the pace outside MALIBU BEAUTY for five furlongs and faltered on the far
turn.

Footnotes
HOT SPICE disputed the early pace inside rivals, spurted clear into the turn, responded to strong encouragement in upper stretch and held sway. SKYFLY
forced the early pace three deep, gave hard chase two wide into the lane and kept on willingly to be well clear of the rest. BACARI , off the rail with pursuit,
offered up a mild kick. I'M PRETTY , four wide, was not a threat. DAYS REMEMBERED vied early between runners, steadied back off foes nearing the turn
and faded. BABY WONDERS , getting out, was pulled up nearing the lane and walked off.
