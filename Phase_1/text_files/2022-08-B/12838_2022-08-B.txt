CONNECTION raced off the early pace, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner. DONTFORGETRDREAMS
chased the early pace from the inside, continued its run from the inside near the quarter pole and moved up late to improve position. MOODY RAFAELA
showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way in the drive. FORT PIKE was void of early speed, raced four wide near the quarter pole and
lacked a bid. SWEET JACKIELEIGH was coaxed along early, raced four to five wide and had nio response. ZUMRA BAYOU was hard sent from the inside
and tired readily in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MO BLING stalked the top pair early, moved up four wide near the quarter pole to take a clear lead, dug in inside the eighth pole and held gamely to prove
best under strong pressure. DREWSILLA rated along in the early stages, was asked near through the far turn, challenged for the lead nearing the eighth
pole but couldn't get by to finish second best. SMILING ANGEL showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside and weakened in the stretch run.
COME WHAT MAE broke to the inside, settled off the early pace, raced along the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out five wide and raced evenly late.
SHE'S TAKIN OVER stalked the pace from the inside and tired. ISN'T IT TIME tracked the early leader from the outside and tired readily.

RUMOHR REIGNS stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole, moved up five wide in the stretch run and drew off to be clear under steady
pressure. D T'S DREAM chased the early leader down the backstretch, took command into the upper stretch, led narrowly near the eighth pole and was no
match for the winner late. FAR BEYOND raced off the early pace, was near the rail in the stretch run and moved up to improve position. PESO IN MY
POCKET chased the early pace, raced three to four wide in the drive and raced evenly late. JUSTIN SPEIGHT showed good early speed to set the early
pace and gave way. BORDEAUX RED dropped back early, raced five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. MACHO RONNIE was hustled from the
inside and failed to respond.

PARALISSFRMANALYSS showed good early speed from the inside and drew off to be well clear in the stretch run under a steady hand ride. AMERICAN
NIGHTMARE settled to the middle of the pack early on, moved up from the outside in the stretch run and got up for the place position. ROOSTER RUN
tracked the early pace while racing three wide, patiently ridden through the far turn and weakened through the drive. LUCKY CRUSADER was bumped at
the break, raced five near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. OBVIOUSLY TOO pressed the pace while racing between rivals and gave way.
TOUCH OF GOLD was bumped at the break and trailed.
