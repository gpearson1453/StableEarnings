IZANAMI pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew off. SPICY SOMMELIER set the pace, responded
when challenged to duel, faltered near the sixteenth pole and held safely for place. LOVE YA MOST raced in the back, bid six wide leaving the turn and
offered a mild bid to get up for show. KNOCKON showed good early speed, fell back, bid and came up empty late. WISHFUL WON put in an even effort in
an outside trip and was not a threat. KID CAT saved ground, lacked a bid and showed little. Hand timed.

Footnotes
KING LEBRON was hustled along to vie two across, inched clear late and proved best. JAZZ TOWN vied inside to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly.
MORE HONOR was unhurried early, saved ground, closed inside, was gaining late and got up for show. SPITTIN HAVOC showed good early speed, fell
back, came again, narrowed the gap and was vanned off. GOT EVEN SMARTER was never far back, bid willingly and didn't have enough late.
REDACTION hesitated at the start, raced far back early and passed a tiring rival. CURRENTLY KRAZY was outrun in an even effort. Hand timed.

SKY HIGH VERONIKA was never far off the pace, swung wide entering the stretch, dueled for the lead, was in tight late and outfinished in a game effort.
SHE HAD A SECRET broke slowly, set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn, responded when challenged to duel through the stretch and was outfinished
in a game effort. MIDNIGHT BABY was never far back, put in an even effort and failed to menace. TOP REFERENCES was in tight near the gap, led early,
bid inside and came up empty late. TAYLOR'S SISTER broke awkwardly, trailed the field and showed little. DOWNTOWN CUTIE was pulled up and walked

stalked the pace while racing inside, angled out in the upper stretch and closed to earn place. ADD ON set a pressured pace, was headed into the turn,
continued willingly, came up empty late and finished best of the rest. MIZZEN POWER pressed the pace, was through after a half and faded. HIGH FLYIN
TIGER showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. REALREALGOOD was not a factor. IMPERATOR was outrun. AUTISM SAVANT was not a

CAUSE AND EFFECT set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew off and extended the lead. HARROVIAN raced in the second flight along the
inside, bid along the rail on the turn and got up for place while no threat to the winner. INTERACTIF MOMENT challenged between horses on the turn, fell
back, hung late and held for show. UNCLE FLOYD raced in the middle of the pack, swung wide leaving the turn, found his best stride late and was gaining
ground. KONA COAST challenged three across on the turn, swung out entering the stretch and faded from contention. MONUMENTAL SEVEN showed
speed to the turn and flattened out. KAT'S HITMAN bumped at the start and was not a factor. THEY'RE GRRREAT was outrun in an even effort. INCLUDE
HOO bumped at the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. MI MALDITO AMOR was fractious in the post parade and failed to contend. Hand timed.
