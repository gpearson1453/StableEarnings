Footnotes
PHANTOMS BOOK broke a bit awkwardly but went right to the front, set the pace, drifted out slightly on the second turn then dug in determinedly to prevail.
MO SUGAFOOT was away a step slowly, chased the winner to the second turn, was fanned out a bit into the stretch then was outfinished. ELECTRIC
ELIZABETA pressed the winner to the second turn, made a run inside rivals to briefly loom a threat into the stretch but came up empty in the lane. MISSY
PARKER was also chasing to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. JAN'S BEST had no speed, was two
wide throughout and never was a serious threat. The jockey on MO SUGAFOOT lodged an objection against PHANTOMS BOOK for alleged interference on
the second turn but the claim was not allowed by the stewars in a unanimous decision.

MAXINAMILLION was unhurried mid pack to the backstretch the second time, eased out to commence his bid, pushed to the front, was two wide to the
stretch and held driving. KALINE trailed for a half mile, got fanned out to the four path on the far turn and made a late run for the place. PULPITS POWER
settled mid pack, raced two wide, got outkicked to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. WINGS OF THE WIND never far away for a half mile,
saved ground to the stretch but did no tally. BERNIE'S BIG BOY contested the pace for five furlongs then was outrun to the stretch and weakened. AMITY
HARBOR stalked the pace for a half, was three wide and gave way in the final furlong.
