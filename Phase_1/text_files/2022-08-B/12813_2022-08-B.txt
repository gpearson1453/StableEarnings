Footnotes
JOE FRAZIER raced four wide into the first turn then stalked the pace up the backstretch, moved up three wide to duel for the lead midway around the far
turn, briefly shook free at the head of the lane then came under attack from MAKABIM, battled back gamely from the inside and prevailed in final stride.
MAKABIM settled off the early pace then began to pick up the tempo leaving the backstretch, chased four wide around the far turn then roused forward to
engage JOE FRAZIER for the lead a furlong out, dug in determinedly along the outside and got nipped for the win. DEANOS CAPE tracked the early pace
on the outside, hustled along three wide around the far turn, ran on four wide into the lane and secured a share. BLAME ELI applied pace pressure to DARK
HEDGES up the backstretch, dueled for the lead racing between rivals around the far turn then faded in the lane. DARK HEDGES set a pressured pace up
the backstretch, dueled on the inside around the final turn then came up empty in the upper stretch. END ALL GET ALL raced tow to three wide into the first
turn and raced off the early pace, had no response when called upon around the far turn and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SUN SQUALL rated on the inside up the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, came three wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer and got up
in deep stretch. TOO LATE set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled inside of TAKE ME UP BRADY around the turn, shook free at the head of the
lane then got caught in deep stretch. TAKE ME UP BRADY pressed the pace up the backstretch, dueled outside of TOO LATE around the turn, could not
match strides at the head of the lane and weakened to show. KNOCKS BIG THIRST tracked the pace in the opening quarter, chased three wide around the
turn and flattened in the lane. JAMES'S MOONSHINE raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. BORN AGAIN
GEORGE showed response in the opening quarter then weakened, saved ground around the turn and had no late response.

Footnotes
NUGGET OF GRACE got bumped at the start then stalked the leader up the backstretch, dueled outside of LEIGHS LIL SECRET around the far turn, took
on the additional challenge of CORRENTE DE OURO at the lane, battled gamely three deep into the final furlong and edged away. LEIGH'S LIL SECRET
led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, dueled inside of NUGGET OF GRACE around the final turn, took on the added
challenge of CORRENTE DE OURO at the head of the lane, battled back between foes then failed to contain the winner late. CORRENTE DE OURO
tracked the pace along the inside through early stages, launched a rail bid turning for home and engaged the top pair for the lead, dueled along the inside
into the final furlong, got overtaken by the winner in late stages and got nipped for place. CYBER MONDAY rated off the early pace, coaxed three wide
around the far turn, stayed on four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for serious impact. MR. PRIME TIME was forwardly placed around
the first turn, remained in range up the backstretch then steadily faded. LOOKIN' BOMBED steadied entering the first turn then settled while not too far of
the early pace then had no response after the half and steadily retreated.

WICKED CHOCOLATE stalked the pace up the backstretch then coaxed three wide around the far turn, stayed on three wide into the lane, dug in
determinedly under firm handling and got up in final strides. ANIME DAY dueled for the lead leaving the first turn, continued to battle for command up the
backstretch, shook free near the three eighths pole and led the way two wide into the lane, fought on gamely holding a slim lead into the final furlong then
edged out in final strides. DERONDA tracked the pace up the backstretch, moved two wide around the far turn then took the inside spot at the head of the
lane, raced in striking distance at the eighth pole then yielded late. SUE HAPPY settled off the early pace, was ridden along two wide into the lane and
needed more for late impact. PREF RIGHT raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE settled
through the early going, coaxed three wide around the far turn and had no response. REMITTANCE SENT dueled for the lead leaving the first turn,
continued to battle through the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and retreated through the lane.

FLEET OF HOOF led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, dueled with NATIVE HELLRAISER around the far turn, shook free
at the lane, stayed sharp under a drive and pulled away. NATIVE HELLRAISER stalked the leader up the backstretch, dueled for command around the far
turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but stayed on with response and cleared second best. EVIL KNIEVEL tracked the early pace, was
ridden along three wide around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane and finished clear over the rest. PISTOL PACKIN MAN was unhurried racing in the
back, came four wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. ONE LAST CHANT raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the far
turn and failed to threaten. BLUE PARADISE stumbled had at the start, quickly recovered and raced in range through early stages, flattened along the
inside around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. STAR OF MINE stalked the pace up the backstretch, bolted around the far turn, stayed outside
and jogged in.

Footnotes
SOMEBODY'S PROBLEM vied outside of ARIZONA KALEI up the backstretch, held a slim lead over rival around the turn, took charge at the head of the
lane, kicked clear under a drive and finished going away. ARIZONA KALEI dueled outside of SOMEBODYS PROBLEM up the backstretch and into the turn,
could not match strides at the head of the lane but stade on with response and finished clearly second best. NAUGHTY LOTTIE raced in early contention
and coaxed three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and prevailed for a share. MY HAPPINESS lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled
along two wide late on the turn, angled inside at the head of the lane and needed more for serious impact. EMPIRE OF MY OWN tracked the top two flights
late on the backstretch, was ridden along four wide around the turn, drifted wider entering the lane and failed to respond. BATTER UP BETTY raced off the
early pace, got carried wide into the stretch and never threatened. CRYPTO MO chased in range along the inside, sustained bid around the turn then came
up empty.

I THINK I KNOW YOU sped to the lead soon after the start and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held clear around the far turn, came two wide
into the lane, had plenty left in reserve and kicked clear. KAYLA was unhurried through early stages, picked up the pace two wide then launched a bid along
the rail at the quarter pole, tipped two wide for the drive and dug in for place. FLAT OUT STORMIN stalked the leader up the backstretch, coaxed three wide
around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane and finished clear over the rest. BUG A BOO was unhurried and raced in the back, gained contention four
wide around the far turn then flattened in the lane. SIMMERING stalked the early pace. chased three wide around the far turn then faded in the lane. JIBE
tracked the pace through early stages, failed to rally under pressure around the far turn and steadily retreated. NAUTICAL MISS rated near midpack up the
backstretch, flattened inside around the final turn and continued to tire in the drive. AMERICAN SUE raced three to four wide around the far turn and had no
response.
