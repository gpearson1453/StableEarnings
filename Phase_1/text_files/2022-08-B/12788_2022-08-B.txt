Footnotes
LADY VALENTINE asked a bit away from the gate to maintain position between horses, pressed onto the backstretch, took over in the two path before a
half, dueled, drove steadily clear through the lane. RED HOT MOON outrun in the early going, continued back in the two path, swung three wide into the
lane, rallied while remaining well out in the strip, finished willingly to be clear for the place, too late for the winner. ABBEY LANE forwardly placed along the
inside, moved out onto the backstretch, continued within striking distance second turn while in the two path, lacked a closing punch through the lane.
SERAPE went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. TEASIN' TESLA four wide whenb off the pace through the first turn, begin to tire before six
furlongs. GATOR PROUD five down to four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit more late in that bend, remained always back in failing to threaten.
ITSONLYMONEYHONEY narrowly showed the way early inside, dueled with the winner into the far turn, stopped midway on that bend, trailed home.

Footnotes
HOPE FOR CHANGE allowed the pace to go early, headed up the second flight up the backstretch, three wide through the bend, late push to reach the
front with a sixteenth remaining, edging clear late under steady handling. GOTTATAKEHIMTO also in the second group, came on the inside for the drive,
rail bid late, could not match strides with the winner in the final strides, second best. BIG BOSS MAN dueled up front off the inside, shook off the other
speed when straightened for home, could not contain the top two in the late going while between that pair at the wire. IDE LIKE HAWAII in mid pack while
racing outside, four wide through the turn, roused for the drive, displayed a mild amount of late interest while unable to improve position. UNBRIDLED
PULPIT fell well back after the start, remained devoid of any speed for five furlongs, steered out widest entering the stretch, improved positon without posing
a serious threat. AMBASSADOR HOUSE in the main body inside, continued to save ground through the turn, lacked a closing response. CORN SOUP
dueled up front closest to the inside for five furlongs then gave way at the head of the lane. K T'S JILTED GROOM dwelt at the start, remained back while
well wide through the turn, distanced through the stretch, walked off.

Footnotes
HIGH VALUE TARGET with the pace from the start, vied inside onto the backstretch, shook clear before a half, rated while throttled back in the second turn,
drew off through the lane under an intermittent right handed crop. K V SQUARED settled off the pace and the inside, moved cloest to the winner in the three
path turning for home, could do little with rival the final furlong, clearly second best. CUPIE CUTIE in the second group while racing inside, continued to save
ground second turn, proved no match for the top two through the stretch, narrowly saved the show. TRACK QUEEN broke out, lacked speed, three wide
through the second turn, staged a mild rally to be slowly gaining for the show late. ALLEN'S JUDY broke back, lacked speed and never menaced. JIG TIME
BANDIT pushed out at the start, recovered to move up on the outside to become a forward factor before a quarter, chased the winner past the half mile
mark then began to falter. BISTINEAU BELLE vied up front outside the winner for three furlongs and stopped, well back.

Footnotes
HOT STOVE LEAGUE away well from the outside, dueled up front in the two path, continued to duel off the inside the middle half, held a slight advantage
nearing midstretch and continued to hold the other speed at bay from there to the wire to prove best. DEBONNAIRE DUDE broke best of all, clear to the
inside when narrowly showing the way into the first turn, altered inside the winner in the run up the backstretch, held the slightest of advantages midway on
the final turn, headed entering the stretch, proved stubborn to the end while remaining clear for the second spot. APPLEWOOD broke back, tucked in early
to save some ground, continued inside, steered out around a tiring rival late in the final turn, improved position through traffic. OCTOBER SURPRISE broke
back, void of speed off the inside, came four wide for the drive, also improved position with some mild, belated interest. DUTCHMAN settled well off the
pace, lacked a significant closing response. UNWANTED INTRUDER in mid pack early, moved a bit closer with a modest middle move, had little left for the
drive. PARTY OF FIFTEEN settled off pace, was finished after five furlongs. LATE NITE MISCHIEF headed up the second flight for three quarters, gave
way late in the final turn.

Footnotes
DRAFT CHOICE close up between horses first turn, put a head in front just before a half, shook clear second turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage
past the furlong maker, dropped to the inside soon after while still clear to take the rail away from the runner up, drifted out a bit to float that same rival out in
the waning strides. LEROY JENKINS outrun early in traffic, continued back into the far turn, began to move midway on that bend, angled out four wide when
rallying into the lane, encountered some traffic and steered in just inside the furlong marker, altered course past the sixteenth pole to the outside for room,
late bid, floated out, missed. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY last to leave, void of speed while saving ground first turn, moved out into the far turn, four to five wide
entering the stretch, rallied down the middle of the strip to earn the show. MATH MAN lacked speed for six furlongs, in the two path exiting the final turn,
improved past the furlong marker, saw that progress stalled a bit in some traffic with a sixteenth to run then picked it back up late when clear between
horses. BIG RESULTS forwardly placed three wide and outside the winner for five furlongs, chased that one into the lane and began to falter.
THISGUYCANFLY settled in the second flight for six furlongs, weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane. MARVINS GOLD was
finished after a half. MONITOR MILLS set or forced the pace along the inside for a half and began to give way. FLIT N FLOT TIME behind the three early
leaders through the first turn, began a steady retreat before a half.

OURS AND THEIRS outrun in the early going off the inside, three to four wide late in the turn when picking up the tempo, engaged the leader with less than
a furlong remaining and wore that foe down in the final strides under confident handling. FRIENDLY ACES allowed the pace to go early, moved closer three
wide early in the turn, took over entering the stretch, clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner late, saved the place while drifting out a bit the final
sixteenth. MEAN AMERICAN in mid pack toward the inside, roused three wide into the lane, angled inside the drifting leader past the furlong marker, slowly
getting to that one late. LUTIE MO broke back, moved outside, came five to six wide into the lane, closest a furlong out then flattened out a bit the final
sixteenth to finish up evenly. DIATONIC lacked early pace off the inside, roused four wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals stretch to improve
position. RESPECT ALL chased the quick opening quarter, roded the rail into the lane, lacked any kind of closing response. SUNSHINE STAR with the
second flight off the inside, moved closer late in the turn, faltered in the drive. ABSOLUTELY MINDY last away, remained always back. NOT SO SWEET
broke a bit outward but very alertly, quickly clear, set a rapid opening quarter, stopped when headed late in the turn, jogged across.

Footnotes
SMOKEY HARBOR raced in the 2nd flight toward the inside, fell back a bit far turn, traffic then was blocked entering the stretch, lost action repeatedly,
shifted outside to be widest, late burst to win going away. LULOS closest to the leader off the inside, also encountered some traffic late in the final turn and
into the stretch, challenged between rivals, led late, proved no match for the winner while holding sway for the place. WAITA MINUTE HAYES five down to
four wide early first turn, continued to stalk on the outside the middle half, poked a head in front three wide and between foes turning for home, vied past the
furlong marker then was outkicked by the top two to the wire. CREME DE BALI last to leave, lacked speed, angled out to be four wide when moving past the
furlong marker, with the lead pack past the furlong grounds then was also found lacking in the late going. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL broke with the leaders,
sprinted clear before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch just off the inside, faltered when headed turning for home. TAYLOR'S SENSE fell back
to trail soon after the start, fell further and further back and was never involved.

Footnotes
BIG SESSY within striking distance well out in the strip early, raced four wide through the turn, engaged the two leaders from the outside past the furlong
marker wore that foe down under firm handling. GENES FEATHER prompted the early pace off the rail, three wide into the lane, challenged between rivals
nearing the furlong marker, slight lead, outkicked late by the winner, clear for the place. BIG RUSSSS broke on top, narrowly set the pace in the two path,
responded briefly when confronted by the top two turning for home and through upper stretch then could not match that pair, saved the show late. CHAN off
a step slow, raced back early, five wide into the lane, improved position with some belated interest while remaining well out in the strip. PRAYFORTHEWIN
vied early along the inside, continued to vie along the rail until late in the turn then began to gradually weaken. HONORABLESTATEMENT raced in the
second flight for three furlongs, came up empty in lacking a response in the drive. T D Z HI COURT five wide into the turn when off the pace, angled in a bit
to be four wide by midway on the bend, no rally stretch. ISLE CALL U LATER broke a step slow, remained back in failing to threaten.
