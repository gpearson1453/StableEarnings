SECRET CASTLE moved to the rail and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the quarter pole, remained at the rail on the far turn and was kept
alert through the stretch. CHIT CHAT GIRL saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and proved no
match in the lane. LONGSTORYLUCY raced well off the pace two deep on the opening turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, eased four
wide leaving the far turn and came along for third the final strides. HERETODAYGONMANANA steadied shortly after the start then saved ground, bid
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened inside the eighth pole. CATHERINES WARRIOR settled close off the rail,
picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths then weakened. RHYTHM TREE stalked the early pace
two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. BUFF N raced off the early pace about the three path,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded into the far turn. This race was hand timed.

ELVIRUS took the lead at the three quarter pole and moved to the inside into the first turn, kept the edge over the challenge of Divine Proportion leaving the
three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady handling the final furlong. LET US MAKE GOLD steadied at the start and
rounded the first turn in the four path, left the turn outside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path
and dug in through the lane to take second the final jump. DIVINE PROPORTION stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the three eighths pole but dropped
back approaching the quarter, rounded the far turn off the rail, flattened stride inside the eighth pole and was nipped from second under the wire. GRECIAN
ADMIRAL saved ground off the pace on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn but
showed little further. WORLD OF FOOLS rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran near the rail on the far

Footnotes
NORTHERN RIDGE settled inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead in the three path approaching the head of the lane, dueled clear
mid-stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. MARTIN MAN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid toward the three eighths pole and
took a slim lead nearing the five sixteenths, dueled clear approaching the quarter and raced at the rail through the far turn, was met into the lane, flattened
stride but managed to hold onto second. HOBE SOUND rated close to the early pace off the rail, moved to the inside into the second turn and raced boxed
at the rail through the turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. RRACE DAY
WARRIOR took the lead two deep on the opening turn and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was caught leaving the
three eighths and gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened in the lane. JAYJAYDEE stalked the early pace from the three
path, took a brief lead at the three eighths pole, gave chase from the five sixteenths then weakened while losing ground on the far turn. GHOST STALKER
rated close to the early pace inside, was shut off and checked sharply off the heels of Hobe Sound into the second turn, eased out into the backstretch and
gave chase, but was of little consequence. CHARITABLE SPENNY rounded the first turn in the five path and stalked from the seven eighths pole, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch. The Stewards posted the inquiry and reviewed subsequent claims of foul.
First claim was against the rider of Martin Man, lodged by the rider of Hobe Sound but was dismissed. Second claim was against the rider of Hobe Sound,
lodged by the rider of Ghost Stalker and resulted in the disqualification of the former to sixth place for interfering with the latter in the vicinity of the five
eighths pole.

ABOUT TO RAGE closed to the lead nearing the three eighths pole, was pressured clear toward the quarter, rounded the turn at the rail then steadily
handled to hold on. BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR chased inside through the backstretch, angled to the five path on the turn and finished well widest. KING
T'CHALLA gave chase and raced close in the three path of the turn, but flattened in the lane. TANELEER took an early lead but was met and gave chase
from the three eighths pole, dropped back toward the quarter, continued close off the rail then weakened into the stretch. QUICK WIT exchanged contact
with VITO ANDOLINI leaving the gate, gave chase toward mid track then saved ground on the turn. The latter exchanged contact with Quick Wit leaving the
gate then saved ground.
