DELIGHT prompted the pace in the two path, was coaxed from the five path into the lane, and drew clear. ALL ABOUT ME was keen to lead two wide early,
took control of proceedings dwon the backside, was cued from the five path into the lane, but yield passing the eighth pole. INSCRUTABLE chased in the
three path, was ridden in the five path going into the lane, and kept on for show. SILENT STORY was unhurried from inside, was hustled while saving
ground into the lane, but was one paced. BRIGHTHILL rated in the two path, swung out to the six path into the stretch, but weakened. TOUGH GAME
stalked from the three path but faded into the stretch. BIZ AS USUAL trailed from the four path early and never threatened. ONE CLEAR MOMENT tracked,
drifted out to the seven path on the first turn, and was no menace.

Footnotes
MY DANNY BOY took the lead from the start, raced in the two path down the backside while in control of the tempo, coaxed on around the far turn, under a
heavy drive drifted out nearing the furlong marker, held off inside challenger under the wire. HEFFNER sent early for position around the first turn, stalked
the leaders from the inside, came under a vigorous ride leaving the three eighths pole, drifted out leaving the quarter pole, moved inside deep stretch under
a stiff ride, just missed at the wire. EKATI'S VERVE off the pace around the first turn, raced along the rail into far turn, saved ground while called on ,
encountered heavy traffic at the quarter pole, regrouped when straitened out top of the stretch, gaining late. ILLUSTRIOUS tracked the leader around the
first turn, raced just of the outside flank of the leader into far turn, came under a steady drive leaving the quarter pole, could not match strides with winner,
stayed on late. HARD LIGHTING slow to start, raced well off the pace, reserved all energies till deep stretch, striding well very late. BRANCO MARIA raced
off the pace and wide around both turns, stayed outside through the stretch, even strides under the wire. There was a riders objection in this race, the rider
of EKATI'S VERVE claimed foul against the rider of HEFFNER, for interference at the top of the stretch, the stewards ruled insufficient evidence, no change.

Footnotes
THORNY TALE tracked the speed around the first turn, stayed glued to the wing of the leader down the backside, sent clear leaving the quarter pole, came
under strong outside pressure in deep stretch, found the wire in time. MOROCCO bumped at the start, raced off the pace and off the rail down the backside,
took the overland rout around the far turn, five wide at the top of the stretch, stayed middle lane in deep stretch, closing in on leader just missed.
ALBERTANO inside trip early on, raced along the inside and well off the pace, sent to the attack around the far turn, came under a heavy drive leaving the
quarter pole, shifted out around weary rival, finished up willingly. CATCH MY VIBE ground saving trip around both turn, when called on leaving the quarter
pole, could not quicken with leaders, even strides stretch. MYSTIC LINK clean trip while stalking around the first turn, came under a vigorous ride around
the far turn, weakened through the stretch. SWING WEST off the early pace, swung into action while racing wide around the far turn, steadily faded through
the stretch. WILD UNION slow into stride, always outrun.
