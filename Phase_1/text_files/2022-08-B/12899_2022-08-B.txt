the winner. INSACIABLE PRINCE unhurried early, found his best stride late in the five path. SMUDGE THE CAT pressed the pace two wide into the stretch
then faded late. ASTRAY CAT was forced in sharply at the start to avoid his outside rivals then failed to menace. BUILT LIKE TARZAN had brief speed.

CRIMSON LEGION hit the gate then bore in bumping SIREN CALL at the start, trailed into the far turn, closed willingly in the two path and was along in time
under mild urging. STARLITESLEW pressed the pace three then two wide for six furlongs, made the lead then couldn't handle the winner in the final stages.
AUGMENTING ASSETS never far back while outside, finished with good courage in the five path. ETTA broke in front, set the pace along the inside for six
furlongs, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then faded. SIREN CALL was bumped at the start, stalked the early pace four wide then was through
after a half. I'M JAC'D pressed the pace two wide into the far turn then faltered.
