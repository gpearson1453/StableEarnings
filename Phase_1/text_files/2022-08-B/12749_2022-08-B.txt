TWISTED RIDE dueled along the inside, repelled pair of opponents then edged away through the lane driving. BUCKS ARE MOVING far behind early,
advanced very wide in the stretch and was up for the place. STONEGATE prompted the pace three wide, vied to the stretch and finished willingly. CUNEO
lacked speed, moved wide and narrowed the gap without menacing. BOSSMAN JONES settled off the pace in the two path and lacked a rally. DEPLANE
broke sluggishly then passed fading rivals. TANKINATOR dueled between rivals for half a mile and weakened. CONDITION ONE made a brief wide bid on
the turn then flattened out in the stretch. NORTHERN EXPRESS was urged close up inside early then began fading on the turn. MR. TUTTLE dropped far
behind throughout.

GOOD SOURCE vied outside, moved easily to front at the quarter pole, drew clear and stayed safe. BRUNO BARBER GIRL outrun early, advanced wide
then closed with a rush too late. BACK TO D' FUTURE urged off the leaders three wide and continued willingly. PACHELBEL forced the pace to the turn
then weakened slightly. RIVERVIEW ran off prior to the start, rushed to the front inside then tired through the stretch. DESI'S REWARD chased along the
inside and was never a factor. TEMPTED TO TOUCH dropped far behind racing wide then narrowed the gap. SOCIAL LADY raced inside and lagged far
behind. GIRL FROM TYRONE angled inside down the backstretch and lacked a rally. IYIYI flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly.

advanced four wide on the turn and finished willingly while no match for the winner. TIZ SPEEDY was urged close up between rivals, was asked for run on
the turn then drifted in through the stretch. SPY NOVEL was fractious during the loading process, faded on the turn then came again while no threat.
HARLEY'S CHARLY broke slowly, rushed up inside then faltered. DAGDA dueled between rivals to the stretch and gave way. HESFIREDUP prompted the
pace inside to the stretch and faltered. GOLDEN TALENT saved ground off the leaders and weakened steadily. SPECIAL PERMIT lost contact with his field
and was eased.

REMAIN ANONYMOUS settled well back, circled her field with a bold move on the turn, took over in the stretch and surged off to a decisive score. CHUB
WAGON dropped back outside, advanced near the quarter pole, swung wider and gained the place. OXANA forced the pace inside, was eased to the
outside on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. CINNABUNNY stalked the pacesetters wide down the backstretch and flattened out. PRECIOUS
moved inside in the opening quarter and lacked a rally. EXCITABLE LADY lacked speed along the inside and was always outrun. HEY MAMALUKE
alternated for the advantage inside then stopped after half a mile. DISCO EBO dueled outside for half a mile then gave way readily.

Footnotes
FORTHELUVOFBOURBON settled inside the dueling leaders, angled three wide on the turn, drifted wide then edged away through the stretch. BEREN
dropped back early, moved inside into the far turn, split foes in deep stretch and was up for the place. BREEZY GUST advanced wide on the turn, bid
extremely wide into the stretch and finished gamely. PRINCE OF RAIN lacked speed inside, moved out in the stretch and closed well. THISCATCANJUMP
dueled along the inside to the five sixteenths pole and faltered. MIDNIGHTCHARLY dropped well behind saving ground and was never a factor. JW'S
THIRD MISCHIE earned a narrow lead outside, vied through the turn and faded. FINAL SHOT stumbled badly at the start then was never in contention.
DANCE CODE lacked speed and trailed throughout.

quarters and faltered. WAIT FOR IT prompted the pace outside, led briefly at the quarter pole then tired. KING KUMBALAY trailed the initial half mile and
lacked a rally. DIVINE MIRACLE was fanned extremely wide into the first turn, remained wide and tired. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE stalked the pacesetters

continued willingly. TITANIC ROSE lagged far behind, angled out in the stretch and closed strongly. ARGENTINA GIRL dropped back early outside and
lacked a rally. ET'S MOON MAIDEN saved ground, faded on the turn then came again while no menace. KNOCK OUT KID raced extremely wide and was
no factor. ESPERNSITA prompted the pace in the two path and proved empty in the stretch. LA CIENEGA was urged close up three wide to the far turn and
retreated. SUMMARY JUDGMENT flashed speed inside then was finished after half a mile. QPIDSCARIZMATKQTEE was placed in tight just after the start
and raced far back.
