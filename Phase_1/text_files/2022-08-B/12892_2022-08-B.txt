Footnotes
TIME BREAK broke on top, was rated outside MEETMEINSTLOUIE on the backstretch, took over two wide when allowed into the bend, moved clear,
stayed just off the inside, was roused entering the stretch, lengthened command and held ABBMAR at bay under steady handling. ABBMAR well placed
from inside, swung out three wide on the turn, moved clear for second, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but gradually pulled away for the place.
PECOS AUTUMN well back early, saved ground through the bend and passed inside tired ones upper stretch without threatening the top pair. PRETTY
GITA crowded briefly at the start, raced in the second flight outside ABBMAR, swung out with that one entering the turn and steadily faded from path four.
MEETMEINSTLOUIE broke a bit inward, was hustled to dispute the pace, gradually angled in on the backstretch and gave way along the rail on the bend.

PEACOCK MAN prominent from inside, squeezed through along the rail leaving the turn to vie for the lead at the top of the lane, floated out some to jostled
with BAM BAM CAN approaching and into the final furlong, moved clear soon after that, drifted out late but held sway. STUMP was boxed in behind the
early speed on the backstretch, lost considerable ground fanning five wide for a clear path on the bend, took over second nearing the final sixteenth, closed
well but came up short. BAM BAM CAM disputed the pace just off the inside, edged ahead on the turn, lugged in slightly approaching the furlong marker,
jostled with PEACOCK MAN, slowly yielded deep stretch but was easily best of the others. YABA DABA DOO contested the pace outside BAM BAM CAN
for nearly four furlongs then began to fade. RIPE ATTACK stumbled a bit at the break, advanced from outside to help prompt the pace, was four wide
through the turn then gave way the last two furlongs.

U S HONOUR NAP vied for the early lead from inside, did not keep up after two furlongs, waited for room on the bend, squeezed through along the rail
leaving the turn then moved clear inside the last furlong. GHAALEB'S HONOR pressed while toward the outside on the backstretch, advanced three wide
on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, found best stride too late but caught ROCKET MAN ATTACK for second nearing the wire. ROCKET MAN
ATTACK broke on top, contested the pace between horses, moved clear after a quarter mile, was challenged from inside upper stretch and gradually wore
down the final eighth. SMOOTH ATTACK forwardly placed from outside on the backstretch, failed to keep up widest through the bend, improved position
slightly upper stretch then leveled off. HELA flipped in the gate, was removed and examined by the veterinarian, returned to the gate on approval, displayed
early speed between rivals but began to yield two wide on the turn. DARREN'S LEGACY raced in a narrow path just inside ROCKET MAN ATTACK on the
backstretch but gave way with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
GLOBAL EMPIRE rated off the early speed from between rivals, commenced his bid from inside on the turn, split rivals two wide with a quarter mile to go,
had the advantage entering the lane then steadily opened up under a mild drive. KINGSBURRY ATTACK without early speed, moved to the inside midway
on the backstretch, came into contention along the rail on the bend, moved clear for second upper stretch and could only just hold his position late.
AWESOME WILLY broke slowly and was soon well back, picked up his pace five then six wide through the turn, gradually lugged in as he passed tired ones
in the lane, narrowly missed second but was easily best of the others. LUKE ATTACK prominent between rivals, went for the lead three wide into the turn,
floated out some leaving the bend and flattened out for the drive. READY MADE broke on top, was soon chasing ANUNKA and MEMPHIS THEPROPHET
from outside, was four wide on the bend, floated out further into the stretch and gave way. ANUNKA vied for the early lead from inside, edged ahead on the
turn, floated out some entering the lane and also gave way. MEMPHIS THEPROPHET displayed early speed just outside ANUNKA but quickly faded
between horses after three furlongs.

Footnotes
W W CRAZY bumped with KHOZAN'S SUCCESS at the start, was rated off the early speed, gradually progressed from outside on the backstretch, vied for
the lead three wide on the second turn, moved clear inside the last furlong and held on under steady handling. DIAMOND MAXIMUS broke outward, also
bumping with KHOZAN'S SUCCESS, was prominent from inside, found himself boxed in behind the leaders nearing the second bend, dropped back some,
gradually angled out, came four wide into the stretch, rallied the last furlong, took over second with forty yards to go but came up short for the win.
STALLONE was sent to contest the pace just off or along the rail, yielded some leaving the second turn, was crowded and brushed by KHOZAN'S
SUCCESS midstretch, steadied then lacked the extra needed the final sixteenth. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS bumped and squeezed briefly between rivals,
quickly recovered to vie for the lead from outside, edged ahead two wide on the second bend, began to yield some into the lane, lugged in to brush
STALLONE midstretch, was corrected and also did not have enough left in the waning yards.
