Footnotes
SILENT GHOST was coaxed early to grab the lead leaving the chute, opened up on her rivals entering the turn, when asked in upper stretch responded well
to offer a strong finish in deep stretch to keep closers at bay in the end. BORN TO BE GOOD settled at the back with three eighths to run, angled out to the
four path between runners at top of the stretch to rally, found her best stride at the furlong marker to close well running a clear second. DIAMOND CRUSH
chased the winner early on , began to inch closer to the lead two furlongs out, was repelled by the frontrunning winner in upper stretch but showed some grit
through the lane while on the wrong lead to hold for third running between rivals. RIDE THE WIND rated inside mid pack in the early stages, began to
advance on the rail throughout the turn and early stretch, angled just off the fence midpoint through the lane and stalled late losing third at the wire.
EVERYDAY MAGIC tracked outside mid pack in the beginning, was roused through to turn to go after the leader travelling three wide, began to weaken
when angling out to the four path turning for home and showed little in the stretch. WINYAH BAY trailed early on down the backstretch, was ridden hard with
a quarter mile to run, angled out for the drive into the five path and offered no finish.

Footnotes
MIA'S AUTHORITY moved clear and shifted in heading past the wire the first time, set the pace inside, began to edge away on the far turn, drew off in the
stretch under moderate hand urging. SALADA was forced in early, saved ground inside on the first turn, advanced up the backstretch, shifted out to be three
wide past the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but kicked on to secure the place from DUSTY'S CHANCE, who had a light bump at the break, was
forwardly-placed three then two wide stalking the eventual winner, could not rally and lost second in the stretch. WANNA PLAY exchanged minor light
bumps at the start, raced off the pace about mid-pack mostly two to three wide on both turns but a bid wider up the backstretch, ran on evenly and was
never able to menace. YOU THRILL ME was in just a bit tight along the rail early, settled off the pace saving ground through the first turn, encouraged a bit
past the half, came out in mid-stretch, was never near enough to threaten. SHE'S SO COLD hopped and steadied slightly at the start, switched out and
advanced rapidly outside rivals four wide early on the first turn to obtain forward position in pursuit of the leader, steadily dropped back and faded.
SILENTANDDISCREET bumped a rival lightly at the break after coming out, lacked room in behind as the pacesetter moved nearer the inside in the early
going and came in at that point while steadying before moving back out, raced mostly three to four wide, never produced a bid. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SILVER SIGN broke a bit slow but quickly recovered to lead, was pressed but an outside rival throughout the turn, turning for home was collared and briefly
surrendered the lead but found some more late inside with a furlong to go to stubbornly inch away late for the win. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES tracked the early
pacesetters outside, commenced a run on the turn circling foes travelling three wide, made a bid outside at the top of the lane to briefly hold the lead with a
furlong to go but was outkicked in deep stretch by the stubborn winner on the rail. MORE GELATO rated inside behind the contesting frontrunners going into
the turn, rallied when angled out in upper stretch four wide and found some late energy to get up for third at the finish. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO sat just
off the pace in the two path after the break, pressed the winner through the turn, battled between rivals for the drive in upper stretch and weakened in the
later stages losing third nearing the wire. UNPASSABLE broke sharp, was allowed to settle behind horses running down the backside, could not keep up
with the field through turn and passed tiring rivals while inside through the lane. ONE LAST FLING trailed soon after the start, made a mild rail run midway
on the turn, angled out to the five path in upper stretch and faded down the lane. LOVE MY CHERYL was hustled between runners to contest the early
pace, began to weaken with horses on either side with three eighths to go and faltered at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
HALFINTHEWRAPPER moved clear with just moderate coaxing to set the pace inside, came off the fence turning for home and in control, held safe from a
closing rival. IMA BEAST settled off the pace toward the back, saved ground on the turn, came out in the stretch, was gaining but too late. SOUPER PECAN
was urged at the break, chased inside, came out near the quarter pole about three wide, drifted out a bit in the stretch, secured show honors over BASALT
STREET, who got away well, stalked the eventual winner two to three wide on the turn coming out four deep toward the latter part of that bend, drifted out a
bit in the stretch and needed more. GIZMO'S B F F settled off the pace early, was four wide into the turn racing mid-pack, came into upper stretch seven
wide, could not menace the top ones but was best of the rest. ADVERSITY chased briefly two wide, steadily retreated to be nearly last coming into the
stretch but kept on to pass some tired ones late. HIT AND RUN raced outside at the rear lacking early speed, went four to five wide on the turn, swung nine
wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten. MRS. DEL raced off the pace four to five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch eight deep
then moved in a bit, failed to rally. ASTROLOGICAL lacked early speed racing off the inside about three deep and was never a threat.

Footnotes
BOUND LUCKY trailed the field on the turn, began to gain momentum two furlongs out, angled out for clear run in the six path turning for home and was full
of run late getting up at the wire for a well timed rally. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE rated patiently near the rear down the backstretch, began to weave through
runners with a quarter to go, found a seam in the three path in upper stretch, quickened to lead with an eighth to run and could not hold off the fast closing
winner at the wire. DROP A CARIBOU pressed the early pace, contested for the lead between runners at the top of the stretch and could not match strides
with the top two finishers running to the wire and had to settle for a non threatening third. PRINCE SUSSEX sat behind the early frontrunners down the
backside, waited on the rail through the turn, offered a rally on the fence in upper stretch only to be in tight quarters trying to go through the seam nearing
the furlong marker and had to settle for a minor placing. BULLET SPEED tracked between rivals in the second flight in the beginning, started to rally outside
midway on the turn, loomed four wide turning for home but could not find enough late. COLTONS DREAM broke sharp to lead, angled inwards soon after
the start, widened his lead through the turn, was collared with a quarter mile to go, shied inwards with rivals around him nearing the furlong marker, had to
be taken up and faded afterwards. SOUPER PRONTO stalked outside runners going four wide with three eighths to go, was roused but could not keep up
with the field while racing four wide through the turn and could not become a factor in the stretch run.

SIXTH ANNIVERSARY bumped a rival lightly at the break, tracked inside, found plenty of room at the top of the stretch to bid, took command and drew
clear, held safe. BEDAZZLE ME exchanged a solid bump at the start, shifted in early settling at the rail, was in tight on heels of a rival near the
five-sixteenths, came out three wide turning for home, dove to the rail in mid-stretch for room, rallied but too late. FORTYFIVESEVENTY had some minor
light bumps at the start, recovered quickly to track inside, came out five to six wide turning for home and in contention, didn't kick on with the top one but
kept on. SENSATIONAL SARAH hopped and bobbled just slightly at the start, stalked in behind two to three wide till late on the turn, fanned six to seven
wide into upper stretch adn kept on. BEAR SPEED shifted in early, raced on or just off the rail through the turn, went evenly in the stretch. SILENT DIVA
brushed lightly at the start, was mid-pack racing off the inside into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, ran on mildly. SILENT TRIBUTE moved forward
and clear to set the pace racing in the two path, drifted four to five wide into the stretch, was collared at that juncture and steadily weakened. BLONDE
DYNAMO bumped with a rival at the start but was up close early stalking two to three wide, came out turning for home then drifted in a bit in upper stretch
while weakening. A GAL FOR T J bumped and bobbled at the start racing at the back, switched outside foes up the backstretch, went five to seven wide on
the turn and was never a threat. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN bumped with a rival at the start, was forced in early and steadied slightly, raced toward the back
three wide on the turn moving to the rail near the quarter pole and was unable to menace. MY GIRL GABBY chased briefly three to four wide, dropped back
and faded.

Footnotes
TWISTER ALERT was allowed to settle at the back to trail, commenced her run three eighths from the finish, angled outside of rivals with a quarter left
gaining momentum, had clear run turning for home in the seven path and finished strong getting up just before the wire. SUGAR IS GOLDEN sat behind the
dueling trio in the early stages, waited inside through the turn to find run, split foes at the top of the stretch in the three path to bid for the lead with an eighth
to go and could match strides late in deep stretch with the winner. SWINGING MANDY rated in the second flight between runners in the beginning, waited
for running room on the rail through the turn, could not find an inside path in upper stretch to run, angled out nearing the furlong marker four wide and
showed late interest to get up for third at the wire. BIG GINGER took command early, was challenged by outside horses through the turn, was headed in
upper stretch, repelled her pace rivals, but did not have enough left in mid stretch to hold off closing foes in the final eighth and had to settle for a gutsy
fourth. SILVER BULLET LADY contested the early pace between runners, still forced the issue through the turn just outside, poked her nose in front turning
for home and weakened between rivals in deep stretch. GAV'S DREAM GIRL rated in the second flight outside of runners down the backside, rallied going
four wide on the turn, got into contention at the top of the stretch and stalled in the drive. LOADED VIXEN contested the early pace outside going three wide
into the turn, began to weaken in the three path mid point on the turn and faltered between runners in the stretch.

Footnotes
ISHIYAYA moved clear to set the pace, came off the rail turning for home, was put to strong urging and held sway. RED EQUINOX chased from inside the
second flight off the inside, went in the two then three path on the turn coming four wide into the stretch, kept on to just get the place while no late threat to
the winner. SUPER LUNAR raced inside the trailing group early, saved ground while asked midway on the turn, ran on belatedly to get up for third while
narrowly missing second. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD raced outside the second flight four wide on the turn, fought on in the stretch but was outfinished for both
place and show. GHAALEB THE GREAT broke a step slowly, switched out early while trailing, advanced to between runners in the trailing group heading
into the turn, came out five wide in the stretch and was never near enough to threaten. SILENT RESPECT broke a step slowly, raced outside at the rear,
went four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six wide, failed to threaten. BILLYJANE chased from between runners in the second flight, began to drop
back about the five-sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
EMMELINE took command from the start, was well rationed on the front end running down the backside, repelled a mild challenge entering the stretch and
had something left in reserve to hold off a closing rival late. LIDO KEY tracked behind the pacesetters down the backstretch, waited patiently inside through
the turn , angled out in the three path for the run to the wire and was gaining steadily in the final furlong running out of room in the end. ERASMO'S GIRL
trailed while angling in to the rail to save ground into the first turn, started to run slipping up the fence with three furlongs to go, continued her rail rally in the
stretch but could not contend with the top two finishing well for a clear third. MOQADAMA (IRE) broke out to begin, chased the winner at every pole, offered
a brief challenge on the far turn but was repelled in upper stretch and stalled between horses late settling for a minor award. GUILEFUL broke out at the
start,, settled near the rear behind rivals at the half, shuffled back on the turn to trail and put in a little run to pass tired runners in the lane. RICHIES NOBLE
GIRL hopped at the break, rated between runners mid pack in the early running, roused on the far turn three wide and had little impact in the final stages of
the race. SILVER DAHLIA raced four wide going into the first turn, was outside runners mid pack down the backstretch, ridden hard going four wide through
the far turn and had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE EFFECT exchanged a light bump at the start but moved forward to set the pace racing two wide, was clear midway on the turn and into upper
stretch, just held under steady handling. TUDOR PEAK was coaxed forward early, pressed from inside up the backstretch, lost ground on the turn, switched
out past the three-eighths, was gaining but too late and just missed. MENAGERIE exchanged a light bump at the start, settled outside a foe mid-pack, went
four then five wide on the turn, ran on mildly for show honors while no threat to the top pair. NORTHERN PASSAGE was lightly bumped after the start,
tracked in behind two wide into the turn and inside rivals, moved out four wide leaving the bend and ran on. HEKLA'S AURA raced between foes just off the
pace early, dropped back three wide on the turn and failed to rally. GOLDEN SUZIE bumped a rival lightly after the start, raced near the inside and never
threatened. ASHWICKEN raced outside foes off the pace three to four wide through the turn, came into upper stretch six wide, failed to rally. BABA'S GIRL
was devoid of early speed, raced off the inside, was not a factor.
