Footnotes
HEY SEQUOIA was allowed to settle on the inside, advanced on the inside to the quarter pole, then shifted out and made a four wide bid leaving the turn
and edged clear in the final furlong to prove best under a mild drive. EROTIC stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, gained a short
advantage leaving the quarter pole, but was quickly challenged by the winner and battled on the final furlong but could not go with the winner while being
clearly second best. STONUS MAXIMUS set the early pace getting to the inside on the first turn, then was pressured on the backstretch and headed on the
turn and weakened, lasted for the show award. MILORDS OATHKEEPER chased the pace three wide, then was three to four wide on the far turn and came
five wide into the lane and weakened, missed show award. IRISH TERRIER was four wide into the first turn, settled three to two wide and tired.

Footnotes
HUNTERS GHOST tracked the early pace on the inside, eased out on the turn and came three wide into the lane, made a bid and surged late to get up in
time under a drive. AFTER THE CANDY was away alertly and soon clear and moved to the inside to set the pace while clear, then remained clear by the
furlong marker but failed to last and was denied on the wire. FORTY SMOOCHES was settled early, made a inside middle move to be in contention, then
remained on the inside to the furlong marker and then shifted off the inside and was slowly gaining but needed more. MISCHIEF ROAD was allowed to
settle and saved ground on the inside and then had a mild late rally on the inside. ABRAAJ MIRAGE was reserved early and five wide by the three eighths,
shifted in on the turn to save ground, then angled out in the lane and improved late. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN tracked the pace three to four wide and
weakened. RINGS OF SATURN chased the pace four wide and came wide into the lane and was empty.

LAFONDA tracked the early pace and made a inside bid on the turn to duel for command, then kicked clear leaving the turn and remained clear to the wire
to prove best, driving. SHE'S MY RIDE was settled early, raced four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and closed well on the outside to gain
the place award. MOSCOW LADY set a pressured pace early on the inside, then came off the inside and was challenged on the inside by the winner,
dueled for the lead outside that rival and was two to three wide on the turn, battled on in the lane and finished on even terms for the show position. TYCHE
AWAITS YOU was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and shifted off the inside in the lane and had a late rally to split rivals and finish on even terms
for the show award. LET IT REIGN chased the pace early, advanced two wide on the turn, angled in leaving the turn to make a bid on the inside but had no
late punch. IT'S CURLIN TIME pressed the early pace three wide, then chased the pace three wide on the turn and weakened. EASY DOES IT was settled
back early, angled out in the lane and had no rally. SWEET KATIE O chased the early pace and weakened.
