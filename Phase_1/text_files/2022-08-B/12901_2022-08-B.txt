Footnotes
BEAR BRIAN prompted the pace set by First Count from along the outside, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and quickly drew clear. THE LAST FEAT
was forwardly placed while racing three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished well for the place. DAN WHO was unhurried early,
swung out to be six-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. GREENBRIER saved ground stalking the pace, was in tight on turn turn, checked
in traffic nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out for room nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly. CHIPPSTER was never far back, came
three-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. ASSISTANT weakened after showing early speed from between horses. FIRST COUNT set the
pace to near the stretch from along the inside and gave way when headed. MARK'S WARRIOR broke in the air to get away behind his field, raced far back
and failed to menace. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS, MADE NO CHANGE IN THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
BIG MAC DADDY was permitted to settle in stride, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly to be in the final sixteenth to win going
away. GLENDORA MINECAT stalked the pace while racing three-wide, responded when asked, but was unable to resist the winner late. MEMORY TAKER
prompted the pace from along the outside of Night's Watch into the stretch and held on well for third. MAD LUTHER dropped back early racing along the
inside and finished in a mild rally. EL CHUMELITO was two-wide on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. NIGHT'S WATCH saved
ground setting the pace to the stretch and tired. SKEETER WHO was finished early after showing brief speed from along the inside.

Footnotes
CITYONTHENILE saved ground setting the pace while racing in hand, responded when asked and was ridden out to increase her advantage. NOBLE MISS
was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up four-wide on the turn, offered a bold bid nearing the eighth pole, but was unable to reach the winner. SWEET
HONOR was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch and was gaining ground late. YOU WANNA EAR RIP
dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished willingly. METAROSE stalked the pace while racing two-wide to the stretch and weakened.
GIRONA was never far back while racing three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. TICK TOCK was forwardly placed racing
along the inside and tired. EBB AND FLOW dropped back early and failed to threaten while saving ground. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T was forwardly placed for
a half mile while racing three-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
RUNNINGINTHERAIN sprinted clear early, set the pace racing slightly off the rail, turned back a bid from Groovy Huey nearing the quarter pole and was
ridden out to increase his advantage. GROOVY HUEY was prominent from the start while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bold bid nearing the
quarter pole, but was unable to match strides with the winner during the drive. RANSIER bobbled at the start, then was unhurried early, came four-wide into
the stretch and finished in a late rally. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE was allowed to settle in stride while racing three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the
stretch but lacked a response. MR. NASTY dropped back early, saved ground but was unable to threaten. JEEBAR was prominent for a half mile from
between horses and tired. BROGAN'S INVASION was forwardly placed along the inside for three furlongs and gave way.
