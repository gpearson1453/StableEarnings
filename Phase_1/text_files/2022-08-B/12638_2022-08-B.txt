MEAN TWEETS tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, moved up near the rail in the stretch run and finished well to get up late under
strong handling. THE COLORA KID showed good early speed from the inside to set the early pace, had a clear lead near the eighth pole, raced off the
inside in the drive and was wore down late to finish second best. PROCTOR PHANTOM raced off the early pace, was near the rail around the far turn into
the stretch, angled three to four wide in the lane and made a good late bid. THTWASTHENTHISISNW coaxed along early whil racing three wide down the
backstretch and weakened in the final stages. CITI CREEK was off slowly, chased the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled widest
through the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
GRAND WISER set the tone early, quickly clear into turn, surveyed the competition near the quarter pole, very little effort pulled clear through the stretch,
hand ride under the wire. ANY MINUTE , stalked the leader while running along the inside, stayed with leader around the turn, shifted out into the three path
for stretch run, could not match strides with runaway winner, held sway for the place money. BRACES raced between runner headed into turn, rated back
off the leaders around the turn, shifted inside at the top of the stretch, finding best strides while running on left lead, finished willingly through the wire.
MIDNIGHT TRICK off the pace at the start, swung out seven wide entering the stretch, picked up ground late, never a threat to leaders. RUN HAPPY STAR
, broke a step slow, raced well off the pace into turn, moved out five wide leaving the three eighths pole, sustained bid till inside the furlong marker, finished
even late. MESMERIZED tracked the pace setters into the turn, came under a heavy ride while racing four wide around the turn, weakened through the
stretch. BOLD TREK teed up early to be part of the mix going into the first turn, racing between runners around the turn, had no late kick. SPECIAL
MEISTER away in good order after the start, raced along the rail into the turn, urged on, lost contact with leaders, outrun stretch.

Footnotes
HONOR THE FLEET was rated down the backstretch while racing three to four wide, was in command near the three eighths pole and held gamely to be
clear late under steady handling. Honor the Fleet had to be vanned off the track after pulling up down the backstretch. ELLAS MY LOVE pressed the early
pace while racing between rivals, dug in late and held the place position. TWITTY CITY was allowed to settle early, moved up three wide near the quarter
pole, raced five wide into the upper stretch and closed in on the top pair late. GRIT'N'GRIND settled off the early pace, moved up from the outside in the
stretch run and made a good late bid. YABBA DABBA DUDE showed good early speed to set the pace while racing from the inside and weakened around
the far turn and had not enough. WHIRLIN CURLIN was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early, lost ground and never threatened. ALEJANDRO'S
TEAM was bearing out in the early stages, bore out entering the far turn and was pulled up. Alejandro's Team walked off the track under his own power.

Footnotes

late rush to his inside. SOUPER ENERGIZER tracked the top pair around the first turn, perfect pocket position down the backside, shifted inside nearing the
furlong marker, was moving best late, not enough to catch winner. NAUTILUS stalked the pace setter around the first turn, always in good striking position
just outside the leader, queued up top of the stretch, could not keep pace with top pair, clearly holding onto the show money. IN EFFECT off the pace into
first turn, rated back off the pack till near the quarter pole, split horses top of the stretch, raced between rivals through the lane, good late interest, never a
threat to top three. WINSTON PEGG raced between runners down the backside, stayed off the pace till top off stretch, picked up the pace late.
INITFORTHELOVE wide around the first turn, took up a wide stalking placing down the backside, stayed out wide when asked for best run, finished even
late. HARD STRIKE lacked speed around the first turn, raced well off the pace down the backside, passed a few foes running even through the stretch.
HACHURE stalked the leaders around the first turn, held nice stalking placing backside, urged on nearing the three eighths marker, could not respond.
ROBERT'S LUXURY , hopped at the start, was well off the pace down the backside, could got quicken with field, outrun late. MUTASALLEM ground saving

Footnotes
MY BEAU was coaxed along early, raced wide through the upper stretch to race outside of foes, dug in late and proved best under strong encouragement.
SPEIGHTSTER RED chased the early leader down the backstretch, ridden through the far turn, raced between rivals through the upper stretch and finished
willingly to the wire. I SAW IT ALL showed good early speed to set the early pace, shifted well off the inside into the lane and weakened the final eighth of a
mile. EXXTOP stalked the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and raced evenly late. JAIME JAMEL raced off the early
pace, raced three wide around the far turn, angled widest through the stretch run and had not enough. FROST'S SONG settled to the middle of the pack,
raced near the inside at the quarter pole and lacked a bid. DR. GRUNSEICH was slow early and never threatened. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN was off very
slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the break, raced near the back early after the troubling beginning and never threatened.

Footnotes
CHIEF RON stalked the pace from the outside of foes, challenged through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch, lost whip near the sixteenth
pole, shifted in a bit late and got up under steady handling. MONEY MIKE chased the early pace, moved up near the rail in the stretch run and finished
gamely to the wire. OMAHA RED vied for the early lead from the inside, dug in late and finished willingly to the wire. GROWL TIGER vied to the outside of
foes down the backstretch, raced between rivals in the stretch run and weakened. RILEYS DUDE was off slowly, raced towards the inside and lacked a
rally.

Footnotes
ILLUSION OF HOPE broke very sharp, split runners into turn, quicken top of the stretch, steadily pulling away under a drive. NOTHINGMAKESENSE well
off the early pace, stayed outside and off the pace, when called on shifted out six wide top of the lane, showed good late interest. ROSELEE sent through
along the inside early, backed off entering turn, split rivals leaving the quarter pole, raced evenly through the wire. BIG EYE JOY away last, in no hurry into
turn, shifted out top of stretch, passed tired foes, never a threat. TRICKLER wide after the opening bell, stayed five wide into turn, came under a drive,
outrun through the stretch. TEXAS GIRL keen to run on after leaving the gate, moved up between horses into far turn, stayed with leader till quarter pole,
steadily weakened through the stretch.
