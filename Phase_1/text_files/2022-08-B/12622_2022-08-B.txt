winner to the wire but lost head bob while clearly best of the rest. HOLY CROSS chased top pair throughout with no late kick when needed. CONGRATS

finished well. HAY SPORT saved ground never far back, no kick in the stretch run. ZIP IT SCOTTY saved ground to turn, angled out with nothing left to
offer. MASTER LEA shut off early, seemed to race rank thereafter while outside.
