Footnotes
MIDNIGHT PIRATE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled four wide mid stretch, made a steady
gain and edged up in the final strides. BOURBON BLAST well placed and between, gained position on the two path through the second turn, angled four
wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. NEVISIAN SPIRIT tracked the pace, was boxed through the second turn, angled
three wide when clear into the stretch and evened out. SWEET MOOCHIE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned
widest into the lane and passed tiring rivals. SONG OF INDY stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, led
on that path into the stretch, shook clear, then flattened and faded late. ANNIE UP BUCK sprinted clear soon after the start, stayed on when challenged
through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. TREASURE THE STORM well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn,
then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
HUNTIN' THE RUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and lasted under steady pressure.
OLD FORTY FIVE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed.
WHONEW'S TREASURE hard to rated inside in the early going, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
angled out and lacked the needed late kick. NATHANIEL'S HOPE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch and passed tiring rivals. TEMPLE OWL LIAM mid pack, angled out and moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the
lane, then drifted in and weakened. TIDDLY WINK well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the
stretch. AVENGEMENT was never involved.
