Footnotes
FOREVER MESA unhurried from the gate, advanced widest on the backstretch, was in path five on the second bend, angled in some near the quarter pole,
brushed with WHITE CASHEL shortly after that, angled in beside MISS KITTY PIE at the top of the lane, edged ahead upper stretch and held on under
steady handling. MISS KITTY PIE broke inward, soon had the lead, set a pressured pace in hand from off the rail but inside rivals, floated out some early in
the second turn and again with two furlongs to go, moved to the rail at the top of the stretch, was overtaken, never relented but did not have enough left.
WHITE CASHEL was kept close, went for the lead between horses on the backstretch, did not keep up just outside MISS KITTY PIE on the second turn,
lost her path briefly and brushed with FOREVER MESA at the quarter pole, came into the lane from path three and rallied belatedly. LEA'S DREAMER
displayed early speed from outside but began to yield from between rivals midway on the second bend. LITTLE ACCOUNT steadily faded from inside. The
rider of WHITE CASHEL lodged an objection alleging interference from MISS KITTY PIE at the quarter pole. After their review, the stewards did not uphold
that claim of foul.

G MONEY LIV soon had the lead, showed the way off the rail, moved clear when allowed on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, was put to urging
upper stretch and maintained full control while kept to task. MOUDARI pressed G MONEY LIV from just outside, did not keep up on the turn, was no match
for that one when set down for the drive but proved clearly second best. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC was a step slow at the break, chased from just off or along
the rail, fanned out to path three for the stretch run and finished evenly. AMARI S. broke on top but was soon chasing the top pair from outside, swung
widest into the lane and had little to offer.

CARTE BLANCHE sprinted away from the rest on the first bend, showed the way in hand from inside, floated out some entering the lane, was put to urging
approaching the last furlong, began to wear down deep stretch, was all out in the waning yards and kept SOME DUDE at bay. SOME DUDE rated from
outside, commenced his bid three wide on the second turn, took over second upper stretch, closed well, came up a bit short but was easily best of the
others. RULE FOLLOWER reluctant to load, dwelt at the break, advanced from outside to reach contention two wide on the second bend but could not
sustain his bid through the stretch. READY REDDING raced closest to CARTE BLANCHE while along the rail to the second turn then began to yield. ROAR
OF THE LION showed little. There was a stewards' inquiry into RULE FOLLOWER'S start but no action was taken after their review.

DOROTA broke on top, showed the way in hand just inside MINI DRESS but off the rail, was challenged by the latter on the turn, roused leaving the bend,
lengthened command under urging upper stretch and held off JULIAISON under steady handling. JULIAISON brushed with MINI DRESS at the start, was
encouraged to find a better stride after that, chased from outside, picked up her pace after two furlongs, moved to the inside midway on the turn, gained
second inside the last eighth, closed the gap on the leader, was too late but pulled away for the place. MINI DRESS brushed with JULIAISON at the break,
prompted the pace outside DOROTA, came to that one midway on the turn but began to yield with two furlongs to go.

HIGH LIFE AGAIN was caught in tight quarters shortly after the break, jostled briefly with TOWN CRIER, was steadied and settled, progressed two wide on
the bend, altered to the inside for a clear path after taking over second upper stretch, caught the latter just inside the sixteenth marker and began to draw off
in the waning yards. TOWN CRIER caught in tight quarters after the break, jostled briefly with HIGH LIFE AGAIN leaving the chute, recovered well to
prompt the pace from between horses, was bumped solidly and forced into CONGRATS ZAPPA after passing the half mile pole, took the lead two wide on
the turn, moved clear upper stretch but did not have enough left the final sixteenth. CONGRATS ZAPPA forwardly placed from outside, was bumped solidly
after two furlongs, three wide taking the turn, had every chance in the stretch, ran evenly but was easily best of the rest. CONCOCTION was bumped at the
start, forced into UNCLE O. G. then shuffled back, chased from inside, swung out for the stretch run and failed to have a late bid. UNCLE O. G. was
bumped from the rear and forced out some at the break then bumped by NOBEL leaving the chute, recovered to set a pressured pace between horses,
gained the rail into the bend, did not stay with TOWN CRIER approaching the quarter pole and gave way for the drive. NOBEL broke outward, bumping
CONCOCTION then UNCLE O. G. was prominent from inside, began to drift out after two furlongs, bumped solidly with TOWN CRIER, quickly dropped
back, was allowed to angle out on the turn, bore out leaving the bend and entering the lane then gradually drifted out as he coasted the rest of the way.

Footnotes
CO CONSPIRATOR stalked the early leader from just outside, took over when allowed two wide on the second bend, was roused leaving that turn and
gradually opened up on the rest while kept to urging to the finish. ZARMAE was sent to stay close from inside, angled outside CO CONSPIRATOR on the
second turn, took over second entering the lane, was no match for the latter but proved easily second best. CRAPS SHOOTER broke alertly, was quickly
clear, pressured from outside on the backstretch, did not stay with CO CONSPIRATOR on the second turn, came off the rail some for the stretch run,
steadily faded from the top pair but was unchallenged for third. FLASHY RICHIE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. MARESONOFAGUN in contention
early, moved to the outside on the backstretch and began to yield with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
CRANKSHAFT soon had the lead, showed the way inside rivals while in hand, was let out on the turn, drew off under a drive in the stretch, was kept to task
to the wire and held sway. BLAZEN ROAD bumped with STORMIN EL PRADO at the break, was prominent between horses, three then four wide through
the bend, rallied deep stretch, edged ahead for second with a sixteenth left and was closing the gap on the leader in the waning yards. BABA'S BOY raced
in contention just off the inside on the backstretch, gained the rail into the turn, his rider lost his whip midway on the bend, fanned out behind SNOOZER
entering the lane, rallied between horses under hand urging the last furlong, fought for second in the late going but did not have enough in the waning yards.
MON AMI FUZZIE without early speed, was two wide on the turn, swung out behind BLAZEN ROAD into the lane, altered out widest upper stretch, showed
a willingness to run the last eighth and passed tired ones. SNOOZER advanced from outside, was four wide into the turn, angled in beside MAJESTIC
ATTACK approaching the end of four furlongs, moved clear for second upper stretch, drifted out briefly with a furlong to go then flattened out between
horses soon after. MAJESTIC ATTACK pressed CRANKSHAFT from just outside but gave way the last two furlongs. MAC PANDOWDY chased from inside
and was never a factor. STORMIN EL PRADO bumped with BLAZEN ROAD at the start, raced in contention from outside but began to yield from path four
on the bend.
