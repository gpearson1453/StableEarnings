Footnotes
PRAYER OF JABEZ broke out and bumped rival then steadied at the start, chased off the rail and tugged along in a tight spot early, waited for room on the
turn then swung out with a quarter mile left to run, drew alongside the top trio at the top of the lane, quickly cleared and drew away under urging. I KNOW
CASH FLOW broke through the gate and was reloaded, broke out and made contact with rival at the start, chased three wide into the turn, angled down to
the two path then steered back out and came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly in the drive but had to settle for second best.
TWOKIDSFROMDABRONX took a bump from inside at the start, chased widest early on, bid four the three wide around the turn, failed to kick on with the
winner in upper stretch and flattened to third. PURE SPEIGHT broke well then raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, applied pressure under
urging around the bend, vied between into the lane and weakened. MAJESTIC WIND drifted in a bit early then sent clear along the inside, held a short lead
through the turn and into the stretch, gave up command shortly after and weakened. COME ON COME ON broke slow and got bumped, trailed early on,
traveled along the inside into the turn, steered out and came six wide into the stretch and was not a factor. FINGLAS LAD tracked between rivals then went
three wide into the turn, lost ground and came five wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
SALLY'S SASSY broke well from outside, tracked the speed outside a rival, angled to the two path for the turn, steered out and took aim at the top pair,
rallied under left then a right handed stick and got up in time. MI MIMITA attended the pace three deep, bid three then two wide around the turn, dueled
down the lane and carried a narrow advantage into the final sixteenth but got nailed by the winner. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT set the pace under pressure,
cleared briefly at the seven-sixteenths pole, met the challenge from MI MIMITA on the turn, dueled through the stretch and relinquished the lead in the
furlong grounds but fought gamely to the wire. BYE BYE BUGGSY settled just out of range, angled to the inside for the turn, lacked room behind a pair of
rivals at the quarter pole, tipped out into the stretch, put in a late run but was not enough. LOANA chased off the rail then got bothered by BYE BYE
BUGGSY early costing her some ground, went two wide into the turn, tipped out and traveled four deep at the three-sixteenths pole, kept on through the
lane but could not get up for a minor award. THE DANCE BETWEEN came away slow, got forced out by META GIRL on the backstretch, traveled two wide
then three wide and entered the lane between rivals but failed to threaten. BIZZY GAL broke a step slow, sat off the pace, traveled along the rail then tipped
out around a weakening rival near the three-sixteenths pole and failed to make an impact. META GIRL broke slow then stumbled inward and had to alter out
to avoid the rail, drifted out and bothered rival early, went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. HOT THOUGHTS was off a bit slow but
recovered quickly, got forced in early, went up to press between rivals, chased the leader into the turn, dropped back on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
COWBOY CHARLIE sped to the front, got pressured leaving the backstretch, moved clear nearing the quarter pole, kept to task under a drive and remained
clear to the wire. BOCHOMBO forwardly placed early on, went three deep into the turn, remained three wide into the lane and held the place. RESPECT
THE CODE tossed his head and came away slow, stalked along the inside through the turn, chased within range in the final furlong but could not find more
late. IKIGAI was off a bit slow to begin, pulled up the backstretch, was along three path to the stretch and lacked a bid. BEEF WINSLOW coaxed early and
raced off the pace, went four deep into the turn, three wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane but lacked further response. DETROIT CITY pressed the
winner from outside leaving the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane and flattened out. COBRA JET came out leaving the gate, chased four wide
around the turn and weakened. HIJO GALANTE broke a step slow, chased between foes, two wide into the stretch and could not rally.

SUPER RENEE dueled for command three deep early on then outside YADIAMA on the turn, inched ahead past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared at the top
of the stretch and held off SIDE BY SIDE to the wire. SIDE BY SIDE stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and went up to press between the top pair,
chased those rivals into the turn, tipped three wide late on the bend, took aim at the winner from outside but lacked the needed late punch. ROSY EDGE
was off a bit slow to begin, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and bested the rest. YADIAMA dueled for command
from inside, fought with the winner through the turn, then weakened in the stretch run. ASCENDANCY climbed a bit briefly then chased four then five wide
around the turn and improved position. DELIA MO in range from off the rail early on, took the turn four then three wide and lacked a rally. NEAREST N
DEAREST was off slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch, raced two wide into the turn, continued a bit off the rail into the stretch and was not a factor.
KITTEN CALLS sat off the pace, navigated the turn five then four wide and weakened. LILAC STARLIGHT broke out and bumped rival at the start, was a bit
rank behind a rival at the half-mile pole, paused when in a bit tight at the three-eighths pole and tired.

INCH tracked the pace off the rail, went three then four wide on the turn, took over in upper stretch, moved clear with a furlong left to run and held well in the
final sixteenth. DANIEL'S MAGIC settled off the pace outside rival, came four wide into the stretch, tipped out further and put in mild late bid. STOTLAND
showed early speed between rivals then got crowded at the half-mile pole, chased between rivals and waited for room around the bend, tipped out in the
drive and got edged for second. MY HARBORS DREAM broke a step slow and bumped with inner rival then got crowded shortly after, pulled the rider along
on the backstretch, took the turn two then three wide and kept on to round out the superfecta. FINALLY HERE showed early speed then got shuffled back
nearing the turn, chased near the inside into the stretch, moved out and lacked a rally. EDINBURGH EXPRESS broke out, forwardly placed from outside up
the backstretch, vied three deep around the bend, led into the drive, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. IT'S MY HOUSE brushed leaving the
gate, went up to set a pressure pace, vied with a pair of rivals on the inside through the turn, then weakened down the lane. FORT BRIDGER broke a step
slow, got crowded on the inside and checked early, saved ground through the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to menace. MCWHERTER

Footnotes
TISQUANTUM brushed leaving the gate, went four wide into the first turn then moved down to the two path tracking the pace, angled to the rail late on the
far turn, steered out with a furlong left to run and overhauled the top pair in the final sixteenth. ONE TIME MARK away quickly and crossed over to the
inside, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, moved clear at the three-eighths pole, met the challenge from LIL BRO COOP into the stretch,
maintained a short lead into the final sixteenth but was overtaken by the winner late. LIL BRO COOP broke a step slow, stalked the pace on the inside, took
aim two wide late on the far turn, challenged ONE TIME MARK into the stretch, dueled while drifting in the lane and lacked the needed final kick.
KAZUHIKO (AUS) was off a bit slow from inside, raced near the back through the early stages, steered out and came six wide into the stretch and
summoned a mild late rally. MIGRATION was along three path in mid-pack early, angled five wide leaving the far turn and failed to produce a bid.
TUSKEGEE CAT stalked two wide early then between rivals, ridden along through the far turn, moved out in the lane and lacked the needed response.
BIRTH OF COOL settled off the pace in the two path, went three deep into the far turn, waited for room around the bend, angled out at the top of the stretch
but could not find more. CANDY FOR CARMEL settled on the inside, may have slipped or took an awkward step at the five-sixteenths pole, continued to
save ground to the stretch and failed to menace. IVORY SKY was off slow to begin, went two wide or outside a rival on the first turn at the back, moved out
into the backstretch, raced wide through the far turn and came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. PITTSBURGH brushed leaving the gate,
forwardly placed three wide around the first turn, stalked outside rivals to the second bend, entered the drive four wide and weakened. RAKU FIRING
showed early speed while pulling and rank early, pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch, could not go on with the leader with three furlong
remaining, lost positions through the far turn and chased three wide into the lane and faded in the lane.
