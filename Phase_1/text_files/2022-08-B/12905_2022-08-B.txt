the best of the rest. MOOR STRENGTH brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, dueled on the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and was outkicked in the lane while finishing evenly. M'LADY THATCHER dueled for the lead between horses through the opening quarter of a

GOLDBUSTER pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, kicked clear in the stretch and held off a late
closer at the wire. HERE'S LIAM raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, and
gained ground steadily down the lane. RIVZONAROLL bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled
while saving ground around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. TAP THAT DIAL raced off the pace in the early going, navigated the turn from the three
path and made no bid. FOREVER SAUCY hopped up leaving the gate, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and tired on the rail in the stretch. BULLOUT trailed far behind the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

TEA IN CHINA pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch
and held that margin to the wire. AWESOME LAWSON bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to track the leader between horses
in the early going, saved ground around the turn and chased the winner home. MRS SHAW raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated
the turn from the four path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late. SOME NIGHTS raced at the back of the pack on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three and four path and gained ground in late stretch. MYRRH led the field up the
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. FASHION ICON bumped with the horse to her outside at the
break, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly. V K PRINCESS raced
at the back of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tiring horses in
the lane. BROADWAY PEGGY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch.
A WISH FOR TRISH brushed with the horse to her outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and never threatened. YIRA brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the rail early, saved ground around the turn
and was empty from there. C'EST PARTI trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and made no bid. SALTY SAUL
bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, gave
way approaching the quarter pole and tired further in the stretch. HIGH ARABIAN hit the gate leaving it, raced in the middle of the pack between horses
early, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
YLIKEDIS stalked from inside, waited for room while saving ground rounding the far turn, and rallied through an opening on the rail to get up in the final
furlong. TIGHTLY TWISTED led from inside, was ridden from the three path into the lane, kept on for place. FACTOR IN chased from the four path, bid from
four wide into the stretch, but hung late to show. POR QUE NO tracked in the three path, tried shifting to the four path in upper stretch, but flattened. FATE
FACTOR was wellback in the three path and never a factor. JUXTAPOSE was unhurried from inside but was never a threat. PYTHONESS had a hesitant
start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
POWER THROUGH pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path coming
around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. TIJUANA BRASS saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on
the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained ground late. TITRATE raced in the three and four path around the first
turn, stalked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole and kept on in the
stretch. FELIX THE FOX saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail
nearing the quarter pole and gained ground mildly in the final furlong. BATTLE OF MEMPHIS (IRE) stumbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn still in the two path and finished evenly.
FREELANCE raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile, continued around the second bend in the four path, swung wider still into
the stretch and flattened out from there. CHAOTIC TEMPO led the way on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving
ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. STRINGFELLA raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leaders between horses up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and tired in the lane. FEISTY KITTEN raced off the pace in the early going, came around the far turn
in the two path and was empty in the stretch. NOICATTARO saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the two path and was not a factor. CASK raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of pack on the
outside, angled in to save ground around the second bend and made no bid. GLORIOUS WEEKEND raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through
the opening half mile, improved position while racing in the three path around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
VALIANT VINNY stalked in the two path, bid three wide at the top of the lane, and stayed on gamely. BACKWOODS BOOGIE bumped an outer foe, rated
while saving ground into the lane, and rallied to place. BARDOLINO led from the two path, was coaxed from the three path into the stretch, and kept on to
hold show. RIP THORN bumped an inner foe, was wellback in the three path, was driven from the five path into the lane, and ran on. W W SPRINGTIME
chased in the five path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but finished evenly. LADY NOY was unhurried from the six path, was coaxed from
seven path into the lane, but was one paced. BATTLEBUS trailed from the two path into the stretch and was never a threat. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE tracked
in the four path, swung five wide into the lane, but weakened. PARISHIONER prompted the pace from the three path but backed out around the far turn,
was eased, and vanned off.
