the pace ceding to rival on the far turn chasing while fatigued the final eighth a clear second best. SHOW ME THE BEST stalked the pace gaining on the
backside, would waver on the far turn dropping off in upper stretch holding off the others with little left. LUCKY CARLENE raced evenly throughout playing
no factor. KEEN MACHINE dropped far back early staying there through the far turn. SMOOTH RITHMS folded up on the far turn.

saved ground to upper stretch vying willingly near the rail the final eighth. KETO FRIENDLY broke sharply to clear the field, threatened near the quarter pole
would duel inside of foe then between horses late weakening in the closing yards. HEAVENLY SMILE was always outrun. LIPA broke late then took a bad
