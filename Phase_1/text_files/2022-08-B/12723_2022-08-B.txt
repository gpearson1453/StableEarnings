TAKES A VILLAGE was fanned five wide to the backstretch, pushed to the front, set the pace to the stretch then drew clear under steady urging. HYPHY
was forded out to the six path on the first turn, chased to the second turn, got outkicked to the stretch but bested the other two. AT U LOVER hustled early
but lugged out to the four path on the first turn, pressed the pace inside then shifted out to the three path to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.
RACHEL'S LADY had no speed and was not a factor.

SHANGHAI WILD CAT was well placed off the leader, pushed to the front nearing the second turn then drew away and held driving. HELICOPTER PILOT
had no speed, was two wide then closed willingly in the stretch to grab second. BARNABY BONES set the pace, was collared into the second turn then tired
and lost the place on the wire. PLAYER OPTION was five wide to the backstretch, chased to the second turn then lacked a closing bid. DON'T GET ME
WRONG was very green, dropped far back then was eased in the final quarter and walked off.

Footnotes
TADEO never far back, rallied three wide on the second turn, pushed to the front and drew clear. SPEEDY TOM stalked the leaders early, came two wide to
the stretch but was outkicked for the win while saving second. DEBT MONGER had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but could not make an impact
in the drive. CADILLAC CHROME hustled to contest the pace, inched away down the backstretch but was collared on the second turn and weakened.
CAPES HOT ROCKET attended the pace early, was outkicked on the second turn and tired in the drive. VERMEER reared in the gate at the start then
reared again one jump out and lost any chance.

Footnotes
PERSEVERANCE had no speed, was asked for more nearing the far turn, pushed to the front in upper stretch and drove clear. BOY HOWDY was
outsprinted for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn then was not a threat to the winner while besting the others. TIZ INDY hustled to the front, set
the pace for five furlongs while two wide but tired in the drive. HAWK'S RISING had no speed, was two wide and never a factor. GOING AWAY PARTY also
had no speed, offered a bid two wide nearing the far turn but weakened in the drive. UNPOSSIBLE steadied into the first turn, chased to the far turn while
two wide then gave way. HARDY CHISEL had his saddle slip coming through the stretch the first turn and was pulled up by the rider then walked off. The
jockey on UNPOSSIBLE lodged an objection against the rider on BOY HOWDY for alleged interference into the first turn but the claim was not allowed by
the stewards.
