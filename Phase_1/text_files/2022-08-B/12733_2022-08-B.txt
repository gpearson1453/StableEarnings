PLEASANT PASSAGE broke in a step at the start placing HAY STACK in tight between herself and POSITIVE MESSAGE, tracked the pace along the
inside from mid pack patiently handled until placed to coaxing just outside the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the inside to
issue a challenge through the final furlong dueling with LETTER OF GOLD to the finish and gamely got up in the final jumps to score. LETTER OF GOLD
saved ground at the tail of the field coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to into contention a
furlong out seizing narrow command inside that station, dueled through to the finish with the aforementioned foe in game fashion but was ultimately bested
at the end. HOLA GATA broke outwards hitting the off side stall at the start, settled tracked the front just off the inside from just off the pace, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, shied out under a left handed stick near the three-sixteenths forcing HAY STACK to bump
with COOKIE CRUMBS to her outside, then ran on to the finish to secure the show honors. TREASURED GEM coaxed from the start, tracked the pace
along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the wire but was
outfinished in the late stages. HAY STACK a bit tight between foes at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung
four to five wide into upper stretch attempting to lean on and nudge out COOKIE CRUMBS to his outside and was denied the move straightened away, had
HOLA GATA come out in front and bumped with COOKIE CRUMBS at the three-sixteenths and again near the eighth pole before lugging in behind rivals
inside that station and kept on to the finish. COOKIE CRUMBS settled just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear of the field, tipped three wide placed to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and was leaned on by HAY STACK straightened away into upper stretch and nudged and
denied the move holding her rightful lane, got bumped at the three-sixteenths by HAY STACK and once more a furlong out, then made no late headway
while keeping on one paced to the finish. CORNINGSTONE just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch rallying to take brief command a furlong from home, then weakened in the late stages. POSITIVE MESSAGE (GB) broke out
brushing the off side stall at the start before placing HAY STACK in tight in tandem with PLEASANT PASSAGE, showed the way rated along the inside,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a host of rivals and was collared at the eighth
pole, then weakened to the finish.

PHANTOM SMOKE broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded, came away fast from the outside post,
angled in front of the field to the two path early then intimidated DEEP COVER from going through to contest the lead despite some room along the rail,
showed the way in about the two path through the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, intimidated DEEP COVER from coming through
along the rail again in upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead near the furlong marker, went back to the proper lead at the sixteenth-pole and held
under strong handling. DEEP COVER was away well then hustled, opted against going through along the rail to contest the pace when PHANTOM SMOKE
angled down from the outside to the two path early, was placed under tight restraint having ceded the front to the aforementioned foe, raced just off the pace
under a tight hold, drafted inside while full of run around the turn, was asked after cutting the corner tight against the rail into the stretch, had room but opted
again to not go through on the inside of PHANTOM SMOKE inside the three-sixteenths and steadied, altered course to the outside coming to the furlong
marker, chased into the final sixteenth, gained on the winner late and just missed. YARROW broke through the front the gate after his neighbor to the
outside did the same, was brought back around and reloaded, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn then driven four wide into the
stretch, chased between foes into the final furlong and was out-kicked while just able to get the show. BREW PUB was slowest into stride then urged early
before settling on the far outside, came under urging in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong
and was also out-kicked then just missed the show. DR. DUKE tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the turn, made a bid
at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. LADY'S GOLDEN GUY broke a step slow then was hustled before being taken up off
heels early, raced near the back under urging, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. BUSTIN SHOUT broke in at the start, was urged early then
settled on the inside, steadied leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ARTHURIAN broke in and bumped with a foe, went to the front, showed the way with company well to his outside, vied in the two path around the turn, spun
three wide into the stretch then shook clear, drifted in under a right-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, was given one final pop of the crop outside
the sixteenth-pole then placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. ICON hit the outside of the gate then bumped hard with a foe and was
slow into stride, settled on the outside, lugged out while ranging up four then five wide around the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the
winner while continuing under extra left-rein pressure into the stretch and weakened while able to hold the place. MATTY'S MARAUDER angled in while
urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths behind a wall of horses, was roused outside the quarter-pole,
swung six wide into the stretch, moved in near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. EL SEGUNDO was bumped
at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, brushed with a foe outside the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path, was driven four
wide into the stretch and tired. VINCENT chased the pace down the backstretch, brushed with a foe into the turn, saved ground around that bend and tired.
SCOTTO broke in then was corrected by the rider while slow into stride, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path and was no factor. CAJUN COMMANDER broke a half-step slow then was corrected with a tug of the left-rein, settled off the pace,
raced between foes in the the three path early on the turn, moved to the four path while roused before the five-sixteenths then the five path outside the
quarter-pole, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. NATURE BOY bumped soundly with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside,
dropped back three then four wide around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
TIBERIUS MERCURIUS lightly coaxed from the gate, settled under rating in closest aim of the leader in the two path, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied knocking heads with GRAND JOURNEY and trading a bump straightened away, took brief and
narrow command a furlong out trading a bump once more, then got headed near the sixteenth marker when trading a third bump near that station and dug
in gamely to take back the front in the final strides and prevail. GRAND JOURNEY lightly coaxed from the start, showed the way rated along the inside,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home confronted in head to head combat by the aforementioned foe and traded a bump
straightened away, dug in under assault and was headed when trading a second bump a furlong out, dug in taking back narrow and brief command when
trading a third bump just outside the sixteenth pole, battled on gamely but was ultimately bested in the final jumps to the finish. ATTENTIVE bumped at the
start by REUX, who broke outwards, chased three then two wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, offered up a good finish closing with a rush late but ultimately missed at the end. THE LAST ZIP three then two wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three to four wide into upper stretch, then offered up a mild kick. DEVAMANI (FR) settled just off the inside in
pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the wire.
MONARCHS GLEN (GB) three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was
outkicked. HEALING just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing along the inside three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and offered no response. REUX (GB) broke out at the start bumping ATTENTIVE, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. BATTALION coaxed from the start, raced three wide through the first turn and then four paths off the
inside in the clear down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch
and tired.

GRAND LOVE came away well and went straight to the front, controlled the action while inside through the turn, responded well when asked coming to the
quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, extended the advantage into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead
outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best. RARIFY bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled,
chased the winner on the outside then in the three path around the turn, pursued that foe while shortening stride still on her inside lead in the stretch and
weakened but was clear for the place. PEAK POPULARITY came outward at the start then was corrected by the rider, was urged along on the outside,
moved in outside the half-mile pole, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and improved to get the show. SPELTERINI broke in
and brushed with a foe, was coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the four path around the turn and tired then lost the show.
SPUN SPECIAL bumped with a rival at the start while also brushing with another foe, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn and came
up empty. ROSIE'S ALIBI was hustled from the start then ridden along on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, moved in some at the
seven-sixteenths, raced two to three wide around the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MRS. MACOMBER dropped well behind
under urging, saved ground around the turn and was no factor.

REPEALING went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, moved to a solo lead in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage outside
the quarter-pole, responded well when asked into the stretch, stayed on her inside lead until inside the three-sixteenths then swapped to the proper lead,
remained clear under a strong-hand ride into the final sixteenth then was placed under a lighter hand-ride late while just able to hold sway. TO A T moved
around in the stall just as the gate opened and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, angled in at the rear then was urged along at the back, saved
ground for most of the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, rallied into the final furlong and closed strongly but was too late while well clear
for the place. FIRING CAROL broke a step slow, moved in while urged along off the pace, went two then three wide around the turn, was driven five wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. BABA was hustled from the gate then urged along on the far outside, went six wide
on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and came up empty. RUVIES IN TIME settled off the early pace then came under urging, saved ground through
the turn and failed to respond. AWESOME INDRA pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, dropped back into the stretch
and capitulated. EXXALTRESS was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back into the turn, went around that bend in the
five path and had nothing left. CHLOE ROSE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path, dropped
back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
LOVE REIGNS (IRE) broke in at the start and was corrected, raced briefly inside before tipping out to the two path as the leader took to the inside, remained
patiently handled in closest aim of that rival until let out spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command with three-sixteenths to go
and edged clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages. DANSE MACABRE broke in at the start bumping REDIFINED before forcing AZTEC
NIGHTS to steady off her heels due to pressure from SWEET HARMONY tucking in front, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. REDIFINED got
bumped at the start by DANSE MACABRE, then got bumped by AZTEC NIGHTS, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. NO KAY NEVER
(IRE) chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home and stayed on one paced through to the finish. SWEET HARMONY established the front crossing to the inside to show the way in hand through swift
splits, got let out under threat just off the inside into upper stretch and straightened away to the rail, got collared with three-sixteenths to run and weakened
to the finish. AZTEC NIGHTS broke out at the start bumping REDIFINED, then got forced to steady off the heels of DANSE MACABRE due to pressure
outside from SWEET HARMONY tucking in, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and had
no rally. KERRY chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response.
SICILIAN GRANDMA chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, tipped three wide into upper stretch, and was outrun. MOTOWN
MISCHIEF three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
BAYOU WIND brushed the gate at the start then was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside with company to her outside, was asked on the far
turn, wobbled off the hedge at the elbow of that bend, extended the advantage into upper stretch then responded well when put to the crop around the
three-sixteenths, remained clear into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging. BELLESHAZZA settled on the inside, moved off the rail while roused
on the far turn, chased the winner into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead while gaining at the sixteenth-pole and missed while up for the
place. VAGARIES (IRE) raced in the three path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into
upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the show. MISCREANT broke near the back of the field then was taken in hand early, rounded the first
turn in the two path, was reserved at the back, came under urging while moving from the rail to the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch then moved further out and improved position with good energy for the last spot in the superfecta. GEOMETRIQUE saved ground on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and also improved position. HOPE OVER FEAR
showed speed between foes into the first turn, traveled around that bend in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three
path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. CANDLESTICK MAKER went three wide around the opening bend, settled on the
outside towards the back, was roused four wide on the far turn, bumped with IRONIC LADY while steadying at the top of the stretch and failed to respond.
IRONIC LADY navigated the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, bumped
with CANDLESTICK MAKER at the top of the stretch then steadied and was no factor. LORDHEARMYPRAYER went four wide on the first turn, settled near
the rear on the outside, moved in around the nine-sixteenths, was roused three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. RICELLE showed speed on the
outside of three foes, went four wide around the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, dropped back under urging around the seven-sixteenths,
went three then four wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. EMPRESS THEODORA showed speed between foes down the
initial straightaway, was eased back nearing the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground while
roused on the far turn and faltered.
