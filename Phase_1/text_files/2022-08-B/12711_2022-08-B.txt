Footnotes
SEBARAY tracked the front just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong seizing command seventy yards from home, dug in to prevail by a neck on the wire. FLOKI'S
FLIGHT broke out at the start bumping MYPLAYALINDA while under coaxing, got placed to a rating hold three then two wide through the first turn and
settled in closest aim of the leader while just off the inside, advanced on that rival patiently handled through the far turn and swung three then two wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take brief command inside the eighth pole, got collared seventy yards from home and was bested at the end. STREET VENDOR two
to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing tipped three to four wide at the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to secure the show honors. FAZARO coaxed from the start, showed the way rated along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared just inside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the last major share.
BILLY PRICE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five then four wide into upper stretch and
stayed on one paced to the finish. MYPLAYALINDA got bumped at the start by FLOKI'S FLIGHT, saved ground at the tail of the field, got set down spinning
along the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN four then three wide through the first turn, chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SPOOKY ROAD traveled around the first turn in the two path, was taken back between horses late on that bend, settled into a comfortable stride down the
backstretch, drafted inside to the two path while in dead-aim of the leader around the far turn, shifted four wide while asked at the quarter-pole, rallied to the
lead in upper stretch, kicked clear into the final furlong and widened under a solid-hand ride to win ridden out. HOLIDAY JAZZ was hustled from the gate,
established the front before leaving the first turn, showed the way on the inside while getting company to the outside, was asked under threat at the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner while put to a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the place. GAGLIANO dropped
to the rear in the two path on the first turn, lugged out entering the backstretch, settled at the rear under some urging, started the far turn in the two path,
lugged out four then five wide later on that bend, floated seven wide into the stretch then drifted further out under a right-handed crop, pursued the winner
near middle of the track into the final furlong and weakened but was best of the rest. STARSHIP PRECIOUS went three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was given her cue leaving the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. U CANT HANDLE THIS was
sent hard from the gate, went four then three wide around the opening bend, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was
asked near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch then dropped back under a drive and capitulated.

Footnotes
ROAD TO REMEMBER broke out and bumped hard with a rival, was taken in hand early then moved out while settling off the pace, brushed with a foe in
the two path leaving the backstretch, shifted four wide while ranging closer near the five-sixteenths, was roused at the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead while
brushing with the pacesetter in upper stretch, shook clear just inside the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. SHINFULL came inward just
after the start, was well placed while settling in third position, moved closer along the rail on the turn, was asked once straightened for the drive, made a bid
along the rail while inside of two foes in upper stretch, lost touch with the winner inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the place.
ROYAL CURRENCY brushed the inside of the gate at the start then bumped with a foe and checked off heels, settled at the rear, went around most of the
turn in the two path then shifted three wide, swung five wide into the stretch, reached a reasonable striking position under a drive into the final furlong but
lacked the needed response while just up for the show. MY CARA MIA MINE was bumped hard on both sides at the start, raced outside under urging,
brushed with a rival leaving the backstretch, went three wide early on the turn then moved to five wide, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just
missed the show. BUNTY WINDERMERE easily went to the front, showed the way with an uncontested advantage, controlled the action while inside to the
two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. POMME SAUVAGE stalked the pace on
the outside then in the two to three path around the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
RARIFIED FLAIR broke out a step at the start brushing ACTIVIST INVESTING, raced forwardly placed vying for command past the stands the initial time
between foes from the two path before easing off as WIDERIGHT seemed intent to go on with it from the outside, tracked that rival in closest aim from the
two path before advancing to latch on with seven-sixteenths to go, steadily whittled away at the leader to get on near even terms when placed to coaxing
near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head tussling briefly before taking command just outside the eighth pole,
dug in under threat from a trio to the outside and gamely held on to prevail. CONVERSING saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive in behind the aforementioned foe and tipped out a path nudging COACH
PETRO into ACTIVIST INVESTING a furlong from home, had those rivals come in slightly near the sixteenth marker and was hemmed back in behind
RARIFIED FLAIR requiring him to tip out once more to regain his lane and again brushed and bumped with those outer two rivals before being bounced
loosely between foes at the finish and missed at the end while up for the place honors. COACH PETRO vied inside a pair briefly after the start, then got
wrangled back along the rail six and a half furlongs from home into the first turn, settled tracking the leader from a loose pocket patiently handled until
placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied getting bumped by CONVERSING a furlong out and in turn brushed
ACTIVIST INVESTING at that station, had that outer rival come inwards and crowded CONVERSING nudging him back behind the leader, had
CONVERSING tip out once more a sixteenth from home and traded a bump once more then bounced that rival around in tandem with RARIFIED FLAIR at
the finish and missed at the end while sharing in the show honors on the line. ACTIVIST INVESTING (GB) got brushed at the start by RARIFIED FLAIR,
who broke out a step, tracked the front just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung six wide into
upper stretch, rallied to be the outermost of a trio stacked across the track in behind the leader and was brushed by the aforementioned foe a furlong out
due to pressure inside from CONVERSING, came inwards inside that station and had those rivals come back out once more and was lightly bumped a
sixteenth from home, battled on to the finish missing at the end while sharing in the show honors on the wire. WIDERIGHT vied outside a pair early on going
three then two wide through the first turn and seizing sole command, showed the way in hand along the inside and steadily came under increased pressure
from the eventual winner to the outside responding by coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for
the drive, dug in under threat and yielded a furlong from home, then weakened in the late stages. TAKING CANDY just off the inside in pursuit early on,
tipped three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
J'ADORO two to three wide in pursuit, got let out angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. PHILHARMONIC chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths and trailed throughout.

BEST IDEA went three wide under coaxing around the first turn, settled well off the pace, was ridden along passing the half-mile pole, went five wide under
strong encouragement around the final turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed well down the center of the track in
the final furlong and got up in the final strides to prevail. DR. BLUTE went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, had WIN FOR
GOLD move up to challenge him at the five-eighths when let off the fence by the rider of FORTY COMETS, vied inside that foe in the two path to the
five-sixteenths, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, extended the advantage while set down into upper stretch, remained clear under the crop into the final
sixteenth but was denied in the final strides while well clear for the place. WHITTINGTON PARK went three then four wide around the first turn, settled on
the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, brushed with a foe inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response
while best of the rest. DANGEROUS EDGE went four then three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked leaving the backstretch, rounded the
far turn in the two path under urging, drifted out in upper stretch, brushed with an opponent inside the furlong marker and weakened. BLITZ TO WIN was
reserved under restraint on the inside, came under urging around the seven-sixteenths, saved ground into the stretch and had nothing left. FOREVER
WICKED dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turns and was no factor. FORTY COMETS raced in the three path around the first
turn, had the rider taken several looks to his inside while remaining well off the rail and providing relief to a rank WIN FOR GOLD who was stuck behind the
pacesetter down the backstretch, allowed that foe easily off the rail at the five-eighths, came up empty in the three then four path on the far turn and
retreated. RHYMES LIKE DIMES went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged five then six wide on the far turn and failed to respond.
WIN FOR GOLD was hustled from the gate then taken in hand while skimming the rail early, became very rank and raced under steadying restraint behind
the leader through the first turn, continued rank behind the leader under stout restraint through the opening three furlongs, moved out while given free
passage off the inside at the five-eighths, gained to make an outside bid at the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path while outside of the runner-up around
the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and faltered.

Footnotes
ECHO AGAIN coaxed from the gate directly to the front, showed the way in hand two to three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through
the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch coming under a light drive straightened away, drew off under that light drive and was geared down inside
the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably at the finish. SUMMONYOURCOURAGE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while along just as clear of the rest to be along second best. EXPECTED VALUE
broke out at the start brushing GOOD NEWS ROCKET, chased two to three wide, bumped GAME CHANGE near the half mile pole and tucked to the two
path into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch and improved position to secure
the show honors while never threatening the top pair. BAT FLIP four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four
wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. CLASSIC LEGACY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to
five wide into upper stretch and tired. GAME CHANGE chased three wide, got bumped by EXPECTED VALUE near the half mile pole, went three then two
wide climbing a bit greenly and dropping back through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. GOOD NEWS ROCKET
brushed at the start by EXPECTED VALUE, who broke outwards, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out and tired.

Footnotes
HAUGHTY came away in good order then strolled to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace
off the rail, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked coming to the quarter-pole, came under a
right-handed crop in upper stretch and held under strong urging. WITH THE MOONLIGHT (IRE) bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, spotted the
front a couple lengths, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, moved closer in the three path on the far turn, was roused at the
five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch under the crop, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in while gaining outside the sixteenth-pole
and finished with good courage but was too late while able to secure the place. DOLCE ZEL (FR) drifted in after the start then was taken in hand, saved
ground around the first turn, settled into a comfortable stride down the backstretch, moved closer while inside on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch,
was asked just behind the leader at the three-sixteenths, tipped off the inside into the final furlong, flopped leads back and forth at that point, chased into the
final sixteenth and was out-kicked while clear for the show. CONSUMER SPENDING broke in at the start, went two then three wide on the first turn, settled
outside down the backstretch, was asked with three furlongs to run, chased three wide around the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, raced
between foes into the final furlong and came up empty. EMINENT VICTOR brushed with a foe at the start then was squeezed back in tight quarters, spotted
the front a few lengths, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths,
came three wide into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed
response. SAIL BY broke awkwardly then made contact with foes on both sides and was crowded, spotted the front a couple lengths, moved out early then
advanced on the outside with seven furlongs to run, rounded the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was given her cue with
three furlongs to run, chased in the two path around the far turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
CARAVEL three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued three wide into upper stretch rallying to collar the leader just
inside the three-sixteenths marker, dug in under a drive under threat from a flanking host of rivals and gamely held safe to prevail. CHANGE OF CONTROL
chased along the inside getting forced to briefly steady at the seven-sixteenths when ILLEGAL SMILE seemed to want the rail directly in front and then ruled
against it, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch in behind FOUETTE, tipped to the two path at the
three-sixteenths under urging before tipping three wide at the eighth pole, had the weakening ROBIN SPARKLES drift out in front and altered to the four
path inside that station, then nudged MISS J MCKAY between foes and placed that rival in tight against LADY EDITH inside the final sixteenth and just got
up for the place honors having threaded her way somewhat successfully through traffic. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied into contention a furlong out and fought on under a drive to the finish
getting caught late for the place honors while preserving the show over a pair. MISS J MCKAY just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong and was placed in tight between rivals in the late
stages when CHANGE OF CONTROL tipped outwards and LADY EDITH came in slightly and was up for the last major share by a sliver. LADY EDITH two
to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was out-finished in the late
going. FOUETTE chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong
out, then flattened out in the late stages. TOO SEXY saved ground at the tail of the field, came under urging with five-sixteenths to run, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, made no impact. ROBIN SPARKLES hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared just inside the three-sixteenths and tired. SARAH HARPER
forwardly placed tracking the front just off the inside, got put to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired.
