Footnotes
MY INSTIGATOR pressed the pace from the three path then was taken back off the pace before the turn then made a rebid from three wide on the turn to
take the lead at the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch. O'LORDY LORD raced in the middle of the pace through the turn then moved out to four of five
wide in upper stretch and closed well but was not enough. ONE HOT REDHEAD sprinted to a clear lead through the turn then was caught at the quarter
pole and faded. SEGOVIANA saved ground off the pace down the backstretch then angled out to be three wide in upper stretch and flatered. KELLEY'S
MANDATE raced near the back made a rail bid on the turn, moved out to the three path in the stretch and passed tiring rivals. RIVER CHARMER was
unhurried down the backstretch made a mild bid on the turn then moved out to six wide in upper stretch and improved position. ATHENIAN PRINCESS was
forwardly placed on the inside and gave way. LANKY LOU was not a factor. TYLERS ANGEL WINGS was not a threat.

Footnotes
TUFF WILLY TE was placed off the pace on the inside through the turn then waited for opening in upper stretch and moved out to three wide to sail past the
leaders and held sway. TRICKY LEE was close up in the three path on the backstretch made a three wide bid on the turn and floated out to the four path in
upper stretch to make a rally but was too late. CHICORY BLUE tracked the leaders from the two path then moved to vie for the lead going into the turn, led
briefly at the top of the stretch but lacked the late response needed. RED WES went to the lead for the first half was engaged at the quarter pole and faded.
HUNTER QUICK was not a threat. IOWA NATIVE was distanced.
