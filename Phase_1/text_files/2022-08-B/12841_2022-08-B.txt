Footnotes
KAYLOR was forwardly placed heading into the first turn, dueled outside of ADDABABY entering the backstretch, shook clear nearing the half mile marker,
held clear around the far turn, hustled along two wide into the lane and finished clear. TAPIT'S LADY stalked the top pair up the backstretch, launched a
three wide bid midway around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane and secured place. STREAKIN' EASY rated off the early pace, edged closer two wide
late on the far turn, hustled along four wide into the lane and stayed on for a share. RUDY TOOTY was unhurried through early stages, coaxed four to five
wide into the lane and finished clear over the rest. ADDABABY dueled for the early lead with KALOR then chased after rival into the far turn, flattened near
the quarter pole and continued to tire in the drive. GIGAWATT trailed throughout.

HERZEN raced three wide in range up the backstretch and edged closer late on the far turn, given cue turning for home, challenged GHOST STRATEGY
for the lead, dueled into the final furlong then took charge and finished going away. GHOST STRATEGY set the pace up the backstretch and held firm
around the far turn, fought back when challenged by HERZEN at the head of the lane, was no match in late stages but ran on and held place. SMOKIN
BOOTS tracked the pace along the inside, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and just missed place. SCREENPLAY stalked the
pace tp the far turn, flattened a bit then came three wide into the lane and offered no late bid. MACHINEGUNPREACHER was unhurried, saved ground into
the lane and had no response. BRODY BOUCHER raced in the last flight two wide, hustled along four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.

HIS GIANT set a pressured pace in early stages, edged away late on the turn, repelled bids gamely through the lane and finished clear. JAZZY JUSTIN
raced near midpack into the turn, hustled along four wide into the lane, finished with good response and captured place. PULL MY CHAIN chased three
wide around the turn, swung four wide into the lane, sustained bid and prevailed for a share. MR. ANKENY prompted the pace into the turn, chased after the
leader into the lane and weakened late. FEARLESS WILL got bumped and steadied just after the start, raced off the early pace, chased three to four wide
into the lane and had a mild improve. MORO WOLF raced in range around the turn, briefly advanced along the rail in the upper stretch then flattened out.
OLD TRAFFORD lacked speed, came three wide into the lane and failed to respond. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
TYLER'S TRIBE broke sharp then briefly conceded position to DIXIEMAGIC in opening stages, quickly took back control over the lead without asking,
widened to a commanding margin still in hand around the turn, came two wide into the lane, continued to pull away from the field in hand, tapped once right
handed in the final furlong and finished much the best. RUNTODAY rated three wide up the backstretch, hustled up around the turn, was ridden along four
wide into the lane, sustained bid and finished clearly second best. ECHO CANYON was allowed to settle through early stages, saved ground around the
turn, sustained an inside bid through the lane and cleared a share. DIXIEMAGIC briefly poked a head in from of TYLERS TRIBE in opening stages then
weakened off of rival, chased after the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SHIPS ON FIRE rated through early stages then picked up the pace late on the backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, held a
slim lead at the head of the lane then took charge and kicked clear. BIG PINES SANDY settled off the early pace, edged closer late on the far turn, was
ridden along four wide into the lane, rallied and captured place. LATE FOR LUNCH stalked the pace to the far turn, roused forward three wide at the quarter
pole, vied with the winner in the upper stretch then weakened late and lost place. JUSTICE ONCE raced off the early pace, saved ground around the far
turn, chased along the inside through the lane and improved position. FINISH UP was unhurried up the backstretch, coaxed two wide into the lane, gained
position then ran on evenly in the final furlong. AMERICAN POSSE set the pace and widened to a clear advantage, got overtaken late on the far turn and
faded through the lane. SEMI CHARMED DAY saved ground around the first turn, stayed inside and raced in range in early stages then steadily faded.
LUCKYAPRIL raced in contention then got pulled up around the far turn and vanned off.
