early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. JEGOS FIRE tracked from the inside and was roused
on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. MALIBU MAX was off the pace and hustled along on the far turn but from the
seven path at the top of the stretch leveled off. FEDERAL LAW was in mid pack but chased on the far turn and was not a factor. GIANT MINE was well back
and showed nothing in a dull effort.

the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. HASN'T HIT ME YET was off the pace, saved ground on the turn, angled out in
upper stretch and was up for show. DREAMINOFPASSION stalked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the
four path in upper stretch but gave way. APPOINTED set a pressured pace but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

CHROMA was off slow, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch proved best. SEAQUELLE set the pace and had a clear lead on
the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was caught late. PAPA'S SILVER had no speed, gained ground on the turn and was the best of the
rest. PICTUREDAY JESSICA settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, angled outside in mid stretch and was up for a share. LIGHTS AND SIRENS
was hustled early and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. PRINCESS SOLITAIRE was in mid pack and
raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch weakened. MY LAST DREAM was off the pace, showed little and had no impact.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S ALL IN showed speed and set the pace, took command on the turn and was kept to task. MR. DYNAMIC was off slow, roused on the turn and from
the four path at the top of the stretch held place. INNUENDO was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch
finished well. OMEGNA was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. MISS D'S PRIDE stalked
the early leader but chased on the turn and had nothing left. SUMMER HARRY was in mid pack and hustled along on the turn but failed to fire. DYNAMIC
MISSION was off the pace, showed little and was never in contention.
