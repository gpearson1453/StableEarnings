LOFTY ADJUDICATOR in hand early on, took over out of the turn and drew off driving in a good effort. I'M MONEY perfect position to the stretch while no
match for winner proving best of rest. FLAT FUN no speed to the stretch, rallied along for the show spot. VOLBEAT raced evenly with no response when
needed. STRONG YEN through early, dropped back readily. MISTER KELLY bit tardy from gate, rushed with speed to the front, pressured to stretch but
gave way readily. HEZA HANDFUL had an awkward start and slow into stride while never a factor.
