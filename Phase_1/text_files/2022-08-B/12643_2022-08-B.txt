ACE NINE NINE was well placed along the inside and made a bid nearing the quarter pole, then shook clear leaving the turn and drew out in the lane to
prove best under a drive. RON DON SCORESE was away alertly, prompted the pace from the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn and continued
willingly to the wire but was second best. PRIVATE NETWORK set the early pace on the inside, then was asked at the five sixteenths while in the two path,
then was headed leaving the turn and weakened, held show award. NORTHERN THUNDER was allowed to settle on the inside, angled out leaving the turn,
then lugged in by the furlong marker and had no kick, missed show award. RUNNINGFORHOME was settled early three wide, then was five wide by the
quarter pole and had no rally. CARGO SHIP chased the pace four wide and tired. CALL FITZROY failed to menace.

Footnotes
MINER'S GEM dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the quarter pole, shook clear leaving the turn and remained clear to prove best
under a drive. STORMBEAM tracked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole but needed more, held place award late. WISHES
AND DREAMS was off slowly, reserved early, advanced two to three wide on the turn, angled out for racing room leaving the furlong marker and rallied well
late to just miss the place award. KAREN'S WAY was well placed on the inside and made a mild bid on the inside leaving the turn but had no punch. SPIRIT
OR SPITE dueled for the lead outside the winner and came three wide into the lane and faded in the drive. SNOW FORECAST was unprepared for the
start, then was hustled to get into contention, then dropped to the inside on the turn and had no rally. MI CLEOPATRA AND I broke in the air at the start,
trailed early and was four wide on the turn and was empty.
