CONDEMNATION chased leader to quarter pole, took over, went clear out of the turn and game held sway to the wire. LEROYISALAGNIAPPE trailed early,
came three wide into stretch but could not get past. MUSIC OF MY HEART never a real menace at any point. PETTY THIEF was slow into stride, rushed to
have speed for a half, stopped badly.

VALYCOVE perfect spot throughout, roused into stretch, all out to prevail. EASY DOER unhurried early, rallied outside into stretch, along late, missed.
MANY ROSES speed to the front, stayed to deep stretch, grudgingly to wire. WILD WEEKEND no speed to far turn, rallied through the stretch, coming on
late. HIGH POWERED chased pace, saved ground throughout, stayed game to wire inside. PARKER raced back to the stretch, moved up mildly in the
drive. HONEY BOURBON no hurry from the gate, dropped far back and only improved position slightly late. PERCENTAGE raced evenly along with no late
response when needed. TORNADO BOY never menaced. PLATINUM MAC through after half, dropped back readily. UGLY DUCKLING never menaced,
and vanned off following the finish on the clubhouse turn. PLUTONIAN (IRE) close up early on with a steady fade back.

Footnotes
MISSIONARY WORK chased pace to the turn, glided past to the front, clear, driving. NOGRATZ inside speed to the front, collared into the turn, could not
keep up but bested the rest in the stretch run to the wire. NEW YEAR'S DELIGHT slow into stride, circled field into stretch, finished with good energy for
show spot. BANNED FROM MIDWAY away slow from gate, inside run through the stretch but outkicked for show spot. SUMMER STORE raced evenly to
the stretch with nothing left in the drive and backed up. TRILOBYTE never menaced throughout. MARYMOTHEROF JESUS through early, dropped back
readily. NOBLES FEELINGS saved ground to turn, bore out sharply into stretch and dropped far back. LA CUERVA never close.
