Footnotes
EULALIA stalked the pace inside, rallied at the quarter pole and found a hole inside, then was clear. QUITE WHIMSICAL pressed the pace four wide, led in
the stretch but couldn't hold off the winner. MYGALJUSTICE bid five wide at the quarter pole, then was no match late. COOL BABY stalked in the two path,
angled four wide in the stretch in traffic, bid, then couldn't close late. SHOTGUN KATIE led inside, then yielded in the stretch. LANTANA JUSTICE stalked
the pace inside, angled four wide in the stretch, was steadied when COOL BABY came out, then offered a mild late bid. WINDOW SHAKER and SANTIVA
DIVA pressed the pace outside of the leader, then gave way in the stretch. CHOCOLATE TRUTH was not a factor. NUTHER BEE pressed the early pace in
the five path before fading.

Footnotes
SPLIT THE WICKETS tracked the pace from the inside on the backstretch, was moving up on the far turn, then menaced in the lane to edge clear in the
final furlong to prevail in the end. UNDERDRESSED chased the pace in the two path, was in a steady drive to press the leader on the far turn, dug in
gamely to gain the command in early stretch but was caught in the final furlong and was second best. AMERICAN HERO was unhurried early, was gaining
ground on the far turn to rally in the upper stretch, angled out to the four path then continued to drive to the wire and hung in the end, missing second place.
KOUFAX set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive into the far turn, was used up and faltered in the home stretch. CULLUM ROAD was unhurried
early then came out two wide on the second turn to bid mildly in the stretch and was no threat. MUTAKATIF (IRE) was in a steady drive while chasing the
pace along the rail then faded entering the far turn and had no final bid. LAVENDER EARL stalked the pace from the two path on the backstretch then was
steadily fading entering the second half of the course and failed to rally.

Footnotes
MOSE DEFINITELY set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive entering the far turn, and was kept to task in the home stretch under a strong hand
drive. CYCOLOGIST settled while two wide on the backstretch, was steadily urging on the far turn to rally from the three path in the home stretch and closed
well in the end. TIZ PENNEY settled along the inside on the backstretch then came out three wide on the far turn to menace in the early stretch, angled out
to the five path and continued to close willingly. LUCKY SHORE stalked the pace while three wide then bid on the far turn to close belatedly in the home
stretch and was caught for the place prize in the end. SEQUAYA chased the pace from the inside into the far turn to rally in the stretch but came up evenly.
UNION PARK GAL (IRE) chased the pace while two wide then came out five wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. CAIRO
SUMMER was unhurried early then swung four to five wide on the second turn, angled in to the three path to bid mildly in the stretch and was no threat.
KEEN ICE SIGHT was well placed while two wide, was in a steady drive on the backstretch into the second turn but never fired in the home stretch. BEING
CREATIVE raced in the middle of the field along the inside, bid mildly on the far turn then weakened in the lane. SHES MY TREASURE raced from the
three path in the middle of the field then dropped back and stopped.
