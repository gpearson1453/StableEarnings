DESIGNATE unhurried early while hung four wide into the clubhouse turn, responded readily when set down, rallied four wide to make the lead before the
furlong marker then widened the balance of the trip under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. TIZ THIRSTY broke in front and set the tempo into the
clubhouse turn, gave up the advantage, chased the pace for six furlongs, made the lead in upper stretch then was no match for the winner. DARING turned
in an even effort. MOTHERWELL broke in a tangle, sped to the lead along the rail before a quarter, set the pace to the quarter pole, remained a sharp threat
into the stretch under loose reigns then weakened in the final furlong. VELVET SAMI never far back, moved closer along the rail into the stretch then failed
to sustain that bid. ACT LIKE A LADY was through early and ran very wide through the stretch.

OHIO PLAYER never far back, closed fast four wide through the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch then widened under a strong hand ride to win
as much the best. MUSTANG WILLIE trailed early, swung wide, rallied in the middle of the racetrack and finished second best. RIDGE WEST pressed the
pace three wide down the backstretch, dropped back on the turn then improved position late. DENNY M bobbled at the start, rushed to contention inside,
pressed the pace along the rail into the turn, gained a narrow advantage briefly nearing the quarter pole, got out through the stretch while shortening stride
then pulled up injured past the wire and was vanned off. ROLLIN ON TEQUILA set a pressured pace two wide for nearly a half, had speed to the furlong
marker then gave way late. CADILLAC RIDE was through early.

Footnotes
BLAZING ZENNA stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead past the quarter pole, shook clear late under left handed urging and
just lasted. SHE'S CRAFTY slow early, closed with a burst of speed in the six path through the stretch and just missed. NANCY'S LESLIE dueled for the
lead along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. MAOILIN battled for the lead between horses two wide into the stretch then faded. ESTILO
ELEGANTE failed to menace. LEDGENDARY KITTEN was no threat. LIBERTY BELLE contested the lead three wide for nearly six furlongs then weakened.
NICEASAKITTENSEYES was no factor.
