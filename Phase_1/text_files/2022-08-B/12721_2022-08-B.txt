Footnotes
T MAX set the pace three to two wide down the backstretch, showed the way in hand from a trio of chasers around the turn, inched away from them at the
quarter pole, and drew off while being kept to task under a vigorous hand ride through the lane. AMARYLLIS tracked four wide while in touch with the leader
around the turn, shifted inside of a lugging CLOUDY BAY entering the lane as the leader kicked away, and gained place at the furlong grounds. CLOUDY
BAY broke a bit outwardly at the start, prompted the pace inside of the leader around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that one at the quarter pole, bore
out to the six path when asked to switch course outside of that rival entering the lane, but tired thereafter, and lost place to an inner foe at the furlong pole.
GATHERING STORM was rated back after being prominent among foes early on, stalked three wide and from between horses around the turn, but
weakened turning for home. LUCKY PHOENIX was brushed by an inner foe after break a step slowly at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, and
was outrun. TOP MULE broke a beat slowly while last away, trailed in the two path, and showed little before probably being eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BIG SPORT was pushed outwardly by an inner foe at the start, stalked just off of the top trio while in the five path entering the turn, shifted ground to the
seven path turning for home to remain outside of them, then rallied in pursuit of the leading inner pair in the final furlong, and drove past them nearing the
wire. SHAPE OF YOU vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes, gained the fore while a path off of the rail down the backstretch, showed the way before
mildly lugging out to the four path turning for home, resisted an inner challenge from MISS GETTY UP entering the lane, sparred with that foe after being
headed in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the closing stages while gaining victory over her inner counterpart for place. MISS GETTY
UP broke out at the start, laid close up in the two path just behind the leaders, stalked them around the turn, smoothly slipped inside of the drifting SHAPE
OF YOU turning for home to produce a bid entering the lane, forged an advantage from that foe in upper stretch, gamely clung to that margin into the final
furlong, but was worn down and yielded in the final sixteenth. AWESOME FAMILY vied for the lead two wide and between horses while in the three path,
but was herded out to the five path turning for home, then chased from among rivals through the lane. CREEKMORE prompted the pace three wide from the
four path before vying into the turn, but was floated to the six path turning for home, chased inner rivals from between horses through midstretch, but tired in
the final sixteenth. DUEL FUEL stumbled at the start, trailed in the four path before swinging to the eight path entering the lane, and cut the gap on the main
group through the final furlong. SIR ACEALOT laid off of the pace in the two to three paths around the turn, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
CHASING RAINBOWS reached the front while tucking down to the two path around the first turn, showed the way while encountering light pressure, met
BOURBON HEIST's challenge at the five sixteenths pole, dug in turning for home as an inner TEN GAUGE attempted to slip inside, shook clear of those
chasing foes entering the final furlong, and held sway to the wire. TEN GAUGE tracked along the inside, failed to kick through very narrow rail quarters
inside of the pace setter in upper stretch, altered course outside of that foe at the furlong grounds, took aim while flopping back to his left lead entering the
final sixteenth, but failed to reel in the leader. JOLLY TOMMY tracked two wide and between horses, took back mildly from tight quarters entering the far
turn, picked up stride from off of the pace along the inside turning for home, swung outside of the top trio entering the lane, and chased the leaders home
while claiming show from a tiring foe in the final sixteenth. BOURBON HEIST tracked four wide before inching closer to a stalking position entering the
backstretch, moved forward and bid for the lead outside of CHASING RAINBOWS while in the three path, but failed to keep pace with that one while
delaying his lead change to the furlong grounds, and readily faded thereafter. CHROME'S RIGHT settled at the rear of the main group along the inside,
shifted three wide and between horses into the far turn causing HE'S AN ANGEL to check from tight quarters, tipped four wide turning for home to surpass a
tiring rival, but lacked a kick to threaten for minor shares while hanging on his left lead. ALEXIS N NIKO was slow early and raced far back, saved ground
turning for home allowing him to improve inside of rivals entering the lane, and stayed on. TRIPLE OPTION leaned a bit outwardly at the start, tracked in
midpack while hung out five wide, and faded turning for home. BOLD MEDICATION pressed three wide, then from between horses down the backstretch,
but faded into the far turn. HE'S A ANGEL laid off of the pace two wide, but steadied in tight quarters between horses at the half mile pole, and faded.
ISLAND MISCHIEF broke a bit slowly before ferociously shying from an inner foe at the start, veered inwardly and almost lost his rider in the aftermath, then
lagged well behind throughout.

Footnotes
GUANA CAY tracked along the inside, shifted two wide while taking aim between the top pair nearing the lane, split those foes to bid at the furlong grounds,
led entering the final sixteenth, and fended off a game outer NEW ROO to the wire. NEW ROO pressed three wide, vied at the three furlong pole, gained an
advantage leaving the quarter pole, but was headed by an inner bidding GUANA CAY leaving the furlong grounds, fought on while chasing that foe gamely
to the wire, but did not have enough to regain even terms. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) set a sternly pressured pace inside of a pair of foes, got headed by NEW
ROO passing the quarter pole, fought on and sustained vying position through midstretch, but gave way to a pair of outer rivals entering the final sixteenth.
LADY LILLY settled at the rear along the inside, produced a four wide sweeping move into the far turn to be within striking range with three furlongs to go,
but flattened out turning for home, and only managed to chase through the lane. LINDALEVESOLTA (ARG) bobbled a bit at the start, tracked five wide
around the first turn, then two to three wide around the far turn before fading turning for home. FRONT STREET pressed the pace two wide and from
between horses, but weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
DILMUNIA sped clear around the first turn, and held sway safely through the lane. LAYLA'S SONG saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of rivals
entering the lane to claim place, and stayed on well in pursuit of the clear leader. MAYSVILLE MISS bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked three
wide while in the four path, gained outside of foes around the far turn to bid for place approaching the quarter pole, reached that position at that juncture, but
was outkicked by a ground-saving foe entering the lane, then held show through the final furlong. NO COMMENT staggered outwardly at the start and took
a stride to regain balance, settled off of the pace three to two wide, commenced a gain between horses into the far turn, shifted to the three path turning for
home, but was outkicked by his outer gaining counterpart passing the quarter pole, shifted course outside of that foe in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly.
MADRE DI GRANDEZZA broke outwardly and squarely bumped a rival at the start, stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail, but was outkicked by
rivals on either side entering the lane, and lacked a bid. BELLA MORNING trailed, improved out of last turning for home, and never got involved. MAYA'S
WISH was soundly bumped by an inner foe while jostled between horses at the start, stalked in the three path, but weakened at the three furlong pole.

COUNTERSPY stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of the embattled leading pair at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway
through the final furlong as an inner MAGNIFICENT MILE fought on. MAGNIFICENT MILE prompted the pace inside of AIRTIME early on, altered course
outside of that foe at the five furlong pole, pulled to vie into the turn, dueled around the bend, but was outkicked by an outer bidding COUNTERSPY entering
the lane, fought on grudgingly thererafter. SPIELMAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide, bid for show at the furlong grounds, and ran
on to secure that position. EL CERRITO laid off of the pace two wide, moved forward between horses entering the lane to bid for show three wide and
among rivals at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked while put to tight quarters at that juncture. SPANISH DOUBLOON saved ground in midpack, but to
no avail. AIRTIME set the pace, dueled for the lead inside of MAGNIFICENT MILE around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch after COUNTERSPY
joined the fray. JUL QUIST was outrun. ROCKING ROCKET broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the five path into the turn, and tired turning for home.
MARTINI SHOT showed little. AIRBIZ bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced at the rear early on, but was pulled up at the five furlong pole, and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
GREYES CREEK was well placed early on, raced in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane with a late bid and was just up at the wire.
BULLSEYE BUN stalked the pace early, made a bid near the five sixteenths pole, was in the three path into the lane, edged clear down the lane but was
caught at the wire. RISK MANAGER raced back early on, waited nearing the lane, was in the two path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining
in the late stages. SUPREMACY chased the pace early on, made a bid nearing the far turn, was in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the
stretch run. WHISKEY DOUBLE was never a threat. DYN O MITE set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and gave way down the lane. MY
SIXTH SENSE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. YOU'RE TO BLAME trailed the field throughout.
