Footnotes
CHAKRA led the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and drew off down the lane. SHANIAH trailed the field up the
backstretch, began to move up while racing in the two and three path around the turn, and continued to gain ground in the stretch while proving to be no
match for the winner. CANADIAN GINGER tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. CONTINENTALCONGRES angled over and bumped with PURRFECT in the early going,
pressed the pace on the outside up what remained of the backstretch and around the turn and tired in the stretch. PURRFECT was lightly bumped multiple
times in the early going when CONTINENTALCONGRES drifted over on her, recovered to chase the leaders on the outside from there, navigated the turn
from the three and four path and faded in the lane. MILENITA raced off the pace in the early going, came around the turn in the three path and made no bid.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD WALK tracked from the four path, loomed up three wide rounding the turn, took over passing the eight pole and drew clear. CHAMBEAU
pressed two wide, led from the two path into the lane, but was rundown late to place. CAROLINA SUN chesed in the three path, hustled three wide around
the turn, tipped into the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. OUR STRONG VOWS rated inside, was roused from the five path into the
stretch, and gained late. HELLO GRACIE raced in midpack from the two path, wasridden three wide around the turn, but finished evenly. DETERMINED
TRUTH prompted the pace inside but faded going into the stretch. MY SWEET KAT set the pace between foes but yielded entering the lane. I'M GITTIN
THERE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SOFT TOUCH led the field while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way racing inside up the backstretch and around the far turn,
kicked clear in the stretch and held that margin to the wire. PERSONAL BEST veered in and bumped the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled in the
two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground late.
MOZAY was bumped by the horse to her outside at the break, raced in tight quarters while saving ground around the first turn, came up the backstretch off
the pace on the inside, raced in the three path around the second bend, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground steadily to the wire. STERN
CHASER saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished
evenly. PARTYLINE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far
turn in the three path and flattened out in the lane. BETHPAGE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and tired from there. KELSEY'S SHOT trailed the field the entire way around the oval and, despite
saving ground, was never a factor.
