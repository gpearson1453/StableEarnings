Footnotes
RONALD DALE led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch and wore down her rivals to
prevail late. CATALE STORM bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid while
racing three wide around the turn, dueled down the lane and was outfinished in the final sixteenth of a mile. EUROEXIT was bumped and squeezed back at
the break, recovered to chase the pace setters between horses in the early going, raced in tight quarters in the three path coming around the turn, swung
wide to began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground late to the wire to just miss second. SHIPMAN'S SONG pressed the pace on the outside through
the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and faded in the final furlong. TIMELY REPLY chased the leaders on the
inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and was outkicked in the lane while finishing evenly. COVINGTON QUALITY raced off the
pace on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in three path and made no bid. GRUFFANDTOUGH bumped with the horse to her outside
leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was empty from
there. EL CHIHUAS trailed the field the entire way around the oval and, despite saving ground, was never a factor.

SQUARE FOOTAGE chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, was forced wide when
WILDSTARINTHESKY drifted out entering the stretch and dueled down the lane to prevail late. WILDSTARINTHESKY led the field on the inside through the
opening quarter of a mile, headed into the turn in the two path, ran out coming off the bend, and dueled gamely to the wire to just miss. MEMORABLE
FLIGHT hit the gate leaving it, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the turn up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, offered a bid
approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. MOONLIGHT BLAZE trailed the field on the outside in the early going, began to improve
position racing four wide around the turn and continued to gain ground in the lane. MUSE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening
quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three and four path and faded in the lane. SAGANAKI raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages,
came around the turn in the three path and made no bid. BROADWAY ROMANCE bobbled leaving the gate, settled off the pace between horses early,
raced in the two path around the turn and was empty from there. ONE CLASSY CHICK raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
began to lose ground from the two path coming around the turn and tired further in the stretch. SANDPLUM CREEK chased the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

DECLINED pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and dueled down the lane to get up for the win late.
IMA BLING CAT dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and raced gamely in the stretch to just
miss. MUNI MUNI SLEW dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle gamely in upper stretch and gave way late.

around the turn and continued to gain ground in the stretch. MAN U chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the
two path around the turn and finished evenly. MORO MERICA stumbled at the break, recovered to stalk the frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and flattened out in the lane. A FLICKER OFSILVER raced at the back of the pack in the opening stages, navigated the turn
from the two path and made no bid. CAYMANS COBRA was squeezed back leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came
around the turn in the two path and was empty from there. CANEY'S GHOST trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was not
a factor. POMEROY HAZE veered out leaving the gate, chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three
