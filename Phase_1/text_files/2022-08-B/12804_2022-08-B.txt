Footnotes
J T'S A. T. M. was bumped at the start by Buckley Bay, then set the pressured pace from along the outside, responded when asked and was fully extended
to just last. MISO FAST was shuffled back at the start, then was unhurried, moved up between horses on the turn, angled out six-wide in the stretch and
finished full of run. ORCADIAN STORM dueled with the winner from along the inside into the stretch and held on well for the show. TRIBAL IMPACT was
prominently placed while racing two-wide and went evenly late. PRINCE OF LUCK was off a step slow, moved up along the inside to stalk the pace before
going a quarter mile, but lacked a rally. JERSEY RED broke out to bump with Norski at thje start, then was allowed to settle in stride and failed to threaten.
BUCKLEY BAY broke in at the start to bump the winner, then prompted the early pace while three-wide and tired. NORSKI was bumped at the start by
Jersey Red, then dropped back and failed to factor. PROUDTOBESICILIAN failed to menace while saving ground.
