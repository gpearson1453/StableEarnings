Footnotes
ROYAL TO BE was clear early in the three path and held sway under mild urging. TAPPINTOTHEBEAT stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid.
HOPPESTRY was unrushed early, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole, then gained the show spot late. C J S SUZIE BYU pressed the early pace in the
four path before yielding. C J'S EMPIRE was not a factor. OXBOW'S IMAGE stalked the early pace between foes, then faded.

PRETTI XTREME tracked the pace from the two path, was moving up on the far turn to duel with an inner rival entering the stretch drive, dug in grudgingly
and was up in the final strides to prevail. PURR SEA dueled for the lead from the inside, was in a long drive, then was challenged by a new rival at the five
sixteenths pole, rallied gamely entering the home stretch but gave way in the end. QUERIDINHA LECA tracked the pace from the inside, was in a steady
drive to bid mildly on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. TAKNTOTHECLEANERS dueled for the lead from the two path, was used up entering
the far turn then steadily faded and had no final bid. SOUTHERN SKY hopped at the start then trailed throughout.

bumped at the start then raced from the inside on the backstretch, bid while three wide on the turn, angled out to the four path to close belatedly and was up
for place prize. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN lead the way quickly then dueled from the two path in the late backstretch into the turn, gained the lead again at
the eighth pole but gave way in the end. C F V BULLET raced in the middle of the pack while two wide, was urging on the turn to menace from the four path
in the stretch and was closing well but it was not enough. FRENCH COMPOSER bobbled at the start, was unhurried early then rallied two wide on the far
turn to close willingly in the stretch but it wasn't enough. BRESLAU tracked the pace from the inside, then bid mildly on the turn into the stretch and was no
threat. WHITE PIGEON moved up along the inside to duel for the lead into the turn, was used up and weakened in late stretch. LUCKY DEVIL was
unhurried early and no threat. SCOTCH NO ROCKS tracked the pace from the two path then faded on the turn and was no menace. SPECIAL A broke
inward and bumped rival, was unhurried early and no factor.
