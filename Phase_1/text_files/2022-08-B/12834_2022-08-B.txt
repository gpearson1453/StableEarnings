Footnotes
RUNNING LUCK rated just off of the early pace while in a comfortable position, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, advanced in upper
stretch under firm handling, came to even terms with SHANGHAI MIST in the final yards and made a determined late push to prevail. SHANGHAI MIST was
asked for early speed, set moderate fractions while prompted into the second turn, was able to extend the lead a bit in upper stretch, came under pressure
in the final sixteenth, was all out in the final strides and was tagged for the win, while holding safely for second. LAKAYA was unhurried early on, was roused
three wide leaving the three-furlong marker, mounted a four wide bid into the drive, was outfinished late by the top pair but was up in time to secure third.
FRONT OF LINE (GB) raced close to the early pace, prompted the fractions through the second turn, was asked for run at the top of the lane and did not
produce a late bid. SUGAR ON TOP bobbled leaving the break, settled off of the pace, saved ground to the second turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
IRISH WAHINE broke a half-step slowly but recovered nicely and was forwardly placed to the turn, stalked the pace to the quarter marker, advanced in
upper stretch, overtook the pacesetter inside of the furlong marker and drew away late as much the best. NENE ROMANO was asked to show early speed
and was sent to the front, set solid fractions through the turn, was confronted by the winner in upper stretch, could not hold off IRISH WAHINE inside of the
eighth pole but stayed on late to be best of the rest. LIGHT UP was crowded a bit at the start, tracked the pace outside of rivals through the turn, improved
position in mid-stretch but lacked the needed late response. CIRCLE OF ROYALTY broke alertly then took back off of the early speed, tracked the leader
three wide through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and gave way late. MISS ARROWHEAD was away awkwardly and crowded LIGHT UP leaving the
start, chased from the rear to the turn, was hard to place leaving the three-furlong marker while along the rail and lacked a late response. CAROLYN'S WAY
chased the pace from a two wide path through the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
ZELAIA was sent to the early lead after an alert beginning, set the moderate pace through the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter
marker, was kept to task through the final furlong, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive to prevail. DEL MAR FLASH lunged at the
start and was off slowly, settled off of the pace through the backstretch run, came in tight and lacked room nearing the quarter marker, angled out in upper
stretch, finished well late, could not reel in the winner in the end but held safely for second. GOOD TIME DOLLY was forwardly placed early on, attended to
the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost ground to the winner on the far turn, was outfinished in the final furlong and just saved third in the final
strides. BOSSY SOUL saved all of the ground while stalking the pace, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong while just missing for
third. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was bumped at the start and was off slowly, was never far back while outside of rivals through the backstretch run, came
three wide while gaining ground on the far turn but could not sustain that run and flattened out in the drive. PARTY SPIRIT (GB) stalked the early pace from
the second flight, lost position on the second turn and gave way in the stretch run.

CROWN KITTEN broke a half-step slowly but recovered to be forwardly placed to the turn, advanced on the turn to come within aim of SWANEE, lost a bit
of ground to that rival in upper stretch, closed well inside of the furlong grounds, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and made a determined late push to
prevail. SWANEE broke alertly and was hustled to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn, was confronted by CROWN KITTEN nearing the
quarter marker, spurted away from that rival in upper stretch but was met again by that one inside of the eighth pole, dueled to the wire and was gamely
bested in the end. TURA LURA stalked the solid pace from the inside, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outfinished by the top pair in the final stages, while
clear of the rest for third. SENORITA ESTRELLA lacked speed through the turn and could not muster a late rally. EYE ON TIGER tracked the pace between
rivals to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BOISE rated nicely off of the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, came within aim of HEAVEN SHINES nearing the furlong marker, overtook his
stablemate nearing the sixteenth-marker and held on over the quickly oncoming runner-up to prevail. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF hit the gate leaving the start
and was off slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, was steered outside of rivals and mounted a four wide rally into the drive, advanced in upper stretch,
found his best stride late while on the left lead and just missed for the win while clear of the rest for second. HEAVEN SHINES showed good early speed
while in hand, set quick fractions through the turn, turned away a rival nearing the quarter marker and extended the lead into upper stretch, was caught
inside of the furlong marker and held for third at the end. WINTER FALCON raced close to the early pace, tracked the leader two wide through the turn, lost
ground in upper stretch and did not mount a late bid. STORMY SAMURAI was crowded a bit leaving the start, chased the early pace, lost position on the
turn and did not offer a late rally. SUPER BILL broke out at the start and crowded STORMY SAMURAI leaving the start, was keen early on while close to
the pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DUBBY DUBBIE raced close to the early pace, stalked the moderate fractions to the second turn, chased PAINT ME LUCKY into upper stretch, made a
steady advance inside of the furlong marker to wear down that foe and edged away late. PAINT ME LUCKY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set
moderate fractions through the backstretch run, felt pressure from DUBBY DUBBIE nearing the quarter marker but spurted away from that rival into upper
stretch, was confronted again by the winner inside of the furlong grounds and could not hold that one off in the final stages and was second best.
NOWHERE MAN stalked the early moderate pace, made a middle move to contest the pace nearing the half-mile marker, lost position on the second turn,
angled out at the top of the stretch, was outfinished by the top pair in the late stages and held safely for third. DUB TOWN stalked the early pace, came four
wide into the backstretch run, maintained position into the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. DEALERS HAND
hopped at the start and was off slowly, settled off of the pace while three wide on the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, swung five wide
into upper stretch and lacked a late rally. KNOWN settled off of the pace while saving ground into the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run, came
four wide along the second turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and did not offer a late response. ENGRAM was unhurried through the first half-mile,
came five wide along the second turn, swung seven wide into the lane and was not a late factor. ORCZY (IRE) was allowed to settle, saved ground to the
second turn, advanced in upper stretch but could not sustain that run and flattened out in the final stages.

SACRED BEAUTY bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the pace while two to three wide, rallied six wide in upper stretch, closed with a
rush in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. PREMIUMONSATURDAY settled of of the early pace, saved ground into the second turn, was blocked in
upper stretch, swung out inside of the furlong marker, surged late and just missed for the win while getting up in time to claim the place. MISS MAIA stalked
the early pace while two wide between runners, maintained position through the backstretch run, came in tight while two wide nearing the quarter marker,
slipped to the rail inside of the eighth pole, found her best stride late and challenged for the win and place while getting up for third. AMIKO CHOW (IRE)
was unhurried early on, gained ground four wide on the second turn, came five wide into the stretch run, finished well while on the left lead in the final
furlong and could not quite reel in the top three in the late stages. DERRYGOOLIN tracked the early pace three wide on the first turn, advanced on the far
turn to come within aim, chased the leader into upper stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. HARBOR ABBEY attended to the decent early pace
through the backstretch run, pressured the pacesetter and overtook RUNAWAY PRINCESS into upper stretch, edged away to lead nearing the furlong
marker, could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final stages and was outfinished. SPARKA (IRE) saved ground while close to the decent pace, dropped
back in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. RUNAWAY PRINCESS was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions through the backstretch run,

Footnotes
SHEZAGHOST was hustled leaving the break and went to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted on the far turn
and dueled with STOIC LUNA to mid-stretch, held that rival at bay inside of the furlong marker, was all out in the final sixteenth to hold off the runner-up and
gamely held on to prevail. IMPERIAL CREED stalked the early fractions, maintained position through the backstretch run, came three wide to the quarter
marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, mounted a bold late rally to confront SHEZAGHOST inside of the sixteenth-marker but could not get by that game winner
and was second best. STOIC LUNA raced close to the early pace, advanced on the backstretch run, confronted SHEZAGHOST approaching the quarter
marker, dueled with the winner to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final sixteenth and gave way late, while clear of the rest for third.
MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried through the opening stages, was steered four wide nearing the top of the
lane, made a mild late rally in the final furlong but was not a threat. CECILE'S CHAPTER settled off of the early pace, maintained position into the far turn,
came three wide nearing the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. MISTY CAT stalked the moderate early pace, lost ground on the second turn, was
outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
KERRYGOLD LADY broke well and settled in a comfortable position outside of pacesetter MISTICAL SURPRISE, moved up to challege passing the quarter
pole, encountered a determined foe, battled the length of the stretch and prevailed in the final strides. MISTICAL SURPRISE was away quickest of all, set a
reasonable pace, was challenged by KERRYGOLD LADY at the top of the stretch, appeared to hold that one at bay but came up just short in a game effort.
CAL ROUGH was off slow, then bumped a few strides out of the gate by DADDY'SFAVORITESON, found a good spot in the two path to the turn while
making steady progress towards the leaders down the backstretch, awaited room around the turn, finally found a hole turning for home and keep on with
some interest to gain third. BIG FAME lost her path at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, improved position three wide nearing
the quarter marker, rallied in upper stretch and continued that bid into the final stages to challenge for third. PETE'S INFERNO ducked in at the start and
bothered APRIL AFFAIR leaving the break, raced close to the pace to the turn, steadied off of heels inside of the three furlong marker, was outkicked in
upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. DADDY'SFAVORITESON was crowded at the start and lacked early speed, improved position four wide on
the turn, continued that advance while seven wide in upper stretch but could not sustain that run and flattened out late. QUITCHERSNIVELIN broke out at
the start, chased outside of rivals on the turn, lost position while six wide in upper stretch and gave way late. APRIL AFFAIR was off a bit slow, steadied
shortly thereafter when bothered by PETE'S INFERNO, kept to the inside path but had nothing to offer when asked. BELLA VINO chased the early leaders
and was in good position around the turn but stopped after a half.
