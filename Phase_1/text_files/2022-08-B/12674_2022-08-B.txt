Footnotes
SHE'S OUTTA HERE set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY was bumped
soon after the start, saved ground in range, angled out in the stretch and held second. RANSOMS REWARD chased the winner four wide, was no match for
that foe but churned on to gain the show. SOUTH PACIFIC was bumped between foes at the start, raced three wide in midpack and lacked a closing bid.
INTERESTING GEM broke inwardly and bumped at the start, had early speed between foes and faded. SOLAIR had her head turned at the start and was
off last, steadied off heels near the five-eighths pole, chased two and three wide between foes and never threatened. IMEXQUISITE failed to menace while
racing three wide. PURE AMBITION was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
SIR AGGRAVATOR pressed the pace between foes, set the pace in the two and three paths around the turn, edged clear in upper stretch and dug in
gamely to last. PROSPECT PROJECT saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole, split rivals in upper stretch, continued on the left
lead in the lane, ranged up outside of the winner near the sixteenth pole but could not get past that foe. NACHO PAPA settled off the early pace, raced
three wide around the turn and rallied outside. ROYAL SQUEEZE prompted the winner three and four wide and tired in the lane. ZANNO set the early pace
inside of the winner and gave way nearing the three-eighths pole. UNCAPTURED KING raced off the pace two wide, angled six wide in upper stretch and
never threatened. LONG BEACH KID was outrun while racing two wide.

CROSS HASTE broke inwardly and slowly, rushed up inside down the backstretch, stalked inside around most of the turn, bulled his way through near the
quarter pole, seized command in midstretch and quickly drew off. LITTLE BIG set the pace along the rail to the eighth pole and was no match for the winner
from there while holding safe for the place. ROYAL ATTITUDE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. MY BIG
DRAMA failed to menace while racing three wide. BRAVE AND TRUE was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. SONG RUNNER
took some awkward strides near the eleven-sixteenths marker, appeared to recover quickly and advanced between foes, raced up close two wide, retreated
nearing the lane, was pulled up near the sixteenth pole and walked off.

lane and just missed second. FIA FIRST saved ground off the pace and passed tiring rivals. OMO TEN GIRL chased the pace five wide and lacked the
needed rally. PROMINENCIA failed to menace while racing three wide. CHILD MEMORIES chased the pace two wide and faded through the lane. RIPLEY

MARYQUITECONTRARY tracked the pace in the four path, surged late and was up in deep stretch. TOWSER prompted the pace in the three path, took
over nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, held clear past the sixteenth pole, drifted out and was caught late. MISS Z broke a bit awkwardly,
raced off the pace two wide and was along for the show. RUNNING LEGACY was no threat while racing four and five wide. RAPTUROUS threw her head
just prior to start and was off well last, raced three and four wide and never threatened. CHITIENNE set the early pace along the rail and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
JAZZY T settled off the pace along the inside, was boxed in between foes around the far turn, found a seam in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and
surged clear. ASTERS D'ORO tracked the pace three and four wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole and was no match for the
winner late. LANIAKEA STORM was in range inside, tipped out near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. KHOSEA chased the pace three
wide around the first turn and inside around the far turn and lacked a rally. MONEY FACTOR failed to menace while racing two and three wide.
STREAKING GREY set a clear pace in the two path and faltered in the lane. GREY CHARLOTTE played no factor while racing two wide. BRODY'S
HONOR was unprepared for the start, raced three wide and never reached contention. ROSE'S CAUSE was outrun while racing three wide.
