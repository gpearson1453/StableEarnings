Footnotes
CHEWY CHEWY GOOD was sent to the front to set the pace while clear in the two path, was well handled throughout, sent down leaving the turn and was
kept to her task to remain clear to prove best. EQUAL MEASURE was rated along the inside to the quarter pole, eased out leaving the turn and came four
wide into the lane and finished well, second best. FILLMORE EAST tracked the pace three wide, made a bid between rivals on the turn and flattened out in
the drive, bested rest. WITCH was well placed on the inside and faded in the drive. STRONG GEM was reserved early three wide, then dropped to the
inside and saved ground on the turn, then was blocked leaving the furlong marker, angled out by the sixteenth pole and had no kick. LOOP THE LOOP
passed the tiring rivals on the inside. MOON CHANT was four wide into the first turn, made a five to four wide middle move to be in contention on the turn
but was empty in the lane. EMMA AND I was settled three to four wide and had no rally. BIRD TRAFFIC failed to menace. BROOKLYN MOJO showed little.

MY THOUGHTS was well rated along the inside, made a three wide move on the turn, then had a long drive with SWAN POINT and prevailed gamely under
a drive. SWAN POINT was settled back early, made a bid four wide move on the turn, then had a long drive with the winner but was outkicked by that rival
to just miss. TROLLEY RIDE was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn, angled out leaving the turn and rallied. CALL ON CLARA was taken
back on the inside, then made a five wide move on the turn and came six wide into the drive but needed more in the lane to finish evenly. CHAMPAGNE

for the lead on the inside and weakened. KLAYTON'S KANDY vied for the early lead between rivals, then dueled for the lead to the outside and made a bid
on the turn and weakened. EARLY FROST tired. BELLA PRIMA vied for the lead three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT HAULER was reserved early, then settled into a nice stride on the backstretch, was coaxed along on the turn and advanced three wide midway
on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and closed full of run on the outside under left handed crop urging to draw away late to prove best. YOU
MUST CHILL was reserved three wide early, then made steady advance on the outside, made a four wide move to take over leaving the turn and shifted in
leaving the three sixteenths, was clear by the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner late, second best. COLBALOAF was allowed to settle early,
made advanced nearing the quarter pole and swung out five wide leaving the turn and continued that bid to the furlong marker but flattened out, bested rest.
TRENDING UP was void of early speed, then was three wide by the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. HELMS DEEP set the pace
while racing two wide and weakened in the drive. UNCONQUERED SPIRIT stalked the pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but came
up empty in the lane. HIGHWAY BOUND was keen early and had to checked into the first turn, then stalked the pace along the inside to the upper stretch
and weakened. SOUPER CATCH was settled early and tired.

furlong marker but was outkicked by the winner while being second best. MEMORY BOUQUET set the pace along the inside and was headed leaving the
turn and faded the final furlong, bested rest. BOURBON MUSIC was settled while wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally.
MARTINKELLY was bumped at the start, tracked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but came up empty in the drive. HEROS
REWARD was well placed on the inside and weakened. NEWSTOME was off slow, raced on the inside on the turn and failed to menace. VENOMOUS
STATE lunged at the start, then was on the inside on the turn and was not a threat. STUDIO B stumbled badly at the start, then was not a factor.
JUMPMASTER chased the pace and was four wide on the turn and stopped.

three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and weakened the final furlong, bested rest. DIGGERS DIAMOND was well placed early two wide and tired.

Footnotes
SMART TART was void of early speed, advanced on the turn and came four wide into the lane, closed full of run and drew away in the final sixteenth to
prove much the best under a mild drive. FLECHE D'AMOUR was away alertly, then relented to LIFE IS ETERNAL and stalked that slow starting rival, made
a three wide bid on the turn and drew clear leaving the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner the final sixteenth, clearly second best. SIMPLE
JUSTICE chased the early pace on the inside, then came three wide into the drive and had no rally, bested rest. LIFE IS ETERNAL was off slowly, then was
hustled to get the lead and cross over to the inside, was headed mid way on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
THIS ROUND'S MINE was well rated early on the inside, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in the drive to prove best under a drive.
STARSHIP BLANCA was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn, angled out in the drive and closed well despite trying to lug in. LADY
MUNNINGS set the pace and faded the final furlong, bested rest. SUSIKIN stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to vie
for command between rivals but was empty in the lane. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT was reserved early on the inside, then was two wide on the turn, lacked a
rally. MAD MARY chased the pace on the in side and weakened. FAIRY DUST stopped.
