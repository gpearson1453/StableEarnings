Footnotes
DEL GRIFFITH tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled three and four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off under steady
pressure. CALL ME LATER stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to challenge that one on the two path through the turn, bid outside, then was no
match for the winner and held the place. STRANGE ARRANGE set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened the
final furlong and held the show. BANDITOFTHEPRAIRIE ran evenly, inside. NOT SO EASY improved position. CHOCOLATE PHILLING was no factor.

DANCE OR STROLL allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, then angled out again
inside the furlong marker and edged up in the final strides. DON'T MAKE ME BEG vied for the early lead on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then
held off a rival edging further ahead and was outfinished. RUN LAUGHING unhurried early, moved up while angling out through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch and closed well for the show. LIMONATA unhurried early, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
steadied for racing room, then angled in, drifted in and flattened out. GET SASSY tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turn, got through inside
the leader into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. WHISTLER DIXIE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that
path into the lane and faded. EMERALD CITADELLE set the pace off the rail and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
DAKOTA DANCER hard to rated early, sprinted away from the field, turned back a challenge through the second turn, shook clear, then drew off in the
stretch and was kept to the task. SPRING MAGIC allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled out and
closed well for the place. DAME OF MALTA mid pack and outside, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and
had a mild gain. STAR OF SHANGHAI tracked the pace pulling, angled out through the second turn, came three and four wide into the stretch and ran
evenly. QUEEN'S WARRANT passed tiring rivals. PELLETIER hopped at the start, was no factor. SIGN AND SEAL pulled to contention down the
backstretch, bid outside the leader through the second turn, then faded.

RUNAWAY PHYLLIS sprinted to a clear lead quickly, held a clear margin to the lane, then drew off and lasted under steady pressure. CANCAN SAREE
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, angled out and lacked the needed late
kick. VAVITE never far back, held position three wide through the turn, came three and four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and did not have
enough in the final strides. RUNAWAY BREEZE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, waited, angled out for racing room,
lost her path, then angled in gaining. DOMINANT STRANGER allowed to settle, moved up inside through the turn, came three and four wide into the stretch
and improved her position. ANOTHERMANICMONDAY stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path and
weakened in the stretch. ELLE M'A SOURI (FR) unhurried to the lane, came three wide into the stretch and had a mild late gain. TRUDIAN'S PROMISE
was no factor. HERE COMES MEG was never involved.

Footnotes
SNAKERATTLEANDROLL mid pack, moved up into the second turn, shook clear three and four wide through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was
kept to the task. PAPI BELLO allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the second turn, drifted in while closing and gained the place.
SMOKEY LEE rated back inside in the early going, saved ground through the second turn, angled three and four wide into the stretch, evened out and held
the show. GOODTIME ARTIE unhurried early, looped three and four wide through the second turn, angled widest in the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up for a share. DECEIVER allowed to settle, looped up five and six wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and evened out. NIP
OF BOURBON well placed and outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. PUNX allowed to settle,
looped up three and four wide through the second turn, angled in and came through inside into the stretch and improved his position. GOLDEN OAK set the
pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded in the stretch. BREWING STORM
ran evenly. RED DUBONNET stalked the pace from between and faded through the second turn. WILD ENOUGH mid pack, moved up while angling out
through the second turn, then had no stretch rally. JESSE JONES hard to rated, faded after a half.
