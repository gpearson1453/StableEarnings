Footnotes
RECKLESS PLACE set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid from DADASHEV, responded when roused, drew off on the rail and was ridden out.
DADASHEV stalked close up outside, bid on the turn, could not go with the winner, then dug in gamely to earn the place spot. PRINCE OF FENTON was
bumped at the start, chased on the inside and rallied mildly inside in the lane. HE'S GOT JUMP stalked two wide early, chased inside on the turn, angled
out and lacked a rally. THE EQUINEST was bounced around at the start, stalked four wide, chased three wide on the turn and tired. BAYOU SHACK was
bumped and steadied at the start, stalked three wide, chased between rivals on the turn and faded.
