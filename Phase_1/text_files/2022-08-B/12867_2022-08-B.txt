Footnotes
XIGERA showed speed on the inside of a foe then was taken off the pace before the first turn, tracked the clear leader in the two path, ranged up on the far
turn, was asked while taking the advantage into upper stretch, kicked clear inside the three-sixteenths, was given one light tap of a down-turned crop just
inside the furlong marker, widened under a hand-ride, swapped back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best while eased up late.
JUSTIFIABLE BELLE settled in a good position on the inside, moved closer on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then swung out into upper stretch,
bumped with CANDLE near the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place.
CLEVER JOKE hit the outside of the gate hard at the break and dislodged the jockeys left-iron briefly, spotted the front a few lengths, dropped well behind
early, went around the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear, was roused in the two then three path early on the far turn, moved to the four path later
on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and just got up for the show. MO SHIRO went three wide around the opening bend, settled by herself in the
middle of the field, started the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide while moving closer at the five-sixteenths then was roused and lacked the needed
response then just missed the show. LA VITA SOFIA was taken up when put in tight by FOREVER DIXIE early, swerved in shortly thereafter then moved in,
saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on
the final turn and failed to rally. CANDLE bobbled outward at the start then bumped solidly with an opponent, settled on the outside while traveling in the
three path, was given her cue on the final turn, bumped with a rival while in good striking range in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and
capitulated. WAND bumped solidly with a foe at the start, was coaxed along early then urged into the first turn, saved ground near the back of the field, was
roused in the two path into upper stretch and failed to threaten. MADEMOISELLEJACKIE broke in and brushed the gate, was taken up when FOREVER
DIXIE dropped in front early, settled in the two path, was urged along around the final turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. AKAYLA
(IRE) was taken in hand while squeezed back in tight between foes early, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on
the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FOREVER DIXIE was hustled from the start then angled in quickly and bothered
foes, reached the inside into the first turn, showed the way with a clear advantage, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage at the
three-sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
CRYO coaxed from the gate, established the front and cut the pace in hand just off the inside through the first turn before taking to the inside down the
backstretch, tipped back to the two path through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths under challenge from ENDOWED to the outside,
floated three to four wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive drifting out to the finish kept to task. ENDOWED bumped at the start by NEVER
CHANGE, who broke in a step, came under coaxing and chased along the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch,
advanced on the leader three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, got shaken off
straightened away and ran on to just secure the place honors. BOLD VICTORY coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide until tipped to the four path
nearing the nine-sixteenths, went four to five wide through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild bid. NEVER CHANGE broke in a step at the start bumping ENDOWED, raced three to four wide through the first turn, then circled
briefly out five wide around HIGHER QUALITY with six and a half furlongs to go quickly tucking back four wide and forcing that rival to steady off his heels,
chased three to four wide from that point onwards coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late
stages. ELOQUIST chased just off the inside through the first turn and then along the inside down the backstretch, tipped to the two path into the far turn
and came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, spun two to three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. HIGHER QUALITY coaxed from the
gate, raced five then four wide through the first turn, then got forced to steady when circled by NEVER CHANGE into the backstretch with six and a half
furlongs remaining, grew detached at the tail of the field steadily losing ground in pursuit three wide, came under brief coaxing through the far turn, swung
four wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish well behind.

STUCK ON KITTEN broke in and bumped with a foe, was urged along towards the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into upper
stretch under a drive then moved further out, rallied outside under a left-handed crop into the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up late. ABUSE OF
POWER chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, dueled outside of
MISPELLED MOOON, swapped back to her inside lead inside the sixteenth-pole then brushed with the aforementioned rival and was denied while just able
to get the place. MISPELLED MOOON was hustled to the front, showed the way along the hedge, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive
while challenged in upper stretch, dueled inside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth, brushed with that foe shortly thereafter and was also denied while
clear for the show. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY was fractious in the gate, moved in while coaxed along off the pace, was roused for more leaving the backstretch,

Footnotes
GASOLINE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths when his rivals in behind launched
bids, began to shake away near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside at that station before drifting to the three path straightened away for home, then
drew off under a drive to prevail. BOLD LOOKER coaxed from the start, raced three wide forwardly placed through the first turn, chased three wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors.
SIDEKICK chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, commenced a bid on the front three furlongs from home, swung four wide
into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened while well clear for the show honors. CLOUD FOREST traded bumps at the start with
AFJAN and came under coaxing, raced just off the inside early on before tucking inside midway on the first turn at the rear of the field, tipped three wide
down the backstretch, came under coaxing and tucked quickly to the inside with nine-sixteenths to go and advanced along the rail inside a pair of rivals to
be just off the pace with three furlongs to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired in the drive. AFJAN traded a pair of bumps at the start with
CLOUD FOREST, raced three then two wide through the first turn before chasing three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE broke out at the start, raced four wide just off the
pace through the first turn and down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home and was patiently handled until put to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. ABUNDANT HONOR chased just off the inside coming under coaxing half a mile from home,
tucked inside with three furlongs to run, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

CALL ME HARRY moved in while strolling to the front, showed the way in the two path with an uncontested easy lead, responded well when set down in
upper stretch, extended the advantage under a brisk hand-ride and a tap on the shoulder of a down-turned crop into the final furlong and maintained a safe
advantage under a strong hand-ride in a felony theft. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY brushed with a rival at the start, jostled with MICROPHONE into the the
first turn, went three to four wide around that bend, settled on the outside without cover, was roused three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the
stretch and finished with good courage for the place. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) was taken under a hold then reserved on the inside, came under coaxing late
on the backstretch, was roused while saving ground on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while just able to get
the show. COLOSSEO broke in and a bit awkwardly, moved in before the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the inside, chased on the far turn, was
driven off the rail into upper stretch, pursued the winner while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and also lacked the needed kick. MICROPHONE
(IRE) bumped soundly with a rival at the start, tossed his head while rank under restraint down the opening straightaway, jostled with a foe into the first turn,
was reserved in the two path while tugging hard at the bit, remained in hand between foes around the far turn and into upper stretch, was roused at the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. IRWIN (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand early, traveled three wide around the first
turn, settled on the outside but with cover, was roused three wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FUNNY JOKE
brushed the gate at the start, tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, was given his cue leaving the backstretch, chased three wide around the far
turn and tired. EXULT was bumped soundly at the start while also bumped with another foe, dropped back while urged along, rounded the first turn in the
two path, was reserved while covered up at the rear, went three wide while roused on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
THE GREAT MAYBE broke in brushing the near side stall at the start and was hustled, advanced inside from the five-eighths marker to get on near even
terms with the leader half a mile from home, took over the front under a firm hold along the rail at the seven-sixteenths, shook away from the rest of the field
in tandem with I'M A COUNTRY GIRL through the latter portion of the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and
went clear under a drive to prevail. LOVE TO SHOP hustled from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung four wide
into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. QUIESCENT led early on before being displaced from the
front five furlongs from home, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear for the show honors. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES chased along the inside under coaxing from
the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. ALPHA BELLA broke out at the start, chased six then five wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position through the stretch. SOLEDAD broke a half a beat slow and was
bumped at the start by LOVIN' ON THE RUN and steadied conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. LOVIN' ON THE RUN broke in at the start bumping SOLEDAD,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. BELLA MICHELLE broke a half a
beat slow and lost her lane conceding four lengths to the front, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the
turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MARIA FROM MIAMI broke out at the start under hustling, chased five then four wide
down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, swung three to four wide for home and tired. I'M A
COUNTRY GIRL coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in aim in the very early stages before advancing to take command five furlongs from home,
showed the way briefly solo before being engaged by THE GREAT MAYBE to her inside nearing the half mile pole, got headed by that rival at the
seven-sixteenths and dueled through the turn widening away from the rest, cornered three wide into upper stretch under light coaxing and faltered in the
drive.

Footnotes
TRAIN TO ARTEMUS showed speed on the outside of a rival, moved to a solo lead at the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, responded
well when asked coming to the quarter-pole, accelerated quickly while extending the advantage under strong urging into upper stretch, powered away under
a strong-hand ride into the final furlong, was given one light tap of right-handed crop shortly thereafter, continued under a brisk hand-ride into the final
seventy yards then was eased up while much the best. TOWERING ORBIT bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, was urged along at the
rear, traveled three wide around the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, moved further out outside the furlong marker and finished well for the place while
unable to threaten the winner. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH was taken up sharply but briefly when CINDERELLA'S CAUSE crossed in front early, raced on the
outside under urging, angled in outside the half-mile pole, moved from the hedge to the three path under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, came four to
five wide into upper stretch, moved out around the furlong marker and improved for the show. SUMMER AT THE SPA settled off the pace, was roused in
the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. LUCKY LATKES settled off the pace, traveled three wide
on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch, moved out behind a drifting foe outside the furlong marker and failed to
rally. FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS had her saddle adjusted behind the gate, showed speed on the inside of the winner, was taken back off pace coming to the
half-mile pole then moved out, chased three wide around the turn, drifted out badly in upper stretch and weakened. O'GOTTEN GIRL brushed the outside of
the gate at the start, was well placed towards the front on the inside, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path
while under the crop and came up empty. WEEKEND FUN was ridden along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn and failed to respond.
BASTET broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner against the hedge while asked for more
at the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE was hustled from the gate then came in some early, settled on the outside, was asked
while three to four wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated.

WIT lightly coaxed from the gate, settled two to three wide in pursuit among the front of the main body of the field tracking the spurting away leader from
afar, took closer order into and through the far turn patiently handled until placed to coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch, pounced on the top pair seizing command with three-sixteenths to go and edged clear under a drive before being geared down in the late
stages. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. NAPOLEONIC
WAR coaxed from the start, raced two then three wide through the first turn before settling three then two wide tracking the front from afar among the main
body of the field down the backstretch, came under coaxing near the quarter pole just off the inside, angled four wide into upper stretch, failed to quicken
under a drive staying on one paced to the finish. LEGENDS CAN'T DIE coaxed from the gate, dueled briefly for command with FLUID SITUATION before
coming under a hold into the first turn when realizing that rival was intent on the front, eased off and tracked in closest aim just off the inside and had the
rest of the field join him five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths taking first run at the once spurting away leader, cornered just off
the inside into upper stretch and was unable to strike the front when overhauled by WIT at the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late going. EMBOITE
(IRE) coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened. FLUID SITUATION coaxed from the gate, knocked heads briefly with LEGENDS CAN'T DIE and was intent on the front and had his main rival
back off into the opening bend, spurted away three then two wide opening up a commanding lead midway down the backstretch before the field began to
take closer order into the far turn, came under light coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch under growing threat, got

Footnotes
GOODNIGHT OLIVE bumped soundly with a rival at the start, tracked the pace comfortably on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid
near the five-sixteenths, took the lead in the four path while set down into upper stretch, kicked clear under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths
and proved much the best under steady urging. CARAMEL SWIRL broke out then was corrected by the rider, settled off the pace, saved ground early on the
turn, shifted three wide at the three-eighths then moved four wide near the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into upper stretch and earned the place
while unable to threaten the winner. OBLIGATORY settled at the rear on the outside, was urged three to four wide around the turn, checked when LADY
ROCKET came out in front of her nearing the quarter-pole, spun seven wide into the stretch and improved for the show. TRAVEL COLUMN bumped
soundly with a rival at the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the outside, moved clear with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path around the turn,
was challenged near the five-sixteenths then asked approaching the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in the three path into upper stretch and
weakened. CE CE was urged along while lacking early speed, moved out near the three-quarter-pole, shifted further out while still under urging outside the
half-mile pole, went four then five wide around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and came up empty. LADY ROCKET was allowed to settle off the
pace, passed the half-mile pole under urging, lugged out some under extra left-rein pressure while three then four wide on the turn, paused while having her
path taken at the five-sixteenths, swerved out nearing the quarter-pole and bothered OBLIGATORY then capitulated. BELLA SOFIA disputed the pace on
the inside of an opponent, dropped back nearing the half-mile pole, chased inside to the two path around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
OUTLAW KID broke in at the start bumping ROCKET'S RED GLARE, chased along the inside, angled three wide for home set down for the drive, rallied to
take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. ROCKET'S RED GLARE bumped at the start by the aforementioned
foe, chased along the inside getting let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch just behind JAVA BUZZ, tucked to the hedge a furlong from home
when UPPER LEVEL backed away and ran on inside to secure the place honors. JAVA BUZZ coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside
in the two path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, dug in
under threat from flanking challengers inside the eighth pole and yielded near the sixteenth marker, then weakened in the late stages while just preserving
the show honors. LUPO'S LEGACY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide for home, offered up a bid a furlong out,
then weakened in the late stages. CHUCKA MOON chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
improved position to the finish. MATT DOYLE coaxed from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. STEADY ON coaxed from the
gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. BE THERE got bumped at the
start by SUPER QUALITY, who broke inwards, chased four then three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, made
no impact. UPPER LEVEL coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure to the outside through swift splits, cut the corner
into upper stretch and yielded the front straightened away, then got eased home to the finish. SUPER QUALITY broke in at the start bumping BE THERE,
chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, tired. BROADWAY JIMMY coaxed from the gate, chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths and trailed throughout.
