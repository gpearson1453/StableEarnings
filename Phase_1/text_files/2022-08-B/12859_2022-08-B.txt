throughout and just missed in a game try. AMORE MOON stalked the duel four wide and was one-paced through the lane. UNCAPTURED GRACE went
evenly while racing two wide. WHAT KNOT bumped with MARIMBA at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and lacked a
closing bid. MARIMBA bumped with WHAT KNOT at the start, raced five wide and never threatened. HER GREATNESS played no factor while racing four
wide. RAIN OF BLESSING had only brief speed inside. SHOW ME LOVE was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
PIYPA DE LYNDA stalked the pace four wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the far turn, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and held
firm between rivals late. FEDERAL EXCHANGE stalked the pace three wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside. DESERT RULER
vied inside down the backstretch, put away the pace rival near the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out under left-handed urging in the lane, was collared leaving
the eighth pole and fought on inside of the winner. HEY PORTER settled off the pace outside, raced four wide around the turn, shifted five wide in upper
stretch and could only gain mildly. THE TWINS SNEAKERS saved ground well back and rallied belatedly along the rail. SUMMER ASH dueled two wide
and tired in the lane. EUPHORIA STAR saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
EPIC RUN settled off the runaway pacesetter while racing between foes down the backstretch, cruised up to the lead in the three path leaving the
three-eighths pole, quickly cleared, drifted out badly under left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out under right-handed pressure and held clear.
TWELVE O'CLOCK was devoid of speed despite some early urging, edged closer four wide around the turn then rallied through the lane to be clearly
second best. MILLENNIUM CONDO raced off the early pace, advanced two wide around the turn, bid inside of the winner nearing the head of the lane,
continued on the left lead and weakened. WATCH FOR THE LUTE hit the starting gate, raced three wide and never threatened. SALTY BIRD sped to the
front, set the pace along the rail and retreated after five furlongs. STORM STRIKE chased the pace three and four wide and was through after a half. DEN
STREET chased the pace inside and wilted in the lane. HIDDEN TRUTH was through early and was eased.

Footnotes
TWELVE VOLT MAN settled in range while racing two wide, angled five wide entering the far turn, advanced outside, angled into the three path nearing the
quarter pole, turned for home on near even terms, dueled outside of CHOCOLATE BAR through the lane and edged ahead late. CHOCOLATE BAR stalked
the pace from the rail, split rivals three wide near the three-eighths pole, took the lead nearing the five-sixteenths marker, fought on inside of the winner
through the lane and gave way grudgingly. I'M A G SIX was forced out at the start, was pulling five wide through the opening half, bid four wide around the
far turn, could not quite keep pace with the top two nearing the stretch but stayed on outside to save the show. NOBLE DRAMA was devoid of speed in the
two path, went four wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly outside. CATTIN set the pace two wide around the first turn and along the rail around the
far turn then tired nearing the stretch. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK saved ground off the early pace, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened.
UNIVERSAL PAYDAY hit the starting gate and was outrun while racing three and four wide. LAUGHING BOY pressed the pace three wide and faltered
around the far turn. SIR OLLIE broke outwardly, chased the pace four wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
DIVINE ENCOUNTER vied inside down the backstretch, stalked inside around the turn, tipped three wide turning for home, took over near the sixteenth
pole and just held off the runner-up's late charge up the rail. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER had early speed between foes, steadied entering the turn, chased two
wide around the bend, waited for room leaving the quarter pole, angled to the rail in upper stretch, closed gamely inside of foes and just missed. BULLET
ON TAP set the pace two wide, led to the sixteenth pole and yielded to challenges on both sides. BALI MOON raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide
in upper stretch and had a mild rally. AVE FENIX chased the pace five wide and lacked the needed rally. REACHING STRIDE was outrun inside. SPICE IN
YUH LIFE had speed four wide between foes and faded in the lane. YELOMA broke awkwardly, pressed the pace three wide and came up empty in the
lane.
