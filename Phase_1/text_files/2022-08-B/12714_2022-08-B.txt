Footnotes
FEARLESS ANGEL rated kindly in the early stages sitting of the pace, took the six path turning for home to easily take command mid stretch and when
asked drew away comfortably in the end. DOLCE SOPRESA took command soon after the break, was hounded on the front end by an outside runner
through the turn, put away that rival at the top of the stretch, beared down to battle outside challenges in mid stretch and gave way with an eighth to go to
the winner while holding second. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB settled early near the rear, angled out widest turning for home in the seven path for a clear run
and closed belatedly in the final part to get up for third money at the finish. LAST CALL bore out on the start, was headstrong going into the turn to contend
just behind the frontrunners, bid for the lead with a quarter to go between rivals and battled briefly fading late to lose third in a photo at the wire. OUR
LIBERTY BELLE broke sharp, tracked in the second flight inside throughout the turn, roused turning for home losing her path with three sixteenths to go and
levelled out at the furlong marker. FAST'N SEXY tracked just behind the pace on the fence early, lost a few positions inside through the turn and ran evenly
inside through the lane. ALL FOR HONOR broke slowly at the start to trail, angled out to the five path at the quarter pole, drifted in while urged left handed
and was not a presence late. STOLEN was pushed out by an inside rival at the break to be near the back early, ridden at the top of the lane and could not
get involved in the late stages. STROKES (IRE) pressed the early pace just outside, held a brief lead entering the stretch between runners, faltered with a
quarter to run and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
BIG BAND LUZZIANN stalked the leader into the first turn racing two wide, allowed that one to go clear, advanced into the far turn, took over past the
five-sixteenths, kicked clear and was eased up late when safely in front. ENDORPHIN RUSH settled off the leader racing near inside mostly two to three
wide, could make no headway on the winner but held the place. GABBY SQUARED was toward the rear two to three wide into the first turn, raced between
runners up the backstretch, had room between past the quarter pole, kicked on too late for place but finished with good energy. TRISH THE DISH switched
outside runners early racing three to four wide on the first turn, continued four to five wide on the far turn and showed late interest in the stretch. WICKED
MIAH shifted in entering the first turn saving ground inside at the rear, came out three wide at the top of the stretch and ran on. SPARKLE SAMMY moved
forward and shifted in once clear to dictate terms through the first turn, extended the margin early up the backstretch to be well clear, began to weaken on
the far turn and continued to drop back through the stretch. BELLA NINA saved ground to no avail despite some encouragement three furlongs from home.
IMA DAREDEVIL was mid-pack two to three wide, asked for more outside the five-sixteenths, tired and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
COURTLY RO tracked just behind the dueling frontrunners between horses through the turn, angled off the pace in the four path to rally in upper stretch and
wore down her competition just before the finish. STAR CANDY tracked three wide on the turn, engaged the leader with a quarter to run, put away the
inside runner after battling through mid stretch and could not hold off the fresh closer outside nearing the wire. KANTBACKOFF pressed the pace just
outside early, took command briefly midway on the turn, battled with an outside runner in upper stretch and faded on the rail late holding third money.
TITO'S CALLING rated mid pack between horses through the turn, angled to the five path at the top of the stretch and showed some interest late to get up
for a minor share. MISCHIEF LILY rated inside through the turn just behind the pacesetters, attempted to angle out off a tiring frontrunner nearing the
quarter pole, was steadied and ran evenly afterwards. MRS. C hopped at the start to trail, roused at the top of the lane and passed tiring runners. DIOSA
CATRINA tried to advance around rivals running four or five wide throughout the turn and came up empty for the drive. MERITAMEN took command on the
rail, was headed outside at the three furlong marker and retreated on the fence through the stretch. RUSHING THE SKY was steadied briefly entering the
far turn and stopped with three eighths to go to be a non factor. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 MISCHIEF LILLY ON #6 COURTLY RO NEARING THE

Footnotes
VEERY set a pressured pace inside, drew clear in upper stretch under urging, was kept to the task. CLEOMENES settled inside well off the lead, swung
seven wide into upper stretch, ran on to gain the place. OHEAVENS tracked inside on or just off the rail into and on the turn advancing inside a tiring rival
late on that bend then coming out a bit in upper stretch, was along for show. UMNEYAAT raced off the pace inside, saved ground and ran on evenly.
BLAZING SKY raced mid-pack two to three wide between runners, came into upper stretch four wide, ran on. KERICS BEAUTY settled mid-pack three to
four wide, was between runners on the turn, came into upper stretch five wide, was never a real threat. ARTFUL BALLERINA broke awkwardly and brushed
a foe soon after, shifted in moving up in behind rivals off the fence, moved out to race four to five wide on the turn coming six deep into upper stretch, failed
to rally. CEDAR VALLEY was away slowly, switched outside a rival, fanned eight wide into the stretch, was unable to threaten. VERI UNIFIED moved
forward under some coaxing to press the eventual winner, gave way past the quarter pole and faded. HALO STYLE was brushed at the break, raced a bit
erratic without any early speed, had no response despite encouragement.

Footnotes
ANCIENT SPIRIT hounded the pacesetter in the beginning, took control two furlongs out, opened up quickly in upper stretch and was kept to the task to win
comfortably at the finish. HOT CARGO started her rally up the rail going into the turn, angled just off the fence with a quarter to go for a clear run in upper
stretch and ran on well turning for home but could not offer a threat to her stablemate for the win. CANADIANSWEETHEART broke in at the start, was
roused around horses through the turn, steadied briefly in upper stretch and finished up well to get up for third at the wire. JUNGLE TIGRESS tracked just
behind the frontrunners three wide on the turn, was ridden to go after the leaders entering the stretch and could not advance on the top two but showed
some grit to the wire to get up for a minor award. CHROME'S ANGEL saved ground while coaxed through the turn and had no finish for the drive to the
wire. SOUPER SUNDAY broke sharp to lead early, was collared outside with a quarter to run and faltered inside fading on the fence through the lane.
READY TO ORBIT was outrun early down the backside and could not recover to get into contention. CELTIC REVIVAL broke inwards hitting the gate at the
start, could not keep up with the field through the turn and faltered down the lane.

Footnotes
CAIRO CONSORT broke outwardly, settled off the pace about mid-pack two wide, came out a path turning for home then moved back inside a rival at the
three-sixteenths, bid at the furlong marker, drew clear under steady handling. ADORA settled off the pace four wide into the turn, tipped out seven wide
turning into upper stretch, rallied late to get up for second. COLLECTING FLATTER pressed the pace from between runners two to three wide on the turn,
came into upper stretch four deep, battled outside a rival in upper to mid-stretch, put a short head in front of that one but was outkicked by another for
second. GRAND OAK (IRE) was coaxed forward to set the pace, saved ground on the turn, encouraged a bit at the five-sixteenths, came out a little into
upper stretch then a bit further later on, was outkicked but kept on well under strong urging. WICKENHEISER settled off the pace, went three to four wide on
the turn, edged closer fanning eight wide into upper stretch, ran on. HELLUVA HOLIDAY was up close three wide and between foes early, dropped back
some on the turn, came out at the eighth pole for room and kept on evenly late. HAPPY VALENTINE was forwardly-placed racing close off and outside the
leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, flattened out in late stretch. RANTING shifted in racing two to three wide and in behind runners, was never near
enough to threaten. ALTERNATE ROCK was encouraged forward a bit early, raced mid-pack outside going five wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch.
WORLDLY BEAUTY broke awkwardly and was in a bit tight, outpaced early racing inside, angled six wide into the stretch then came out a bit further, was
never a threat. CAHIRA'S BLESSING tracked off the leaders inside, was reasonably close up on the far turn, faded in the stretch. A NITE IN CAIRO was
ridden along racing off the inside, had no response and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
PEACE SEEKER rated kindly between horses mid field in the first part, got to the outside of runners at the quarter pole and rallied in the five path upper
stretch finding her best stride the last sixteenth to get up for the victory. ROSEBUD'S HOPE took command soon after the start, was well rationed at the
half, repelled a brief bid in the far turn, opened up in upper stretch and was caught just before the wire. SARATOGA VISION was in contention tracking
runners three wide entering the far turn, rallied turning for home four wide while angling to the rail in mid stretch and finished up well to be a close third at the
wire. YOUENS advanced up the rail to take closer order to the leaders with three eighths to run, angled outside off tiring runners at the top of the lane, found
a seam with a furlong to go and was hard ridden to the wire to get a small piece. SWEET SERENADE tracked the early pace on the rail down the
backstretch, sat behind the frontrunners through the far turn, had a clear path to offer a fence rally turning for home and stalled the final eighth.
PREFERRED GUEST chased the pace early on, challenged for the lead mid point on the far turn, was repelled turning for home and faded between runners
through the stretch. ANN OF CLEVES was void off early speed to start, settled at the rear down the backside and could not close on the leaders down the
lane. YA BEAUTY (GB) was rated near the rear going three wide into the first turn, roused into the far turn, offered little response and was not persevered
with in the late stages.

for room and got up late five wide and between runners. SMOKE LIGHTENING pressed the early pace briefly, dropped back two wide early on the turn,
switched out at the three-eighths pole, came into upper stretch seven wide and came again to get up for place. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE raced mid-pack
three to four wide on the turn while settled, came out six wide in upper stretch, ran on well but was outfinished for second. CHISELER brushed a rival at the
start, took closer order three to four wide on the turn, kept on late but needed more. NINETYFOUR EXPOS pressed the pace outside three wide, engaged
the leader at the quarter pole, dueled and came in a bit past the three-sixteenths brushing a rival, took a narrow lead, maintained it till late but was
outkicked. BATTLE STRIKE raced up close along the inside, came out three wide nearing the furlong marker, ran on evenly. POULIN IN O T set the pace
inside facing some pressure, dueled through upper stretch, was brushed past the three-sixteenths, yielded inside the final furlong. ONE FOR CHAP settled
off the leaders racing inside on or just off the rail, ran evenly and made no bid. CAMINO DE SANTIAGO was brushed lightly at the start, toward the back

Footnotes
LUCKMAN was allowed to settle at the rear early on, began to pick up horses three furlongs out splitting runners on the turn, angled out to be three wide for
the drive and rallied past dueling leaders with a sixteenth to go. ROCKET JOE COPPER sat nicely behind the pacesetter on the rail with a half mile to run,
was asked to go after the leader two furlongs out, led briefly between runners with an eighth to go and could not hold off the winner in the last few strides.
MALIBU EDGE took the lead soon after the start, was well rationed through the half, opened up with a quarter to go only to be headed at the furlong marker
and could not find enough late to hold off the closers at the finish. SHANGASSAH was asked to keep up with the frontrunners entering the far turn, was
relegated to trail with five sixteenths to go and found some more energy down to the finish passing tiring rivals outside late. LESLIE CHOW tracked outside
runners in good position down the backside, offered a mild rally three wide through the turn, stalled in upper stretch and faded late. EMBRACE MY UNCLE
chased the leader through the backstretch, began to weaken between rivals midway on the turn and retreated inside horses down the lane. H C HOLIDAY
settled at the rear with a half mile to go, was ridden hard on the rail through the turn, could not advance and was not a factor in the stretch.
