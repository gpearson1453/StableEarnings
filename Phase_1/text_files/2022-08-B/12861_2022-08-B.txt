MUCHO VELOCE tracked the top pair early, made a quick move near the half mile pole to take a narrow lead, dug in late and prevailed under strong
pressure. JAMBI was allowed to settle early off the early going, made an advance through the far turn, swung five to six wide into the upper stretch and
finished gamely to just miss. MY BOY SAM chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch through the far turn, shifted five wide through the stretch
run and kept on to the wire. CONFESS pressed the pace from the outside and weakened through the stretch run. TOP HAT CAT showed good early speed
to set the early pace, was confronted early on to race between rivals just past the half mile pole and tired readily the final furlong.
