the early speed, made a two wide bid going into the turn and closed well. QUEEN OF THE ICE tracked the leaders from the three path but wasn't able to
gain on the leaders. PUT A BLING ON IT raced in the middle of the pack in the three path but was never a serious threat. LA CAPRICHOSA saved ground

SHASTAWIN broke well and went to the lead to set all the pace, steadily increased margin and drew off in the stretch. BRING THE POSSE was rushed to
contention from the two path and proved second best. MS BUMBLEBEE raced near the back from the two path down the backstretch made a two to three
wide bid through the turn, went between horses in upper stretch to be up for the show. IMA HOT TOTTIE was last away made a three wide bid and faltered.
A C'S OLIVIA ROSE saved ground but was not a factor. MIDNIGHT GHOST had a wide trip. FLYING LADY showed little.
