Footnotes
VACCINA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the second turn, then drew off and was kept to the task. MOTITO
unhurried in the early going, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted out and closed willingly. GEARED UP
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled three and four wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. CEREAL I D stalked the pace on
the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, then faded in the lane. TUDOX I DON'T BRAG was no factor, inside.

SHOMETHESISTERS set the pace off the rail rating, held sway with reserve, then held a rival off in the final yards under steady pressure. SHES A THREAT
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. SIDE ACTION
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out. BAROLA hopped at the start, looped up
three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and got up for a share. IOVA well placed, gained position three wide through the
second turn, then had no stretch rally. CALL TONY steadied into the fist turn, was well placed and between, then faded after half. COUPLE OF NIKKIS
stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the second turn.

slowly from gate, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and closed well for the show. FALK unhurried early, gained position three and
four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and flattened out. WILLIE WANDO passed tiring rivals. TANGO MIKE vied for the early lead on the
outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then angled in into the stretch and faded. CITY TRIPPER well placed and outside, held position
three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then drifted in and faded.

PATRIOT DRIVE mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in slightly, edged up for the place
and held. D'CRAZINESS rated close up, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and
held the show. CHIC N WILBUR allowed to settle, looped four wide through the second turn, angled widest into the lane and passed tiring rivals for a share.
JEN'S SONG mid pack and inside, dropped back into the second turn, came through inside into the stretch and improved his position. ORAZIO pulled to

outside, held position four wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
DRIFTWOOD sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held a clear margin the furlong marker and held under steady pressure. ALABAMA SLAMMER
well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. COOL COMEDIAN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and closed well for the show.
SURF AND TURF allowed to settle, angled widest into the stretch and improved his position. INDIAN FEVER bumped at the start, moved up inside through
the second turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then shortened stride and weakened. WOODCHUCK bumped at the start, led early,
was rated back inside, angled out to gain a striking position and faded into the stretch.
