far back, finished with good courage two wide. LAUTREC failed to menace. FALCONS FURY stalked the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened.

handed whip brushing with BIG TRIP near the furlong marker and edged clear under strong handling. SPINSTER ROAD stalked the pace two wide into the
stretch, rallied late in the four path and got up for second. BIG TRIP away alertly, set the early pace along the rail, dug in when headed by the winner,
matched strides into the stretch, was brushed near the furlong marker, altered course to the three path then was outfinished. GOLDEN READY never far
back, improved along the rail into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. COTTON JIM close up three wide, steadied between horses entering the turn
then faded. BIG GAME BOB trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION,
