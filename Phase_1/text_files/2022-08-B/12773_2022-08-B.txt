Footnotes
PERMANENTDETENTION moved up along the inside to take control before a furlong, clear into the turn, extended that advantage while off the inside into
and through upper stretch, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. JOSAN void of speed along the inside early, moved around a tiring rival in the two
path midturn, dropped back to the inside late in the bend and rallied willingly up the rail under brisk handling to be getting to the winner late, clearly second
best. GRAY DANE within striking distance up the backstretch outside, three wide through the turn while still in a forward position, lacked a closing punch
through the lane to finish up best of the rest. COLE'S SENSATION last away, raced back off the pace in some traffic, three wide turning for home, went
evenly to the wire to also be lacking a closing punch. OLDER AND WISER pressed the winner from the two path for a half, had little left for the stretch run.
KATS PICK broke sharp, fell back three wide and failed to make an impact through the stretch. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER in mid pack early, was finished
before a half, trailed home well back.

Footnotes
WHY JOEY WHY showed the way out of the chute from between rivals, set the pace up the backstretch and into the turn along the inside, shook off a bid
from SUCH turning for home, drew out through the lane while kept to pressure. HUMPHREY well back off the pace in trailing early, four wide through the
turn when advancing, continued to rally down the middle of the strip to be up for the place, not a threat to the winner. SUCH forwardly placed off the inside,
challenged the winner briefly from the two path entering the stretch, proved no match in the run to the wire, caught late for the second spot. OUTLAW X. in
mid pack out of the chute and up the backstretch, moved closer three wide in the turn, lacked a further advance stretch in finishing up evenly. QUANA
DUDE broke back, saved ground and improved a bit into the lane, not dangerous in also lacking a closing punch. COMBAT COMMAND pressured the
winner early from along the inside, was finished before a half. DARREN'S FORTUNE had nothing for the drive. SOUTHPINE GIFT remained back to be
always outrun.

Footnotes
VIVA EL CAPITAN broke with the field, lodged an early move to clear from the outside, brief breather through the turn then drew off through the lane to win
ridden out. JUST A WIN in mid pack early, roused in the two path entering the stretch, rallied and kicked well clear of the others, no threat to the winner. IN
FOR A PENNY in the second flight while racing toward the inside, two path exiting the turn, dropped to the rail and staged a mild rally to be up late for the
show. BITSY C C LIL GIRL chased the winner while well off the inside, three wide into the stretch, remained closest to that same rival with a furlong to run,
weakened late to lose a couple of positions. GLADS LOVE CAT lacked speed outside, was five wide out of the turn, improved position a bit by picking off a
few tiring rivals. SISTER CHLOE last to leave, raced four wide and between horses into the lane, never a serious threat. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL in the
second group early inside, shuffled back a bit into the turn, continued to lose position while along the inside through the bend. TEXAS PROMO GIRL in
traffic when steadied with a half mile remaining, moved outside, faded stretch, returned bleeding from both nostrils, vanned off.

Footnotes
CRAFTY PRINCESS void of speed, began to advance midway on the turn toward the inside, two path for the drive, dropped to the rail with a sixteenth
remaining and showed good resolve to be up in time. MO BELLA broke alertly, narrowly set the pace toward the inside, continued to show the way into the
lane toward the inside, turned back a couple of rivals past the furlong marker maintain control only to be caught in the final strides. FUHR MEO back off the
early leaders, moved closer in the turn, three wide into the lane, challenged between rivals past the furlong marker, outkicked to the wire. LAST DESTINY in
mid pack early outside, advanced into contention four wide through the turn, challenged on the outside past midstretch, not enough in the late going.
ABIGAIL G in the second flight off the inside, four wide into the lane, in traffic while within striking distance late, finished up evenly toward the inside when
clear in the waning strides. AUNT JANA off slowlyf to race well back, advanced five wide into the lane, continued to improve position to the wire. TIME TO
SLEEP raced back off the pace and the inside, came five wide for the drive, lacked a closing kick. SANDY'S WAGER off the pace, closer along the inside
past the furlong marker, in tight along rail a sixteenth out, was going evenly at the wire. GRACE'S GAL off slowly, trailed much of the way, passed tiring
rivals while never a threat. AUDACIOUS GIRL within striking distance out in the strip, gave way from between foes into the stretch. BLUE RIDGE
ROMANCE chased the runner up for a half and stopped. DAVE'S RONDA broke back, was used to move up through the run up the chute, shied onto the
main track, gave way early in the turn, continued to fade stretch and trailed home. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CHROME SAVAGE last to leave, settled back off the early pace while saving ground early first turn moved outside, launched a four wide move into
contention second turn, bid, took over, strongly clear. SUDDEN IMPULSE in mid pack early, moved closer along the inside the middle half, continued inside
through the stretch and narrowly gained the second spot while no match for the winner. CZAR'S BALLERINA devoid of any early speed, continued to race
well back in the run up the backstretch, strong move four wide behind the winner late in the final turn, flattened out a bit in the late going to miss the place.
DEVASTATING BEAUTY sprinted clear to show the way through the first turn, dueled late backsatretch, disposed of that rival to be clear again midway on
the final turn, offered little resistance to the winner nearing the furlong marker, faltrered when headed. TRINITY HOPE broke back, lacked speed, improved
along the inside turning for home, went flat late to finish up evenly. CAJUN TWO STEP closest to the early leader, began a steady retreat after a half.
GLORY TO ME broke well, shuffled back in some traffic into the first turn, continued back the middle half, swung four out to five wide into the lane, picked
off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE in mid pack off the inside, four wide out of the final turn, tired. VANCOUVER
SNOW forwardly placed after breaking best of all, dueled briefly off the inside late backstretch, gave way final turn. ARCTIC GUITAR in the second flight for
five furlongs outside, stopped, far back, jogged in. CUSTOM MADE gave way after a half, eased into the stretch, returned bleeding, vanned off.

Footnotes
QUARTER RAT forwardly placed along the inside in the run up the backstretch, fell back a bit despite being called on for run early turn, angled out four wide
entering the stretch, challenged outside the leaders past the furlong marker and kicked clear under continued steady handling. DIXIE STAR in the second
group off the inside, challenged three wide midway on the turn, gained a slight advantage inside the winner and between horses with a furlong to run, could
not match the winner to the wire, held sway for the place. WOODS N WATER back off the pace and the inside, three wide into the stretch, shifted out a bit
inside the furong marker, slowly getting to the runner up late. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS broke mid pack, set or forced pace off the inside, vied between
horses into and through upper stretch, weakened in the late going. EASY RUNNER took control after an alert break, vied closest to the inside into the
stretch of the first flight and then began to falter. HOLIDAY DIAMOND lacked early foot, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. FLASHY
PREMO fell back to trail, showed little to be always outrun.

Footnotes
REECE'S PRIORITY broke sharp, hustled away to be soon clear, was given a bit of a breather through the turn, maintained daylight through the stretch
under firm handling. YES BAB broke back, lacked any early foot, began to move along the inside early turn, two path into the lane, shifted out a bit furlong
when rallying with less than a furlong remaining and continued willingly to the end to be clear for the place. WAR SONG within striking distance, moved
closer three wide turning for home, chased the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT in mid pack outside, turned in
and even effort while racing four wide. FLUFFPOINT forwardly placed off the inside, chased the winner through the turn, weakened in the drive. HOSTILE
AFLEET last to leave, trailed early, floated out six wide turning for home, passed some tiring rivals while not a serious threat well out in the strip.
ENCHANTED MOON closest to the winner in the run up the backstretch, began to back up through the turn. MAKATI PHIL in mid pack early, had little left
for the drive. BLACK JUSTICE finished early while getting out turning for home, trailed to the wire.
