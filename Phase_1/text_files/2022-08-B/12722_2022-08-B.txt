BRADY BOY set the early pace on the inside, then turned back a bid leaving the five sixteenths and then drifted off the inside leaving the turn, then drew
clear by the furlong marker and was ridden out to prove best. TRUMPED was off slowly, then chased the pace from the inside, then checked around the
three eighths marker, then recovered and was coaxed along, swung out four wide leaving the turn and finished well. BLAZEN GRAZEN chased the pace
and was three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and was up for the show award. POVERTY BAY stalked the pace three wide, made a three
wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive, lost show award late. HERMISTON was settled early and four to five wide and stopped. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THIS RACE BUT AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS.

Footnotes
MOSQUITO FLEET was rated between rivals at the half mile marker, then was coaxed along on the turn and eased out to make a four wide bid leaving the
turn, edged away late to prove best under a mild drive. NATIONHEART stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command,
then gained a short lead leaving the turn but could not match strides with winner late while running on to be clearly second best. NEW EVERY MORNING
was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while clear, then was headed by the quarter pole and faded the final furlong. IRISH KNIGHT bobbled at the
start, reserved early, then started to unwind on the turn while saving ground, angled out in the lane and had a late rally. LASTBESTHOPE was allowed to
settle early while four wide, then was three to four wide on the turn and had no rally. OXBOW PARK chased the early pace on the inside, then came five
wide into the lane and was empty. STARZAN was settled and was four to three wide on the turn and weakened. DIAMOND WILLOW chased the pace three
wide and stopped.

Footnotes
YOUONLYLIVETWICE was well rated early, made a five wide bid leaving the turn and drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under mild urging.
SUMMER PUDDING was slammed at the start, tracked the pace, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, gained a short lead but could not go with
the winner in the final furlong, second best. ASK THE KING was outrun early, then was getting out on the turn and was five wide by the quarter pole, shifted
in and found best stride late through the lane. MIA CASA chased the pace and was three to four wide on the turn, swung out six wide for the drive and had
no kick. R HAPPY PLACE dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the lane. MAGIC GEMSTAR was reserved early, was six wide by the quarter
pole and not a threat. COASTAL QUEEN dueled for the lead three wide and stopped leaving the furlong marker, eased to the wire.
