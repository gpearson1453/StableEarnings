SPEEDY TOM set the pace in hand to the stretch then was given a light tap in mid stretch and was a facile winner. PIVOTAL FEVER chased the winner
from the rail to the stretch then was never a threat to that one and just saved the place. MR MEMPHIS checked off heels early then lugged out on the first
turn, raced two wide to the stretch then drifted out in the drive and just missed second. KEEN JAMES had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but never
was a factor. SONORA SERMON had no speed and saved ground to no avail.

GEE STREET had no speed and trailed, advanced three eighths from the line, was two wide to the stretch then rallied, split foes and surged to the front late.
WICKED SUNSET was well placed off the pace to the second turn, rallied inside to the stretch, inched clear from MORNING BLURS but was nailed by the
winner. MORNING BLURS set the pace while two wide, responded to resist WICKED SUNSET to mid stretch then was outkicked. GEMMA ROYAL never
far back for three eighths, was roused three deep on the second turn but lacked the needed late response. RACHEL'S LADY ducked out at the start then
was corrected and hustled up to engage the leaders, pressed the pace four wide, got oukicked into the second turn and weakened in the drive.

MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY had good speed, eased away into the second turn then drew clear in hand. DON'T TELL HYDEE had no speed, was asked three
wide on the second turn and closed willingly late without threatening the winner. PHANTOMS BOOK attended the pace early, pressed the winner to the
stretch then could not offer a late response. SWEET MEG broke slow, trailed to the second turn then saved ground but was never a threat. ELECTRIC
ELIZABETA was a pace factor early, raced two wide but gave way after three eighths. ZU ZU FLYNN was bumped and forced out on the first turn, saved
ground but was outrun. CHIQUITA PIQUITA tracked the pace for three eighths then was outkicked and gave way. WETHERLY bore out badly on the first
turn and lost any chance.
