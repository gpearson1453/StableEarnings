Footnotes
HOUSEBUILDER tracked the leader from the start, kept close range to the frontrunner through the turn, pounced to battle for the lead in upper stretch and
began to wear down that rival late drawing away at the end. SMART COVERAGE was away alertly to lead soon after the break, continued to hold off the
tracking winner through the turn, was headed in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly a furlong out finishing a clear second. NATURAL ENERGY
advanced nicely up the rail through the turn, shot up the fence in upper stretch to finish well to be a non threatening third. RIVER OF BABYLON angled out
turning for home widest, lost path in upper stretch and angled inside between runners to show some late interest to get up for a minor part. GUNS N'
ROJAS rated mid pack between runners down the backside, was ridden between rivals through the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and lost the battle for a
minor share at the wire. KINETIC STONE tracked the top two pacesetters through the early stages, roused turning for home to challenge the frontrunners
and offered little response fading in the final eighth. GREEN AMAZON was off a bit slow, offered a mild run around runners mid point on the turn to contend
for the minors but weakened mid stretch. CATRIN steadied mildly in the backstretch to trail early, angled off the fence into the turn and could not get
involved turning for home.

Footnotes
WHIMSICAL DANCE settled off the pace, advanced four to five wide on the turn while asked a bit three furlongs out, took the lead near the quarter pole,
lugged in while clear, extended the advantage and was geared down late. CAPPY advanced early from between runners three wide, came out six wide at
the quarter pole, gained the place. CURLIN CANDY had the early lead then ceded to an inside foe while content to press two to three wide, bid briefly lead
briefly at the top of the stretch, had no extra. SECRETARYOFTHENILE was coaxed forward inside to take the lead, set the pace facing outside pressure,
was overtaken near the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. GREY SOCIETY raced off the inside toward the rear two to three wide on the turn, came out
five wide at the top of the stretch, kept on mildly. INDY CHAMPAGNE raced mid-pack three to four wide between runners, dropped back turning for home,
angled seven wide in upper stretch and ran on. MEDAGLIA MO raced mid-pack inside foes on or just off the rail, went evenly and made no bid. NOW IS A
BREEZE tracked up close inside heading to the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch and faded. TURF AND SURF settled outside, advanced four wide past
the half to reach striking distance, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
HAZELBROOK was bumped slightly at the start, tracked the top two frontrunners outside down the backside, advanced just outside on the turn closing the
gap between her and the leaders, collared the pacesetters at the top of the stretch and fought on gamely outside down the lane to be inching away late at
the finish. BEYOND MYBUDGET broke outwards on the start, hounded the pacesetter through the backstretch, continued to keep close range to the leader
on the turn, made a bid for the lead with a quarter out between rivals and fought on stubbornly mid stretch only to give way to the winner inside the sixteenth
pole. GOLDEN VISION was allowed to settle at the back in the beginning, trailed through the turn, angled out in the four path turning for home and closed
well showing good energy late getting up for third and just missing out for second money. HARD EDGE took command early, was collared on the rail by
outside runners with a quarter to go, battled on through mid stretch and stalled late losing third money at the finish line. AMALFI COAST tracked inside in
the second flight down the backside, roused on the fence in upper stretch to go after the battling threesome on the lead and could not find enough through
the stretch to challenge at the wire. LA LIBERTEE rated near the back in the early stages of the race, was ridden hard to get into contention through the
turn, no response was given and offered little for the run to the wire.

Footnotes
GASTON tracked along the inside, came out three wide at the top of the stretch, bid between runners taking command nearing the furlong marker, edged
clear under steady handling. GUARD OF HONOUR stalked two to three wide through the turn, bid four wide at the top of the stretch, was all out but no
match for the winner. MR NOBILITY broke a half step slowly, advanced inside early, angled five wide turning for home, drew even with the leaders about the
three-sixteenths making a bid but could not sustain the effort. COLONEL MUSTARD moved clear willingly early, dictated terms racing near the inside, came
out a bit turning for home, was collared in upper stretch and weakened. OPUS NORTH was lightly brushed at the start, settled inside, advanced between
rivals at the five-sixteenths, came out four wide in upper stretch and improved inside rivals late. HE'S GOT SOUL was forwardly-placed outside three to four
wide just off the leaders, came into upper stretch five deep, failed to rally. STRONGER TOGETHER raced off the pace early, was encouraged some on the
turn, swung six wide into the stretch, ran on evenly. THE THUNDERER broke outwardly brushing a rival lightly, raced off the pace between runners early,
was encouraged at the half, had no rally. FLAWLESS RULER was between rivals at the rear early, went three to four wide on the turn, was never near
enough to threaten. TRIZMO got away slowly and a bit awkwardly, raced outside at the rear mostly four to six wide, was never a factor.

Footnotes
DERZKII was rationed well on the front end, held a short lead into the far turn with horses inside and outside pressing the issue, opened up turning for home
and was kept to the task in mid stretch having enough left late to hold safe at the wire. CREATE AGAIN was in tight behind runners going into the far turn,
shuffled back to near the back with a quarter to go, weaved his way through traffic in mid stretch to have a clear run and rallied but it was not enough late to
catch the winner. LAPOCHKA stalked between runners mid pack with a half to go, waited through the turn behind horses looking for a seam, roused
between foes with three sixteenths to go and found clear run with an eighth out to close well to just get up for third at the finish. COURTLY MANNER started
to rally from mid pack three wide into the far turn passing runners, was in contention turning for home and faded a bit in deep stretch losing show money in a
photo at the wire. SELFMADE settled near the back in the beginning, was roused on the far turn going five wide to contend in upper stretch and stalled in
the final eighth. SEGUIMI trailed in the early stages, angled out at the top of the stretch in the five path and offered only an even finish to the wire.
MAMBOINTHEFOREST rated early on mid pack between rivals, waited on the far turn behind the pacesetters for the stretch run, offered a mild bid in upper
stretch and levelled out at the furlong marker. FINALIST tracked the leader into the first turn going four wide, continued to keep close range down the
backside, was ridden to keep position through the far turn and faltered between runners mid stretch. BOURBON EXTENSION pressed the leader inside in
the early stages, began to weaken on the rail with three eighths to go, retreated through the turn and stopped through the lane.

BRITISH ARTILLERY was rambunctious and tossed the rider behind the gate, broke on top, settled in to stalk the pacesetter, moved rapidly on that one to
take a narrow lead at the nine-sixteenths, was clear by the top of the stretch, kicked away under steady handling. KAUKOKAIPUU was fractious in the gate
hitting it with got away well then settled in to track off the leaders racing two wide, came out four deep turning for home, was no match for the winner but
clearly second best. FIGHTING IRISH settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out five wide in upper stretch, kicked on and just held show
honors from BABA VOSS, who exchanged light brushing and bobbled in the opening furlong, moved out from three to five wide on the turn racing well back
off the leaders, finished strongly to gain but missed third. SOONER LUNAR moved forward inside to set the pace, was overtaken entering the turn but kept
on till the stretch then weakened. VENTI raced mid-pack two wide, ran on evenly. CURLIN'S GHOST exchanged a light brush early, raced up close into the
turn going four to six wide, weakened in the stretch. HUNGRY WOLF rated inside off the pace, came out in the stretch, was unable to menace.
GLENHOLME brushed a rival at the start, raced outside four to five wide on the turn in the back half of the field, was never near enough to threaten. SING
DIXIE was up close racing outside a rival three then four wide on the turn, altered inside that one at the top of the stretch and faded thereafter. ARNIE P was
brushed at the start, lacked early speed racing off the inside, was never a factor. CHAMBER MUSIC brushed with rivals early, dropped back, tired.

Footnotes
THEREGOESJOJO sat behind the dueling leaders at the half, waited behind horses midway on the turn looking to pounce, found a seam in the two path in
mid stretch to come through with a furlong out and began to inch away late. LION KINGDOM started his run early down the backstretch to contend for the
lead with three eighths to go, put away his co leaders through the far turn to lead in upper stretch, braced for the challenge on both sides in mid stretch and
fought on courageously to the wire just missing the win and still holding second. LIL BIT GANGSTA was roused midway on the far turn to engage the
leader, briefly led at the top of the stretch and could not find enough late to hold off the top two finishers. CANADIAN PHAROAH was left alone upfront early,
was roused inside when headed with a half to go, could not keep up to the closing runners in upper stretch but still showed some finish to get a minor
award. BURNING MAN trailed in the early stages of the race, advanced between foes going into the far turn, was ridden hard to go through horses mid turn
and ran on with some late interest in the stretch to get a small share. JUAN PABLO saved ground throughout, advanced up the rail through the far turn and
could not offer a solid run late to the finish. FROSTED ICING tracked the early pace sitting fourth on the rail, could not keep up with quickening pace at the
half, offered a mild run entering upper stretch and levelled out in the drive. SUNRISE DRIVE settled near the back early on, was roused with three eighths to
go and could not get into contention. TWISTED PATH was close to the pace in the beginning, began to weaken inside into the backstretch and tired to trail
into the far turn. TYCOON was roused early to get a good position from the outside, tracked the leader in the early stages, contended for the lead between
runners with a half to go and retreated quickly through the far turn and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) moved in and forward inside a rival to soon take the lead, set a pressured pace on or just off the rail, came out to the three path
turning into upper stretch, was asked past the quarter pole, kicked clear and received steady handling through the lane. HARLAN ESTATE settled off the
leaders, saved ground on the turn, gained steadily in the stretch but was only second best. HADDASSAH tracked the leading pair inside a rival on or just off
the rail, came out six wide turning for home, kept on evenly. MARCH TO THE ARCH was unhurried early racing off the inside, swung five wide into the
stretch, ran on with mild late interest. TOWN CRUISE broke well and settled in to press the eventual winner two to three wide, weakened in the stretch.
WEYBURN raced outside a rival mid-pack two to three deep through the turn, was floated seven wide into the stretch, failed to rally.

FEV ROVER (IRE) attended the early pace from inside, eased back and switched out coming to the five-and-one-half, took closer order drawing even at the
seven-sixteenths racing two to three wide, dueled to the top of the stretch at which point took a narrow lead but was thereupon engaged by an outside rival,
dueled with that one to the wire and got the nod under strong and steady urging. CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR) settled off the leaders about mid-pack, switched
outside a rival three wide into the turn, advanced while swinging six deep turning for home, engaged the leader in upper stretch while drifting in, dueled with
that one under stout encouragement but just missed. FLIRTING BRIDGE (IRE) was allowed to settle just off the leading pair, went two to three wide into the
turn, gained in the very late stages to close the gap and galloped out strongly. BELLAGAMBA (ARG) was unhurried early, went two to three wide on the
turn, came out four to five wide for the stretch run, improved position between runners for the minor award with some late interest. BARKIN broke a half-step
slowly and lacked significant early speed, raced inside on or just off the rail, angled six wide into the stretch, kept on evenly. MUNNYFOR RO saved ground
inside to the stretch, came out and ran on evenly. KEYFLOWER (FR) settled off the pace going three to four wide on the turn, swung seven deep into upper
stretch, failed to rally. ANGELOU moved forward to set the pace shifting in, raced on or just off the rail, was engaged by the seven-sixteenths, dueled to the
top of the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
MOIRA was allowed to settle while shifting in soon after the start, raced two to three wide through the first turn in the back half of the field, advanced into the
far turn after tipping out four wide about the seven-sixteenths, thereupon picked up the pace and with quick turn of foot swept to the lead outside rivals about
five wide by the three-sixteenths, kicked clear under urging and was taken in hand seventy yards from home in a dominant performance that set a new track
record. HALL OF DREAMS settled well back along the inside, continued to save ground on the far turn while advancing inside a rival, shifted seven wide
coming out of that bend, gained the place to be clearly second best but no threat to the winner. SIR FOR SURE was forwardly-positioned stalking the
leaders three wide, lost some position while floating five wide into upper stretch after three deep on the far turn, kept on well late though to get up for show.
IRONSTONE was forced in a bit at the start, tracked from inside, switched out heading up the backstretch, moved to challenge at the quarter pole, was
carried four deep into upper stretch, had no extra late. DANCIN IN DA'NILE was blocked and forced to ration speed in behind rivals heading to the first turn
racing three wide, was still well back on the far turn swinging five wide out of that bend, moved out a bit further in mid-stretch and ran on with good late
energy. RONDURE rated mid-pack two wide and between runners, came out four deep at the top of the stretch, lacked any late kick. HUNT MASTER was
caught three wide early racing in the back half of the field, shifted in a bit on the far turn, passed tiring foes in the stretch. DUKE OF LOVE broke awkwardly
then was coaxed forward while shifting in racing about mid-pack into the first turn, saved ground on that bend and the next, came out a little in mid-stretch,
had no late kick. THE MINKSTER broke inwardly and moved forward and clear to set the pace racing about in the two path, was challenged late on the far
turn, gave way in the stretch. CAUSIN' MAYHEM was forced four wide on the first turn racing outside and mid-division, was still close up to the leaders three
deep on the far turn, weakened thereafter. SHAMATEUR was forced in at the break then urged but lacked early speed, raced mostly two to three wide and
was never a threat.

Footnotes
I HAVE AN IDEA settled behind the pacesetters with a half to run, waited patiently on the rail through the turn for running room, shot through on the fence
mid stretch and accelerated well in the sixteenth to get up at the wire. FEW REGRETS started her run mid point on the turn only to be taken up momentarily
turning for home to go around a faltering rival, rallied well in the seven path to get its nose in front in mid stretch and ran on well to the finish hold safe for
second money. LIVIN ON LUV settled in the second flight between horses just off the frontrunners, waited for room at the top of the stretch, found a seam
with a quarter to run splitting rivals in the four path to bid for the lead but could find enough late to get up for the win. SWEET BOMBOLINI rated in the
second flight behind the pacesetters, was asked for run outside at the top of the stretch to gain the lead with a quarter out, collared while between foes at
the furlong marker and was outkicked late in deep stretch. FRAC TALES threw her head at the break and was steadied shortly afterwards to trail, weaved
her way through traffic down the stretch picking up tiring runners and showed some good late energy at the wire. WELL ACTUALLY raced four wide through
the turn, was roused into contention racing in the five path at the top of the lane and stalled with an eighth to go. TECHIE lead on the rail in the early stages,
was collared nearing the quarter pole, battled for a bit and then retreated between horses in the final eighth. BABY FADE was squeezed on the break
starting, settled near the back down the backside, offered a brief run mid point on the turn and had nothing to offer on the fence down the lane.
SUSPICIOUS was reined back entering the turn, angled inside to save ground through the turn, roused in the eight path at the the top of the stretch and had
no finish to give to the wire. SO BREANNA press the early pace, was asked five sixteenths out for run with no response given and faltered in upper stretch
backing through the field.

Footnotes
MONEY PRINTER settled two wide off the pace, advanced three deep on the far turn, altered outside a rival at the three-sixteenths, struck the lead coming
to the sixteenth pole and drove clear despite getting in a bit. FARAWAY KITTEN rated just off the lone clear leader racing two to three wide, edged closer
and took the lead by the quarter pole, was outkicked by the winner but second best. ENTRY TO HEAVEN settled inside off the pace, tipped out leaving the
first turn, went two wide into the far turn, came into upper stretch four wide, rallied through traffic to get up for show from between rivals. HENLEY'S JOY
settled two to three wide off the pace early, went three to four wide on the far turn, kicked on but was outfinished for third. THREEFIFTYSEVEN stalked two
to three wide between rivals early, loomed a threat three wide turning for home, had no late kick and lost show honors at the wire. ARTURO TOSCANINI
(IRE) was unhurried racing toward the rear inside early, moved out to go three wide on the far turn, still had much to do in upper stretch, shifted out further
for room in mid-stretch and ran on belatedly to improve. ENGLISH CONQUEROR broke outwardly and was corrected then allowed to settled toward the
rear two to three wide, fanned five wide into the stretch, came out a bit in mid-stretch and needed more. KEEP GRINDING stalked three to four wide, was
up close coming to the top of the stretch then weakened. ESKIMINZIN tracked from inside mid-pack then weakened. DAY TRIPPER sped clear, set the
pace inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
CLIFF'S HEAD broke in after the start, took command down the backstretch, was unchallenged through the turn, opened up when asked midway in the
stretch and held well at the finish. JIMMY IS A BREEZE trailed the field on the rail mid point on the turn, angled out to the five path turning for home and
rallied well outside closing late to be a clear second. P. S. RISING STAR chased the leader in the beginning, roused to go after the loose frontrunner on the
turn, could not gain on the winner in upper stretch but showed some grit to rebid inside late to get up for third. CREEMORE was bumped on the break by an
outside runner, tracked the pace in third down the backside, loomed between horses turning for home and stalled late losing third at the wire. REINS OF
PURPLE tracked inside on the rail through the turn, advanced on the fence to contend for a minor placing turning for home but could not finish up late
running evenly to the wire. KEYSTONE LAW was ridden between rivals through the turn, could not get into a contending position turning for home and
offered little in the late stages of the race. FRAGOLA trailed after the break, offered a mild run travelling four wide with three eighths to go, lost ground to
runners through the turn and was not a factor in the stretch. JOCKEYS CLAIM OF FOUL#9 KEYSTONE LAW AGAINST #10 CREEMORE ON THE
BCKSTRETCH WAS DISALLOWED
