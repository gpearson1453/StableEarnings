Footnotes
HAYES STRIKE broke a bit outwardly at the start, pressed the pace setter from the three path, vied into the far turn, drew off turning for home, and widened
under moderate hand urging. ROUTE RUNNER tracked two wide and from between horses, shifted three wide entering the lane as the eventual winner
kicked away, then stayed on from among rivals to bid for place, and held that position through the final furlong. RABBIT HOUND tracked three wide, floated
four wide entering the lane, chased the clear leader while bidding for place, but was fended off by ROUTE RUNNER for that position. MANO DURA stalked
along the inside, but chased under urging around the far turn, attempted a bid for place inside of a trio of foes in upper stretch, but yielded late. BOXSTER
set the pace inside of a pressing HAYES STRIKE while remaining a path off of the inner rail, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart at the quarter
pole, then gave way between rivals at the furlong grounds. GHOST NATION dwelt at the start and spotted the rest of the field multiple lengths, shifted
outside of rivals around the opening hook, gained four wide entering the backstretch to a tracking position, but gave way entering the far turn.

BALL GOWN vied for the lead outside of TWENTYTWENTY HOAX early on, backed off after ICY RIVER pulled forward to vie nearing the turn, stalked the
top pair from the two path leaving the three furlong pole, shifted in slightly passing the five sixteenths pole and appeared to put LADY PELE to tight quarters,
tipped back outside of the top pair entering the lane, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. ICY RIVER hopped
while spotting the leaders a few lengths at the start, yet tugged forward shortly after, pulled to split the top pair into the turn, dueled two wide around the
bend, vied from between horses into the final furlong as an outer BALL GOWN joined the fray, but failed to match strides in the final sixteenth, then just
saved place late. LADY PELE broke many paths out at the start, tracked in the five path, tucked to the rail approaching the three furlong pole, inched closer
inside of BALL GOWN soon after, steadied when probably put to tight quarters leaving the five sixteenths pole, shifted four wide in upper stretch for clear
sailing outside of the top trio, then grinded away in pursuit of ICY RIVER for place in the closing stages, but missed reeling her in. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX
vied inside of BALL GOWN early before dueling inside of a bidding ICY RIVER around the turn, fought on while the prior re-bid in midstretch, but yielded
entering the final sixteenth. ANNIE'S KINGDOM broke many lengths slow, and trailed throughout. THE RIDER OF LADY PELE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
THE RIDER OF BALL GOWN FOR INTERFERENCE APPROACHING THE QUARTER POLE, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISSALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS.

Footnotes
PEEKACHO stalked outside of the leading trio into the first turn before tucking behind them passing the thirteen-sixteenths pole, pursued a clearing
SIMOVITCH from the rail around the far turn, slipped inside of him entering the lane to produce a bid, then gained an advantage leaving the sixteenth pole,
and readily drew clear. SIMOVITCH set the pace along the inside while well in hand, inched clear of a pair of outer pressers while shifting to the two path
leaving the three furlong pole, which allowed for PEEKACHO to slip inside of him entering the lane, resisted that foe into the final furlong, but gave in
passing the sixteenth pole. SEARCH ENGINE pressed three wide, chased a clearing inner rival around the far turn, then failed to keep pace with that one
and another bidding foe in upper stretch before remaining well clear of the rest. BEACHWALKER laid at the rear in the two path, and improved in
midstretch, but failed to threaten. SUPER CONSTITUTION prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but gave way at the three furlong pole.
CREED raced at the rear in the four path, and never got involved.

Footnotes
NIP N TUCK stalked two wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, forged an advantage in upper stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth. THE
PENINSULA set a clear pace in the two path around the first turn, remained loose into the far turn, met NIP N TUCK's challenge at the quarter pole, fought
on while getting headed entering the final furlong, then yielded a sixteenth from home, and saved place. OPTIMUS KAT tracked in the two path early on,
then two wide into the far turn as COURAGEOUSLY slipped inside, but was floated four wide by that foe entering the lane, and chased the top pair home,
but failed to catch a tiring rival for place. COURAGEOUSLY tracked in midpack along the inside, gained to a stalking position inside of OPTIMUS KAT into
the far turn, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, but only managed to chase between horses while lacking the needed punch. SONO GRATO
broke a beat slowly, tracked in midpack three to four wide, and failed to factor. DYNABLUE laid in midpack two wide entering the first turn, but failed to
sustain that position nearing the backstretch, rated off of the pace along the inside thereafter, and never got involved. CHASIN CHARLIE was last away and
trailed throughout. NO HEAD ON REPLAY SHOWN

Footnotes
BLING stalked the leader from the outside, bid at the quarter pole as a pair of outer rivals threatened, readily kicked clear when let out in upper stretch, drew
off under a vigorous hand ride into the final furlong, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. COLLECTED GLORY tracked three wide, ranged up
turning for home as an outer HOLY FOLY forced her hand, but quickly failed to keep pace with an inner foe in upper stretch, and secured place entering the
final furlong. FAME STREET pursued from off of the pace in the three to four path, tipped five wide and outside of rivals in upper stretch, and rallied
thereafter to reach show approaching the wire. MYSTIFY broke a beat slowly, laid off of the pace two wide, crept closer between horses while tracking
around the turn, bid for place entering the lane, but failed to match strides with an outer foe for that position at the furlong grounds, then relinquished show
late. HOLY FOLEY laid off of the pace, gained four wide and outside of foes around the turn to range up to the leaders nearing the lane, but flattened out
while failing to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch. CHANEL POINT raced in midpack along the inside, but lost position while mildly shuffled
back leaving the three furlong pole, shifted three wide turning for home, and failed to menace between horses through the lane. CATCHA LATER MO set
the pace along the inside, but gave way to a trio of bidders at the quarter pole. STORM RATE stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home. GREEK
HEIRESS broke very poorly while spotting the leaders many lengths, and was outrun. BECKY THATCHER showed little. NO HEAD ON REPLAY SHOWN

Footnotes
SILK TRADE took a bump from an inner foe at the start, dueled for the lead along the inside while hounded by a pair of outer rivals, shook clear of them in
upper stretch, then lasted from a surging rival to the wire. UBER KIRK bumped an outer foe rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path,, tracked in
the three path around the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and rallied with a strong late kick, but just ran out of ground. DR. PERRY stalked along the
inside, but only managed to chase through the lane before reaching show entering the final sixteenth. MARCHING vied for the lead two wide and between
horses, dueled around the turn, but yielded in upper stretch. FLAGS UP was jostled between horses at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path,
floated to the five path in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. COURTHOUSE COVE broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, prompted the pace three
wide, but tired in upper stretch. TITLE SHOT bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed around the turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, and made little
impact. BELFAST BOY broke a step slow before taking bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, and never got
involved. PRESTONSBIRD stumbled at the start while breaking with the field, tracked four wide, but weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT tracked two wide and from between horses tipped three wide entering the lane, grinded away in pursuit of the top pair through
midstretch, bid entering the final sixteenth, gained an advantage nearing the wire, and held. HIGH FASHION settled of of the pace two wide, took the far
turn in the three path before shifting four wide and between horses in upper stretch, produced a good kick in the final furlong, rallied up to the leaders
approaching the wire, and reached place while running out of ground to reel in the leader. ARLYNE'S CROWN set the pace, showed the way from a vying
MISSION BELLE around the far turn, gamely clung to an advantage well into the final furlong, but was bested by the eventual winner inside the final
sixteenth, and got nailed at the wire for place. MISSION BELLE stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, sparred through the lane while failing to gain the
advantage, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. LET'S DUET stalked along the inside, but lacked a hole to split the leading pair
in upper stretch, lost the option to tip outside of them while getting outkicked by a hole-shutting SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT leaving the furlong grounds, altered
course further out while getting outkicked for minor rewards in the final sixteenth, then kept on willingly once clear in the closing thirty yards. DIVINE HOPE
trailed two wide, came into the lane three wide, and moved up between horses. LEGERITY saved ground towards the rear, improved inside of foes entering
the lane, but failed to menace. FABRICATE tracked three wide, but faded five wide and outside of foes entering the lane. TREATY OF PARIS laid off of the
pace along the inside, but faded between horses turning for home.
