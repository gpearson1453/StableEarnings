Footnotes
ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) rated off the top pair down the backstretch while racing near the inside, eased out to challenge through the far turn while racing
three wide, had a clear advantage through the upper stretch and remained clear lead under steady handling. R TENDERONI pressed the early leader from
the outside, raced off the inside in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. CAMP PENDLETON showed good early speed to set pressured pace from the
inside, shifted off the rail in the drive and kept on. DR. FERBER settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced near the inside at
the quarter pole, angled out to race from the outside in the stretch run and made a late gain to narrowly miss the show position. MAMAIGOTTHIS settled off
the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid. DARK AGES was allowed to settle early, raced well off the
inside into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
WICKED MAD rated in the early stages, eased out through the far turn to move while racing three wide, raced four to five into the lane and finished well to
be clear late under strong handling. CHAUFFEUR chased the pace from the inside, angled out through the stretch and closed well late to get up for the
place position while racing from the outside. PASSWORD PROTECTED dropped near the back of the pack early, advanced towards the leaders through the
turn and moved up from the outside to gain the show position. BILLINGSGATE was coaxed along from the outside, raced three to four wide in the stretch
run and weakened a bit in the final stages. HIGH PRINT coaxed along early while chasing Scotty Brown early on, raced three to two wide between rivals in
the drive and had not enough. SCOTTY BROWN was quick to begin to set the early pace from the outside, collared through the upper stretch and was
empty late. MARYLAND PRIDE was void of early speed, saved ground and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MR. MOSLEY was sent along from the inside early to set the early pace along the inside, continued its run from the inside in the stretch run, dug in late and
prevailed under strong handling. BROWN DELIVERS pressed the pace from the outside, was hard ridden through the far turn and just missed in a game
effort while continuing its run from the outside of Mr. Mosley. NEVERFOLD settled off the early pace, moved up four to five wide through the far turn, raced
six to seven wide through the upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair. NOTION TO TAPIT stalked the early pace, raced along the inside around
the far turn and had no late response. BYRON'S GOLD was void of early speed to trail early, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and improved
position. MR. FIBONACCI was unhurried early on and failed to respond. KEEP NORTH coaxed along press the early going while racing between rivals and
was done early. THUNDERHOUSE settled off the pace, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch, lost ground and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
RIBALDRY (IRE) chased the pace from the inside, shifted four to five wide through the stretch to race outside of Seems to Whisper and just got up in her
final strides under strong pressure. SEEMS TO WHISPER stalked the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch, led deep stretch and just missed in
a game effort. IN HER CUPS showed good early foot to set the pace down the backstretch, dug in while racing near the rail in the stretch run and gave way
grudgingly. DON DIVA dropped back off the early going, made an advance along the inside through the far turn and moved up to improve position late.
POLICE WOMAN settled to the middle of the pack early, moved up four wide through the far turn and flattened out in the drive. HAZELMOOR BEACH was
void of early speed, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled out to race from the outside and had no rally. SEAP tracked the early leader from the
inside and faded in the drive. I'M PRETTY was slow early on, raced six deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MY MAGIC LADY broke to the
outside, hustled along from the outside, raced five wide around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
MISS GEORGIE was quick to begin from the outside to cross over and set the early pace, raced just off the inside in the drive and held gamely to remain
clear under steady pressure. SILENT SWINGER was away alert, rated along down the backstretch along the inside, continued a rail bid in the stretch run,
angled out three to four wide near the sixteenth pole to race outside of Miss Georgie and finished willingly to the wire. BLOWTHRUYELOWLITES was
hustled early, raced three to two wide in the lane and moved up to improve position. ARROGATES DREAM was coaxed along early, raced three wide near
the quarter pole and weakened through the stretch run. BLOME was off a step slow, chased from the inside early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and
had no late response. ONE LAS OLAS dropped to the back of the pack early, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled four to five wide and never
threatened. HONOR THE TRUTH was hustled soon after the start and failed to respond.

under strong handling while racing four deep. OLDIES BUT GOODIES rated under a firm hold along the inside down the backstretch through the far turn,

enough. BATTLEBUS was quick to begin to set the pace along the inside down the backstretch and weakened a bit the final furlong. ROBEY'S BOY was
