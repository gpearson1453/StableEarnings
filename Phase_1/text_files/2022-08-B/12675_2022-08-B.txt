Footnotes
FREYA'S BLESSING came away a bit rank and was steadied early, rounded the opening turn about the five path then closed through the backstretch,
challenged two deep approaching the top of the stretch, dueled at even terms from the eighth pole and drew clear later yards. WEAVINYOUINTHEDUST
took the lead and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, held the advantage near the rail on the far turn,
was met leaving the turn and dueled at even terms in the upper stretch before relenting the final sixteenth. JUJU ON DA BEAT steadied at the heels of I
SHALLBE RELEASED on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and came along for
third mid-stretch before flattening stride. The latter stalked the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far
turn. ROO stalked the earlier pace from the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. TRACE
ESTATE became anxious in the gate then saved ground.

HAPPY YEARS stalked off the rail then challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole, took over two deep approaching the quarter, cleared Jaxjaxxorjacks
midway on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. MY BOY CLYDE raced off the pace in the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the
half mile pole, rounded the far turn three wide and drew clear in second past the sixteenth pole while gaining on the winner. AZURE FIRE settled off the
pace toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. JAXJAXXORJACKS took the
lead into the first turn and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met at the rail approaching the quarter,
dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. WELL EQUIPPED saved early ground then eased out leaving the second turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. ACASHA'S INTUITION stalked the early pace inside then faded through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed, and
dismissed, a claim of foul against the rider of Azure Fire for alleged interference into the far turn, lodged by the rider of Well Equipped.

Footnotes
BLUE N GOLD settled off the rail, bid toward the three eighths pole and drew to even terms two deep midway on the far turn, took the nod approaching the
top of the lane and dueled clear later yards. HARDLY EVER BETTER rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was met
a the rail midway on the far turn and dug in a close factor through the upper stretch before relenting the final sixteenth. SLEW THE TURN saved ground on
the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. RED HOT TODDY settled back
in the two and three paths of the first turn and left the turn outside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and
showed little in the lane. FIGAROS FORTUNE closed to stalking position through the front stretch and settled off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole
but was boxed and steadied off the heels of Hardly Ever Better into the far turn and faded at the rail through the turn. ROCKET SOUND bucked leaving the
gate and raced well back. The Stewards reviewed, and dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Blue N Gold for alleged interference into the far turn,
lodged by the rider of Figaros Fortune.

on the first turn then stalked four wide into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and dug in to
share second under the wire. ORANGEBURG rated close inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the three path
and ran evenly in the lane. IRISH FLIGHT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and
showed little in the lane. EVANESCO took over into the first turn and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was met
at the rail leaving the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. ROCKET BALLAD saved ground. WHATAPUNCH rounded the first turn about the five path

NICE N' BROAD stalked two deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms midway on the far turn, was carried out into the
stretch but dug in to put Miss Wave away mid-stretch and was steadily handled to just last. JAMESTOWN ROAD saved ground on the first turn then eased
out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, was carried out leaving the turn, angled back in at
the head of the lane, dug in for second the final yards and just missed the win. MISS WAVE moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge into the far turn, was met at the rail midway on the turn, drifted into the lane and continued a close factor
to mid-stretch before flattening stride. GRACE ELIZABETH raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail but drifted into the lane, angled back toward the inside and flattened stride. DISTORTED SPLENDOR closed toward
contention and stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded past the five sixteenths. CASTLE OF CAYLEE

Footnotes
GLOBAL EMPRESS pulled herself to the front and set a firmly rated pace, widened at the rail on the turn then further extended her lead; handily. TAPTAP
chased, rounded the turn about the four path and dueled for second inside the sixteenth pole. SIENTE LA BRISA raced with the early pace, gave chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the quarter, ran at the rail through the turn and flattened in the lane. PRETTY CASTLE chased inside,
rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. SUNSET QUEEN gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and flattened into the lane. A BLONDE
THING chased outside, rounded the turn in the seven path and showed little in the lane. JADE SKYE saved ground. BADS LIL LADY gave chase, rounded
the turn in the five path and weakened into the lane. LET'S B CIVIL chased, rounded the turn in the six path and showed little in the stretch. CHARITABLE
SHOW chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and weakened.
