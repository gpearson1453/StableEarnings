Footnotes
WHAT A BEAUT was allowed to settle at the back early on, started to cruise around runners with three eighths to go, battled outside for the lead at the top
of the stretch and wore down her inside rival late inching away at the finish. LET'S HAVE FUN sat just off the contesting pace runners through the turn,
briefly took over the lead in upper stretch between horses and fought on stubbornly to the wire giving away in deep stretch. WAKE UP MAGGIE tracked on
the rail behind the early pace duel, waited to angle outside in the three path off runners at the top of the stretch, rallied but could not match the top two
finishing to the wire but ran on well to be the best of the rest. MI TORMENTA rated mid pack in the second flight outside of horses in the beginning, was
roused four wide with a quarter to go and passed tiring runners outside to get a small award. GELATO AMORE hopped at the start , quickly recovered to
lead between runners into the turn, was headed in upper stretch, battled inside briefly and faded at the furlong marker. MORE SAVVY hopped at the break,
settled near the rear down the backside and could not get involved in the late stages. ASHA IRONBORN pressed the pace inside early, began to give way
with a quarter to go and retreated on the fence through the lane.

Footnotes
ARRA GO WAN stalked from outside, loomed boldly three deep at the quarter pole, drifted out several paths in the stretch but forged clear in the final
furlong. SHELLY THE ROCKET was coaxed forward inside to set the tempo, engaged late on the turn, came out a path turning for home, fought on briefly
then yielded. IS THERE A FOREST was forwardly-positioned pressing the pace to the turn, dropped back from between runners and was encouraged along
early on that bend, could not kick on with the top ones but held show honors. MY GIRL HOOTER was ridden along throughout but outpaced racing near
inside, came into upper stretch three wide, gradually moved outward, ran on but missed show. THESKYISTHELIMIT settled outside at the rear going three
wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five wide, moved out a bit, was never a threat.

Footnotes
GALWAY WATERS sat just off the early speed on the fence for the first quarter, engaged the frontrunner into the turn to keep inside position, poked his
head in front with three eighths to go, opened up on the field in upper stretch and was kept to the task to the finish winning comfortably in the end. RAT
PORTAGE tracked the early pacesetters inside on the turn, angled out at the quarter pole to the four path for the stretch drive, offered a mild bid in upper
stretch and could not gain on the winner in the last eighth. WHERE IS ESSA was roused to keep up to the top pair midway on the turn, shuffled back to last
between horses turning for home, angled to the inside for the drive and responded well to rebid to get up for third. RAISE A PROFIT trailed at the start,
rallied four wide though the turn and finished up evenly outside to the wire settling for a minor share. SILENT FAREWELL rated near the rear from the start,
was ridden to go on through the turn racing three wide and offered little response not being a factor in the latter stages. DOMINANT DESTROYER took the
early lead down the backstretch between runners, was headed by the winner inside three furlongs out, was asked turning for home and stopped through the
field in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL CRESCENT stalked from mid-pack racing off the inside, went mostly four wide on the turn commencing a rally, struck a narrow lead outside a
rival past the furlong marker, dueled with that one to the wire and got the nod. T'PRING stalked just off the leader moving in early, went two then three wide
on the turn racing inside the eventual winner into upper stretch, dueled with that one and just missed. FREE CARRYCOMB moved clear under mild coaxing
to set the pace and shifting in, raced near the inside on the turn, was clear turning for home, had no extra. LAILA'S CHARM got away well and was close up
in the early going having shifted in, eased back off the leaders early on the turn, moved out beginning about the five-sixteenths, came five wide to the top of
the stretch and a bit wider still while showing late interest. SUNDAY VISIT gained position after saving ground on the turn but could only run on evenly in the
stretch. POSITIVE was in behind rivals early, switched outside foes, raced between foes into the turn four wide, was thoroughly asked by the three-eighths,
moved out six to seven wide by the top of the stretch, ran on evenly. FLASHY GET EVEN switched outside the leading trio early, advanced three wide early
on the turn, could not sustain the effort for the drive. HONOR AND DIGNITY was mid-pack early, in a bit tight between rivals past the five-eighths while
being forced out a bit, dropped back between foes and failed to rally. ORIGINAL ME hit the gate, raced outside toward the back four to five wide, was never
a threat.

Footnotes
HONEY WON'T tracked the early pacesetters down the backside, advanced on the fence with three eighths to go, angled off the rail for the drive to assume
command turning for home and began to draw away mid stretch to hold safe at the wire. DANI'S VICTORY tracked mid pack in the beginning, was coaxed
while outside the winner through the turn, could not quicken enough to keep pace with winner with three furlongs to go but showed some resolve by closing
late in deep stretch to get up for second and making it a race at the finish. HALLIE'S HERO showed good early speed to lead, widened his lead going into
the turn, was collared by the winner at the top of the stretch , fought on briefly in mid stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. BEN LOMOND trailed after
the start, rallied going three wide through the turn, angled out to the five path for the stretch run but could not find enough late to be involved at the finish.
GORGEOUS KITTEN was allowed to settle near the rear after the break, asked through the turn, had little to offer and could not get into contention.
WHISKEY VICTOR stalked at the back of the pack in the beginning, saved ground through the turn but could not get involved through the race. ROBUSTO
chased the early the pace for the first quarter, was asked to go on after the leader three furlongs out and could not find another gear and retreated through
the field down the lane.

Footnotes
AL HEYBAY settled just off the pace tracking inside, saved ground on the turn, took over the lead from drifting rivals turning for home, was quickly clear and
held well under steady handling. MR NARCISSISTIC came in a bit at the break, raced near but just off the rail going mostly two to three wide, followed the
winner without making much headway but secured the place. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ broke outwardly bumping a rival lightly, settled at the rear, raced in
the two path on the turn, advanced past rivals inside in mid- to late-stretch to gain third. LIARS CLUB stalked the pacesetter, went four wide through much
of the turn and was carried six wide into upper stretch, kept on from between runners. ICING pursued the early pace between, dropped back and switched
out, advanced four then six wide on the turn, was carried eight wide into the stretch and ran on. PRINCE OF THIEVES was bumped and squeezed at the
break, advanced outside rivals five wide early on the turn, was forced nine wide into upper stretch and ran on. RAPID RELOAD moved forward inside to set
the pace racing off the rail, appeared to be getting out up the backstretch and early on the turn racing in the three path, bore out five wide past the quarter
pole, tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
UNDER THE EYE hounded the early pace into the first turn, assumed command entering the backstretch, was challenged in upper stretch briefly and drew
away when asked at the furlong marker to win comfortably in the end. AWILDAS TREASURE led into the first turn, surrendered the lead to the winner
entering the backstretch, commenced a run through the far turn to offer a mild threat to the winner in upper stretch, was repelled shortly afterwards and held
second safe to the finish. DEJAS TOO rated mid pack between rivals into the first turn and backside, was ridden with three furlongs to go making a rally,
could could not close on the top two turning for home but was running well enough to hold third money. ELEANOR POWELL tracked mid pack on the rail in
the early stages, was shuffled back to trail with a half to go, angled off the rail in the three path passing tiring runners into the stretch and levelled out
through the lane to finish on the fringes. MONASTERY LANE travelled three wide into the first turn, made a mild move into contention through the backside
and could not find more with three eighths to go when the running started and faded inside of horses in upper stretch. DIVINE GENESIS trailed the field
going three wide into the first turn, was reined back while headstrong entering the backside to trail, offered a short run into the far turn, faltered mid turn and
stopped.

Footnotes
KNOW HOW (GB) was urged from the break chasing the pacesetter from outside going two to three wide on the turn, took over at the top of the stretch,
went clear and held while being kept to the task. MUSKOKA SUMMER bumped a rival at the start, was forwardly-placed soon after chasing, went four to
five wide on the turn, loomed a threat in upper stretch but ran on evenly thereafter and held the place. SWEET EDITION settled mid-pack going two to three
wide on the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch, gained slowly and steadily and was too late for second. FOREST CHOICE was forwardly-positioned
tracking inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. MEETING AT MARTHAS was bumped by the outside foe and bumped with
the inside one at the start, raced well back early, saved ground on the turn, began to pick it up in the stretch, came out four wide nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished with strong energy but far too late. MY BABY JANE was bumped by the inside rival and bumped with the outside one at the start, was urged
forward inside advancing into upper stretch then evened out. ROAD MAP was up close just briefly chasing the leaders but soon dropped back to mid-pack
racing three to four wide, ran on evenly. STOLE THE RING lacked early speed racing three wide into the turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch and
improved. CLINK CHEERS bumped the outside rival at the start, moved clear to set the pace inside, gave way. ELUSIVE GEM chased five wide coming
seven deep into upper stretch and turned up empty. MIMI'S HOLIDAY broke a step slowly, raced off the inside lacking early speed, was never a factor.
INFINITE PASSION raced outside at the rear four wide into the turn, fanned nine wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
