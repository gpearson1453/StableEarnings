DOUBLE TIME BAY was bumped at the start, tracked the pace between rivals at the half mile marker, then was two wide on the turn, swung out four wide
leaving the turn, then surged late to get up under a drive to prove best. NO RHYTHM tracked the pace on the inside, then continued to save ground on the
turn, then finished well on the inside but was outfinished by the winner. ISSUING JUSTICE set the early pace on the inside, then was two wide leaving the
turn and shook clear past the furlong marker, then had nothing left the final sixteenth, held show award. MONEYONTHELINE tracked the pace and made a
three wide bid on the turn but flattened out. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was outrun early, then was five wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally.
TOUCH OF PRINCE bobbled at the start, settled early, then was four wide by the quarter pole and had no rally.

GEM JUAN was allowed to settle and was on the inside on the turn, eased off the rail and came five wide into the lane, closed well to get up late under a
drive. ACT OF VALOR stalked the early pace, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, shook clear by the furlong marker and then drifted out nearing the
sixteenth pole and was caught late. EXPENSIVE was reserved early, started to unwind leaving the five sixteenths, saved ground leaving the turn and then
shifted out leaving the three sixteenths, then shifted out leaving the furlong marker for racing room, but was cut off by ACT OF VALOR when that rival drifted
out, altered course and angled in and finished well, rough trip. DREAMERS REWARD was allowed to settle early and was three to four wide on the turn,
came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally but needed more. FRANK N DUCKY stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn and
weakened. DREAM OF WARRIOR set the pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
MYSTERY ITEM stumbled at the start, then went up to set a pressured pace on the inside, then turned back a bid leaving the quarter pole, and drew clear
in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. SPECTACULLARI was rated along two to three wide, made a four wide move by the quarter pole, but
could not get to the winner while being second best. YOURINDENIAL pressed the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole to vie for command,
but flattened out in the final furlong. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY lacked a rally. SPRINKLE THIS was well placed towards the inside and weakened. CLOUD
SKIPPING stalked the pace three wide and went bad at the five sixteenths and lost the rider after sustaining an injury and was vanned off. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THIS RACE BUT MADE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

PERUVIAN BOY tracked the early pace four to three wide, made a three wide move on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew clear leaving the
turn and remained clear to the wire to prove best under a drive, sharp. VOUCH was rated along the inside to the two path on the turn, made a bid leaving
the turn on the inside, finished willingly but could not get to the winner while being second best. HASHTAG WINNING was allowed to settle early on the
inside, came into the drive two wide, then had a mild late rally. THE BIG BLUFF was rated along and between rivals on the turn, came four wide into the
drive and had a mild late gain to just miss the show award. HIGH VELOCITY dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. SPEEDY MOONLITE dueled
for the lead on the outside and weakened. CALCULATED THINKIN chased the pace five wide and stopped.

Footnotes
WONDER IN was away alertly to set a pressured pace while racing in the three path, drew clear by the quarter pole and remained clear by the furlong
marker, then held sway late to prove best under a drive. HESASMOKIN was rated along between rivals, came three wide into the drive, angled in leaving
the three sixteenths and was gaining on the inside late. SPIN CYCLE tracked the pace three wide and came four wide into the drive and rallied on the
outside, just missed the place award. BIG BAD BUD was allowed to settle early, came two wide into the drive and had a mild late rally but needed more.
STONE SCULPTOR was reserved early, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally. TOOK A CAB pressed the winner early from the inside and
weakened.
