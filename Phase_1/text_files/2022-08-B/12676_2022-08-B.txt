Footnotes
JETTIN OUT coaxed between early on, then settled a bit off the top pair, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and finished well to be well clear late
under strong handling. HARD FOUGHT was sent along from the inside to show good early foot, dug in near the eighth pole but was no match for the winner
while continuing its run from the inside. DESHACKLED chased the early pace while under a steady ride early on, raced three wide through the far turn,
shifted five near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN was void of early speed, raced four to five wide in the drive and
moved up late to improve position. ZEN PI broke awkward, lost a considerable amount of ground at the break, hustled along early, raced along the inside
around the far turn and lacked a rally. PHASE OUT showed good early speed to show the pace outside of rival entering the far turn and weakened in the
stretch run. HERE WEGO chased the pace from the outside, raced four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
C C GOLDRUSH showed good early speed to set the early pace, was headed near the eighth pole by Giantsbane, dug in gamely and prevailed in a
determined run under all out pressure. BATON broke in sharply at the start, tracked the early leader from the inside, ridden along near the three eighths
pole, angled four wide in the drive and finished gamely to the wire. RIPKEN rated in the early stages along the inside, continued its run from the inside
around the far turn, shifted out through the stretch to race between rivals and finished gamely to the wire. GIANTSBANE stalked the pace while racing from
the outside of foes, challenged near five sixteenths pole, narrowly led near the eighths pole and finished willingly to the wire. T REX was allowed to settle
early, moved up four wide through the far turn, raced from the outside in the stretch run, took aim near the three sixteenths and flattened out. HARNESS
CREEK was void of early speed, raced four wide through the far turn and made a mild late gain to improve position. KEYS DISCOUNT lunged at the break,
raced near the back of the pack early, was four deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. BOFFO KID settled off the early pace, angled widest
through the stretch run and lacked a bid. WONDER WATER was rated while racing in hand early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and lost ground

the drive. UNCOMMON VALOR was void of early speed, raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled out through the lane to race from the outside and
moved up late. JOHNNY SWISH stalked the early pace, raced three wide through the far turn and weakened the final furlong. FRANCIS X. tracked Dialing

chased the pace from the inside, raced near the inside around the far turn into the stretch, experienced traffic near the eighth pole, shifted out four wide and
had not enough. CLAIRE'S DARLING was coaxed along from the outside, led narrowly into the upper stretch and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile.

PEACE WITH HONOR stalked the early pace, raced was ridden along nearing the three eighths pole, raced four wide through the upper stretch and
finished well to prevail under strong handling. MY CANDY GIRL settled to the middle of the pack, moved up four wide through the far turn and finished
willingly to the wire. CUPID'S STRIKE was unhurried early on, made an advance through the far turn, angled widest in the lane and made a good late bid to
close in on the top pair late. QUEEN MACHA was pulled to the early lead soon down the backstretch to control the pace while racing inside of rivals and
weakened a bit in the stretch run. FIRE IN THE HOLE settled off the early pace, moved up five wide through the far turn, made a mild late gain in the drive
but had not enough. FLIMSY was fractious in the starting gate, forwardly placed to lay up close early, shifted out near the three sixteenths pole and had no
final winning bid. DOTADA was unhurried early on, raced along the inside around the far turn and passed tired ones late to improve position. BOURBON
WILDCAT , rated in the two path, came up empty in the stretch. DANCING TIL DUSK was not a factor . BECKON raced in mid pack early and weakened..
