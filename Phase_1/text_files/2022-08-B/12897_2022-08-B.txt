MANI PEDI stumbled while breaking alertly, was well placed inside the dueling leaders, angled wide advancing into the lane and was just up following a long
drive. MARIANNA QUEEN vied along the inside, was challenged again by the winner into the stretch and held on gamely just missing. SUGAR STREAK
forced the pace outside to the stretch and weakened. FRISKY FEELING broke a bit poorly, trailed outside and was never a factor. LONDONDERRY lacked
speed, moved very wide on the final turn and had no bid. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRLinjured herself in the paddock and was ordered a late scratch.

TRUE DAKOTAN far back early, moved swiftly to the leader on the final turn then took over into the lane and pulled away. PRINCIPE lacked speed,
advanced in the two path and rallied to gain the place. TOUGH WORKOUT engaged in a heated duel outside, drew clear into the far turn then tired in the
stretch. TRANSFER THE FUNDS dropped far behind outside then gained just missing the show. KANE was well placed behind the dueling pacesetters but
stopped after the half. SWATH dueled along the inside to the final turn and stopped abruptly.

through the lane to gain the show. SOVEREIGN CHANGE prompted the pace, moved closer midway on the turn then had no further response.

INSTINCTIVE stalked the pacesetter outside, bid to the front into the stretch, edged clear and stayed safe under encouragement. CURRENT SITUATION
set the pace under rating, was collared into the stretch, lost the advantage but continued gamely. GINGERS WISH raced off the pace between rivals then
closed well in the stretch. SOLEMN OATH saved ground behind the leaders, swung wide in the stretch with a mild bid. ELUSIVE RYDER broke slowest,
advanced wide then proved empty in the stretch. FED POLICY lagged far behind then passed a fading opponent. OBSTINATE raced in closest pursuit of
the pacesetter and was finished on the final turn. TOMARIE was a late scratch during the warm-up on the advice of the track veternarian.
