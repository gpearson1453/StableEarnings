Footnotes
AWESOME VIEW was coaxed from the outside early on, dug in through the stretch run while racing to the outside of Snackster and just got up under strong
handling. SNACKSTER pressed the early pace from the inside down the backstretch, shifted off the inside into the lane and finished willingly to the wire.
THEA'S THEME hustled along early from the inside, checked after racing in tight quarters just past the half mile pole, raced two wide at the quarter pole,
angled out through the upper stretch to race from the outside and kept on willingly to the wire. MS. MALEVOLENCE checked at the start, was void of early
speed, angled widest through the lane and had no final winning bid. B B'S ROCKET was off a step slow, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and
had no rally. FREEZER BURN showed good early foot from the inside and was done early.

Footnotes
SIBERIAN took control from the opening bell, raced with the target on his back around the turn, came under outside pressure nearing the quarter pole,
shook off rivals top of stretch, kept to task through the stretch, clear under the wire. CONNECTING moved up while saving ground into turn, moved around
leg weary foe on the turn, split rivals top of the stretch, clearly second best today. DIAMANTE DE ORO off the pace early on, raced well back into turn,
quicken leaving the quarter pole, split foes after the furlong marker, found best strides late. ONEHANDSOMEDUDE raced between runners into turn, stayed
between rivals around the turn, came under late pressure while racing on the left lead, even strides late. GREGORIA'S BAY broke sharp, shuffled back
soon after the start, raced off the pace and four wide around turn, mild late gain. DO THE HONORS raced middle of the pack into turn, urged on while four
wide around the turn, could not respond, outrun stretch. SKATING DATE good early speed, raced along the inside around the turn, all in after the quarter
pole, empty through the lane. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR wide after the start, asked for run while racing five wide around the turn, outrun through the stretch.
DAVID'S CUPID slow start, never a threat.

Footnotes
NELSON AVENUE stalked the early pace from the outside down the backstretch, took a narrow lead near the quarter pole while racing three wide, shifted
out through the stretch run to race well off the inside and prevailed late under strong handling. SUPERSTITIEUX was away slowly, void of early speed,
made an advance through the far turn, raced towards the outside of Nelson Avenue in the drive and slowly closed in on the winner late in a game effort.
PROUD CIVILIAN chased the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled out five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough
for the top pair. MUD ISLAND pressed the early pace, led near the five sixteenths pole and weakened through the stretch run. SILVER R was off a step
slow, settled to the middle of the pack early, raced five through the upper stretch and never threatened. GHOST OF KHOZAN dropped back early, raced
near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch and never threatened. CELLULOID HERO was off slowly, raced five wide around the far
turn, continued a wide bid in the stretch and lacked a rally. NAVAL OFFICER coaxed along from the outside, raced five near the three eighths pole and
lacked a bid. KING OF SONG showed good early foot to the early pace and was through early.

Footnotes
CLASSY SOLUTION dueled for the early lead from the inside and held gamely to be clear late under strong pressure. KEVIN WITTE dueled for the early
lead while racing between rivals and finished willingly to the wire. FUTILE chased the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out four
wide and moved up to improve position. THE EXCEPTION dropped back early on, raced towards the outside in the lane and made a good late bid.
RAVENS DELIGHT settled off the pace, moved up through the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late. TOM TERRIFIC was
void of early speed, raced five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. JUDICIAL MANDATE dueled from the outside of rivals and faded in the stretch run.
VEGAS LIFE chased the pace, lost ground and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
MAESTRIA showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely in the drive under steady handling. FABS coaxed along early, challenged
through the far turn, raced four wide in the lane and held the place position late. AWESOME BIRDIE stalked the early pace, angled shifted out to race from
the outside in the lane and kept on to the wire. POWWA OF LOVE settled off the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, moved up while
continuing its run near the inside in the stretch run and improved position. MIDDIE chased the pace from the inside, was four wide through the upper stretch
and raced evenly late. ARUMA dropped to the back of the pack early, raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. SHANIA SEA stalked the
pace from the outside, raced five wide through the upper stretch and weakened. MY CORALENA was slow early, raced four to five wide around the far turn
and never threatened. The five eighths fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
FASHIONATTA tracked the speed duel into turn, perfect three wide position nearing the quarter pole, sent to the attack top of the stretch, went clear leaving
the furlong marker, easy ride under the wire. MISSPOKEN very wide after the start, stayed well wide till nearing the quarter pole, split rivals top of the
stretch, moved into clear second placing, never a threat to winner. RUBY DOOBY DOO running last into turn, moved up along the inside around turn, split
horses top of the stretch, held sway late for the show money. LITTLE FOUR well off the early duel, took a four wide run around the turn, had momentum top
of stretch, finished even late. KISSES FOR HANNAH raced well off the pace early on, moved up along the inside around the turn, had to steady behind
stopping foe at the eighth pole, finished up even late. CAPRICHOSA raced along the inside off the early duel, remained inside around the turn, could not
keep pace with leaders, weakened through the stretch. ATLANTIC FRONT racing off the early pace, tried to make up ground racing three wide around the
turn, split foes deep stretch, no late kick. MAJESTIC'S GIRL had the outside position in the early duel, stayed out front dueling to the quarter pole, felt
pressure from both sides, lugged out top of stretch, steadily faded through the stretch. MO STYLISH raced middle of the pack into turn, pressed on for best
stuff around the turn, could not sustain move, faded through the stretch. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE lacked speed away from the gate, running between
horses entering turn, dropped back and came up empty stretch. GREAT DEVOTION asked to quicken soon after the start, raced inside around the turn
dueling for the lead, outrun through the stretch.
