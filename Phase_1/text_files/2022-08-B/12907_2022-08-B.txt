five wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. CONNECTED followed the early pace, raced three wide into the turn and weakened late
stretch. TWELVE YEAR MAC raced in mid pack from between rivals and was empty late. PARS HEY ZEUS was taken back early, raced off the rail and
finished evenly late. TURNTHEGOOSELOOSE was void of any early speed, raced six wide into the turn and offered no late rally. MARSHAL DILLON was
unhurried early and was no factor. TREASURED IMAGE was outrun early and was no threat. GOLDENINI set a clear early pace, bolted through the turn,
