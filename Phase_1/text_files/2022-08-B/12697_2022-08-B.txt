Footnotes
MAGEEZ allowed the pace to go early while saving ground, continued inside up the backstretch and into the far turn, snuck through along the rail inside the
two leaders to challenge turning for home, drew steadily clear. PINCH ASSAULT took control soon after the start, set a soft but pressured pace toward the
inside, continued to hold a slight advantage into the lane while allowing the winner the inside, proved no match for that one, extended duel for the second
spot, stubborn. PAYDAY TOO pressed the co runner up from the outside from the start, dueled with that one the length of the stretch, also proved
determilned at the end to earn the dead heat. LOUISIANA MOON fell back to trail after the start off the inside, continued three wide up the backstretch and
into the far turn, came four wide for the drive, lacked a closing kick.

CCED FOR STEPH stalked the early leaders three wide into the turn, took over between the entrymates turning for home, quickly clear under a brisk hand
ride, continued to draw off to be ridden out at the end. R T'S CAJUN LADY broke to the outside, was quickly straigtened to clear early, continued to show
the way while getting out late in the turn, proved no match for the winner through the lane, narrowly held the runner up position over entrymate. R T'S GEM
forwardlyl placed along the inside, also proved no match for the winner through the stretch, outfinished for the second spot. ENTITLEMENT off a step slow,
lacked speed while saving ground through the turn, improved position with some mild late interest. ONE MO TO GO off a step slow, went one paced while
three wide. COUNTRY LADY settled off the pace, had little for the drive while racing in the two path. EASY ACT dwelt at the start and remained back.
NIKLAUSIA fell back to trail, was always outrun while four wide.

MY MAN LOUIE last away, moved up quickly between foes to vie, dueled through the turn in the two path, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker,
put the other speed away soon after while holding the runner up at bay in the waning strides inside that one. SADIE'S LIGHT closest to the dueling leaders
off the inside through the turn, ranged up outside that pair to challenge past the furlong marker, turned back, clearly second best. JEFFROW settled off the
pace inside, continued to save ground into the lane, staged a mild rally up the rail to gain the show. DOCTRINAIRE void of speed, continued back then
launched a mild rally from between foes into the lane to improve position slightly. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE broke on top, showed the way early, dueled inside
the winner through the turn into the stretch, faltered the final furlong. TOTALLY ADDICTED was finished early, far back to be well beaten.

BE A BANDIT broke back, was outrun up the backstretch despite some encouragement, came four wide out of the turn, set down, rallied through some
traffic, late surge to be up at the wire. GILDED APPLE lacked speed inside, continued to save ground turn, shaken up when straightened for home, rallied
up the rail to finish willingly to annex the place while unable to match the winner at the wire. TEXAS MAMA broke sharp from the outside, pressed then
alternated up front in the two path, shook off the other speed when straightened for home to be clear by the furlong marker, faltered in the late going to be
nailed from the outside and inside respectively for the first two positions. MOMENT TO DREAM in the second flight outside, three wide through the turn,
lacked a closing kick through the stretch. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL took command soon after the start, was joined in the run into the turn, dueled closest to the
inside through the bend then was the first to blink entering the stretch. OLD FASHION AMOUR lacked speed outside, was five wide into the stretch, failed to
muster a response when called on. ACHANCETOWIN forwardly placed early along the inside, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

BIG ROJO forwardly placed for three furlongs along the inside, steered out three wide late in the turn, engaged the two leaders from the outside nearing the
furlong marker, kicked clear under steady handling. ETBAUER'S SECRET away best of all,dueled off the inside, vied between horses past midstretch,
proved no match for the winner late, proved game for the place. WILLIE THE MAN dueled up front closest to the inside, also proved no match for the winner
the final furlong, outkicked for the runner up position. FIGHTING SOLDIER went one paced throughout while racing off the inside crossed the wire trailing
his left hind bandage which had become undone. UNCLE CHAN last to leave, trailed throughout in failing to menace.

Footnotes
SCHNELL withg the early pace in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, fell back a bit through upper stretch, set down, found more the final sixteenth
to prove best in a game effort. COMMON LAW CAT settled off the pace toward the inside, came in the two path into the lane, traffic nearing midstretch due
to a drifting leader, altered course to the outside, finished up a nice turn of late energy to narrowly miss. GOLDEN PALACE forwardly placed early outside,
advanced four wide turn to challenge entering the stretch, took over, drifted in past the furlong marker, caught in the late going between the top two at the
wire. MUCHO MARVIN set or forced the pace outside the winner and between horses for almost five furlongs, faltered in the final furlong. BLUE CHEESE
last to leave, trailed for three furlongs, fanned five wide into the lane, improved slightly. MICAJAH back off the pace and the inside, was four wide exiting the
turn, lacked a rally when called on. TARGET PRACTICE with the early pace three wide, began a steady fade before three furlongs, trailed home.

Footnotes
HANNAH'S HAVEN within striking distance along the inside into the first turn, continued to stalk from a ground saving position up the backstretch, advanced
and challenged the leader from the outside turning for home, drew well clear under steady pressure. RUMPUS asked a bit away from the gate, clear into the
first turn, set the pace along the inside, offered brief resistance to the winner turning for home, no match to the wire, fully extended to hold the next foe safe
late. SPECIAL CONNECTION void of speed while 4w early in the first turn, angled in before a half, made a good advance along the rail second turn, steered
out then back in through the middle part of the stretch, continued willingly to the finish to be getting to the runner up. AKIANE'S SOLDIER in mid pack early,
moved closer in the two path in the second turn, flattened out a bit in the drive. CATCAKE in mid pack while racing outside, four wide into the far turn, lacked
a closing response through the lane. GLANCE void of speed, came four wide out of the final turn, picked off a couple of faltering rivals while never a serious
threat. CADILLAC RIDGE behind the leaders off the rail, gave way after a half. VIV VIV VIV chased the leader off the rail for six furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
ROCKDALE broke back, raced four wide into the turn when beginning to advance, angled a bit and was three wide into the lane to challenge, took over,
drew clear under a firm right handed crop. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST settled behind the pace toward the inside, cut the corner into the lane and rode the rail
to garner the place, no match for the winner. POSEIDON WRATH chased the early leader, took over inside that one before a half, briefly clear early turn,
asked along late turn proved no match for the winner through the lane, caught late for the place. RITHMICALLEA void of speed, saved ground out of the
turn, shifted out for the drive, staged a mild rally to improve position. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer to press through
the turn then gave way in the turn. WAR ROGUE sprinted clear soon after the start out in the strip, remained outside to be four wide through the turn when
beginning to tire, continued to fade out in the strip. LIAM SKYE last away, remained always back to never threaten. MR. NASTY TIME was finished after a
half.
