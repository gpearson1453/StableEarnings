Footnotes
IMTHEPRINCE trailed into the far turn, closed rapidly, got through along the rail to make the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off to win as much the
best. SAY HEY KID never far back, rallied determinedly outside rivals and finished second best. ONLYATTHESHOE allowed to settle, moved up between
horses on the far turn then was outfinished. ADANO saved ground early then faded in the stretch. KITCHI set pressured pace while getting quick fractions
along the inside, drifted out entering the stretch to the four path then weakened. KLAATU pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted out to the six
path and weakened. NOBLE BEHAVIOR was through after a half.

GOD'S WILL BE DONE close up from the start, closed three wide through the turn then two wide through the stretch in a perfect trip and won under a strong
hand ride. SCORSESE chased the pace along the inside into the stretch, altered course sharply to the eight path nearing the furlong marker giving up some
ground then rallied to get up for second. UHAVETOBEKITTENME away alertly, set the pace near the inside to deep stretch then was outfinished.
AWESOME STEEL failed to menace. EXONERATED PREZ close up early dropped back on the turn to trail then passed a tiring rival late. WINWITHJIMMY
chased the pace two wide and was through after a half.

was no match for the winner. EXPRESS FASHION slow early, loomed boldly along the rail in upper stretch then was outfinished. MERE BAG OF SHELLS
failed to menace. A LIL COWBOY LOVIN had brief speed three wide. IN TROUBLED WATERS pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
ITASCA set the pace into the far turn, gave up the advantage, came on again regaining the lead at the furlong marker, drifted out to the three path when
struck with a left handed whip and edged clear late. COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY with the second flight three wide, dug in late four wide and got up for second.
WARRIOR'S DREAM pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the pace to mid stretch then was outfinished. DYRDEK with the
second flight two wide, moved closer in the three path in upper stretch, was shut off causing his rider to steady at the furlong marker, angled inside the
winner then lacked the needed response late. BOSS BEAR close up along the inside, altered course to the six path entering the stretch then finished
evenly. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE was no factor. GIZMO JONES was outrun. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

best. GRANDGRAN close up from the start, offered a mild bid three wide into the far turn then was no match for the winner. MAXIMIZER sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, set the pace for a little over six furlongs then was outfinished. DISCLOSURE failed to menace. LEVANTO (ARG) close up early,
