FLEETING ATTE stalked inside, was roused saving ground into the lane, and rallied. NANTASKET BEACH prompted the pace two wide, bid three wide into
the stretch, and kept on. VICTORS VALIANT led inside, was cued from two wide at the top of the lane, and faught gamely. QAADER was behind and inside
early, tipped out to the five path into the lane, and improved position. DELTA RIDGE rated from the two path, was ridden from the four path into the lane, but
finished evenly. TEPPER was slowly away and wellback early, swung out to the five path into the lane, but was one paced. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA tracked
from the two path but flattened down the stretch. STEADY JOHN chased two wide, steadied three wide into the far turn, but was never a threat. LOVE
MACHINE was unhurried in the five path and never a factor. RUBY ROAD raced from midfield in the four path but was no threat. SHUYYOOKH (IRE) was
in midpack but got shuffled out into the far turn.

Footnotes
MR BOLDACIOUS tracked along the inside early, raced in the two path entering far turn, very crafty move slipping through along the rail, surveyed the
competition leaving the quarter pole, under a long steady drive went clear late. MERCURY TEN stalked the leaders around the turn, perfect tracking position
down the backside, very enthusiastic ride leaving the three eights pole, raced four wide top of the lane, stayed under a drive through the stretch unable to
catch winner, good energy through the wire. SETTE STELLE lacked speed around the first turn, raced off the pace and well off the rail down the backside,
sent into action racing five wide at the top of the lane, finished willingly through the wire. IM YOUR PAPI racing off the early pace, found inside stalking
placing down the backside, split rivals after the quarter pole, tried through the wire. SO THERE sent into the fray early on, tracked leader, went clear nearing
the half mile marker, faded through the stretch. GREGORIA'S BAY tracked the pace setters early on, called on far turn, never threatened. KERANOS raced
along the inside, stayed inside around the far turn, when called on entering the stretch, came up empty. ARE YOU HAPPY slow to start, raced widest down
the backside, sent wide around far turn, outrun.
