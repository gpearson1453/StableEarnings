dueled with COACH ADAMS in upper stretch, dug in gamely and edged away to prevail. COACH ADAMS bobbled at the break and bumped a rival, raced
three wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and came up second
best. ABUELO NUNO vied outside of PETULANT DELIGHT for the early lead, took over, dueled inside rivals on the far turn, weakened and stayed on for
the show spot. PETULANT DELIGHT vied inside for the lead, chased on the far turn and tired. FLIPPING FISH pulled while close up inside on the
clubhouse turn, then tracked the pace, lacked a bid and faded. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE was bumped at the start and steadied, trailed the field and was

in gamely inside in the final furlong and battled to the end. POSTINO'S IDOL pressed the pace, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in
gamely between rivals, then was in tight in deep stretch and checked nearing the finish. HER NAME IS LOLA raced two wide off the pace, moved up three
wide on the far turn and rallied mildly outside. ROB THE TREASURE tracked close up on the inside, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally in the
stretch. TALE LIGHTS stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and weakened. JOY'S PRIDE raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. MODEL

pace inside, then between rivals, moved up three wide on the far turn and gained mildly outside. LARGER THAN LIFE bobbled at the break, raced three
wide early, continued three wide off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. FOOD BANK HELPER raced two wide off the pace, came
two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. HELLMAN raced off the pace inside, was shuffled back behind a tiring runner on the far turn, continued on the
rail and lacked a rally. GUN FOR SUCCESS pulled in the early stages on the rail, then tracked inside, chased on the far turn and faded. ITS OVER set the
