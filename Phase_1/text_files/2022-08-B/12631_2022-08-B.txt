Footnotes
TAMANRASSETT allowed to settle, rallied circled rivals quickly three wide on the far turn, made the lead nearing the quarter pole and drew clear late under
brisk handling. ONLYATTHESHOE stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally in the five path and finished clear for second. KITCHI dueled for
the lead along the rail into the stretch then weakened late. PALTARREVENGE was squeezed between rivals at the start then failed to menace. KLAATU
was bumped at the start then no factor. THIS MAN CAN drifted in bumping KLAATU at the start, contested the lead two wide for a half mile then was used
up.

COURTLY drifted in bumping a rival at the start, set the early pace along the rail, dropped back after a half, came on again with a rapid move in upper
stretch and drew off to win as much the best under a hand ride. BACKSPLASH never far back, rallied through the stretch four wide and finished second
best. SPECIAL BEACH hopped then was bumped at the start by the winner, sped to the lead before a half, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the four
path and was outfinished. LITTLE MATILDA trailed into the far turn then passed tiring rivals five wide. CLOSE TO ME close up, moved closer three wide
into the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. MAMBO DANCER vied for the lead three wide, offered a mild bid two wide before a half, had speed into the
stretch then came up empty. MANHATTAN LADY was through after a half.

Footnotes
BLUSHING BETTY never far back, rallied three wide into the stretch to make the lead before the eight pole, drifted to the seven path under left handed
urging and edged clear. DIVINE MARTHA broke inward bumping a rival at the start, was always close up, loomed boldly in the nine path into the stretch and
finished second best. INDY PRINCESS KOKO bobbled then was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, found her best stride late in the middle of the
racetrack and returned bleeding from the nostrils. BAREBACK FUN broke in front, set a rapid pace three wide into the stretch then tired late. LADY
VALENTINA pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. HASTY LADY was outrun, swung extremely wide entering the stretch and
passed a tiring rival near the wire well past mid track. COMPANYS COMING pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then stopped.

FAT DADDY vied for the lead along the inside, shifted out three wide nearing the far turn, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit and
edged clear late under strong handling. ITASCA pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, drifted to the five path entering the stretch,
checked inside the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and finished second best. SLICK SILVER unhurried early, swung wide and closed ground determinedly
seven wide. ZITMAN trailed for six furlongs then found his best stride late along the rail. YOUVESAIDITALL failed to menace. MAXIMIZER failed to
respond. NOBLE BEHAVIOR with the second flight two wide, gave way on the far turn. LAST DROP OF WINE away alertly, set the pace along the inside to
the five sixteenths pole then was used up. THE RIDER OF ITASCA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED

Footnotes
CENTSOFWANDER chased the pace into the stretch, rallied three wide under left handed urging and was along in time. RELEASED broke sharply, set the
pace off the rail until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. BAD LITTLE BEAST bumped at the start and finished with good courage along the rail.
STAY THIRSTY AMIGO bumped at the start, was never far back, angled out to the six path entering the stretch then finished determinedly. COMPASS
POINT chased the pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted out a bit the faded. GRAND DEAL with the second flight three wide, lacked the needed
response. SHARKS COVE trailed. PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2022-TDN-72, DATED 10/03/2022 CENTSOFWANDER WAS
DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
