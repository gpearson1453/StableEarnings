WORTHY OPPONENT pressed the pace along the inside, shifted outside the leader entering the turn, was put to a right handed whip entering the stretch,
made the lead at the furlong marker then drew off. BILLY BEACOUP allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch in the six path and finished clear for
second. MUCHO PRIMO away alertly, set the pace until mid stretch then was outfinished. KETTLE KING failed to menace. DEXQUIRE stalked the pace
three wide into the turn then faded. BIG STOCK WINNER never far back, offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then came up empty.
BLISTERING PAKSHI was no factor. WESTERN HOPE stumbled badly at the start and trailed throughout.

STORMIN'UNCLEJACK broke in full stride to set all the pace, drifted to the six path in upper stretch under right handed urging and prevailed under a strong
hand ride while drifting out slightly more nearing the wire. MOTOWN COLLECTION never far back, swung wide, rallied in the middle of the racetrack, ran up
on the winners heels causing his rider to check nearing the wire and finished clear for second. ATILANO wide early, angled inward on the turn then passed
tiring rivals in the three path. ESTILO FAVORITO stalked the pace into the stretch and lacked the needed response. AGNELLO'S DREAM bobbled the miss
stepped at the start, rushed up to pressure the winner two wide into the stretch then was used up. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN was through early.

Footnotes
SUSHI Q sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under brisk handling. HOSANNA vied for the lead near the
inside, had a mild late rally in the three path and finished second best. COSTUME JEWELRY never far back, found her best stride late outside. YOU NAME
IT stalked the pace into the stretch and finished determinedly in the six path. PENNIESANDDIMES chased the winner three wide into the stretch and faded
late. CONGRATS JENSEN had brief speed. DEB'S ALL OUT was outrun. BAY MAGIC was no threat.
