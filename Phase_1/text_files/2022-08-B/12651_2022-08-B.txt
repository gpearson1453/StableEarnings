Footnotes
PESO , jostled at the break, edged up four wide to stalk, angled five wide to make a run nearing the lane, came in a bit and closed in under right handed
asking, took a slim lead outside rivals with a sixteenth to go, came in and exchanged a bump with CARELESS KITTEN then held firm to the wire.
CARELESS KITTEN was lightly steadied off of rivals nearing the half mile marker, recovered and made a quick gain towards the rail past the five sixteenths,
steadied off heels near the quarter pole, slipped through inside soon after, eased out and bid between runners near the sixteenth pole, came out a bit and
made contact with the winner and continued gamely. CROSS EXAMINE drifted out soon after the break, lagged early, made a rail run nearing mid stretch,
angled out late and closed willingly. HIDING THE BRICK , three to four wide with pursuit of a contested early pace, edged up some mid turn, angled out
soon into the lane and churned on. SHARDIAL broke a step slow, rushed up inside and poked a head in front nearing the half mile marker, dueled under
rating, shook clear mid turn, came about two wide for the drive, failed to contain challenges nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened. RANCHO RED ,
fractious in the gate, was lightly steadied early, raced three wide around the turn, swung out and came up empty. BESAME MUCHO chased towards the
inside, raced about two wide past the quarter pole and faded. SIERRA PASS broke slowly, saved ground into the lane and failed to menace. LOOKIN TO
EXCEL , bumped and steadied at the break, raced four wide pursuing around the turn, angled very wide and faded. GABE'S MONSTER , reluctant to load,
was outrun. MOUNT OLYMPIC came out at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected to show speed, vied outside a rival, stayed on past the five
sixteenths then faltered. There was stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run and an objection by the rider of CARELESS KITTEN against the winner
alleging interference in deep stretch. No action was taken.

OFFSHORE AFFAIR took command from between rivals and cleared after a furlong, set the pace just off the inside, took outside pressure from HOLDEN
THE LUTE nearing the half mile marker, dueled from the three eighths, ceded command in mid stretch, battled back under right handed asking to reclaim
the lead with a sixteenth to go then edged away at the wire. HOLDEN THE LUTE was rated back off the winner into the first turn then angled out nearing the
backstretch, tracked three wide and in hand, took closer order after a half mile, drew alongside a furlong later and commenced a duel, came under coaxing
past the five sixteenths, gained a slim lead a furlong out, failed to maintain the advantage past the sixteenth pole and weakened very late. LORD DRAGON
broke a beat slow, dropped inside early, moved up to the inside of rivals near the half mile pole, emerged as the closest pursuer leaving the three eighths,
shifted four wide for the drive but lacked a serious punch. COLONELSDARKTEMPER bumped with LEPRINO at the break, raced four wide between rivals
through the backstretch, chased to the three eighths and faded. FALSELY ACCUSED , two wide between runners heading to the far turn, weakened.
LEPRINO , bumped at the start, tracked three wide early on, was joined from both side and chased three wide between runners through the backstretch,
shifted in some and gave way. LOUD MOUTH lost ground five wide outside rivals, chased to the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
LIBERTY FOREVER quickly went clear, dropped over to about the two path and set the pace, was nudged along to maintain a clear lead mid turn,
responded to firm encouragement through the final furlong and kept OFFLEE ICY at bay. OFFLEE ICY drifted in at the break and brushed with ORTH,
tracked inside under some coaxing, eased out in upper stretch, edged up past mid stretch, remained on his left lead and kept on gamely to earn the place.
LET'S ACCLIMATE stalked three wide, moved closer mid turn, wandered outward pursuing past mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. GRAZED broke a
step slow then steadied, edged up and angled out leaving the far turn, circled and had a mild kick. ORTH , brushed at the break, raced inside foes and then
steadied when attempting to get out a bit nearing the three eighths, recovered to chase inside then lacked a solid stretch kick. TOUCH OF ZEN was
steadied in the opening sixteenth while inside, checked off heels nearing the quarter pole, angled four wide, dropped back in for the final furlong and had

Footnotes
BRITTLE AND YOO settled nicely into the first turn then was taken about five wide past the five eighths, moved up comfortably outside rivals into the far
turn, dropped in and gained three wide nearing the lane, closed in under some left handed asking, got the better of TROPICANA GIRL leaving mid stretch
and widened under a steady hand ride. TROPICANA GIRL was hustled clear early, set the pace slightly off the inside, took pressure from the half mile pole,
edged away a bit nearing the lane then braced for a challenge from the winner, fought on holding a slim lead past the furlong grounds then gave way
grudgingly while well clear of the rest. SUGAR KISSES broke slowly, lagged back early, made steady progress while saving ground from the three eighths
to mid stretch then flattened out. V BUCKS prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, moved to apply more pressure near the half mile pole, forced
the issue to the head of the lane, failed to kick on from there and gave way. LADY PROTONICO , between rivals nearing the far turn, angled wide but
lacked a bid. LIVIN' AT THE BU , close up inside early while trying to get out, saved ground chasing the pace, was under a hearty ride past the three
eighths, angled wide into the lane and came up empty. WILD ARCH , fidgety when the gates opened and was moving backwards, came away second last
then rushed up and angled out, lost ground four wide leaving the far turn and faded. RED PANTY NIGHT was a bit keen and steadied off the leader into the
first turn, stalked between rivals then dropped back around the final turn. PAWNEE , four wide, faltered leaving the far turn then was eased through the
drive.

Footnotes
ABINADI sped clear early and dictated the pace just off the inside, responded and spurted away leaving the three sixteenths, wandered out several paths
despite the efforts of his jockey with right handed asking then held sway. SAM MALONE stalked inside a host of rivals, eased out under asking into the lane,
straightened heading to mid stretch and kept on with good energy to earn the place. MOR TEQUILA drifted in at the break, corrected and pulled his way
forward behind rivals, angled out leaving the far turn, made a bold five wide run outside runners into the lane, gave hard chase past mid stretch then
flattened out. BOLT FROM HEAVEN , three wide stalking the pace, pursued between foes mid turn, shifted in through the drive but lacked a bid. SOUTH
COAST ROUTE prompted the pace four wide, took closer order outside foes mid turn, chased into the lane and faded. LITTLEBROTHERJOEY flashed
speed then tracked two wide between runners, failed to go on while under pressure past the quarter pole and faded. BUFFETT , away slowly after hopping,
dropped in early, stayed inside but failed to make an impact. NAK NAK BOLT , four wide chasing the pace, angled very wide for the drive but lacked a
response. HADLEES HONOR broke a step slow, was climbing early on and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TURN ON THE JETS (IRE) showed speed then was rated back off the leaders and tracked two wide, shifted in and awaited room around the turn, eased
out and found room past the eighth pole, quickened when put to right handed asking, gained a slim lead inside the sixteenth pole, battled outside his stable
mate and proved best. GREGORY'S PRIDE , off the pace and outside a rival, angled out past the quarter pole, move up behind foes then dove inside
leaving the furlong grounds, moved to near even terms, fought valiantly but wasn't quite good enough. I'LL STAND TALLER broke a step slow, edged up in
hand while saving ground, swung out into the lane and finished with good energy. MAC DADDY TOO moved up nearing the half mile pole and got engaged
in a duel outside PARTY GAME (IRE), carried that scrum past the eighth pole, was floated out some but continued on with effort. PARTY GAME (IRE)
advanced inside rivals to put a head in front leaving the half mile marker, sparred into the turn to past mid stretch while clinging to a slim lead, wandered
outward and faded. JOHNNY PODRES , three wide while not too far back, angled six wide for the drive but lacked a serious run. RAGING WATERS was
steadied off foes early, steadied again around the turn, saved ground into the lane but failed to menace. TIME TO PARTY , in close attendance of the duel
while three wide, was fanned four wide into the lane, failed to kick on in mid stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BOX OF CHOCOLATES , fractious in the gate, broke a bit slowly, recovered and was nudged up towards the rail, steadily progressed leaving the far turn,
came under firmer asking when sustaining past the quarter pole, slipped through to the inside of foes to take over nearing mid stretch then kicked away
under a right handed drive. SQUALOTORO , off the pace and towards the inside, gained under asking nearing the lane, swung six wide in upper stretch,
straightened and closed willingly to gain the place. PARTY TOWN , four then three wide, moved up outside a rival into the lane to threaten, battled past
three sixteenths, failed to kick on heading to the sixteenth pole, stayed on his left lead and was out finished for the place. CATBERNAY drafted back early,
was under pressure while between runners near the quarter pole, swung out and had some late action. SUMO drifted in at the break and brushed with
RIVER TIBER, moved up between rivals nearing the half mile marker and stalked, was urged to the inside of PARTY TOWN while pursuing into the lane
then weakened through the final sixteenth. STAR ENTRY , well back around the turn, raced two to three wide in upper stretch and had belated action. BIG
SCOTT DADDY , four to five wide, offered a mild kick but failed to make any real impact. WINHAPPY , quickly went clear, set a rated pace two wide, gave
some resistance soon into the lane, fought on to mid stretch then weakened. BEING BLESSED chased the early pace, shifted out five wide and tired.
RIVER TIBER , brushed at the break then steadied, was urged three wide, angled in and tired.

Footnotes
OUBABE , quickly to contention, shadowed the leader while in hand, moved to command leaving the five sixteenths, spurted clear when given his cue soon
after, drifted out steadily through the final furlong but held firm under right handed asking. FORE FLAG , taken to rate while towards the inside, moved up
leaving the far turn, eased out and knifed his way between foes approaching the stretch, shifted out and had aim on the winner in mid stretch, gave game
chase from there but was denied. ATTENZIONE , off the pace four wide, circled five wide with some momentum into the lane and churned on to gain the
show. AGADOR SPARTACUS , well placed saving ground and under rating, took closer order with three eighths remaining, angled three wide with pursuit
past the five sixteenths, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and gave way. THREECARDMONTE stalked three wide and outside a rival, moved up
leaving the three eighths, chased under a ride into the lane and gave way. ARTISTIC SERVE saved ground off the early pace, moved up some into the
lane, angled out but failed to sustain. NAUGHTY NIKO broke slowly, saved some ground and failed to menace. PEACE TOUR , sluggish early, found
himself far back through the backstretch run and failed to really pick things up. STREET HUMOR grabbed command early, set a pressured pace towards
the rail, ceded the lead near the five sixteenths, stayed on to upper stretch then faltered.
