Footnotes
MR LIBERTY pressed the pace from the two path, was in a steady drive to gain command at the seven sixteenth pole, shook clear in the upper stretch and
was held to task under a strong hand drive. JACKYS BACK settle along the inside, was saving ground on the backstretch to bid two wide on the far turn and
closed strongly in the stretch and was up for second place. ASHWINS ORB stumbled badly at the start, then tracked the pace from the inside to rally four
wide entering the home stretch and closed well and just missed the place prize. SUPER LIAISON set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive headed
into the far turn then faded and had no final bid.

Footnotes
HARVEY'S PRINCESS was unrushed while three wide, rallied at the three-eighths pole and drew off while ridden out for the win. WICKED INTENT was off
awkwardly, trailed, angled four wide at the three-eighths pole and rallied belatedly. RE ANTE raced inside, lacked room at the three-sixteenths pole, then
split rivals at the eighth pole and closed fast. ONLY TIME bid in the five path on the far turn but couldn't gain late. CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY raced in the
four path but had no late bid. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI dueled outside of the leader but couldn't last. PRINTER'S ROW saved ground to no avail. LEMON
ROSES dueled inside of a foe but couldn't last in the stretch. REVELING vied between foes early, pressed in the three path but then faded in the stretch.
ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE was not a factor.

Footnotes
POETIC VERSE chased the pace while four wide, was moving up to the two path on the turn to duel for the lead in the stretch and was up at the wire to
prevail. UNBRIDLED VICTORY set the pace while two wide, then was challenged for the lead by an outer rival on the turn to duel down the stretch but hung
in the end. SMOOTH JUSTICE chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive on the turn to rally in the stretch and held on for third place.
DONTYOUREMEMBER settled along the inside, then bid on the turn and closed well in the stretch but it wasn't enough. COMPRESSED ENERGY chased
the pace from the inside then faded on the turn, rallied in the upper stretch but came up evenly. E STREET ANGEL broke awkwardly at the start, then was
unhurried early and no menace. BLU VIXEN tracked the pace from the four path, was gaining ground on the turn but never fired in the stretch. MISS
DEPUTY STAR tracked the pace from the inside, then came out four to five wide on the turn, was in a hard drive then stopped.

BASSCOAT raced midpack, then angled six wide in the stretch and rallied for the place. BRENTSPENCE stalked the pace in the four path, rallied five wide
at the eighth pole and was just caught for the place. HITCHPIN pressed the early pace, settled to stalk the pace in the three path, bid on the far turn but had
no closing bid. AWESOME JUSTICE raced in the three path with a mile late bid. WHITE SILVER SANDS raced inside, bid at the quarter pole, was steadied
at the three-sixteenths pole and lost momentum. MISTER MACHO dueled inside of INDY BIZ and both gave way in the stretch. WHISKEY WEEKEND and
MONTREUX saved ground to no avail. CONSIDER saved ground and was no factor. COG raced in the four path and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
TANGO CHARLIE tracked the pace from the four path, was moving up on the turn to rally gamely in the stretch and was up just in time to prevail.
COMISKEY PARK broke outwardly at the start, then set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive heading into the stretch but was caught late and was
second best. AMONGST FRIENDS was bumped at the start then raced behind the field while two to three wide, was gaining on the turn to menace while
five wide in the stretch and was closing well. CLASSIC KING chased the pace from the inside then made a mild bid in the stretch but it wasn't enough.
STOP HAMMERTIME hopped at the start then was unhurried early, came out five wide on the turn to close willingly in the stretch. CARAMELITO chased
the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive to rally in the early stretch but came up evenly. BEEALEA was bumped at the start then settled along the
inside and was no threat. BIG NICK stalked the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive, was used up on the turn then tired in the stretch. SKYLINE chased
the pace from the two path then dropped back on the turn and was no menace.

BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN settled well back out of the gate, bid at the five-eighths pole, then rallied six wide at the three-eighths pole, circled the field and
was up in time under steady urging. EVIL EYE stalked the pace between foes, steadied at the three-eighths pole in traffic, then rallied four wide inside of the
winner. NOBRAG JUSTFACT saved ground early, angled five wide at the three-eighths pole, circled the field to be clear in the stretch but couldn't hold off
the closers. ALL WEST was unrushed inside, rallied at the quarter pole along the rail, then closed late between foes. FIREWATER JAKE saved ground, bid
at the half-mile mark, raced three wide in the stretch and faltered late. STEWARDS RULES led inside and then gave way late. CRIMINAL DEFENSE
improved position late outside. THRU THE VINE showed brief speed in the four path, stalked five wide, then gave way in the stretch. UNBRIDLED BEAST
raced evenly. MOMENT pressed the pace in the three path to the far turn and gave way. MYSTERY UNBRIDLED pressed the pace to the far path between
foes and gave way.
