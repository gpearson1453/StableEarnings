Footnotes
BELLA MARIA saved ground throughout, bid and edged ahead in the final sixteenth following a long drive. SNAPPY RIDE forced the pace along the rail,
angled out at the quarter pole, led briefly but was outfinished. SO SWELL outrun early, moved wide on the turn then very wide in the lane rallying. IMAGISM
vied three wide, shook loose into the far turn then weakened in the stretch. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL trailed early along the inside then showed some late
energy. SANTAFE EXPRESS prompted the pace between rivals then began fading on the turn. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY made a menacing wide move on
the turn then proved empty in the stretch. GUNS UP lacked speed and gave way readily.

HE'SSOSUBTLE firmly rated outside, took over into the stretch and remained clear while kept to his task. GRAZELY settled wide, advanced very wide then
made a gradual late gain. D BLACK MAMBA vied along the inside, faded on the final turn then came again. PORSUPUESTO hustled to a narrow advantage
inside, led to the stretch then faded. AYE saved ground, dropped back on the final turn and was no factor. MINE NOT MINE dropped back early and was
never in contention. SHANGHAI CANDY raced far behind outside and was never a factor. PRINCE CHAMP lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

HARD STING settled at the back of pack, circled rivals rallying into the stretch and drew off under moderate coaxing. IRISH HONOR prompted the pace
between rivals, faded briefly near the top of the lane then came again to earn place. INDOCTRINATE stumbled at the break, led inside, was collared and
held on gamely while losing advantage. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE pressed the leader three wide to midstretch then flattened out. HE RUNS THE LINE
flashed speed inside then gave way readily. JOHNNY SACK saved ground off the leaders then faltered on the final turn.

RISQUE REBEL controlled the pace, repelled challenges by the runner-up and edged away under a drive. CELTIC TREASURE pressed the winner, loomed
a threat into the stretch but could not get by the winner. DRENA'S BULLET saved ground, moved closer on the final turn and finished willingly. SILVER
FURY settled inside, angled out on the final turn and flattened. SON OF A SAINT dropped back early, raced very wide on both turns and was no factor.
TACTICAL PLAN trailed early outside and lacked a rally. KINGS HIGHWAY was urged close up briefly then gave way readily. POLITICAL angled inside
after a quarter mile and was never in contention.

final eighth. ICONIC LEGACY trailed to the stretch then caught fading rivals late. INEVTABL CONECTION prompted the pace inside to the stretch and
faltered. PRIVATE SECTOR settled close up three wide to the quarter pole and faded.

went after the winner on the turn but was no match for the winner. POR UNA CABEZA broke slowly, advanced wide and finished nicely while no threat.
WISE AND ELEGANT raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and proved empty in the stretch. CIVIL NOTION dropped back inside, moved wide on the
turn with a mild bid. BELLA PALOMA chased outside off the leaders and faded on the turn. KAREN'S HONOR hustled just off the leaders down the
backstretch and gave way. LADY THOR broke sluggishly, chased inside and failed to respond. AZTEC BAY was hustled close up inside briefly then
stopped.

Footnotes
BEST ACTOR drifted wide into the first turn, rated close up, took over easily midway on the final turn, drifted in early stretch and drew away under a drive.
KISSALOT stalked the pace three wide, bid on the final turn continued gamely for the place but was no match for the winner. CREATIVE MINISTER settled
inside, moved closer after half a mile, angled out in the stretch with only a mild bid. GOLDEN ALCHEMIST raced off the pace in the two path, moved wide
on the final turn but had no kick. PRACTICAL COACH broke alertly and led inside, was collared midway on the final turn and weakened. CLAPTON broke
sluggishly, raced very wide and lacked a solid rally. WITTY broke slowest, chased between rivals in traffic and faltered. PIONEER OF MEDINA rated off the
pace outside then gave way near the far turn.

Footnotes
WHAT'S TO BLAME outrun early, swung wide rallying at the quarter pole then closed strongly to get up in time. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF controlled the pace
inside, moved clear to the final sixteenth but was nailed nearing the wire. GEEBERT settled behind wall of pacesetters, faded on the turn, mopved very wide
and closed well too late. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY prompted the pace three wide, loomed threat but flattened out. GOLDEN SPOKE chased just off pace
outside and proved empty in the stretch. KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE forced the pace along the inside then weakened in the stretch. TEXAS BASIN dropped
back after the start and trailed throughout.
