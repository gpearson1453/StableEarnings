Footnotes
HEAVENLY HEART stalked the early pace two wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and drew off in the stretch
to prove much the best under left handed crop urging. MISSING A SOCK was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, then proved to
be no match for the winner while clearly second best. BO RUNKLE dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive, bested rest. ROSE VALLEY
dueled for the lead two wide and weakened. CEETA was reluctant to load, chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
LIVE FIRE was well placed early and saved ground on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn and kicked clear by the furlong marker, then held sway
late to prove best under a drive. COURT AND SPARK chased the early pace and was on the inside to two wide leaving the turn, then moved back down to
the inside and closed well. ROBBY'S RANSOM tracked the pace and was three to four wide on the turn and was gaining late. BLAME IT ON HONEY
dueled for the lead on the inside and was two wide by the quarter pole, faded the final furlong. SUNSHINE MAX was settled early, then was four to five wide
on the turn and had no kick. DRAMATIZED was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the drive and had a belated rally. MORNING
MARCH failed to menace. UNCLE REMI dueled for the lead three wide and stopped.

pops with the crop, then was shown the crop late while well clear. BARISTA VIXEN tracked the early pace four wide, then was three wide by the quarter
pole and failed to gain, second best. HELLO ROSIE SAY was four wide into the first turn, then reserved on the inside, then shifted out on the far turn and

leaving the turn and had a late rally to best the rest. SCARY LARRY was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was two wide by the quarter pole and
had no rally. FREEDOM'S START chased the pace on the inside and weakened. BUFF AND SHINE broke outwardly, settled while four wide and had no

Footnotes
DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then dug in gamely in the stretch and held on to prove best under
a drive. UNIMPEACHABLE was bumped soundly and forced out at the start, then recovered to tracked the pace from the outside, made a three to four wide
bid by the quarter pole, then was slowly gaining on the winner late and was impeded in late stretch but came up short. TUCKERTON BAY was outrun early,
then shifted out on the turn and came wide into the lane and had a belated rally to best the rest. DUNE DUNE broke outwardly at the start, pressed the pace
three wide and angled out leaving the furlong marker and was empty. SPEED SLOT was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked a rally. DAKOTA
OUTLAW was allowed to settle and advanced three wide on the turn but lacked a late response. MISTER GARY chased the pace on the inside and
stopped.
