INEXPENSIVE STAR was chasing the leader to the backstretch, responded when roused leaving the quarter pole, rallied three wide to get on terms in
upper stretch and drove clear in the final sixteenth. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST set the pace to the backstretch, was two wide, resisted the winner to the stretch
then was overtaken and held second. WARNING SOUND had no speed, saved ground on both turns and closed a gap to the line. HILLSDALE NATION
was outsprinted while three wide, remained three wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response.

AFTER SUNDOWN was well placed to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then battled on late to best SECRETLY PARANOIDE. The latter
pressed the leader to the backstretch, was outkicked to the second turn but rallied two wide to the stretch, engaged for the lead in mid stretch but was
bested late. CHIEFS LIL PEARL hopped slightly at the start, chased the pace to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch but was outfinished to the
line. MERGIE TROID broke out sharply, was corrected but trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but did not threaten. HYPHY hustled to the
front, pushed away on the backstretch but tired after a half mile.

Footnotes
TIMBERLAKE GAGE was pushed out four deep to the backstretch, moved up to engage for the lead into the second turn, drove clear to mid stretch and
held. TIGER MOM had no speed, bid two wide into the second turn, could not threaten the winner but gamely saved the place. SOMARA broke in a tangle,
chased to the backstretch, checked inside of TIGER MOM into the second turn then lacked a closing bid. KAYLA'S COWGIRL was forced five wide on the
first turn, chased to the second turn, got outkicked to the stretch and did not rally. SWISS SCRIPT hustled to the front but drifted out three wide to the
backstretch, was overtaken into the second turn then weakened. A claim of foul by the rider on SOMARA against the rider on TIGER MOM for alleged
interference into the second turn was dismissed by the stewards.

GRIGORO settled for a half mile, rallied three wide leaving the quarter pole, pushed to the front a sixteenth out and edged clear. NICOLE GRACE broke a
bit slow and lagged for a half mile, advanced inside on the far turn then swung out into the stretch and closed willingly. COWLITZ attended the pace for five
furlongs, inched to the front then was collared in upper stretch and lost the place late. PULPIT SINGER contested the pace inside of COWLITZ, saved
ground but was outkicked on the far turn and weakened. SUBTLE RIDE had no speed and settled for a half then saved ground to no avail. RAMONCITA
LIGHT tracked the leaders for a half mile but gave way in the final quarter.

WILL IS CHILL was unhurried for a half, saved ground while rallying on the far turn, took over and edged away. DREAMER'S REALITY was allowed to
settle, bid three wide to the stretch and was second best. PERSEVERANCE was four wide on the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch but was
outfinished. FORT YORK trailed for a half mile, came two wide on the far turn and made a belated bid. ZOE'S PAPA CEE pressed the pace for a half mile
then tired. SNICKER'N DAN hustled to contest the pace, was overtaken after a half mile and also tired.

Footnotes
STRIKE IT LUCKY was outsprinted, tracked the pace, rallied three wide on the second turn, got to terms, was engaged by the runnerup and dug in
determinedly to get the nod. DEBT MONGER had no speed, circled rivals four wide while rallying on the second turn, got to terms with the winner, battled
but missed. DUMB LUCK hustled along early, got outsprinted down the backstretch, pressed to the second turn, was outkicked to the stretch and finished
evenly. STARBOARD LIST was sent for speed, got fanned out to the four path to the backstretch, edged away to the second turn then saved ground but
tired in the final furlong. STANFORD BAY tracked the pace for three furlongs, shifted off the rail on the second turn but lacked a closing response.
RHODIUM RUNNER was four wide to the backstretch, trailed to the stretch and did not rally.
