Footnotes
THE CAIRO KID sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, raced along the inner rail the final quarter mile and was ridden out. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS , a
forward factor throughout, raced near the inner rail around the turn, chased the winner and held the place. COMMITTEEMAN , two to three wide around the
turn, chased the winner and weakened. PERSONAL MEADOW lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and
showed some late interest. DONTCROSSFUZZY , no factor, swung outside leaving the turn. JAIME JAMEL trailed.

Footnotes
MIDDLE EARTH prompted four wide outside rivals into the first turn, chased the dueling leaders three wide from the three eighths to the eighth pole, shifted
out in upper stretch, made a grinding run and got up in the final yards. BET ON BITZ put a head in front between runners into the first turn, secured the
inside leaving the half mile marker, dueled then stayed on after being headed near the three eighths, kept up the battle under a hustling ride into the lane,
drifted out a bit nearing the wire and stayed gamely to get the place. WINSTON'S GOLD , three wide between runners early, sparred outside BET ON BITZ
from the half mile marker, held a slim advantage into the lane, fought on past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly while in close quarters between
runners at the wire. NO MONEY DOWN was hustled up inside rivals soon after the break and contested the pace, drifted a bit into the first turn, dropped
back off the leaders leaving the half mile marker and failed to respond. ON A WHIM , off the rail, failed to keep pace and dropped back.

HAIR OF THE DOG bore in leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail stalking the pace to the quarter pole, angled outside approaching the stretch, too
command between horses near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. FORE ON SEVEN prompted the pace outside LOADED SNIPER, dropped back a bit
leaving the far turn, was three deep turning for home and gamely regained the place. SNOW CANDY lacked speed, raced in the two path on both turns and
rallied between horses. LOADED SNIPER broke well and quickly sprinted clear, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened late. FIVE STAR PHIL ,
swung to the three path entering the backstretch, circled the far turn four deep and failed to rally. RED MESA , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced
along the inner rail on the far turn and weakened. TRUTH SERUM was no factor.

HIGHLAND DREAM vied inside under rating, moved clear after a half mile, spurted away leaving the quarter pole, wandered outward a bit through the lane
and proved much the best under a mild hand ride. SLOE GIN BIZ , three deep past the five eighths, dropped in and forced the pace outside the winner,
failed to keep pace leaving the quarter pole but stayed on with effort to be clear for the place. CALLYOURIGHTBACK , sluggish from the gate, moved up
wide to a stalking spot nearing the half mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn, failed to keep up entering the lane and faded. GALWAY LAD ,
between rivals early disputing the pace, dropped back past the half mile marker, raced between runners into the lane but lacked a serious response.
STAVANGER drifted out at the break and bumped with BOUBOLINO, lagged back, circled four wide into the lane but lacked a bid. BOUBOLINO stumbled
at the break then was bumped, saved ground with early pursuit and gave way.

Footnotes
DRIVE BY LAYOVER pressed the pace outside I'D LIKE TO KNOW, poked a head in front while between rivals after a half mile, turned away SEANY P and
kicked away leaving the quarter pole, dropped in towards the rail, was kept alert with one ask with the right stick and widened. SEANY P saved ground into
the first turn, angled out and moved up three deep to bid nearing the five sixteenths, pressed, failed to keep up with the winner past the quarter pole but kept
on willingly to hold down the place. CONFUSION BABY BOY , taken to rate four wide early on, came under pressure leaving the far turn, moved up a bit
into the stretch then flattened out. MUCHO MAS GRANDE , in a bit close at the break, lagged well back, saved ground into the lane and had belated action.
SPITBALL was rated back from between runners nearing the first turn, dropped in while well back, angled four wide for the drive but failed to menace.
JAMMIN STILL lost ground four to five wide and failed to threaten. I'D LIKE TO KNOW sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside then was joined by
the winner heading to the half mile marker, staved that one off for nearly a half mile, chased past the three sixteenths then faltered.

between horses on the turn and rallied. TWENTYFORKARATROSE hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and finished willingly.
HEARD , three wide around the turn, chased the winner and weakened. I HAVE COURAGE drifted in leaving the starting gate, was rank when straightened
soon after the break and showed some late interest. TWIZLERS HURRICANE was not a factor.

ANOTHERDAYGONEBY hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and determinedly edged clear late. GALACTIC TIDE disputed the pace outside the winner
in a very game effort. MYSISTERNANCY , three wide the first turn, remained off the rail and chased the pace in an even effort. WATER FIGHT , always well
off the inner rail, was not a factor. HONOR THE TRUTH , along the inner rail around the first turn, raced three deep on the far turn and was not a factor.
ANATH , a forward factor just off the inner rail, stalked the pace and faltered leaving the backstretch.
