Footnotes
MACHOS VISION settled in the middle of the pack move out to three wide in upper stretch and wore down the leader to prove best. OUT OF THE SKY was
hustled to the lead to set all the pace, could not fend off the outside late closer in the final furlong and was caught in the final yards. DONNAS FINAL WORD
was placed off the pace setter in the three path moved to engage leader at the quarter pole but couldn't match strides. A BUNCH FOR LUNCH saved
ground to no avail. HEY ROXY was hustled along to make a three wide bid on the turn and faltered. AL'S PRINCESS was not a threat.

Footnotes
OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL was positioned off the pace then took the lead at the eighth pole and was kept to task. RYRYSWEETIE raced in the middle of the
pack from the two path made a late surge to be up for the place. DABBLIN CHANNEL raced in the middle of the pack from the two to three path made a bid
in the stretch but was outkicked for the place. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS raced near the back early then steadily advanced through the turn moved out to five
wide in upper stretch to rally but was not enough. THAT'S ALL RIGHT sprinted to the lead to set all the pace was caught at the eighth pole and was empty.
SOJOURNER TRUTH settled in the two path made a mild bid on the turn to give late effort and improved position. IZE DISCREET ROSE was forwardly
placed in the three path and gave way late. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY was close up on the inside but weakened late. MILLI STARR was placed in the middle
of the pace while racing four wide throughout made a bid on the turn and tired in the drive. JUST LEAVE was never a threat. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL had a
wide trip.

out to four wide in upper stretch for a late run but was too late. INAGOODWAY pressed the pace from between horses and weakened. AMERICAN
REALITY vied for the lead from the inside and gave way. CLUBHOUSE SAINT tracked the leaders from the inside and retreated.
