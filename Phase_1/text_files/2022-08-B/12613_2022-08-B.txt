Footnotes
MELTDOWN was in a steady drive on the backstretch to track the pace from the two path, then was moving up on the far turn to gain command in upper
stretch, rallied and held on well driving to the wire. EGOMANIAC settled along the inside and reserved ground on the backstretch, then was gaining ground
on the far turn to rally in the upper stretch and closed well but it was not enough to catch the leader. GEMO RAIN was bumped slightly at the start then
dueled for the lead into the first turn, then drew away mid back stretch to set the pace into the second turn, was used up then flattened out. EL BOHEMIO
was bumped at the start, then dueled from the two path into early backstretch, was headed by the inner rival, was in a hard drive entering the second turn,
was used up and weakened in the lane. OVERTHOUGHT was unhurried early then bid mildly on the far turn and was no threat. RECKLESSNESS chased
the pace along the inside, then dropped back on the backstretch and failed to menace.

D'ORO'S WISH vied inside, was headed at the sixteenth pole and fought back late under mild urging. SPOKE vied three wide, led at the sixteenth pole but
yielded late. RIVER ANT vied between rivals to the stretch and gave way. MISCHIEVIOUSBUD stalked the pace in the three path, then lacked a late bid.
INDIGO RICH stalked the pace in the three path but had no closing bid. BOLD BIZNESS stalked the pace in the four path with no bid. BLAZEN JUSTICE
was no factor in the four path. The race was hand-timed due to a timer malfunction.

MAGNIFICENTREVENGE chased the dueling pair from the inside, then came out four wide on the turn to menace in the stretch, then drew clear in the final
furlong under a strong hand drive to prevail. ROCK OF CASHEL dueled while two wide into the turn, continued to menace gamely in the early stretch then
gave way in the end. WISHED tracked the pace from the inside into the turn then closed fast down the lane but it was not enough. SHARP JUSTICE was in
a steady drive to duel for the lead from the inside into the turn, then menaced in early stretch, was used up and weakened in the end. FARM SAFETY
chased the pace while three wide then rallied in upper stretch then flattened out. BEAUTIFUL D chased the pace while three wide then made a mild bid on
the turn and was no menace. WICKED JUSTICE raced behind the field while in the three path and was no menace. KATIECAN'TKEEPUP was unhurried
early and no factor.
