dueled with FREE SHOT in deep stretch and got the nod on the wire. FREE SHOT chased on the inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, put a head in
front at the sixteenth marker, then dueled to the wire and just missed. LADY LANCER raced off the pace, advanced two wide on the turn, came three wide
into the lane and rallied late outside. ALWAYS ELLE chased outside, chased into the stretch and finished evenly. SIRENETTA raced off the pace inside and
closed belatedly on the rail. WEST VIRGINIA GAL stumbled badly at the start, was outrun early and closed belatedly inside. FAIR AND TRUE raced off the
