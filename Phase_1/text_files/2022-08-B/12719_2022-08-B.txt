Footnotes
RITHM NIC led the field between horses up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the
wire. COFFEE CALIENTE tracked the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path, could not go
with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. ALCAZABA (IRE) stalked the frontrunner on the outside in the early going, began a four wide bid
coming around the turn, was outkicked by the eventual winner in the lane and kept on to the wire. STOMPING MOON chased the leader between horses up
the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. RESPOND chased the pace setter on the inside in the opening stages,
saved ground around the turn and tired in the lane. MAIRIVERSTORM hopped up leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the inside for the run
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never a threat. STAR READY raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the
turn from the two and three path and made no bid.

MIDNIGHT GARDEN dueled on the outside up the backstretch, battled from the three path around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off to the
wire. STARS OF BLUEGRASS chased the leaders from the middle of the pack in the early going, raced in the three path around the turn and kept on to the
wire. EVEN PANDURA dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, gave way while saving ground around the turn and finished evenly.
WHERE'S FRANKIE dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and tired in the
final furlong. STARLIGHT TWIST trailed the field the entire way around the oval and despite saving ground was never a factor.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA RED led the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the far turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire. OPTION bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn,
tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and improved position on the rail in the lane while never threatening the winner.
KEEN RESPONSE trailed the field on the inside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid approaching the
quarter pole and gained ground in tight quarters between horses while proving to be no match for the winner. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY raced in the two path
around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch while
finishing evenly. BON DEUX tracked the leader on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn in the three path and faded
in the lane. SWAMPDRAINER saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two and three path
around the second bend and flattened out from there. GRUNDER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the far turn
in the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid. MONGOLIAN BONUS raced at the back of the pack on the inside around the first turn
and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was never a factor. PERIPATETIC hit the gate and bumped soundly with the
horse to her outside at the break, settled off the pace on the outside for the opening half mile, moved up from the three path coming around the far turn and
was empty from there.

LUVIN BULLIES raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position in the
lane. SILVER COIN chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing
evenly. SOUTHERN VENTURE dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn, gave way
entering the stretch and tired from there. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME chased the leaders on the inside in the early going, began to drop back while saving
ground around the turn and flattened further in the lane. HEY HEY raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three
path and was empty in the stretch. BABY BEE MERRY stalked the pace setters on the outside in the opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn
and faded from there. GRAND SLAM HOMERUN raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, trailed the field while saving ground around the
turn and was not a factor.
