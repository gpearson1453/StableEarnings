Footnotes
OHEAVENS broke sharp to be in front after the start, surrendered the lead inside momentarily through the turn with a half to run, took control entering the
stretch, opened up quickly when asked nearing the furlong marker and won comfortably in the end. HALLANVAARA was allowed to settle early trailing after
the break, began to pick up runners just outside with three eighths to go, rallied in upper stretch racing five wide and finished up well to be the best of the
rest while not threatening the winner late. SWEET SHADES settled near the rear inside in the early stages, was roused up the fence two furlongs out and
showed some good interest late getting up for third. STORM GAUGE tracked the contested pacesetters through the turn in the three path, asked for run
turning for home between foes and showed some energy through the lane to get a small award. FREDERICIA trailed the field travelling through the turn,
roused on the fence with a quarter to go and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. KERICS BEAUTY tracked the leaders in the second flight running four wide
through the turn, was asked for run at the top of the stretch, offered little response and faded at the furlong marker. RUM RAISIN contested the early pace
down the backside, poked her head in front with a half to go racing two wide, was headed between runners turning for home and faltered through the field in
mid stretch.

HALF TO RELOAD was forwardly-positioned early while angling in, eased back from between runners off the pace to track in behind and between the
second flight, went two to three wide on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit in upper- to mid-stretch, struck the lead by the sixteenth
pole and kicked clear. MIA'S LIL ANGEL settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, had room inside leaving that bend, gained in the stretch, came out a
path past the sixteenth pole for room and got up for second. IT'S TRUE was coaxed forward inside to challenge for the lead, dueled into the turn, edged
clear turning for home, was collared a sixteenth out and lost place late. TODAY raced off the pace three to four wide, asked for a bit more about the
three-eighths, swung seven wide into the stretch and kept on for the minor award. CANDY STREET tracked from inside the second flight, angled four wide
into the stretch, switched outside a rival five deep in upper stretch, was outkicked. SUNYANI prompted the pace from outside then dueled into the turn going
two then three wide on that bend, weakened in the stretch. JIM'S HOPE was allowed to settle at the rear, saved ground inside early on the turn, fanned
eight wide out of that bend, ran on well but too late. DON'T STOP DREAMIN raced mid-pack four wide on the turn coming into upper stretch six deep, was
in a bit tight behind and between runners late. TREJO broke inwardly, raced mostly four wide, failed to threaten. ONE MORE RING shifted in to track in
behind the leaders in the second flight two to three wide, came up empty. BIG INVESTMENT tossed his head at the start and got away a step slowly then
moved forward outside under some urging to gain closer order on the leaders, pursued three wide through the turn and was empty for the drive. FAVOR
THE BRAVE raced off the pace two to three wide, came into upper stretch four to five deep, made no bid.

TALK TO YA LATER broke a bit slow after the start, was allowed to trail in the early stages behind the four contesting frontrunners at the half, waited behind
horses with three eighths to go, angled out at the quarter pole to quickly pass foes, had dead aim for the leader turning for home and took control at the
furlong marker to win going away in the end. BAKSHEESH was brushed at the start, quickly recovered to have a short lead into the turn, opened up on her
contesting pace rivals two furlongs out but could not find enough in mid stretch to hold off the fast closing winner. CHROMA challenged on the rail for the
front early, was ridden to keep inside position through the turn, was shuffled back to near the rear with a quarter to go and rebid between rivals through the
lane to capture third money. ABSOLUTE JEWEL pressed for the lead travelling in the three path between horses down the backside, was roused between
runners through the turn only to be relegated to last turning for home and passed a tiring runner while drifting inwards in deep stretch. UNABLE contested
for the lead racing four wide outside of rivals down the backstretch, put in a mild run rallying three wide mid point on the turn, began to weaken turning for
home and faltered through the stretch.

Footnotes
SANDY BAY lacked early speed, switched outside foes racing at the rear, went three then four wide outside on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch,
was gaining fast late and just got up. SUNSPEAR settled in behind just off the leaders tracking inside, bid up the rail in mid-stretch taking a narrow lead past
the furlong marker, led till the final strides and was just caught. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR vied inside runners for the lead, came off the rail turning for
home, drifted out a bit in the stretch, kept on but was outfinished. SOUPER SUCCESS shifted in two to three wide racing toward the back, came four wide
into upper stretch then moved out near the sixteenth pole and gained belatedly. WESTERN TROUBLE exchanged a light bump at the start, stalked from
outside just off the leading trio, advanced four wide leaving the turn, had no extra for the drive. DIXIE GIANT settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn
and five wide into upper stretch, was in a bit tight near the sixteenth pole. MALIBU SECRET exchanged a light bump at the start, was strongly urged
thereafter to vide between runners, began to weaken at the three-eighths, came out in late stretch. ELEKTRONIC exchanged light bumps at the break, vied
outside three wide, came up empty. NEVAEH'S DREAM failed to threaten after saving ground along the inside at the rear.

Footnotes
COMMANDER JOE broke a bit slow to start, took command from the other pace rivals at the half, was well rationed through the turn, opened up turning for
home and had enough in reserve to keep the late closer at bay in the final eighth. GALVASTON settled near the back outside of horses down the
backstretch, started to circle runners midway through the turn, offered a threat to the winner with three sixteenths to go but could not find another gear and
had to settle for a clear second. CITY LEGEND tracked on the rail behind the pace trio in the first quarter, waited inside on the turn, advanced up the fence
two furlongs to go and won the battle for third through the lane. SOUPER RUSH pressed the early pace three wide in the beginning, made a four wide bid
through the turn, contended for a minor role at the top of the stretch and stalled a bit between runners settling on the fringes. WOOD BE WILD settled at the
rear after the break, offered a mild run between horses three wide at the three eighths pole, backed away on the turn to trail entering the stretch and angled
out in the four path to pick up a stopping runner late. NEWPORT AGENT battled between horses for the lead down the backside, chased the leader through
the turn, was ridden a quarter out to keep up between runners, retreated at the top of the stretch and stopped through the lane.

FULL SCREEN vied two to three wide, began to edge away at the seven-sixteenths, moved nearer the rail turning for home, was clear into upper stretch
and widened while being kept to the task. GIANT TEDDY stalked in range of the leader three to four wide on the turn, could make no headway on the
winner in the stretch and was only second best. DISSECTOLOGIST rated under a tight hold racing outside six wide early, eased back and shifted in three
deep entering the turn, moved to the rail later on that bend, gained show honors inside and was best of the rest while no threat to the top pair. CHAIRMAN
BOB switched out in the early going racing five wide and inside a foe to the turn, advanced five then four wide early on that bend, came back out a path in
upper stretch, lost show honors but held the minor award from rivals gaining steadily inside and out. MIDNIGHT ARKLE tracked two wide between runners,
came out four wide in upper stretch and kept on. WHERE'S NEAL stalked three to four wide between runners into and on the turn, came out five wide for
the drive and was outkicked for minor placings. LOVE THE GAME tracked up close inside, dropped back early on the turn, swung out six wide leaving that
bend lightly brushing a rival at the top of the stretch and ran on. MAGNIFICENT MARIO raced up close outside early, was four wide entering the turn, in a
bit tight and steadied just slightly past the seven-sixteenths altering out a path, came into upper stretch seven deep and was lightly brushed then ran on. BIG
WARDEN vied inside the winner, began to weaken on the turn, came out a path turning for home and continued to drop back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MAGNIFICENT MARIO AGAINST CHAIRMAN BOB ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN AND RESULTS WERE ALLOWED TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
GRAN SPIRITED tracked the early speed duel sitting three wide, moved to take command briefly on the turn with a quarter to go, surrendered the lead to a
rushing outside runner in upper stretch and stubbornly fought back to rebid on the rail to earn the victory. TWIN CITY broke out at the start, settled near the
back in the early part of the race, picked up the bit with five sixteenths to go, angled out with a quarter to go for clear run seven wide in upper stretch, was
full of run late closing fast but had too much to do the last eighth. WICKEDBLACKBULLET started to rally four wide while mid pack circling rivals with a
quarter to run, ran on well through the lane outside, could not threaten the top two finishers but showed some grit with a gutsy effort late to get up for third at
the finish. HOUSEBUILDER tracked the frontrunners outside with three furlongs to go, made a bold move around runners travelling four wide on the turn to
lead entering upper stretch, began to get leg weary with an eighth to go and stalled late losing a couple of positions at the wire. CRIMSON COMET tracked
early behind the frontrunners on the rail, started to rally moving just off the fence to contend with three sixteenths to go and faded between runners in deep
stretch. MO TOURIST stalked mid field between horses, was ridden hard through the turn inside advancing inside of foes in upper stretch and stalled the
last sixteenth. DESANTIS was roused between runners mid pack on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and had little to offer for the drive to the finish.
ONE MORE BREW took command down the backside, was collared midway on the turn inside, gave way to outside runners at the quarter pole and
weakened in mid stretch. GUNGI broke slow to trail after the start, made an early move up the fence through the backstretch to get good position into the
turn, angled off the rail midway on the turn and weakened turning for home. QUIET VISTA was shuffled back to trail leaving the chute, could not keep up to
the pack going into the turn and passed a few stopping runners in mid stretch. GIVE ME MY MONEY rated mid pack widest of runners for the first part,
offered a mild move entering the far turn outside five wide and came up empty for the drive. MR. RUDY settled near the back in the early stages of the race,
was urged on the turn but could not gain on the field and made no impact running to the wire. IMPERIAL STAR was away alertly to be in front early, battled
for the lead down the backside, began to weaken between runners with three eights to go and quickly retreated through the turn and stopped in the lane.

Footnotes
ANAM CARA shifted in early, tracked along the inside into the turn while settled, tipped out three wide coming to the quarter pole, was asked at the top of
the stretch, lugged in just a hair then altered outside the leader near the furlong marker, drove past coming to the sixteenth pole under moderate urging.
SOUPER SINCLAIR was up close early, moved in from four to three wide commencing a bid on the turn, struck a narrow lead on the turn, began to edge
away past the three-sixteenths but was outfinished late. KATCHY NAME shifted in early racing just off the leaders in behind, split rivals two wide coming to
the five-sixteenths, kept on under urging to get show honors. RIFLING vied from between runners then moved forward to force the issue with a narrow lead
two wide, was challenged on the turn and into upper stretch, yielded late. I'M A BOURBON GIRL settled off the pace racing wide into the turn going three
then four wide and swinging seven deep into upper stretch, kept on to improve position. LIAM'S AWESOME broke a step slowly, raced toward the back off
the inside, moved out from two to four wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch. FLAT OUT ANGEL broke a step slowly and lacked early speed while shifting
in early, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, asked for run about the five-sixteenths, improved position inside in the stretch. SOCIETY'S KAT
raced off the pace inside then just off the rail on the turn, came out three wide about the quarter pole and ran on. SHARP AZA RAINBOW lacked early
speed, raced off the inside and passed tired rivals. TRICK AND TREAT attended th pace three to four wide between runners, began to lose ground on the
turn coming out five wide late on that bend and continued to weaken. CENTENARY chased the pace from outside five wide, steadily dropped back on the
turn and faded in the stretch. BEYLA BE GOOD vied inside, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
TAVALINE broke sharp and showed good speed to battle just outside on the front end early, put away her fellow frontrunner with a quarter mile from home
and had enough left late to draw away mid stretch to win comfortably in the end. SMILES FOR DAVID trailed in the early stages on the fence, started her
rally on the rail with three furlongs left to go, angled out turning for home in the three path and finished up well outside to get up for place. DAWN PHAROAH
tracked the speed on the rail in the second flight, was roused midway on the turn to go after and challenge the frontrunners, offered a brief run in upper
stretch and levelled off late losing second money. HONOR IT broke outwards to start, battled up front on the rail with the winner for the first half, started to
give way on the fence with two furlongs to run and weakened more at the furlong marker to lose a couple of placings late. GIO MARIA tracked in the second
flight outside in the beginning, was roused to go on with three eighths left but could not keep up to the leaders through the turn and faltered. BESSIE trailed
runners down the backside, could not get into contention through the turn and was not a factor at the finish.

Footnotes
SMALL TALK was allowed to settle just off the leading pair tracking inside, bid up the rail in upper stretch, kicked clear and held sway. LORD OF WAR
pressed the early pace then stalked three wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. BENLION settled toward the rear, raced in
the two then three path on the turn, came out five wide in upper stretch, was brushed late while between runners and kept on to get up for show. STAR
CHAMBER settled off the leaders, swung six wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly. BIG BAD BEAST stalked three wide mid-division off the leading trio,
was brushed in mid-stretch into another rival then came in and bumped the first foe inward. UNCLE SPIDER moved clear under mild coaxing to set the pace
off the rail, weakened in the stretch while drifting out brushing a rival and was then bumped inward late. AHMAS raced toward the back two wide into the
turn, swung six wide and ran on. LUCYS CHILD was off the inside three to four wide toward the rear and never near enough to threaten. AWESOMECREST
chased from inside on or just off the rail, steadied slightly in late stretch when in tight. UNILATERAL broke a step slowly and was never a factor.
