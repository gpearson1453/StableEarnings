Footnotes
BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD saved early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the six path and dug in widest to get up
the final yards. PEARLY GHOST stalked the early pace about the three path, challenged leaving the half mile pole and took the nod at the five sixteenths,
contested the edge off the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch urging but was caught flattening stride late yards. MIDNIGHT BRASS stalked off
the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the two and three paths and raced evenly to late stretch
before flattening stride. MY SISTER PAM rounded the opening turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at a close disadvantage
in the three path of the far turn but weakened from mid-stretch. PRINCESS HALO raced in the four path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and had little left. ELIANAGRACE rounded the first turn in the three and four paths, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole and raced close four wide on the far turn before weakening. MOIRAINE set the early pace inside, came under pressure leaving the half
mile pole, was met at the five sixteenths and raced at a close disadvantage at the rail on the far turn, then weakened.

Footnotes
LADY CINCO DE MAYO closed to stalking position two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at a close disadvantage from that
point, took the lead two deep past the quarter pole, drifted nearing the top of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and just lasted. OVERCOOKED rated close
inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted into the stretch and closed for second later yards while just missing the
win. ASUE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge from that point but was caught past the
quarter pole, continued close at the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. UNBRIDLED IRISH exchanged light contact with Wicked Felina
leaving the gate and settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. GILDED
QUEST entered the opening turn in the five path, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. LICENSE TO
CARRY came away a step slow and ducked out leaving the gate, then saved ground. WICKED FELINA exchanged light contact with Unbridled Irish leaving
the gate and was through early.

past the pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled to hold well. SPECTACULO rounded the first turn in the five path then saved ground
into the second turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, ran off the rail on the far turn, drifted into the stretch, dug in under steady handling and just lasted.
AZURE FIRE raced well off the early pace toward the inside, eased out into the backstretch and bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the three
path of the far turn, finished well and just missed second. LET'S GET PHYSICAL rounded the first turn about the four path then saved ground into the
second turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, drifted into the lane but showed little more. OFFICER APPEAL settled off
the rail early, moved to even terms into the backstretch and dueled for a brief slim lead at the five sixteenths pole, but faded on the far turn. AIR MEDAL
saved ground racing well back. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE raced well back, left the second turn outside and showed little response. OBANNON took a quick

HYPOTHESIS chased through the backstretch, was bumped by NICO leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced close four wide on the turn then dug in from
the head of the lane to earn the nod at the wire. The latter chased off the rail through the backstretch, was hemmed in off the heels of JEFFERSON NATIVE
and made contact with Hypothesis leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced close three wide on the turn then missed the nod at the wire after a long stretch
duel. JEFFERSON NATIVE tapered to the inside and set a pressured pace, contested the edge off the rail on the turn, dueled at even terms through the
upper stretch but relented late yards. PENGUIN POWER pressured the pace inside, steadied briefly in tight at the rail past the five sixteenths pole, raced at
near even terms through the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. COMMAND THE CAT chased the pace toward the outside through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the six and seven paths then flattened in the lane. SETTLEMENT DATE gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little
in the lane. CEDAR RUNS CASTLE chased outside then flattened off the rail on the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of
Hypothesis for alleged interference past the five sixteenths pole, lodged by the rider of Nico, though, determined there was no foul.

the rail on the far turn, dueled clear past the eighth pole and was kept alert to widen. FILLE D'ESPRIT became a bit anxious in the gate then rated the pace
inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met a the rail at the quarter, continued close through the far turn but flattened inside the
eighth pole. ALLWORTHY was sluggish into stride then settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail then flattened in the lane. MOODY WOMAN saved ground on the first turn, eased out with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn off the rail and
showed little in the lane. CURRENT CLIMATE became a bit anxious in the gate and rated just off the early pace toward the inside, gave chase leaving the

SOCIETY took a quick lead while tapering to the inside, kept the edge over FREE LIKE A GIRL leaving the three eighths pole, pulled away from that one at
the rail on the far turn and was kept sharp through the lane. The latter stalked three wide the first turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole but dropped
back toward the quarter and had to settle for second best. MIDNIGHT STROLL raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran evenly in the lane. DIVINE HUNTRESS rated close inside, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, ran near the rail on the far turn and weakened into the lane. CHARDONNAY stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. PEACHY WEACHY saved ground and showed little response through the
backstretch. STELLAR RIDE came away awkwardly and raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole
then weakened off the rail on the far turn. SHE'S PURE SILVER raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened
at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
ART COLLECTOR took a quick lead and angled to the inside to rate the pace, kept the edge over MUAD'DIB from the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear
of that one midway on the far turn and was kept alert through the stretch. MUAD'DIB rated close two deep, challenged the winner nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and took a slim brief lead toward the three eighths, continued in close chase past the pole but dropped back midway on the far turn,
relinquished the win but dueled through the stretch for second. MIND CONTROL saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second while best for third. OFFICIATING
settled close toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled three wide leaving the turn then outfinished in the
stretch duel for third. LAST SAMURAI raced well back inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened in the
lane. JALEN JOURNEY rated close off the rail, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and raced close through most of the backstretch, though, faded into
the far turn. PLOT THE DOTS settled in the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded into the far turn. TREASURE
TROVE rounded the first two turns in the five path, left the second turn outside and faded past the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SOCIAL CHIC stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and closed to striking position three wide approaching the head of the lane, drifted out
past the eighth pole then lugged in while taking the lead across the path of FANCY CONCHO mid-stretch, dug in under steady handling from that point and
held on. FANCY CONCHO settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn, was
shut off leaving the eighth pole then again mid-stretch, but came again late yards. SHY GUY settled back about the three path the first turn, bid leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished well while gaining on the top two. CANDY INVASION saved ground racing well back
from early contention, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved in the four and five paths of the far turn and finished well; outside. HERO'S MAN took a
quick lead and rated the pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point to put River Crosroad RVF away midway on the far turn, but was
caught leaving the turn and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. NO CHANGE tapered in and stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
and took a brief lead three wide leaving the quarter pole, but gave up the advantage past the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. C R'S MANDATE
saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. RIVER CROSROAD RVF stalked the early pace from the three path, drew to even terms
two deep into the backstretch and dueled close from that point, but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened into the lane. BOASTER raced well
back in the three path the first turn and never factored. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Social Chic for interference leaving the far
turn and again mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Fancy Concho, and as a result, disqualified the former to second place.
