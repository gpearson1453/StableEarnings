Footnotes
CIDSTAYINURLAINE stuck inside to turn, angled out roused to go clear late. NAUGHTY NELLIE good position to turn, steadied along turn, clear sailing
stretch, might have been best. HOHOHOHO off rail run to the stretch, rallied in the lane for show spot. LUCKY LAUREN quick inside speed to the stretch,
could not go, faltered late. GREGS POSSE far back to the stretch, steady advance in the stretch improved. BETHY tried to keep between horses to the
stretch, backed up late. CATTALEYA RONITH broke tardy, saved ground throughout with no late gain in the stretch. BERTRADA off rail trip while never a
threat. CUPP OF CLASS dueled between horses to the turn and gave way readily. LOVE YOU GOODBYE flashed brief speed and stopped readily.
