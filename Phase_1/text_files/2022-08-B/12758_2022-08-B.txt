Footnotes
SHAKOO MAKOO set the pace, took command on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. BRADY O'BRADY was
unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. HALF LIT forced the pace and was a
factor on the turn but had nothing left. FRAT PARTY was off slow, saved ground on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. TOMCAT BLACK
was up close but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch faded. SEAL TEAM TWO was in mid pack and roused on the turn but
from the seven path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. BALA FALLS was hustled early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
STRONG ENDING stalked the leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. TOMATO
BILL set the pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. MONEY MATTERS was unhurried early,
moved up on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. CHASING VINNY was in touch and roused on the turn but from the
seven path at the top of the stretch needed more. STRIKING MOON was hustled early and forced the pace on the turn but had nothing left. DUKE OF
MIAMI had no speed and closed the gap on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. WINGS OF VICTORY was off the pace
and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. WHERE'S ANTHONY was well back and showed little while outrun.
MAKE NO MISTAKE was in mid pack and saved ground on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.
