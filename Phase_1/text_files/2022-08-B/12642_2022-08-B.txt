Footnotes
FALLEN EMPIRE slow early advanced outside on the turn looming in upper stretch surging late to hook rival getting up abreast at the wire. HARD FROST
pressured the pace dueling to lead on the turn digging in down the lane being hooked late from the outside missing in a very game effort. ON TILT
pressured the pace dueling through the turn into upper stretch wearing down late. GATORATER dropped back on the turn giving a mild rally down the lane
to move up some. REGAL HOLIDAY chased the pace through the turn weakening in upper stretch. QUANAH flashed early speed then faded from mid turn.
CREATIVE MAGIC was never involved. MR. HOSTLER retreated on the turn.
