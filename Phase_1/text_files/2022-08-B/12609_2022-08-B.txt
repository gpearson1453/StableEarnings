MORE FIREWATER set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely in a driving finish. BRUIN MAGIC was void of early speed,
raced outside, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. DEPUTY'S DANCER challenged three wide between horses, was in tight entering the turn,
swung wide entering the stretch, fell back and settled for show. SPEEDING STYLE stalked inside early, lacked a bid and was outrun. MR LOVE MUFFIN
pressed the pace while racing between horses, was checked hard entering the turn and stopped. UNBRIDLED TIGER pressed the pace while racing four
across, was carried out leaving the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

THE BEAT flashed speed, dropped back and raced inside, challenged between horses entering the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, drew off for a long
lead and held safe. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND broke slowly and was crowded at the start, was unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied around the turn
and closed well to earn place while no match for the winner. FINAL FINAL stalked the pace while racing outside, challenged three across into the turn, fell
back, finished evenly and was able to hold for show. HIGH FLYIN TIGER raced in the back, bid off the rail and came up empty. WE'RE JUST SAYING was
through after a half. THE THIRD RING veered out at the start, drew off for a clear lead, tired into the second turn and gave way. Hand timed.

Footnotes
DAZZLING MIST set the pace, drew off in the drive and was kept to task. QUEENS RANSOM stalked the pace, lacked the needed late response and
finished second best. DIRT FLIRT was slow early, raced outside, lacked a bid and was clearly best of the rest. JOY IN THE BATTLE raced close to the
pace, swung wide leaving the turn, tired in the drive and dropped back. UPTOWN RHAPSODY saved ground, angled out on the turn, swung wide and
lacked a stretch response. PERFECT EDITION was not a factor. JAZZY EINSTEIN showed brief speed along the inside, stopped, was eased and walked
off. Hand timed.

GOT EVEN SMARTER raced close to the pace, bid inside on the turn, dueled through the stretch and proved best. HARROVIAN bumped at the start, was
hustled along, bid willingly, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. KING LEBRON bumped at the start, set the pace, responded
when challenged to duel and came up empty late. JAZZ TOWN raced close to the pace, fell back on the turn, swung wide and gave way. MORE HONOR
was not a factor. CURRENTLY KRAZY trailed the field. Hand timed.
