responded to pressure to be up in the final sixteenth. EARS TO US dueled for the early lead from along the outside, opened clear after a quarter mile, set
the pace to deep stretch but was unable to resist the winner. WHATSTHEDIFF dropped well back early, moved forward on the turn while racing three-wide,
angled in slightly for room during the drive and finished full of run. IGOTTABOOBOO was allowed to settle while racing three-wide on the turn, angled in
entering the stretch and was gaining ground late. BOSS NINE raced four-wide on the turn and lacked a rally. SWING FIRST gave way after showing brief
speed along the inside, ducked out nearing the eighth pole and unseated his rider and walked off following the race. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE RACE, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
PROSPERA was never far back while racing in tight behind horses on the turn, found room to split rivals nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
strongly to be up in the final strides. ENCHANTING WAY dueled for the lead with Pearl River Delta from along the outside, shook that one off in the stretch
to open a clear lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner late. PEARL RIVER DELTA vied for the lead from along the inside into the
stretch and held on fairly well for the show. IN THE VAULT was prominent while racing three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed late response. AWESOME DAZE failed to threaten while racing two-wide. PIRATES CROSS was not a factor while saving ground. ZAZEN was
off a step slow, then moved up to reach contention early while three-wide and tired.

FIREWALKER saved ground while being unhurried, moved closer on turn turn, slipped through entering the stretch, took the lead leaving the eighth pole
and won drawing clear. BOOK SMART dueled for the lead from along the outside, was carried out slightly entering the stretch, could not stay with the
winner but continued on gamely for the place. MARCH ON LINCH was off a step slow, then moved up along the inside to duel for the lead in the stretch and
held on determinedly during the drive to earn the show. ME B BUBBA T saved ground stalking the pace, swung out four-wide nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, offered a bid entering the stretch and then hung. TIG prompted the early pace while three-wide and tired. DECIMATE was through early.

UPPER ROOM was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, was four-wide entering and finished strongly to prove
narrowly best. MAMACALLMEBOO saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through entering the stretch and finished fast to just miss.
GOLDIE'S HILLS prompted the pace into the stretch from along the outside and held on well for the show. THE PRESS was unhurried early, came five-wide
into the stretch and was gaining some ground late. TENGO SED dueled for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and tired. AZEE RULES failed to seriously threaten while saving ground. LOCHNESS was off a step slow, then moved forward on the backstretch,
checked running up on horses heels nearing the half mile pole, angled out for room, came six-wide into the stretch but was unable to recover the lost
ground.
