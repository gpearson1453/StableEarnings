Footnotes
PLANE TALK was sent to the lead, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch and shook off
CHESS MASTER, went to a drive again late as MINISTER OF SOUL gained to his outside and held. MINISTER OF SOUL was pushed along to show some
early pace but settled back to track the leader inside of CHESS MASTER, settled back to the rear pair while saving ground around the turn, shifted out
approaching the furlong mark, gained with good interest in the final sixteenth but missed. CHESS MASTER tracked the leader outside of MINISTER OF
SOUL down the back straight, tracked the leader in the three to four path around the turn, could not match the pacesetter into the lane, flattened but
nonetheless held for show. SIR WELLINGTON settled at the rear, raced in the rear pair outside of MINISTER OF SOUL on the far turn, floated into the six
path in upper stretch, and found no kick under a drive.

Footnotes
RIGHT OF REFUSAL settled outside of MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM to chase the leading line, continued to chase three to four wide on the turn, responded
when urged approaching the quarter, swung out to the five path into the lane and drifted out a few more paths in upper stretch, but nonetheless sustained
her rally, led nearing the sixteenth, and finished best. TOP HAT TIGRESS broke outward, trailed early, began to gain inside around the turn, sustained her
rally under a drive inside in the lane, engaged inside of RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE past the furlong mark, could not match the late run of RIGHT OF REFUSAL
to the outside in the final sixteenth but kept on willingly for place. RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE disputed the early pace between horses, tracked the pace in the
two path when COUNTESS OF CAIRO asserted the lead on the turn, rallied inside of COUNTESS OF CAIRO into the lane and took the lead in upper
stretch, was engaged from both sides past the furlong mark, proved no match in the final sixteenth but held for show. COUNTESS OF CAIRO disputed the
early pace three wide, inched to a defined lead in the three path past the seven sixteenths, was engaged by RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE to her inside into the
lane, proved no match and drifted out while flattening. MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM chased well off the leading line inside of RIGHT OF REFUSAL, chased
near the rear in the two to three path on the turn, floated out into the lane, drifted inward in upper stretch, and lacked the needed response when driven in
the lane. BANGIE GO disputed the early pace inside, flattened out inside around the turn and was no further threat in the lane. BETYAR AZETS hopped at
the start, settled near the rear, raced in the five to six path on the term, floated into the lane in the six path and lacked a bid.

BEYOND PROPER tracked the pace inside of SHABAM, raced at the rear of a compact field into the back straight, rallied comfortably inside of SWANAGE
approaching the far turn, took the lead past the half, set the pace clear around that bend, drifted out in upper stretch while on a clear lead, continued to drift
out down the lane but stayed on clear. SHABAM tracked the pace two wide through the clubhouse turn, inched outside to track in closer range of SHABAM
into the back straight, was driven three wide around the far turn to keep pace after BEYOND PROPER moved to the lead inside, chased that foe all out
down the lane but proved second best. SWANAGE was sent for speed between horses, set the pace around the first turn, continued to dictate terms as
SHABAM stalked to her outside down the back straight, had no answer when BEYOND PROPER confronted to her inside past the half, flattened two wide
on the far turn and proved no further threat down the lane.

DEFLATER settled near the rear early, chased in the four to five path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane and drifted further out in upper stretch,
rallied outside, found his best near the sixteenth mark and got up in time. RICKEY B tracked the leader outside of FIREMAN OSCAR, bid outside of JAZZY
TIMES on the turn, drew even with that foe near the five sixteenths, continued to battle three wide in the leading flight into the lane, chased on under a drive
when FIREMAN OSCAR took a narrow lead in upper stretch, kept on willingly to the wire but was narrowly outfinished by the winner. SHIP IT RED settled at
the rear, continued at the rear in the three to four path on the turn, drifted out in the lane, and offered a belated rally for show. FIREMAN OSCAR tracked the
pace inside of RICKEY B early, stalked inside around the turn, bid inside of JAZZY TIMES into the lane, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, carried that
lead past the sixteenth pole but flattened out late. JAZZY TIMES stumbled at the break, was sent for speed and set the early pace, was engaged by
RICKEY B to his outside around the turn, found himself on even terms with that foe near the five sixteenths but continued to battle between horses in the
leading flight into upper stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CAJUN NINJA was sent for pace, set the pace clear in the three path on the turn, kicked away from the tracking flight when asked in upper stretch, drifted
out past the furlong mark but still remained well clear. UNRIVALED QUEEN tracked the leading pair early, raced in the tracking flight three wide around the
turn, kept on three deep into the lane, proved no match for CAJUN NINJA past the three sixteenths, but kept on willingly and wore down FACCIA BELLA for
the place. FACCIA BELLA chased midfield while well off the rail early, angled inside into the turn and rallied to join the inside of the tracking flight, continued
at the inside of the tracking flight into the lane but proved no match for CAJUN NINJA past the three sixteenths, continued to chase willingly but was
narrowly outfinished for the place. FREEBRITNEY broke a step slowly and inward, settled near the rear, raced in the four to five path on the turn with the
rear flight, angled inward approaching the quarter pole, and chased on mildly inside down the lane while no match for the top three. MANHATTAN CHERRY
tracked outside the pacesetter early, continued in range between FACCIA BELLA and UNRIVALED QUEEN on the turn, proved no match for the others in
the tracking flight into the lane and flattened out. IZZY'S MONSTER chased at the rear of midpack early, was pushed along in the five path on the turn, went
to a drive into the lane, drifted out toward the center of the track in upper stretch, and chased while ultimately lacking the needed kick. ALICE JOSEPHINE
broke a step slowly and outward, settled near the rear, raced with the rear group in the three to four path on the turn, stopped approaching the quarter and
was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
BOB'S ALL IN settled in second last, was pushed along outside of CAVE HILL while toward the rear around the far turn and began to improve, kicked on in
earnest past the quarter, split horses, swung three wide into the lane, angled out toward the center of the track and sustained the rally, led approaching the
furlong mark and won with authority. DON'T BOX ME IN set the pace while clear and a bit keen, continued on the lead in the three path on the far turn,
drifted out in upper stretch, was headed by BOB'S ALL IN approaching the furlong mark, and chased on second best. SAMYAZA tracked the leader inside
of TREASURE RUN, continued to track while saving ground around the far turn, chased inside of the leader in upper stretch, proved no match for BOB'S
ALL IN and DON'T BOX ME IN from upper stretch but kept on for show. CAVE HILL was taken to the rear and settled, was urged inside while racing at the
rear of the main pack around the far turn, offered an inside rally into the lane, flattened out past the three sixteenths but held for a minor share.
SIGNOFTHECROSS settled near the rear around the clubhouse turn, inched forward midpack between horses down the back straight, raced three wide on
the far turn, floated five wide into the lane and chased on while ultimately lacking the needed kick in the final furlong. TREASURE RUN broke well, tracked
two wide, was pushed along for a bid outside of DON'T BOX ME IN into the far turn, couldn't reel the leader in, weakened between from near the quarter
pole and had no more in the lane. MOUNTAIN PINE chased behind the tracking flight early, kept on outside of SIGNOFTHECROSS down the back straight,
chased four wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. EXETER chased at the inside of the main group, settled back inside of BOB'S ALL IN
down the backstretch, was outpaced into the far turn and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
MAGIC CASTLE carried a narrow lead early while attended inside by KIERKEGAARD, was clear in the two to three path on the turn, was confronted from
the inside by TWISTED DIXIE in upper stretch but turned that foe back past the three sixteenths, kept on under a drive and dug in to hold off the late re-rally
of KIERKEGAARD. The latter attended the early pace inside of MAGIC CASTLE, was outkicked by that foe into the turn, settled back to track inside of
JACK'S ADVANTAGE, came out and bumped that foe near the quarter and again while racing into the lane, rallied well three wide late but missed.
TWISTED DIXIE chased inside at the rear of the main pack early, was pushed along in the two to three path on the turn, began to rally past the five
sixteenths, loomed inside of MAGIC CASTLE past the quarter, but was turned back past the three sixteenths, chased on, but flattened out in the final
sixteenth. JACK'S ADVANTAGE tracked the leading pair early outside of KIERKEGAARD, tracked between horses on the turn, was bumped between near
the quarter and again into the lane when KIERKEGAARD came out, and chased on mildly to the finish. CUMBERLAND AVENUE chased between horses
down the back straight, was pushed along into the turn, raced three wide with the tracking flight around the bend, was herded out four to five wide when
KIERKEGAARD came out approaching the turn for home, and flattened while drifting out. YOU SPLIT TENS settled at the rear, trailed in the four path on
the turn, floated further out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
M AND M GIRL settled inside at the rear of the main group, continued patiently through much of the turn, began to improve past the five sixteenths, rallied
inside with good interest into the lane, shifted two wide in upper stretch, split horses near the furlong pole, continued to sustain her rally, headed
CIRCULODEGANADORAS past the sixteenth pole and edged past. CIRCULODEGANADORAS tracked the leader inside foes early, continued in range
while positioned two wide around the far turn and into upper stretch, caught the pacesetter at the three sixteenths, cleared through midstretch, kept on
willingly but could not hold off M AND M GIRL inside the sixteenth. SECOND GRACE chased three wide early, bid three wide around the turn, raced into the
lane in range three wide but was outkicked by CIRCULODEGANADORAS into the lane, continued to chase on and gained slight ground on that foe late but
was ultimately outfinished. IKNOWYOURFACE chased toward the rear of the main pack, was urged in the two path on the turn, swung five wide in upper
stretch, rallied under a drive while drifting a few more paths out, kicked on belatedly and was nearest at the finish. CHA sent for speed, set the pace in the
two to three path on the turn, was headed near the three sixteenths by CIRCULODEGANADORAS to her outside near the three sixteenths, and weakened
between horses. FANCY EMPRESS settled near the rear outside of M AND M GIRL early, chased toward the rear around the turn, was urged for a three
wide bid approaching the quarter, floated out toward the center of the track for the stretch run and lacked the needed kick. SAILSINTHESUNSET chased in
range, saved ground midfield on the turn, was driven inside into the lane and threatened in range briefly, but weakened past the three sixteenths. SUMMER
LOVIN soon trailed, continued at the rear in the four path on the turn, swung out near the center of the track into the lane for the drive and passed tiring
horses. FLYING BUSINESS tracked three wide down the back straight, but began to flatten past the three eighths and proved no further threat in the lane.
PRETTY SWEET tracked between horses early but soon settled back to race between horses in the chasing flight, gradually weakened around the turn and
had no more for the drive.

Footnotes
TIGER HUNTER tracked the pace three wide between horses, bid outside of RED WAVE near the nine sixteenths, headed that foe near the half, opened up
in the two path, kept on under a drive in the lane and held firm. RED WAVE broke well and soon led, was engaged by TIGER HUNTER near the nine
sixteenths, could not hold him at bay past the half, appeared to be flattening out after being headed but found enough to chase on, shift out into upper
stretch, and sustain enough interest to hold off GUEST CHECK and save place. GUEST CHECK raced inside in range through the clubhouse turn and
down the back straight, was pushed along inside of SIR BAMABUS into the far turn, took up near the three eighths while in tight between RED WAVE and
the rail, shifted out to the three path to chase the leading trio, rallied three wide in the lane, and missed the place. SPEEDY DAREDEVIL broke outward and
lightly bumped SIR BARNABUS, settled at the rear of the main group just behind the four-deep chasing flight, bid three wide into the far turn, tracked in
closest range of the leader around the bend, floated four wide into the lane and flattened. HONEY'S SUPERMAN soon trailed, was pushed along in the four
path on the far turn and began to improve slightly, chased on mildly in the lane but ultimately proved no threat. SIR BARNABUS was lightly bumped by
SPEEDY DAREDEVIL in the opening strides, raced very keenly between horses around the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, settled back to the rear
of the main group near the half, was urged around the far turn but began to weaken and proved empty when driven in upper stretch. UNCLE AL'S PAL
raced four wide into the clubhouse turn in the tracking flight, continued four wide into the back straight, began to flatten out near the half, faded around the
far turn and was allowed to trail home.

MINNESOTA NICE chased behind the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, continued in range of the leading flight outside of SENSE OF FLURRY
down the back straight, improved four wide approaching the half, engaged outside of CELTICS WILDCAT into the far turn, vied outside of that foe around
the bend, took the lead in upper stretch, and kept finding two wide as WITHHERBOOTSON loomed inside her through the final furlong.
WITHHERBOOTSON settled at the rear inside, began to gain strongly near the five sixteenths, sustained the rally when driven in upper stretch, loomed
inside of MINNESOTA NICE past the furlong mark but could not reel her in. MAIDEN ROCK settled patiently in second last outside of WITHHERBOOTSON,
began to improve in the five path around the far turn, swung out near the center of the track into the lane, kicked on best in the final furlong, gained with
good interest to the finish but came too late. FLASH FLOOD was rank at the inside of the tracking flight through the first turn, inched up inside of CELTICS
WILDCAT near the three quarters and attended inside down the back straight, was relegated to tracking the leading pair while saving ground around the far
turn, drove into the lane in range behind the leading trio, but was outfinished from upper stretch. CELTICS WILDCAT cleared to the lead into the first turn,
was engaged by FLASH FLOOD to her inside and SHEZONEZESTREET to her outside near the three quarters, carried a slim lead between down the back
straight, was engaged by MINNESOTA NICE into the far turn, fought in inside that foe into upper stretch but began to weaken between horses approaching
the furlong mark. SENSE OF FLURRY tracked three wide around the clubhouse turn, tracked behind the leading trio into the backstretch, while positioned
four wide, was driven in the four path around the far turn, and mustered no rally. SHEZONEZESTREET tracked between horses around the clubhouse turn,
joined the leading flight three wide near the three quarters, attended the pace down the back straight, began to weaken between horses approaching the
