Footnotes
PETTIGO GIRL pressed from the two path, made a bid from the five path at the top of the lane, and drew clear late. LIL MISS HOTSHOT led from the two
path, was ridden in the four path coming into the stretch, but yielded grudgingly late to place. CAR LADY bobbled and broke out at the start to trail early,
made progress from the inside of foes around the far turn, swung out to the five path for a clear stretch run, and improved for show. BEAUTIFUL TIZ chased
from the two path, was driven from the six path into the lane, and gained late. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL tracked in the three path but faded into the stretch.
TIME TO TWO STEP was bothered at the start by an inner foe, rated in the six path but was never a threat.

Footnotes
PURRS WELL tracked the duel into the turn, saved all the ground hugging the rail around the turn, stayed inside while gaining ground, shifted out into the
three path, under a steady drive went clear leaving the sixteenth marker. PRESSING CONCERN chased the early duel, four wide pursuit around the turn,
forced out seven wide top of the stretch, steadily picking up ground through the stretch, could not catch winner, clear second. HIGHLAND DREAM raced off
the early duel, stayed in the three path around the turn, scrubbed on after leaving the quarter pole, between runners through the stretch, found best strides
late. ENGLISH LAD dueled from the inside, remained along the inside dueling around the turn, came under pressure top of the stretch, finished up even
late. CONSIDER ME bumped soon after the start, found very nice stalking position off the duel, raced three wide around the turn, when called on drifted out
top of the stretch, had no late kick. PALLIETER away very slow to start, in no hurry down the back side, moved past leg weary foes late. HOUR CAT outside
position in the early duel, pressed on around the turn, came up empty late. MARCONIS slow start, never could recover, no threat.

Footnotes
HEFFNER stalked the pace setter around the first turn, waited patiently to be queued up, surveyed the competition leaving the quarter pole, under a long
drive, finished off rivals very late. AXXERATOR slow to start, raced even till nearing the half mile marker, teed up entering the far turn, moved up along the
inside till top of the stretch, under a long sustained drive got up for second under the wire. STORMY BONNIE found the leading roll to his liking, controlled
the pace down the backside, felt pressure nearing the top of the stretch, raced inside foes through deep stretch, stubbornly lost the place at the wire. CAPE
HEDGE three wide and off the early pace, raced middle pack backside, four wide top of the stretch, even strides through the wire. RUNNER raced off the
early pace, stayed well off the pace backside, called up nearing far turn, empty through the stretch. MINECRAFTER lacked speed around the first turn,
raced near the rear of the field down the backside, made a bid around the far turn, weakened through the stretch. RUTHENIAN tracked the leaders around
the first turn, stayed in nice four wide stalking position, called on far turn, outrun stretch.

Footnotes
SPANISH CZAR prompted the pace in the three path, made a bid from two wide around the far turn, opened up in upper stretch, and held gamely. CODIGO
tracked two wide, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, was bumped by OUT OF TOWNER passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. OUT OF
TOWNER chased in the three path, was coaxed in the four path around the far turn and into the lane, drifted in and bumped CODIGO passing the eighth
pole, but kept on for show. KING TSUNAMI raced from well back inside, was hustled in the four path at the top of the lane, and gained late. EDMUND
FITZGERALD missed the break, rated from the three path, was driven along in the six pathgoing into the lane, and finished evenly. JONNY QUIST was
unhurried while four wide but was never a threat. DOUBLE O OTTO set the pace inside, was cued from inside into the stretch, ducked in passing the eighth
pole, and weakened. HIDDEN ROD stalked inside, was steadied and shuffled back into the far turn, and faded.

steady drive, wore down leader final strides. HE'S INCREDIBLE tracked between runners early, split rivals nearing the quarter pole, drifted out top of
stretch, game through the wire. SWING WEST off the early pace, well back and along the inside around the turn, stayed inside through the stretch, shifted
out while running on the left lead, held on to the show money. FAST CASH slow to get under way, raced well off the pace into turn, called on for best run
nearing the quarter pole, drifted out entering top of the stretch, found best strides after leaving the furlong marker. JEEZUM JIM lacked early speed, tracked
middle pack into turn, split foes after leaving the three eighths pole, even stride through the wire. INSTIGATED stalked the speed duel while racing four
wide, urged along could not keep pace, no threat late. STROLL SMOKIN dueled inside, saved ground around the turn, called up, weakened through the
stretch. GREEN GROWTH four wide and just off the early duel, maintained four wide chasing position around turn, when called up, could not respond.

Footnotes
BE YOURSELF rated in the two path, was cued from inside into the lane, steadied to shift out passing the eighth pole, and rallied to get up late. PAPA
JIMMY stalked from the two path, bid from the three path into the stretch, and ran on but was caught late to place. DAMIR set the pace in the two path, was
coaxed from inside at the top of the lane, but yielded. UNORTHODOX trailed in the two path, saved ground into the lane, and improved up the rail late.
YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA tracked from the two path, was cued from four wide at the top of the stretch, but finished evenly. CLEVER FELLOW chased in the
three path, was ridden five wide into the stretch, but flattened. INGREIDO prompted the pace three wide, floated out to the five path into the stretch, but
faded. REPEATED PROMISE pressed two wide but dropped out around the far turn.
