Footnotes
BRUSTER JUSTICE broke well to lead the way in the two path, was in a steady drive to rally on the turn then drew away in the stretch under a strong hand
drive to prevail. HEALING WATERS broke inwardly at the start then chased the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive on the turn then menaced in upper
stretch and closed well. AARON'S CONQUEST broke out at the start, then was bumped by an outer rival, then pressed the pace from the inside into the
turn to rally in the early stretch but flattened out in the end. CONQUERED broke in at the start and bumped rival, then chased the pace while three wide to
menace on turn but came up evenly in the stretch. MACHO JUSTICE broke outwardly at the start and bumped rival, then bid in close early, was steadily
fading and had no final bid. OH SO SOCIAL broke inwardly at the start then was unhurried early, swung five to six wide on the turn and was no threat. There
was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION. The rider of AARON'S CONQUEST claimed foul against the rider of BRUSTER JUSTICE for
interference in the stretch. After review, no change was made.

MYSTERY UNBRIDLED bobbled at the start then set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive entering the second turn, was challenged by an outer
rival, dug in gamely then drew clear in the stretch under a strong drive to prevail. PURPLE SHIRT was unhurried early and was saving ground on the
backstretch, then came out five wide on the second turn to close belatedly in the home stretch and was second best. UPHOLD was bumped at the start,
then saved ground while three wide on the backstretch to bid four wide on the far turn and was closing well along the rail in the stretch but it was not
enough. JINGLE gained ground steadily on the backstretch while four wide to chase the pace into the far turn, menaced in the upper stretch to close well
but it was not enough. BANDIDO DE AMORES settled in the two path on the backstretch then came out four wide to rally in the stretch drive but came up
evenly. CLOSE THE CASE tracked the pace while two wide then came out seven wide on the second turn to bid mildly in the stretch and was no threat.
TWO LAST WORDS stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch then faded entering the second half of the course and had no final bid. ROCKET
DOCKET broke out at the start and bumped rival then stalked the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive to challenged the leader on the second turn,

Footnotes
CABLE CHANNEL settled along the inside on the backstretch, was moving up on the far turn to menace while five wide in the upper stretch then surged to
the wire to be up just in time. CREATIVE MIRACLE broke inwardly at the start, was unhurried early, then was gaining ground gamely along the rail on the
second turn, gained command in the early stretch but was caught in the end and was second best. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD was in a steady drive while
racing from the inside on the backstretch, then came out three wide on the second turn to rally in the stretch, was in tight then continued to bid well and was
up for the show prize. FIGHTING HEART was bumped at the start then raced in the middle of the field while four wide, was in a steady drive to menace in
the early stretch then flattened out and missed third. HIGH DEFF (FR) was unhurried early then swung six wide on the far turn to make a mild bid in the
stretch and was no threat. RAVE ON set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive on the backstretch into the turn, was used up and faltered in the
home stretch. SKYLINE chased the pace while two wide then came out four wide to bid the far turn and was no menace. MOON DOG broke outwardly at
the start and bumped foe then raced in the middle of the field while two wide into the second turn and failed to rally. BARBARIAN settled in the two path
then bid on the far turn but never fired in the stretch. STUBBORNKINDAFELLA raced in the middle of the field while three wide then faded entering the
second half and needed more in the end. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of BARBARIAN
claimed foul against the rider of CABLE CHANNEL for interference on the backstretch. After reviewing the replay, the claim was disallowed.
