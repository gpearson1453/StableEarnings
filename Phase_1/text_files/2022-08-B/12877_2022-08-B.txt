Footnotes
COULTERBERRY settled of the dueling leaders while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, advanced from along the inside midway down the
backstretch to gain a striking position approaching the final turn, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide to engage the
pacesetters entering the lane, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get the better of AIRAFFAIR in the final strides to prevail. AIRAFFAIR broke
sharply and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the backstretch, battled for the lead from just off the rail from the inside of WISE
MARKET in the run down the backside and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival leaving the turn, but was quickly tackled by
COULTERBERRY, and just failed to last. WISE MARKET away well and pressed the pace from the outside of AIRAFFAIR in the run down the backstretch,
continued to battle with that rival through the final turn, was unable to match strides with that foe leaving the turn, and finished two wide in the drive to hold
on for a share. ADITYA away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the
final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to improve his position. WE'RE IN COMMAND settled off the early pace while racing one out
from the rail entering the backstretch, trailed the field in the run to the final turn, and failed to mount a late bid when called upon.

MAKIN IT UP away alertly and tracked the leader through the second turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide from the outside of
BAKZONE in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, took control midway through the turn and quickly drew clear to prove best. BAKZONE
broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of MAKIN IT UP in the run
down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival leaving the turn, but battled gamely through the lane to hold the place.
HARLAN'S ANGEL away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while under snug restraint at the rail, maintained her position in the
run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to just miss the place. ZETAMARIE stalked the leaders
into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, advanced into a tracking trip two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed
to make an impact. The one mile split for this race was currently unavailable

FRANKIE MACHINE away well and pressed the pace from the outside of BABY GRAND entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two
wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival leaving the turn, and finished determinedly two wide in the drive
while holding off the closers to prevail. JUST MAKE BELIEVE boke sharply and stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time,
maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and battled willingly three wide from between rivals in deep
stretch to just miss. MY COLLEGE FUND stalked the dueling leader one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run
down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss. ERLICH settled well off
the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, began to advance from along the inside midway to the final turn,
rallied two wide entering the turn, swung five wide for the drive, and found his best stride late. MR. QUALITY settled off the early pace while racing one out
from the rail through the stretch the first time, bided his time well off the pacesetters in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, but failed to mount a serious late impact when called upon. BABY GRAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
set a pressured pace from the inside of FRANKIE MACHINE through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead
through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival entering the lane, and weakened in the drive.

AVE'S IN COMMAND away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of LITTLE GROOT entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide from the
outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, continued that pace battle into the lane before getting the better of LITTLE
GROOT late while drifting four wide nearing the wire, and fended off a late surge by QUAGMIRE to prevail. QUAGMIRE away alertly and tracked the
dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and found his best stride late while splitting
rivals to gain the place in the closing strides. LITTLE GROOT broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured
pace from the inside of AVE'S IN COMMAND in the run down the backside and through the final turn, continued that pace battle into the lane, but was
outfinished in deep stretch in a game effort. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing three wide from between rivals, got
shuffled back to trail approaching the final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, but needed more late while finishing four wide in the drive. TIZ MEOW

Footnotes
TEX TONIC broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and
closed willingly two wide in the drive, and wore the pacesetter down late to prevail. WELLSLEY away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BLACKSTONE in the run down the backside, assumed command entering the final turn, and just failed
to last. FORCE TO REKN WITH stalked the leaders while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside through the final
turn under snug restraint while awaiting room at the rail, and continued from along the rail through the entire stretch while awaiting room that never
materialized. PENALTY TO RANGERS settle off the early leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the
inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while racing a bit greenly. PENALTY TO RANGERS pulled up following the race in
some distress and was vanned off. BETTER WITH TIME settled well off the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backside,
rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished five wide in the stretch drive while unable to make a serious late impact. LUCKY COWBOY was slow into
stride, and lagged well off the early pace while racing three wide entering the first turn, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished with some late
interest three wide in the drive. DADDY'S PEPPER settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. BLACKSTONE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of
WELLSLEY entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. JUST MISTY dwelt at the
start, to get away poorly, trailed well behind the field throughout, and was never a factor. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted inquiries
into both the start and the stretch run. Following review, there was no change made to the original order of finish.

HEART OF TEXAS tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue three wide midway down the backside,
continued to battle for the lead through the final turn from the outside of BAKFIRE BABY, and got the better of that stubborn rival late to prevail. BAKFIRE
BABY away well and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch
and through the final turn, and battled determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss. LIVING SKY away alertly and moved up on the outside of
BAKFIRE BABY to press the pace entering the backstretch, battled two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the top
pair midway through the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. HEREVERYWISH stalked the dueling leaders into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a
serious late impact. SUNGOLD BEAUTY broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. DO YOU WANNA GO settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to menace.
