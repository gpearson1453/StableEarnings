Footnotes
ARUMA forced the pace outside, bid clear in mid stretch then lasted driving in a tight finish. JEZEBEL JADE chased wide in the opening half mile, split rivals
late, closed strongly and just missed. LA REGALADA made a menacing wide move on the turn then continued willingly. DECISIVE CAUSE trailed early,
advanced quickly along the rail, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by. POOR NO MORE lacked speed inside and was never in contention.
SHEWEARSTHEPANTS broke through prior to the start, rushed to the front inside then proved empty in the lane.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO BRIDGE engaged in a race-long battle alternating for the lead and earned a dead heat. GIVE ME TWO STEPS dueled outside throughout,
led briefly in mid stretch and fought gamely to earn dead heat. INSTANT CHAOS saved ground early, angled out in the stretch, loomed threat, tired.
SINGINTHRUTHESTORM was urged close up four wide down the backstretch and faded on the turn. LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind then caught
stopping rivals late. DREAMING THOUSAND chased wide down the backstretch then gave way. VICTORY IS OURS dropped well behind and was always
outrun.

DEBBIE'S SURPRISE dueled along the rail, shook loose at the quarter pole and pulled away while geared down late. ESCANDALO lacked speed,
advanced wide and was easily second best. EDIES WAY broke a step slowly, rushed up inside then flattened out in the lane. SCARF dropped well behind
and caught a pair of fading rivals late. HOPS PETUNIA stalked the dueling pacesetters outside and weakened. ORB'S PARTY GIRL dueled outside to the
five sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
DIANE'S COMET rated just off the pacesetter, faded briefly on the turn, angled out and came again to gain the decision. DON'T B RIDICULOUS settled in
the clear off the pace, bid to front into the stretch then tired. HOT LITTLE NUMBER far behind early, moved wide in the stretch with late energy.
BLUEBERRY PIE chased off the pace, advanced wide with a gradual gain. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO dropped far behind, ducked in mid stretch and was no
factor. PAGE ELEVEN saved ground off the pace and was never a factor. TREASURE SEEKER raced outside and was never in contention. SO SWELL
raced in the two path and was always outrun. RELENTLESS CANDY set the pace in hand to the final turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
LIVE AID stalked the pacesetters three wide, bid clear nearing mid stretch then held on gamely through final furlong. BLUNT FORCE lacked speed,
advanced wide, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. SIZZLING ROMA outrun early, moved very wide in the stretch to gain the show.
GRAZEN HONOR broke slowly and chased far back then moved wide in the stretch gaining. MEMPHIS MAFIA was shuffled back in the opening quarter
then flattened out along the rail. REITERATE vied outside, bid clear on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. BACK CHANNEL hustled to a narrow
advantage inside then was finished after half a mile.

PRINCESS SOPHIE firmly rated inside, took over on the final turn, drew off then remained safe under mild urging. CHELSEA WALL lacked speed near
inside, bid strongly on the final turn then angled out in the stretch rallying. TILSA saved ground off the pace then flattened out in the stretch. J D'S VISTA
dropped back after start, raced extremely wide then rallied and tired. CATTI LA BELLE fanned wide on the first turn and was never a factor. A BIT BAD N
BOUJEE raced far behind then passed fading rivals. SYSTEMIC RISK prompted the pace outside to the final turn and stopped. BOOM BOOM GIRL was
urged close up for half a mile then bore out tiring. JACKIE THE JOKER hustled to the front early then stopped after half a mile.

Footnotes
HALLIGIRL dueled outside to the final sixteenth and edged clear in the final furlong under steady handling. MY CORALENA came out at the start, angled
inside to duel then weakened slightly in the stretch. PRINCESS KAIRA crowded at the start, moved inside, angled out in the stretch rallying. HIT A HOMER
HONEY bothered from her inside at the break, saved ground and continued willingly. MISS ALEX moved off the inside within striking range and tired.
APPRECIATE raced very wide throughout and gave way readily. FALL CAMPAIGN broke very poorly losing all chance at the start. ARDEAN prompted the
pace three wide briefly then stopped abruptly.
