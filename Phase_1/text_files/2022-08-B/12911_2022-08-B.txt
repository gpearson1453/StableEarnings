Footnotes
KATY THE CAT set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then held sway late to prove best under a drive. BONITA LASSIE was well
placed along the inside, eased out nearing the quarter pole and made a two wide bid leaving the turn, and was slowly gaining to the wire but needed more,
second best. DANCE A LITTLE JIG was allowed to settle and advanced on the inside on the turn and had no rally, bested rest. EARLY FROST was four
wide into the first turn, prompted the pace three wide and weakened. WILL TAKE ROSES tracked the pace two wide, then shifted out and was four wide on
the turn and tired. RAECHEL'S RISK pressed the pace between rivals and stopped.

prove best under a drive. SPEEDY MOONLITE pressed the pace three wide, then was three to two wide on the turn and held the place award. CALL WIL
tracked the pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and had a mild lae rally. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA chased the pace and
saved ground on the turn and had no kick. FLASHINTHENIGHT was bumped and lost an iron at the start, then raced between horses, then on the turn rider
reached down and got his boot back into the iron, then did finish with some late interest. OBROTHER ITSYLVIA was reserved early, came wide into the
lane and had a belated rally. NOT A TRICK was settled and four wide on the turn and was not a threat. RAILMASTER was allowed to settle on the inside
and weakened. BLOODPROF was reserved early, angled out in the lane and was no threat. PER RULING 22195PN FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING

FILLMORE EAST was well rated along the inside to the quarter pole, then eased out and came four wide into the lane, closed well to draw away late to
prove best under a drive. MOON CHANT set the early pace while clear, then drew out leaving the turn but faded late, held place award. STRONG GEM was
allowed to settle early, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then was slowly gaining but needed more, missed place award. WITCH was four
wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and then two wide on the turn, weakened. LOOP THE LOOP was reserved early, then saved ground on
the turn and had a belated rally on the inside. SWITCHRATTLENROLL was four wide on both turns and passed the tiring rivals. PARANOIA lacked a rally.
SAILOR'S SALUTE failed to respond. STUY TOWN BABY was well placed on the inside and tired. FALSE RULING showed little.

GRATITUDE ATTITUDE dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn and kicked away to prove best under a drive. NOTEWORTHY
tracked the pace on the inside to the quarter pole, then eased off the inside and angled out leaving the three sixteenths and finished willingly but failed to
gain on the winner, second best. BAILEY COFFEE was allowed to settle early, then was ridden along on the turn two wide, came four wide into the drive
and had no kick while racing green. NORTHWOODS was reserved early and saved ground on the turn, then showed some late interest on the inside to just
miss the show award. ECLIPTICALS BEAR pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the drive. WICKED IRISHMAN prompted the early pace three wide
and weakened on the turn.

ROCKIN COWBOY set a pressured pace early, drew clear on the turn while in the two to three path, then was kept to pressure to prove much the best. MY
MAGICAL MAN pressed the winner early to his inside, then was two to three wide on the turn while chasing that rival, then failed to gain while staying on to
be second best. AFLEET TRAXX was allowed to settle and saved ground on the turn, angled out in the drive and had a belated rally. PECOS BILL chased
the pace three to four wide and had no kick. COAST TO COAST tracked the early pace and chased the pace on the inside on the turn and weakened. GEM
JUAN was settled three wide and had no rally. CALL ME G Q bobbled at the start and failed to menace.

Footnotes
VITESSE was off a beat slow, then made a inside middle move to press the pace setter on the inside nearing the half mile marker, then rated off on the turn,
angled out in the stretch and closed late and got up in time to prove best, driving. CHARGING LION sent to the lead to set the pace while racing in the two
path, then remained clear nearing the sixteenth marker and was denied late to just fail. PEPE TONO was rated along and made a three wide move on the
turn, then finished willingly but was outkicked. THE GREAT CASBY was allowed to settle towards the inside on the backstretch, eased out on the turn and
came five wide into the lane and loomed boldly by the furlong marker, but needed more late. VISHNU tracked the pace two wide, then was between rivals
by the quarter pole, and faded in the drive. MAIN COOL CAT was allowed to settle three wide and had no rally. SURFER BOY GEORGE was not a factor
on the inside.

Footnotes
WAHOOWA WAHOOWA was sent to the front to set the early pace, was well handled and remained clear by the sixteenth marker, then was kept safe late
to prove best under a drive. AGAINST THE ODDS chased the early pace between rivals, then shuffled back and shifted to the outside on the turn, advanced
five wide by the quarter pole, then closed well on the outside, second best. I SEE THE STARS was well placed on the inside, then eased out for aim on the
winner and came three wide into the lane, shifted out by the sixteenth marker and hung. HIS NAME IS SUE chased the pace on the inside, steadied by the
three eighths marker, then made a inside bid leaving the turn but had no late kick. DROSSELMOON was bumped at the start, then had a five to six wide
pursuit and came widest into the lane and had no rally. SACRED MOUNTAIN chased the pace and was four wide on the turn and weakened. BLUEGRASS
POSSE was allowed to settle on the inside and was not a threat. KUDURO stalked the pace three wide and weakened.
