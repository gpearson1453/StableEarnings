Footnotes
A J'S RIDE sped to the lead at the start and set the uncontested pace, came two wide into the lane, pulled away from the field and kept to task while ridden
out. TASHA tracked the pace three wide, hustled along three to four wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and cleared second best.
BOOTLEGGING GIRL was forwardly placed soon after the start and chased the leader into the turn, hustled along two to three wide into the lane and ran on
for a share. I GUESS NOT raced in the last flight, was ridden along two wide into the lane and failed to threaten the top trio. STREAKIN' EASY raced off the
pace, chased three wide around the turn and never threatened. SURE WASN'T ME raced in early contention along the inside, weakened around the turn
and continued to tire in the drive.

the backstretch, waited near the inside around the far turn then given cue three wide in upper stretch, got edged late for show but finished well clear over the
rest. TACTICAL REBEL dueled outside of SOLE SURVIVOR around the first turn and continued to battle around the final turn, got collared by the winner at
the head of the lane and gave way. BLUEGRASS FLIGHT settled off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the lane and failed to rally. SOLE

the turn, swung five wide into the lane and rallied to get up for place. COLD AS YOU chased three wide around the turn, sustained a four wide into the lane
and secured a share. BLUSHING SCARLETT chased between foes in opening stages then ran on two wide around the turn, sustained bid into upper
stretch then weakened past the furlong marker. CYBER SNEAKER raced off the pace and saved ground, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and lacked a
rally. MAGIC IN A HAT was ridden along off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and failed to move on. SENTIMENTAL CROSS sped to the lead
soon after the start and showed the way around the turn, got collared by the winner at the head of the lane and steadily faded. HATCHET GURL was

Footnotes
LET'S GO LACEY was forwardly placed soon after the start, dueled between foes around the turn, battled on with REDNECKER through the lane and
edged ahead in deep stretch. REDNECKER dueled inside of duo into the turn, continued to match strides with LETS GO LACEY into the lane, held a slight
edge at the furlong marker then failed to contain the winner late. DIAMOND OF EKATI tracked the embattled trio around the turn, swung four to five wide
into the lane and got up late for show. FREEIA TAP dueled three deep for the lead around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane, flattened
in the final furlong and got edged for show. DELIGHT SURPRISE was away in good order then quickly dropped to last, continued in the back then hustled
along two to three wide into the lane and gained position without threatening. SLOOPY HANG ON chased the pace along the inside around the turn then
came up empty in the lane.

OSCAR WINNER WALLY raced off the second flight into the turn then was ridden along three to four wide, edged closer along the outside in upper stretch,
dug in under firm handling and got up late. DAAHERS BULLY sped to a slim lead in opening stages and showed the way around the turn, came three wide
into the lane, held a slim lead at the furlong, stayed on gamely and got denied in deep stretch. CHINLEE was forwardly placed and chased three wide
around the turn, edged ahead and raced in striking distance in the final furlong then yielded late. MY BOBBY MCGEE was reserved racing well off the early
pace, shifted out midway around the turn, swung six wide into the lane and gained late. A BRUSH OF LUCK raced off the early pace, edged closer four
wide midway around the turn then flattened in the upper stretch and ran on evenly. SIR ELI raced two wide around the turn, stayed in the same path into the
lane and lacked a rally. SEMI CHARMED DAY was forwardly placed along the inside, sustained bid around the turn then gave way. RIDING THE TRAIN
raced in contention through early stages, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
