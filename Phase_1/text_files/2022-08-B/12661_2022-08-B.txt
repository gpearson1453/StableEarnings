Footnotes
LADY MOONSHINE sat inside just behind the contesting frontrunners down the backside, moved out midway on the far turn to the three path to bid in upper
stretch, battled outside for an eighth and was inching away coming to the finish. WHO SAYS chased the pace in the beginning, engaged the leader outside
three furlongs out, rallied between foes at the top of the stretch, fought on stubbornly inside with the winner midway through the lane and gave way nearing
the finish. TEMPEREYA cleared around horses to lead going into the backstretch, was headed outside with three eighths to go, dueled at the quarter on the
fence and could not find enough late to keep up with the top two while finishing a clear third. PEMBERLEY trailed after the start, was roused outside runners
with two furlongs left and passed tiring horses while finishing up a non threatening fourth. GAV'S DREAM GIRL hopped on the break, settled near the back
in the early stages, was coaxed with a quarter out to go on entering upper stretch and offered little response to the wire. TAQUANYAH stumbled at the start,
rated just outside runners mid pack, was ridden into far turn to keep position, could not go on with rivals with five sixteenths to go, retreated and had no
impact down the lane.

Footnotes
FEDALIA tracked from inside, moved out two wide to bid between foes leaving the turn, took the lead past the three-sixteenths, drifted out a bit in late
stretch while clear and kept to the task. VERY SAVVY tracked from between runners going two then three wide on the turn, had good late stride to get up
for second. OLD SECRETS switched outside foes and settled off the pace, advanced four then five wide on the turn looming a threat six deep at the top of
the stretch, lugged in a bit at that juncture, evened out thereafter. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH was in tight quarters after the break, settled at the rear racing off
the inside, angled six wide turning for home, ran on with belated interest. CARELESS HEIRESS was mildly coaxed forward inside to dictate terms,
weakened in the stretch. SASSY MARTINI pressed from outside early, went three to four wide on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
SPIDER BELLE trailed leaving the chute, began looping runners on the turn easily to contend coming into the stretch, was roused with an eighth to go and
was drawing away nicely in the end. STERLING SPEED pounced on the contesting rivals at the quarter pole outside to gain the lead turning for home, was
quickly challenged by the winner closing widest in the five path and could not respond to that late charge while holding well onto the place position. MITZI
was away alertly only to duck in at the extension rail to then be shuffled to near the back, rallied when angling off the fence in the four path with a quarter to
run and finished well on end to be a clear third at the wire. SWIRLING DANCER broke sharp to lead, was headed at the five eighths pole for a brief moment,
pulled away to lead into the turn, was collared three furlongs out, fought on in upper stretch and weakened on the fence the last eighth. SPEEDY LYNN
rated inside just behind the pacesetters down the backside, was ridden throughout the turn on the rail to try to get into contention and could not be a
presence in the stretch run. HATMAKER HOLIDAY engaged the frontrunner between rivals early in the backstretch, regained command outside at the
quarter pole, was challenged at the top of the stretch by an outside foe, offered no resistance and stopped with a furlong to go.

Footnotes
VALLEY GIRL stalked the leader into the turn going three wide on that bend, took the lead by the eighth pole, lugged out a bit while edging away under
hand urging. MACHISIMA set the pace racing off the rail, went in about the two path through the turn, yielded only grudgingly. CRUMLIN TIME tracked
inside, kept on to hold show honors. PLUIE D'AVRIL shifted in, went three to four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. LIL'S TURN was bumped at the break,
moved in to save ground racing inside, asked nearing the three-eighths for more, failed to menace. STORMY DERBY DAY raced off the leaders two wide
into the turn, asked for more nearing the three-eighths, angled five wide past the quarter pole, failed to rally in the stretch. BOSSALINA was bumped lightly
at the start, raced three to four wide, was never a threat. CALL HER JOEY bumped a rival at the start, lacked early speed racing inside, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LUCKY CURLIN was allowed to settle at the back early, started his run inside going into the turn, angled to the three path to take command with three
sixteenths to go and was kept to the task holding off a closing outside charge at the finish. CLEAR DESTINATION rated near the rear outside after the
break, was roused going four wide midway into the turn and was full of run late closing well outside of horses in the final sixteenth to make it close at the
wire. MY SILENCER battled for the top spot through the turn, inched away from a fellow pacesetter with two furlongs out only to be collared at the top of the
stretch to give away inside, but fought stubbornly on the fence to regain third from his outside rival in deep stretch. IT'S GAME KNIGHT rallied just outside
with three eighths to go to contend for the the lead between runners turning for home, tried to quicken with the winner in mid stretch and faded with horses
on both sides in the final sixteenth to lose 3rd late. HICKSY brushed the gate at the start, rated inside down the backside, coaxed on the turn to offer a rally,
was checked trying to go around a tiring runner on the outside and could not get involved through the lane. VANBRUGH battled just outside early for the
lead, surrendered between runners nearing the quarter pole and was not persevered with though the lane.

MORE THAN HAPPY switched out early, was forced five wide into the turn, swept past runners from outside on that bend, struck the lead and drifted in at
the three-sixteenths, drew off under vigorous hand urging. WICKED CRAZY tracked from inside, moved out a path in upper stretch, advanced between foes
in late stretch to get up for second. TARADAR pressed from inside, dropped back off the leaders on the turn, shifted outside three wide past the quarter
pole, kept on but was outfinished for second. NORTHERN CONQUEST raced mid-pack pursuing in behind the leading trio, went four then five wide on the
turn, ran on. BOLD DIAMONDS BFF was mid-pack near the inside, shifted out coming to the quarter pole, entered upper stretch five to six wide and ran on
with mild late interest. CAUSES TROUBLE was forwardly-placed between runners, set the tempo two wide, came in a bit leaving the turn and weakened in
the stretch. KATZISALLIHOPEFOR was off the leaders early going three wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch, failed to menace. SILENT THUNDER
pressed from outside three wide, came up empty. PAINTING THE MOON raced off the pace near the inside, was never a threat and not persevered with in
the stretch. WIN THE DRAW chased very briefly, steadily retreated, was eased through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
BLU SKY SUNRISE lead from the break, was well rationed on the front end setting slow fractions going into the first turn, opened up on the field in upper
stretch and had enough late to hold off the closing runners. ZAFEATHER trailed runners down the backstretch, began to thread her way inside on the fence
through the far turn, found a seam at the top of the lane to split horses mid stretch and was gaining steadily on the winner at the finish. ADMONISH broke
awkward to trail into the first turn, began advancing four wide three furlongs out, offered a mild bid turning for home and stalled with a furlong out losing
second place nearing the wire. FORESTERS PRINCESS rated mid pack down the backside between runners, was coaxed through the turn between horses
and ran one paced through the lane passing fading runners to get a minor share. GOLD FORESTER was asked to go after the leader midways on the
second turn, little response was offered and weakened between horses with an eighth to go. JOLENE JOLENE was three wide into the first turn, advanced
down the backside to be in contention with three eighths to go, retreated outside of runners while racing wide through the far turn and was not persevered
with in the final stages of the race. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA rated just behind the pace on the rail early, was ridden on the fence through the far turn to
contend turning for home and weakened between runners at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
COURTINGCOURTNEY broke inwardly bumping a rival lightly and steadying slightly, was encouraged forward while shifting in to track inside just off the
pace, came out three wide about the five-sixteenths, struck the lead outside the eighth pole, kicked clear late under solid urging. BRIENNE OF TARTH was
brushed at the start then coaxed clear outside a rival moving in early on the first turn, set the pace inside, had no extra late. HIGH TREASON settled toward
the rear racing off the fence in the three to four path, swung six wide into the stretch, gained but too late. HARD ROCK WARRIOR settled well back inside,
began to advance two wide on the far turn, angled five wide turning for home, ran on mildly. LA PRINCESSA POLLY tracked up close inside, ran on evenly.
MILWAUKEE BAY was mid-pack three wide through both turns and failed to rally. SUSPICIOUS MINDS failed to threaten after racing mostly three to four
wide. NADIABIZNIZ got away alertly but ceded the lead to another rival switching outside that one on the first turn, pressed up the backstretch two to three
wide, asked for more by the three-eighths but had none and faded.
