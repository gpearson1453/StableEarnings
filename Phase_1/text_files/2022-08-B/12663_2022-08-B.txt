Footnotes
HOLDONTOYOURTIARA chased pace to the turn, took over into stretch, hung on late. PABLO'S MINX never far back outside to the stretch, rallied in
earnest, missed. DESTINY'S DARLING settled outside to the stretch, moved up in the late going. SISTER'S GHOST dueled entry mate to the stretch, used
up grudgingly late. MY DARK SECRET no speed to the stretch, rallied outside to close the gap late. ANOTATION pressed pace three wide to stretch, gave
way in the drive readily. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY broke slow from gate, never menaced thereafter. KITTY'S PROMISE through after half, faded back
rapidly. HOWIZEE through early, dropped back readily.
