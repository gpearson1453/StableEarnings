Footnotes
UNCLE WATER FLOW went three then four wide around the first turn, settled on the far outside, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, went four wide
under a strong-hand ride on the far turn, gained five wide into the stretch, made an outside bid while lugging in under extra right-rein pressure at the
three-sixteenths, drifted to the inside while moving clear into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop shortly thereafter, switched to a
left-handed crop and was given one pop near the sixteenth-pole then placed under hand-ride to the wire while much the best. LUCKY MUCHO MAN went
two then three wide around the first turn, settled on the inside of a rival, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, chased in the three path around the far turn,
was driven four wide into the stretch, made a bid between foes at the three-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match
while able to safely secure the place. SENSIBLECONCLUSION was sent from the gate, raced inside to the two path around that bend, tracked outside
down the backstretch, came under urging with five furlongs to run, made a bid in the two path into the far turn, gained the lead outside the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide into the stretch then was put to a left-handed crop, lost the advantage to the winner in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, dropped back into
the final furlong and weakened but was well clear for the show. UNCLE BRUCE was sent hard to the front, went clear while dropping from the three path
towards the rail on the first turn, showed the way in hand down the backstretch, vied inside under heavy threat on the far turn, lost the lead under urging
outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. REUNION TOUR was unsettled in the gate then off slow, spotted the front a few
lengths, angled in at the back, moved closer outside the five-eighths, was hard ridden while moving from the rail to the three path on the far turn, floated five
wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BUSTIN BAY four wide in pursuit throughout, advanced on the top pair through the far turn and was set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch,
seized command straightened away and drew clear under a drive to prevail. CARAGATE broke out at the start and was corrected, raced three wide in
closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch between foes, kept on to secure the place
honors after proving no match for the top one in the stretch. EPONA'S DREAM bobbled at the break recovering inwards and broke on top despite it, showed
the way lightly coaxed along coming under some pressure from the aforementioned foe nearing the far turn and then a pair of rivals midway on that bend,
took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest for the
show honors. OK HONEY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, tired. A BIT O'IRISH
SASS chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. IFIHADACHANCE chased three wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths and made no impact.

GET THE CANDY strolled to the front, was well rated while setting an easy pace through tepid fractions, raced inside around the turn, responded well when
asked at the quarter-pole, remained on her inside lead while put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead at the eighth-pole,
responded gamely under a continued right-handed crop in the final furlong and held determinedly to prevail. JILL'S A HOT MESS stalked the slow pace on
the outside, inched closer in the two path around the turn, cruised into upper stretch under her own power, was asked inside the three-sixteenths, battled
outside of the winner in the final furlong, was put to the crop outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to her inside lead into the final sixteenth and couldn't
get by while able to hold the place. SASSY MELISSA was reserved under a tight hold, went around the turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole
then steadied behind horses in upper stretch, waited under coaxing while blocked to the sixteenth-pole, came out at that juncture then bumped
FONTANAFREDDA soundly, bobbled some shortly thereafter and finished willingly to narrowly get the show but lost her best chance at victory.
FONTANAFREDDA was last to commence, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, chased outside into the final furlong, was bumped by
SASSY MELISSA soundly just inside the sixteenth-pole then forced out and just missed the show. SHESAWILDJOKER settled at the rear of the field under
some restraint, rounded the turn in the three path, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, shifted four wide into the stretch, moved further out around
the three-sixteenths, chased outside into the final sixteenth then was forced out and lacked the needed kick. ITSAKEYPER smashed through the front of the
gate prior to the start but was held onto by the assistant starter, was brought back around and reloaded after being deemed fit to run by the state
veterinarian, came away in good order, was rated just off the pace on the inside under a snug hold, saved ground around the turn, was asked once
straightened for the drive, dropped back under strong encouragement into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS settled
on the outside, was asked three wide late on the turn, chased under a drive into upper stretch, was taken in hand while crowded between horses and being
out-kicked outside the furlong marker then weakened. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, SASSY MELISSA WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH

MEXICAN WONDER BOY hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, got set down spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, drew off under a drive kept to task. FLAMINGO HAWK coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear for the place honors. ALCOOLS chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued along the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. STAGE LEFT chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. ABSENTEE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. REJECTED AGAIN coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
CLEAR THE DECK broke very fast, chased the pace under strong urging, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, was driven four wide
into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths while still on his inside lead, swapped to the proper lead after getting one pop of a left-handed
crop outside the eighth-pole, gained the lead under strong hand-urging just inside the furlong marker, was given one more pop of a left-handed crop at the
sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. FORBIDDEN SECRET was reluctant to load then hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside
then in the three path around the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, lost the lead to the winner
just inside that marker, fought on to the wire but missed while well clear for the place. CHILDERS was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to
his outside, vied in the two path while inside of a foe for most of the turn, dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the runner-up
into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired while well clear for the show. TSURIS brushed the inside of the gate at the start, lacked
speed while ridden along, raced inside to the three path around the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. UNCLE DAN was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced well off the pace while hard ridden, traveled around the turn in the two path and was no factor. RAKA
RAKA CRUZ chased the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, fell further back in the four path around the turn, spun five wide into the
stretch and faltered. HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA

RECOGNIZE brushed the off side stall at the start and came under brief coaxing to establish the front and show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked
inside into the far turn and was patiently handled as rivals got busy in behind, took the inside route into upper stretch let out for the drive, drew clear under a
drive to prevail. BERNING HONOR brushed the off side stall at the start, tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the aforementioned foe, ran on to chase that rival home safely
securing the place honors. ORANGE FREEZE settled unhurried just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing tipped back to the two path at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick closing outside to procure the show
honors. DREAM ON CARA grew a bit rank when jostled between foes briefly before being restrained off heels of a rival into the first turn, tracked the pace
along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, improved position while losing ground to the finish. SARAH'S
DIALED IN three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the three-eighths pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. BERNT AGAIN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
drive. LUNA LOCA broke out a step at the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide for home and
tired. APRIL FIRST three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, cornered three wide at the top of the stretch and trailed.

path early on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, came under one pop of a right-handed crop around the three-sixteenths then switched to
left-handed crop, responded well in the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. TRUEBELIEVE showed speed between horses,
steadied then was squeezed back at the nine-sixteenths while behind the hedge on the pan-camera view and lost position, went around the turn in the two
path, was given his cue at the quarter-pole then shifted four wide over heels into upper stretch and finished with good courage for the place. VETERANS

at the quarter-pole then came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. BOOM
BOOM KABOOM tossed his head at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, raced outside at the rear, went four then five wide on the
turn, was fanned out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. STEELERSFANFORLIFE lacked speed under some urging, raced inside of a rival
while under restraint in the three path around the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. CHARLES CHROME pressed the pace
down the backstretch, stalked two then three wide on the turn, was given his cue coming to the quarter-pole and came up empty. LOADED JOE was hustled
from the gate, showed speed between horses then chased the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was fanned out in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
WARRIOR JOHNY forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn, advanced three to four paths off the rail into the backstretch taking over
command from a hard held and choked back NABOKOV, tucked to the inside five furlongs from home and showed the way along the rail patiently handled
through the far turn as rivals got busy in behind, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got given a notch and placed to coaxing straightened away and
went clear in hand through to the finish to prevail comfortably on the wire. PERCEIVED saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing just off the
inside at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the place honors while never threatening the top
one. COMPLETE AGENDA saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. UNBRIDLED BOMBER chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went eight wide at the head of the
stretch, weakened in the drive. NABOKOV bobbled breaking in at the start and was shouldered by COMPLETE AGENDA bobbling back to the outside and
placing WINIT in tight against WARRIOR JOHNY, showed the way early on under a light hold before being taken hard hold of and wrangled back off the
lead when WARRIOR JOHNY advance outside into the backstretch, chased two to three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, tired through to the finish bumping WINIT just inside the eighth pole before coming over again and
getting a solid bump on that eased up rival a sixteenth out and headed him at the finish. WINIT brushed between foes at the start and placed in tight, chased
two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive briefly before being taken in hand when
tiring, got bumped by NABOKOV just inside the eighth pole and then got bumped solidly once more near the sixteenth marker as that rival again came
inwards seeking him and was headed on the wire among the remaining finishers. VASARIANO away well, got taken in reserve and went four then three
wide into the first turn to midway before tucking briefly to the two path, chased three then two wide from near the rear of the field coming under prolonged
coaxing at the half mile pole, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. Following the finish it was reported that
NABOKOV was the focus of a Stewards' Inquiry in the stretch involving interference with WINIT and was disqualified from fifth and placed sixth for
interference before the race was declared official.

SELL SOMETHING coaxed from the gate, got pinched between foes into the first turn and tracked just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside into
the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, edged clear to
the finish to prevail. URAGANO hustled from the start, pinched out a pair of rivals on his way to the first turn showing the way early on before ABLETON
advanced into the backstretch to take over with five furlongs to go, tracked that rival in aim along the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths,
swung four then three wide into upper stretch, took over at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and was caught a sixteenth from home, ran on to
preserve the place honors. ABLETON got pinched back after the start by URAGANO, raced along the inside through the first turn before tipping to the three
path into the backstretch advancing to take command with five furlongs to go, tucked inside through the far turn coming under coxing near the quarter pole
and took the inside route into upper stretch, got headed for the front at the three-sixteenths, fought on inside keeping on to just hold for the show honors on
the wire. TOGA DANCER coaxed from the start, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three to four wide from that point onwards, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just miss for the show honors. LOZ hustled from the
start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. CASH BAIL chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, continued just
off the inside into upper stretch and made no late headway. RUSH TO HONOR hustled from the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, weakened, then appeared to suffer an injury when galloping back and was pulled up and subsequently
vanned off. LOOKIN GRAND three wide in pursuit, came under coxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired. PHOEBE'S FROSTY
just off the inside in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and retreated, swung five wide into upper stretch, folded in the drive. MARIE'S
TUFF SON three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide losing ground and growing detached from the main body of the field into the far turn,
continued three to four wide and was eased home to the finish.
