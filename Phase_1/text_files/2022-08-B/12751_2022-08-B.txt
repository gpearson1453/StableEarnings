LADY IN HEELS sprinted to a clear lead quickly while pulling, held sway without challenge to the lane, then drew off and was kept to the task. IRISH
DREAM GIRL well placed and three wide, dropped back and angled in into the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, then closed willingly and
edged up for the place. ETTAPLACE mid pack, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, angled five wide,
made a steady gain and missed the place. SO MOXIE broke a step slowly from the gate, looped up four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. CINCO DE MANDEE tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, angled
four wide into the stretch and weakened. TUDOX ROADSTER mid pack, dropped back in the early going, looped three and four wide through the turn, came
four wide into the stretch and improved her position. QUALITY TOO SPARE passed tiring rivals. SERENE WARRIOR well placed and inside, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and faded the final furlong. EVERY LITTLE BIT well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide

Footnotes
JINGLE BELLS unhurried in the early going, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, closed through traffic and drew off
late. CHAOS KID rated outside the place, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn, then was no match for the winner late and held the place.
NO TIME TO YAWN set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then weakened late and held the show. ATLANTIC
RULER well placed and off the rail, angled in and saved ground through the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong
and held a share. FARAT mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was blocked late, steadied and could not
gain. PAUPING allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. KID
CHOCOLATE passed tiring rivals. PHARAOH'S PROPHECY mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the
stretch and faded. TITHED unhurried early, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally. HOUSE LIGHTS tracked
the pace and faded through the second turn.
