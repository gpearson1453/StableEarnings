Footnotes
DREAM HALO proved best in stretch duel and earned the victory after exchanging command as the widest of four rivals along the backstretch and around
the hook. D TWO broke alertly and rated between rivals on the front end through the opening half, locked into stretch duel, then was outfinished. CREATIVE
LETTERS shared early command from three wide, maintained that line through the bend, was within striking distance at upper stretch, but failed to match
strides with top pair in final sixteenth. TWO DOT came away slowly and behind all rivals, rushed up along the backstretch and established an inside stance
around the turn, rated close up at upper stretch then weakened in final furlong. THE GRAY BLUR lacked a needed rally after giving chase to pacesetters
from a trailing position.

Footnotes
PAPAWS BOY stalked the pace from an inside stance through the opening half, was on the heels of leader at upper stretch and trekking the two path, then
was piloted inward nearing the sixteenth pole and finished under a stiff drive while inching away at finish. ROOSTER RUN pressed the early pace from a
two path stance, gained command around the final bend, led the field at upper stretch, but was unable to fend off the late charge of eventual winner in final
sixteenth. TOUCH OF GOLD was unhurried from outset, trailed the field through the half, swung to be widest of all at upper stretch, then rallied mid track to
earn the show. OKUDAH saved ground to no avail. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN failed to match stride in final furlong after looming boldly on pacesetters heels
from a three wide stance. IMMORTAL lacked a needed rally to end a three wide journey. STEELS ALL IN rushed from outset to gain first command, set the
pace in unison as the inner rival through the half, then eclipsed in crucial stages of contest.

LOYAL TO THE CHIEF rushed from outset for first command, led every step of the way while trekking the two path, and drew off from all rivals in final
furlong. ASHLEY'S GIRL was unhurried along the backstretch, swung to be widest of all around the turn and at upper stretch, then closed with a rush to be
gaining on leader at finish. CAJUN ACES settled in just off the pace along the pace, tracked a four path position around the bend, was stronglt urged at
upper stretch, and finished willingly for the show. GOLD CHAIN broke slowly, rushed up along the backstretch, trekked the two path around the turn, rated in
second flight at head of stretch, and finished willingly to just miss the show. B B GUN BULLSEYE pressed the early pace from a three path pose,
maintained that line into the homestretch, then weakened in closing strides. WANNAMAKEABET rated mid pack along the backstretch, established an
inside stance around the turn, and steadily faded thereafter.

Lee, Louis R.;
Footnotes
WEDINGTON hustled from outset and established an inside stance while gaining first command, led the field at every call, and shook clear in final furlong
for a wire to wire score. THUNDER ROAD was unhurried from outset, trailed the field through the half, then circled rivals in the closing turn and earned the
place with a strong late kick. PHARME'S PHAITH showed reserve in the opening half and chased the front runners from a two path pose, angled out slightly
near the eighth pole and was closing fast in final furlong to earn the show. WINGS FOR ENO pressed the early pace from between rivals, rated within
striking distance entering the final turn, then gave way to rivals near the quarter pole. CROOKS REBEL trekked three wide early just off the pace, led the
second flight at upper stretch, then failed to sustain the bid and faded in the final furlong. OREGON COUNTY lacked a closing bid after settling into mid
pack and travelling wide in the latter half of contest. C. F. CONGRESS weakened in closing strides to end a wide trip.

Footnotes
SPEEDY G stalked the front runners as the inner rival in the second flight, angled out around the turn to be three wide at upper stretch, then ran down the
leader in final furlong for the score. LUCKY BREAK rushed form outset and established an inside stance, led the field from outset into upper stretch, but
failed to fend off the rally of the eventual winner in final sixteenth. MY BOY SAM was unhurried along the backstretch, trekked the two path through the turn,
drifted inward nearing the eighth pole and rallied to earn the show. JAMBI came up empty and was vid of response to urging after settling into mid pack and
losing ground to front runners with a four wide trip around the hook. TOP HAT CAT rushed from outset to press the pace from a two path stance, rated on
even terms as the outer rival of two abreast at upper stretch, but faded in final furlong. SKY WATCH settled into second flight as the widest rival, maintained
a wide line around the turn, then lacked a needed rally in the homestretch. BODEE BODEE was squeezed back shortly after the start, saved ground, and
lacked a needed a rally.

HUDSON'S TURN established a ground saving stance shortly after the start, stalked the pacesetting duo along the backstretch, awaited for opening around
the final bend, came under rousing at upper stretch, was piloted through the opening along the inside and shook clear in final furlong. INTO WISHING
loomed on the heels of the pace setting duo while trekking the two path in the opening half, lacked room at the head of homestretch, changed lanes inward
nearing the eighth pole and finished with a strong late kick to secure the place. MR. TIN MAN flashed early speed and set the pace from an inside stance,
locked into a four way stretch duel for place honors, but was outfinished in final sixteenth. CPRIORITY settled into mid pack while travelling widest of all,
then finished willingly and was part of four way photo for the show. ITS WILD AGAIN was unhurried through the opening half, angled out around the final
turn, and rallied mildly to be photoed out of the show. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF pressed the early pace from a two path pose, led the field at upper stretch,
then faded in closing strides. WESTERN STAR showed reserve and gave chase to rivals while trekking the three path, swung wide through the final turn,
and was no late menace.

Footnotes
WOMANONTHEWARPATH broke alertly and led the field in tandem along the backstretch, was up front on even terms as the inner most of three abreast at
upper stretch, relished command nearing the eight pole, then came again along the rail for the score. THROUGH THE CRACKS stalked the early pace from
the three path, advanced on leaders through the turn with a three wide move, led by a slim margin at the eighth pole, but was caught in final strides. KHOZY
TAP tucked to a ground saving pose shortly after the start, chased rivals from an inside line around the bend, then finished with late interest to procure the
show. VOODOO MISTRESS hustled away from the start and shared early command from a two path stance, rated close up between rivals at upepr stretch,
then failed to sustain the bid and weakened in final furlong. TWISTED BRADE came up empty after rating between rivals in the second flight and angling out
at upper stretch to no avail. UNBRIDLED ANNSLEY lacked a needed rally after settling into mid pack and giving chase from a two path position.
RECLAIMED rated back, gained experience, and passed tiring foes in the late strides. CORONA DEL MAR settled into mid pack, traveled widest of all at
upper stretch, and tired in final stages. SWEET RED ROSE lacked experience, failed to menace, and tired in late going.
