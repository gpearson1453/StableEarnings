Footnotes
WORKIN NINETOFIVE was void of early speed, circled the field, closed with a rush, got up late and won going away. AWESOME GALAXY was reluctant to
load, pressed the pace to the turn, assumeed command, inched clear, led to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. MISS REBEKAH was headed
on the turn, continued willingly to the wire, didn't have enough late and settled for show. BIG AL'S PRINCESS showed speed to the turn, fell back and
finished evenly. PARTY POLICE was reluctant to load, veered out at the start and was not a threat. Hand timed.

HOLY TUTTA BELLA was hustled along to set a pressured pace and held on gamely. FIRST PROMISE pressed the pace two across, challenged for the
lead on the turn, couldn't get by the winner and was outfinished in a game effort. TENGAS MASTERPIECE was never far back, offered a mild bid inside and
got up for show. AUTISM WARRIOR stalked the pace, lacked a stretch response and lost postion. IT BETTER BE GOLD was not a factor. MUSICAL GEM
was outrun. Hand timed.

DON'TTEASETHETIGER was unhurried early while never far off the pace, advanced on the turn, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. D
K'S CROWN stalked the pace, challenged on the lead on the turn, dueled for the lead, led late and was outfinished in a game effort. ALBANY FRONT raced
close to the pace towards the outside, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and settled for show. SUCCESS RATE stalked the pace while racing inside,
rallied leaving the turn to duel, weakened and fell back. AUTISM CAN DO got away alertly, led to the turn, responded when challenged to duel and came up
empty late. Hand timed.

finished well. WINDING was off a step slowly, rallied three wide on the turn, fell back and finished evenly. FIGHT ME had brief speed only. BIG WAVE

GIRL pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back on the turn, was carried wide, bid and hung. PALACE STAR pressed the pace while racing
four wide, was carried out entering the stretch, lacked a rally and held for show. SONGOFTHEDESERT raced mid pack outside, swung wide entering the
stretch and offered a mild bid only. MULLIGAN pressed the pace three wide between horses and gave way on the turn. MAYBEE A DIVA was not a factor.

Footnotes
THE PUBLIC HALO broke in the air to be off a bit slowly, advanced outside, went six wide on the first turn, assumed command on the second turn and drew
clear. GO FOR A RIDE stalked the pace, fell back on the second turn and closed well to get up for place. WESTFEST set a pressured pace to the second
turn, fell back, continued willingly to the wire, came up empty late and just lasted for show. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE stalked the pace, saved ground, shifted
out for the drive and was outnodded for third in a steady effort. REDACTION was in tight entering the first turn and raced mid pack in an even effort. CHEF
was in tight entering the first turn and failed to threaten in an even effort. RUN TAPPY was not a factor. HIGH FLYIN TIGER was rated back leaving the gate
and failed to contend. OSTINI was in tight entering the first turn, was through after a half and stopped. Hand timed.
