Footnotes
HAND PAY broke readily to secure a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter into the turn, continued in that path to the stretch and
produced a steady late response to wear down the pacesetter and edge forward under firm encouragement. ROSES BY LIAM tracked off the second flight
five wide through the backstretch into the turn, then continued widest into the lane, found his best stride nearing the sixteenth marker and narrowly prevailed
for the place honors on the wire. SCATAMARAN was hustled to the lead from between foes, then angling inside setting the pace on a clear margin into the
turn, held sway past midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. UNDERTOW tracked the leaders four wide between foes in the opening stages, angled
to the rail racing into the turn, continued with a steady bid inside foes through the closing stages to challenge for command late but was outkicked. WEST
ISLAND, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter as part of the second flight into upper stretch, faded in late stages. RED'S MR Z broke slowly, settled
along the inside early and never gained contention. IMAGINE DRAYGON came under pressure in early stages but soon dropped out. WARBURN broke
slowly and trailed the field to the stretch. KURT'S CHOICE angled to the inside just after the start, made brief pursuit of the leaders into the turn and gave
way into the lane.

Footnotes
SKYKAT was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, gained some position between foes just off the inside on the far turn, shifted out to the five path
leaving midstretch and produced a solid late response to prevail under firm encouragement. SILLY NOTION tracked just off the leaders along the inside
racing to the far turn, came around a tiring foe leaving midstretch to bid for command nearest the inside but was outkicked. KALLINIKI tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight, continued with a steady bid between foes to late stages but was outkicked. IF YOU WANT IT, reserved off the second flight
along the inside, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out entering the stretch and found some late stride to gain position in the three path late.
ELEMENTAL, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue nearing the far turn, edged clear into upper stretch but failed to sustain that
momentum. SHES GOT THE POWER settled along the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. CRIMINAL RECORD, urged inside rivals
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival into the far turn and gave way midstretch. MIZZANNA,
pulling against restraint racing three deep to the backstretch as part of the second flight, emptied out early.

Footnotes
BIRDIE MACHINE, forwardly placed three wide between foes while being urged to maintain striking distance racing into the turn, continued with a steady
effort to close the gap on the pacesetter leaving midstretch while being carried out by that foe late but prevailed in time under strong handling. TAPIT SAM
broke sharply, was urged setting the pace on a clear margin in the two path, then three path into upper stretch, drifted out markedly in the closing stages but
just failed to contain the winner. SWEET ANALYZER was rated off the leaders between foes through the backstretch, shifted out on the turn advancing on
the leaders in the four path into upper stretch, was floated wide in the closing stages but continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. SMART OXIE,
urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, flattened out in the drive. R VOO'S TABOO, off slowly, was bumped, then shuffled avoiding
tight quarters just after the start, was urged to brief contention between foes in second flight racing into the bend but faded into upper stretch.
SMOKEONTHEHORIZON was urged four wide in the opening stages pursuing the leaders to the turn but emptied out early. BURN BOSS broke inwards
bumping R VOO'S TABOO and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SOUPER FORTUNE angled to the rail racing to the first turn stalking off the first flight, steadily drew into striking distance entering the far turn while his rider
continued under patient handling awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, tipped out racing through the lane and responded to firm handling to narrowly
prevail between foes in time on the wire. CHICKEN TRUCK, in touch three deep attending the pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far
turn into the stretch but was just outkicked. DEVOTED TO YOU was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled
for command grudgingly into the lane maintaining a narrow advantage but couldn't contain the top pair to the wire. COASTAL WATERS was rated off the
second flight just off the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide racing through the lane and continued with a
mild bid. FEEDING FRENZY settled well off the leaders along the inside, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS switched out three deep racing to the backstretch tracking off the second flight but offered no rally. STAR OF STARS, pulling
between foes prompting the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. MR. COUGAR ducked out at the
start and trailed the field to the stretch. EDGIE REGGIE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, angled to the inside racing into the far
turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
SIR STERLING was urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch and continued
in a protracted skirmish to late stages to prevail under right handed pressure. TOTAL SURPRISE, urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset,
dueled for command inside the eventual winner into the stretch but was outkicked. PROTONIC AND GIN, off slowly, settled in the last flight, split foes racing
into the turn gathering momentum, angled inside foes racing into upper stretch and was making a steady gain on the top pair late while earning a share.
JOSE PATIO, caught in tight quarters at the start, altered course twice in early stages, then split foes three deep to gain terms with the first flight pressing
the issue into the turn but flattened out entering the lane. WYNN TRIP tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter, lost some
position to the leaders entering the turn, swung out entering upper stretch but had no late bid. FISHERMAN OSCAR broke readily, was urged four deep
prompting the pace to the turn, then gave way into upper stretch. JERSEY WANNA BEE threw his head at the start, then was steadied when losing his path
in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. MR INSENSITIVE was urged in brief pursuit between foes but emptied out early. BORDERLINEOUTALINE
proved no factor.

Footnotes
KRAMDEN was urged inside the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch, took over after a half, held sway on a clear margin into the lane and
held safe the late challenge of CASHANOVA under firm handling. The latter angled to the rail racing into the first turn dropping off the second flight, made a
steady advance gaining on the leaders racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place
honors while closing the gap on the winner. PALACE PRINCE tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground gaining
position on the far turn, shifted outside the winner racing into upper stretch while being roused to challenge but lacked the needed final kick. CAMPS BAY,
off slowly, settled last to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside racing into the far turn, then continued inside foes into the stretch, tipped out in the
lane and gained position between foes to the end. MR. WHO, urged four wide into the first turn pursuing the leaders to the backstretch, angled to the inside
racing through the far turn and faded in the drive. MISCHIEVOUS MO ducked out at the start, settled racing to the backstretch, made brief progress inside
foes racing into the far turn, switched out midway through the far turn and had no closing bid. UNBROKEN SONG switched out five wide racing through the
first turn and proved no threat. ROCKTIZWAY broke sharply, set the pace off the rail racing to the backstretch and gave out early. FAYETTE WARRIOR
made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide between foes to the backstretch but retreated early. GAINER tracked off the second flight between foes racing
to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the far turn. RIVER ROSE, caught four wide racing to the first turn, dropped out early.

Footnotes
MOONSHINE MOXY broke readily, tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight to the turn, readily advanced in that path racing into upper stretch,
took over leaving the furlong marker and edged clear under firm encouragement. IMPULSUS tracked the leaders five wide in second flight in the opening
stages, angled to the rail entering the turn, advanced inside foes to challenge for command inside the pacesetter in upper stretch but was outkicked.
HOUSE OF TARGARYEN tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing into the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch but had
no final kick. THAT WOULD BE NICE settled well outside foes racing through the backstretch, continued five wide through the turn to upper stretch but
made an effort to gain some position. FULL SPEED ASTERN settled outside foes racing to the turn and continued evenly four wide between foes into the
lane. CLARE CRESCENT, off a step behind the leaders, was hustled between foes to go clear racing into the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin to
the lane but faltered midstretch. ORTS DREAM was a brief factor four wide between foes but steadily faded into the turn. TEMPORARILY tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight and emptied out racing into the turn. I CAME TO SHAME, slow to gather stride, proved no threat. PRICELESS
MIRACLE tracked the leaders along the rail and retreated early.
