HOWGREATISNATE chased the early pace from the outside, continued an outside bid in the stretch and finished strongly to draw clear late under steady
handling. TAKE A HINT showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, was hard pressed through the far turn and wore down late to finish
second best. SWIFTY DEVIL pressed the early leader from the outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ESTILO CLASICO stalked the top pair
down the backstretch, raced three wide near the quarter pole and weakened through the drive. GUAPONESS settled off the early going, raced near the
inside around the far turn and lacked a bid.

SECRET ANGEL showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced well off the inside in the stretch run and edged clear late under strong handling.
Jockey of Lucky Charm claimed objection for interference deep against Secret Angel and stewards ruled no change. LUCKY FREEDOM settled off the early
pace, was ridden along from the inside near the three eighths pole, continued an inside bid near the quarter pole, angled to the outside to race well off the
inside in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. LADYNESS rated along in the early stages, raced from the outside around the far turn, took aim through
the upper stretch while racing well off the inside and flattened out the final eighth of a mile. BOARDWALK FRIES was off slowly, raced near the back of the
pack early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. TRUE QUEEN stalked the pace early on, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and tired the lane. APRILS LUCK pressed the early leader from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
SMARTHUMOR beautiful clean trip around the first turn, found nice outside stalking position into far turn, shifted out at the furlong marker, all out drive ,
grabbed the gold under the wire. MAYBE IT'S TIME found the leading roll around the first turn, coaxed his speed down the backside, came under a vigorous
hand ride far turn, felt the pressure mounting from the outside, fought on gamely through the wire. HENDERSON found the perfect inside stalking trip, raced
just off the pace along the inside, called up for best stuff nearing the furlong marker, stayed on well through the wire. MAGIC WIZARD raced well off the
early pace, reserved energy racing well back into far turn, swung five wide, stayed under a drive seven wide top of the stretch, raced on willingly through the
wire. THE REGION raced off the pace stalking the leaders into far turn, four wide pursuit around the turn, could not match strides with leaders, finished up
even through the wire. DON CICCIO raced off the early pace, rated off the pace and four wide down the backside, sent on his way four wide around far turn,
stayed middle lane through the stretch, even strides late. MASTERFUL ONE off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn, shifted inside nearing the
gap, under a steady drive, finished up even late. HIDDEN ROD mid pack around the first turn, steadied in traffic leaving the turn, was very keen to run on
down the backside, raced along the inside far turn, once again found traffic, finished up even late. LAW OF THE JUNGLE off the pace first turn, sent to the
attack far turn, weakened through the stretch. RAY OF LIGHT slow into stride, raced well off the pace, empty.

Footnotes
DIXIELAND DANCER was rated along from the inside, was asked nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced three wide near the quarter pole, was six deep into
the upper stretch and drew off to be well clear under steady handling. MOON ME AGAIN was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack early on, moved up
through the far turn, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out through the upper stretch to race from the outside and got up for the place position
late. MOON BIZ showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. RAPIDAMENTE checked at the break, stalked
the top trio, hard ridden through the far turn, challenged the leader through the upper stretch and flattened out. LA ALHAMBRA chased the early pace,
angled widest through the lane and lacked a bid. MISS IS ZIPPY stalked the pace, raced two to three wide around the far turn and failed to sustain a bid.
LUNA FORTUNA was coaxed along early and tired readily.

MISS DELICIOUS off the early pace, raced along the inside and off the pace down the backside, slipped through along the rail leaving the quarter pole,
angled outside the leader nearing the furlong marker, under a steady drive fought hard for the victory. CASHING BIG CHECKS leader around the first turn,
dogged down the backside, queued up under a nice hand ride nearing the quarter pole, quickly went clear, felt the pressure from the outside, dug in gamely
conceded late. STIR CRAZY very smooth trip around the first turn, beautiful strides down the backside, shifted out top of the stretch, good energy late.
SURREAL FANTASY tracked the leader around the first turn, found nice tracking position down the backside, called on for best run leaving the quarter pole,
weakened through the stretch. WICKED MERCURY nice stalking position around the first turn, very keen to run on down the backside, called on entering
the far turn, steadily faded through the stretch. COCONUT BEACH veered in at the start, lacked speed down the backside, outrun stretch.

Footnotes
BOUND BY DESTINY showed good early speed, raced just to the outside of foe down the backstretch, repelled the early bid of Laramore from the inside
and Chickienss near the five sixteenths pole, and dug in through the upper stretch to race well clear under a steady hand ride. CHICKIENESS chased the
early leader, challenged near the five sixteenths pole, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and was no match for the winner in the drive.
SKYLAR'S SISTER was rated early on, angled to race from the outside in the stretch and moved up to improve position. TAPPIN JOSIE chased the early
pace from the outside, raced four wide around the far turn, came in a bit near the three sixteenths pole, veered out near the eighth and sixteenth pole while
under left handed urging to race a bit erratic in the stretch and kept on the wire. LARAMORE vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened in the
drive. YOU'RE THE ONE chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, continued an inside run near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid.
COCKTAIL DREAMING dropped back early on, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. BOSS LIKE BETH settled off the early pace,
raced four wide around the far turn, angled widest through the lane and never threatened. SHELL BELLE broke awkwardly, raced along the inside around
the far turn and never threatened. TITOSCHANGEDMYLUCK was coaxed along early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
FEDERAL CASE raced along the inside while dueling early, always under a steady ride, headed after leaving the quarter pole, found an extra gear when
straitened up, under strong left hand ride went clear late. GET THE W between runners in the early duel, raced between till clearing under a drive at the
quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner through the stretch, desperately holding on for second. YABBA DABBA DUDE raced well off the early
duel, in no rush around the turn, was teed up nearing the quarter pole, shifted inside entering the lane, found good energy through the wire. FUTILE slow to
get under way, raced just off the rail into turn, shifted out five wide top of the stretch, under a long steady drive, finished up even late. PEPE AND
HEYWOOD dueled from the start, was on the outside dueling around the turn, pressed on leaving the quarter pole, weakened through the stretch.
