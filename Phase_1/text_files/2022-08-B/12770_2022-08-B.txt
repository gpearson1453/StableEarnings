Footnotes
SCENT OF SUCCESS sped to the lead at the start and saved ground around the first turn, set the uncontested pace through the backstretch and held firm
around the far turn, stayed sharp on the inside through the lane and held clear under steady pressure. SUMMER DAY saved ground around the first turn
and stalked the pace through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, ran on two wide through the lane and secured place.
CLICKBAIT was unhurried and raced in the back through early stages, saved ground then edged closer and headed in pursuit near the quarter pole, came
four wide into the lane, sustained a steady effort and prevailed for a share. BADGER KITTEN was allowed to settle through early stages, came under a ride
two wide around the far turn, ran on two wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. SKY HIGH SUSAN was forwardly placed soon after the start, tracked
the leader to the far turn, hustled along on the inside into the upper stretch then came up empty.

BIBLEMAN sped to the lead at the start and continued to show the way on the inside, dug in gamely under firm handling and held on. PERFECT FANNY
chased three to four wide in early stages, raced in striking distance in deep stretch, dug in late and just missed. CAN HE STORM hustled along in steady
pursuit, stayed on with response and edged closer to the wire. TIM'S BUDDY raced in range along the outside and inched up closer in final strides. TURN
THE SWITCH was a bit tight between foes in early stages, shifted to the inside, raced in contention then gave way. SAMURAI MIKE raced in the back and
failed to move into threatening range.

Footnotes
SCARYATCANTERBURY sped to the lead at the start and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, continued clear then drifted out three wide entering
the head of the lane, responded under right handed pressure, shifted in a path, turned back the bid from WILDCAT HAGRID in the final furlong and held
clear. STUN GUN was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued reserved up the backstretch, saved ground then tipped two wide entering the lane,
gathered momentum under steady pressure and finished strongly to the wire. WILDCAT HAGRID raced in early contention then edged closer along the rail
late on the turn, sustained a rail bid into the lane then ran on evenly late. LL'S CLASSY DUDE raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn,
