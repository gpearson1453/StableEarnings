TEEN DRAMA settled two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside in the stretch, closed willingly
and was up late to win going away. PRUDENT SONG dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, shook free in upper stretch, drifted out a bit at the
eighth pole, dug in gamely and was caught late. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn, rallied on the rail and finished
well. TAPIT'S GIRL dueled three wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, steadied behind PRUDENT SONG at the eighth pole and weakened. INSATIABLE
raced two wide off the pace, saved ground on the turn and closed belatedly inside. HAZARDOUS HUMOR raced three wide off the pace, came three wide
into the lane and finished evenly. TIZ HER WAY steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DAHGO dueled between rivals for the
lead, dropped back on the turn and gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of TAPIT'S GIRL against PRUDENT SONG was dismissed.
