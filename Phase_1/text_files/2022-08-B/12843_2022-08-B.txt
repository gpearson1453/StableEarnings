Footnotes
EMOTIONAL INTEL was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths marker and drew clear in the
drive. EVIL TEMPTATION was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside with IM COMING OVER, vied with that rival for a half, responded
when challenged by the winner approaching the stretch and gave way grudgingly through the final furlong. BERNICE WHO was void of early speed, saved
ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain late. WILEO PROCEED settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the
turn and finished with some late run. OUR ISLAND GIRL was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. IM COMING
OVER broke sharply to duel with EVIL TEMPTATION while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. MAMIE'S WARRIOR lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. JASMINE WHO raced four-wide through the turn and lagged throughout.
