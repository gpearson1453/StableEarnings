Footnotes
FOREVER JIMMY hustled away, led the field through the backstretch, drew away into the far turn, responded to looming threat near the quarter pole and
opened up through the stretch. RAVINA LANE rated off the pacesetter, moved up menacingly nearing the three sixteenth pole, but was no match for the
winner in the stretch, rallied late to secure place position. DOC COPE trailed early, shifted out to the four path bumping into LITTLE DIEGO repeatedly,
fanned three wide into the far turn, closed gradually for show. TRICKY SPEEDSTER tracked the pace inside, took closer order in the final turn, and came up
empty for the drive. LITTLE DIEGO settled outside, was bumped repeatedly leaving the backstretch, and lacked a bid.

pace in the three path, hustled five wide into the lane, rallied outside through the stretch and edged away. SKY DESTINY trailed outside, circled into the
lane, and closed gradually earning show. GO MAMA sat just off the pace outside, dueled outside of MI REYNA and weakened in the final sixteenth. MI
REYNA stalked the pace from the rail, dueled inside of GO MAMA and weakened in the later stages.

SHE LOVES WINNIN chased the pace, angled to the rail entering the lane, overtook the lead at the head of the stretch and won driving. SKYWARD
BOUND vied outside for the early lead, showed the way through the turn, was overtaken into the stretch and kept pressure on SHE LOVES WINNIN late,
finishing second best. KEEPMEINPOWER went three wide leaving the backstretch, closed inside and was unable to stall the top two finishers. WILD
RUNNIN MAGGIE dismounted rider in gate before the start, broke alertly but lacked the early speed needed, chased through stretch but was unable to
improve contending position. UBBADEETS failed to threaten. SAKKARY brushed leaving and was outrun.

Footnotes
STEVIE WONDER GIRL tracked the pacesetters inside leaving the opening turn, shifted outside in the backstretch, moved up willingly nearing the quarter
pole, swept the lead and kicked away under encouragement. SASSY BUT CLASSY reluctant to load, vied four wide into the opening turn, moved up to
contest the pace, was no match for the winner in the stretch and finished second best. FAVORITE trailed the field, experience traffic at the head of the lane,
closed steadily and was along with time for show. CUVEE TEE pressed the early pace leaving the opening turn in the three path, inherited the lead, and
flattened in the stretch. MISYA GIRL stalked from between foes, lodged a rail bid and was unable to improve position. IM A WHISKY GAL offered little.
SAVYSKYE vied inside for the early lead, was unable to keep pace and tired.

Footnotes
DREADNAUGHT rated well off the dueling pacesetters, went in pursuit of the leaders nearing the quarter pole, overtook the lead into the stretch and held
safely. FROBISHER BAY trailed behind the field, advanced quickly outside in the final turn, closed steadily and missed out. COMMON KNOWLEDGE
dueled inside of EVER TRUE from the outset then opened up to good margins on the rest of the field, weakened approaching the stretch then was
overtaken and held on for show. MAJESTIC CAFE saved ground early and made a late run along the rail. EVER TRUE dueled outside of COMMON
KNOWLEDGE, was unable to match strides after the quarter pole with rival and flattened out. WHISKEY BOUND saved to no avail. TANNIN saved ground
and was done early.

BRANDYN vied inside for the early lead, led the way through the final turn, rider peer under arm at the head of the stretch and was kept to task under a
confident hand ride. MISS VICKERS lacked early speed, gained closer order with a furlong and a half remaining, and finished willingly but was no match for
the winner. FAMILY IS GOLD chased from rail, shifted out to the three path at the head of the lane, drifted in at the three sixteenth pole, angled out and was
along late for show. PARK WEST vied outside of BRANDYN early, dueled into the lane inside of SUBLIME EUPHORIA, and finished on the wire the same
time with the fore mentioned. SUBLIME EUPHORIA broke sharply, chased four wide in the final turn, dueled outside of PARK WEST and finished in a dead
heat for fourth. SHESBOURBONONICE flashed some early speed and was outrun. ALBERTA hit gate leaving, and was unable to recover from the start.

Footnotes
MARYAM allowed to settle mid pack early, drove five wide into the lane, and going away. KISSABLE U tracked outside, rallied steadily then was collared
mid stretch and finished evenly. TEMPLE OF ZOOM pressed the pace from between foes, was unable to move on with rivals in the final turn, and held on
for show. BEAUTIFUL BABE chased outside, and lodged a late bid. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY chased on inside, and lacked a closing response.
BLACKBERRY LISA showed early speed outside, moved up alongside REDS LITTLE STAR nearing the quarter pole then gained a short lead, and yielded
in the final sixteenth. ENTITLED STAR offered little. REDS LITTLE STAR sent for speed inside, took pressure through the turn, and wilted abruptly into
stretch.
