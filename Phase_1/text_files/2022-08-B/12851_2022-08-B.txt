Footnotes
RUNAWAY READY was settled last while angling to the rail entering the first turn, commenced a steady advance along the inside nearing upper stretch and
continued with a sustained response to just edge WARRIOR BOSS in time under firm handling. The latter, reserved out of striking distance racing in the two
path to the backstretch, readily advanced on the leaders on the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch, bid for command in that path entering
the lane while being brushed by SILVER DASH to strike the front midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. SILVER DASH, urged to the lead along the
inside racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend, turned back a rival's challenge nearing upper stretch, shifted
out brushing WARRIOR BOSS while being roused to resist that rival nearing midstretch but emptied out once headed by the top pair. CANDY COVE broke
readily, was prompted to a forward placing, was urged to lodge a brief bid outside the pacesetter racing into the far turn but abruptly gave out nearing upper
stretch.

Footnotes
LIZZ A BEE, reserved last dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, tipped off the inside nearing the far turn gathering momentum, swung out four
wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to rally past the pacesetter in time under firm handling. KALLINIKI was urged to dictate
the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, widened the margin after a half, dueled for command leaving the far turn into upper stretch,
resisted a rival's challenge entering the lane to prove best of the others but couldn't contain the winner. SILLY NOTION tracked off the first flight along the
inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, bid for command in that path racing into the lane but
lacked the needed late kick. LADY PHYLLIS stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and
finished evenly late. IF YOU WANT IT tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way after a half.
MIZZANNA, forwardly placed just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes on the far turn but quickly came up
empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SUPERSTAR BEA was rated along the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted to close the
gap on that rival along the rail racing through the far turn, continued inside that foe entering the stretch while moving to challenge leaving midstretch and
prevailed in time under firm handling. TIZ WONDERFULLY broke readily, was urged clear to the backstretch racing a bit off the rail, held sway on a
commanding margin into the stretch but faltered late. NORA'S LEGACY tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch,
shifted to the three path racing into the lane and continued evenly. BIG ANDY tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted out four
wide racing into the lane but had no late bid. WILDWOOD MAGGIE settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never gained
contention. SUMMER LOVIN tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the backstretch and faded into the far turn. PER RULING FROM THE
MINNESOTA RACING COMMISSION, BIG ANDY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

MISTER MULDOON broke readily, stalked just off the leaders along the rail racing through the backstretch, came through inside the pacesetter to challenge
for command nearing upper stretch, edged clear in the stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. CHASE THE CHAOS off a bit slowly, tracked the
leaders along the inside early, tipped out entering the turn to gain position between foes, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch advancing to
striking position but couldn't gain terms with the winner while prevailing for the place honors. CROSS THE CAUSEWAY was rated outside foes tracking off
the first flight on the backstretch, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain position while being just outkicked for
second. PUBLIC OPINION, slow to gather stride, settled well off the leaders racing to the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch and continued with an
effort to improve position. ROLLERCOASTER MAN, urged three deep between foes prompting the pace to the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch.
KAMIKAZE BLUE was urged to the lead from the outset dictating the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail through the backstretch into the turn, then
gave out between rivals racing into upper stretch. RED CENTS, off a step slowly, was urged to terms with the leaders four wide prompting the pace to the
turn but gave way midway through the bend. WEST BAY, caught in close quarters between rivals in the opening stages, retreated early.

Footnotes
PASSTHECAT broke readily, was urged to the lead while angling inwards to set the pace just off the inside racing to the backstretch, dueled for command
between foes into the far turn, disputed the issue in a protracted skirmish outside a rival past midstretch but edged forward late under strong handling.
ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA angled to the rail in early stages stalking just inside the pacesetter to the backstretch, advanced inside that foe to press the issue
racing into the far turn, continued in a prolonged drive while shifting off the inside racing into the lane and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. PIRATE BIRD
settled along the rail tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain a share.
BOOTLEGGIN POSSE, pulling against light rating while gaining a forward placing three wide racing to the backstretch, moved to lodge a brief bid in that
path after a half but emptied out nearing upper stretch. BIG BOY MCCOY settled outside foes in the last flight to the backstretch, lost some ground to the
leaders racing to the far turn, angled to the rail racing through the stretch but made no real impression. TIGER HUNTER tracked off the second flight
between foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide midway through the backstretch while being prompted to gain some position but emptied out
abruptly entering the far turn.

Footnotes
DANZIG STAR, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, responded when called up to wrest the advantage racing into the
far turn, moved away to a commanding advantage and was kept to pressure. FOXGLOVE was rated between foes tracking off the first flight to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail narrowly for the place honors late. TANTIMA, off slowly, was
settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch, then continued willingly inside foes to gain
position to the end while being just outkicked for second. FAT AND FURIOUS tracked just off the leaders three wide racing to the backstretch, shifted
inwards after a half to track the pacesetter between foes into the far turn, then to upper stretch but faded leaving the furlong marker. BRUCE'S GIRL settled
along the inside while dropping out last racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn, swung four wide nearing upper stretch while
being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. HUNTER'S MAGIC angled to the inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight after a half,
was shuffled back behind a tiring foe leaving the midway point of the far turn and came up empty entering the lane. CUPIDS LOVE, urged to the lead along
the inside racing to the backstretch, couldn't match terms with the winner racing into the far turn and abruptly emptied out. PER RULING FROM THE
MINNESOTA RACING COMMISSION, DANZIG STAR WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
I CINC EYE LUV U tracked the pacesetter between foes as part of the second flight conceding position to that rival racing through the backstretch, was
prompted to make a steady advance racing through the turn to gain striking distance nearing midstretch, took over in late stages and went clear under firm
encouragement. BETTE'SGOTANOTION, bumped at the start while caught momentarily in close quarters, tracked off the second flight along the inside,
came around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch and found her best stride in the closing stages to gain position along the rail. TIMBER LADY tracked off the
second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, angled to the five path racing through the stretch and continued with some interest to prevail for a share.
EXODUS AND HOPE tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight racing into the bend but lacked a closing response. NOEL'S ANGEL sprinted clear
of the field soon after the start, opened a commanding margin racing to the turn, held sway into upper stretch but was completely spent and faltered leaving
midstretch. ALITTLEBITALEXIS tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight racing through the backstretch and gave way racing into the turn.
LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT stumbled badly at the start dislodging her rider, but walked off the course under her own power after being collected by her trainer
near the unsaddling area following the race. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO
ACTION.

Footnotes
CUPIDS CRUSH was urged clear outside foes in the opening stages, angled inwards setting the pace racing into the turn, widened the margin into upper
stretch, was kept to pressure past midstretch and finished on her own courage once the issue was decided. MIZ CALI was urged along the inside prompting
the pace in the opening furlong, switched outside the pacesetter racing into the turn while being urged in pursuit of that rival, lost ground to that foe racing
into the stretch but proved best of the others. PERFECT PRINCESS brushed the gate while breaking a bit slowly, angled to the inside racing into the turn
while being prompted to advance, shifted out entering the stretch and continued with interest to gain position between foes to the end while prevailing for a
share. MO SMOKING angled to the rail tracking the leaders from just off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid.
GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the bend, faded into upper
stretch. ICE N LEMON tracked off the leaders four wide racing to the turn and faded early. NELLY TOO broke slowly and failed to gain striking distance.
CHAPARRITA was held up in early stages while switching out five wide racing to the turn and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CANDY PRINCE, prominent three wide in the opening stages, forced the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, shook clear entering the stretch and
gamely held the challenge of FUTURE PERFECT to the wire under firm left handed encouragement. The latter, in touch with the leaders nearest the rail in
the opening sixteenth, was eased off those rivals to track along the inside racing into the turn, tipped out nearing upper stretch briefly awaiting an opening
between foes, then continued willingly to close the gap challenging the winner nearing the wire to just miss. XTREME MAYHEM broke slowly, tracked
outside foes off the second flight early, angled inside on the turn gathering momentum, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with
interest to edge a rival narrowly for a share on the wire. HOLDENTIGHT tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out three wide
racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. SAINT CHARLES, caught in tight quarters just after the start, switched out tracking off the second
flight racing three wide into the turn but offered no rally. OJITOS proved no factor. VALLEY VISTA was urged between foes, then along the inside disputing
the pace into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.
