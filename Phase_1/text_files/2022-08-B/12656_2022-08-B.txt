Footnotes
ASH FLAT chased the pace from the inside then bid three wide on the turn to make a gamely menace in the stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail.
ROCK N JUNE BUG lead the way early, then was challenged by an outer rival on the turn, continued to dig in gamely to take the lead again in early stretch
but was caught in the final furlong and was second best. BOCA BOY pressed the pace early, was moving up to duel from the two path on the turn, was used
up and tired in late stretch. GORMLEYS GOT GAME was unhurried early then made a mild bid along the rail in the stretch but it was not enough. ON YOUR
MARK raced behind the field while two wide then rallied four wide in the stretch but it was too little too late. BREAKING NEWS chased the pace while two
wide then came out five wide on the turn and failed to rally in the stretch.

AMAZINGNESS away last, raced six wide around the first turn, surged to get the lead going into the backstretch, led outside of a foe, went clear on the far
turn and held sway under mild urging. SKYS IMAGE led early in the three path, dueled inside of the winner but was no match in the drive. BOTOX KATIE
saved ground, angled four wide in the stretch but couldn't close late. CLEVER KATE stalked the pace between foes, before fading. TRIP CHARGE was
unrushed early, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole but then faltered. MAKE OVER stalked the pace between foes, then faded. SONG OF THE SIREN
raced in the two path and steaded while in tight going into the first turn, then saved ground. HOOSIER PREMIUM raced five wide around the first turn, bid
four wide at the five-eighths pole, then gave way.

Footnotes
LAMASCO was well placed while heading into the first turn, then was in a long drive on the backstretch while stalking, gained command on the second turn
and held on gamely down the stretch drive to prevail in the end. HIGH STICK saved ground while chasing the pace from the inside on the backstretch into
the second turn, then rallied in the upper stretch, angled in towards the rail and continued to close strong but could not catch the leader. JOYFUL
APPLAUSE broke in at the start and bumped rival then chased the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive entering the final quarter, menaced in the
stretch and closed well in the end. PARIS KENTUCKY broke out at the start and bumped rival, was unhurried early, then came out four wide on the second
turn and was closing willingly down the home stretch. MILAN'S GIRL raced in the middle of the field while two wide, was urging steadily on far turn to rally in
the upper stretch and closed well in the final furlongs. I'M BOX OFFICE tracked the pace while five wide on the backstretch then bid on the far turn to
menace in the late stretch between rivals but it was not enough. ORNAMENTAL settled along the inside on the backstretch, was moving up on the turn to
rally seven wide in the home stretch and was closing willingly but it was too little too late. AZAMANA EMPIRE was squeezed back at the start, then tracked
the pace from the inside in the middle of the pack, made a mild bid in the stretch but it was too little too late. MY SWEETNESS broke outwardly and bumped
rival, settled in the two path on the backstretch into the early stretch and never menaced. QUEEN IN THE NORTH chased the pace while two wide, was in a
hard drive on the second turn then flattened out in the stretch. MS MAGGIE set the pace along the inside into the backstretch then gave way on the second
turn and had no final bid. BEG BORROW N STEAL was bumped at the start and was unhurried early, came out three wide on the second turn and was no
factor.
