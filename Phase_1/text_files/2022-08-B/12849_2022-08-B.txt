RANDOM AFFAIR vied for the lead from the two path through the final turn then engaged the leader at the quarter pole and battled to the wire to be up in
final jump. A P'S BLUEGRASS was hustled to the lead from the inside and held that position through the final turn was challenged at the quarter pole and
fought gamely to the wire and lost the nod. LOOKING FOR BULL forwardly placed while saving ground through the final turn then angled out to the three
path in the stretch drive but was no match for the top two. WINGS UP was unhurried throughout but was not a threat. MAD AT MONEY raced near the back
from the two path but was never a factor.

DIVA'S DIVA was unhurried down the backstretch then made a two wide bid on the turn to move between horses to make a late run, took lead in the final
sixteenth and held on. ATOKA GIRL stalked the pace from the three path move out the four to five wide in upper stretch to make a late rally but it was not
enough. MOONFIELD was hustled to the lead to set the pace and folded in the final sixteenth. FIVE B C tracked the leaders from the three path but didn't
make a bid. LIL MISS DE BUY raced in the middle of the pace while saving ground and was not a serious factor. APRILINTHEPINES was placed off the
pace in the two path and weakened.
