Footnotes
EL NOBLE settled in stride entering the opening turn, sat in striking position through the backstretch in the four path, angled down to the rail and got up
driving. BIG AL'S VISION hurried away to secure a rail position, led the field through the backstretch, was under attack into the stretch, turned back
challenge from AWESOME SATURDAY, and was wore down late. AWESOME SATURDAY fanned four wide through the opening turn, drove five wide off
the final turn, came under encouragement moving up menacingly but was unable to improve position late stretch. LANNY MAC raced near the back of the
pack, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, responded to handling in the drive and finished well. SPORTSCARR tracked from the three path, lodged a
mild bid when urged along from the rail, and was edged out late. ROOKIE YEAR was under a snug hold into the opening turn from between foes, stalked
outside, hustled through the final turn, and failed to threaten in drive. MR. KALYPSO offered little. JUMEIRAH COAST showed little interest.

Footnotes
SHORTY THE SWEDE zipped to the front from the outset, saved ground while showing the way, was given cue at the three sixteenth marker and drew
clear under handling. FULL VELOCITY tracked inside under a snug hold, roused into the lane but was no match for the winner and turned back challenge
from DREAM COACH late stretch to prove second best. DREAM COACH chased the pace outside, rallied three wide into the drive and finished evenly.
BUCK WEST raced wide through the backstretch, came under urging but was unable to improve position in the stretch. H K MELODY saved ground and
lacked a bid. SNAP COUNT unhurried early and lacked a closing response. WYE CROSS reserved early, produced a mild bid and faded. MAKE'N TRACKS
trailed and passed tiring rival. ROLL THE STONE was outrun.

Footnotes
INFINITE PATIENCE sat in striking position in the four path, was under a strong hold leaving the backstretch then willingly overtook the lead, drew clear
when given the okay, rider peered under arm entering the stretch, was kept to task, easy ride to the wire in record time. PLUM BLUE allowed to settle early,
took closer order then encountered traffic at the head of the lane, drove between but was no match for the winner in the stretch and finished second best.
SOLARITY saved ground inside, angled out to the four path, was all in after leaving the three eighths pole, even strides late. MINE ME tracked the leaders
through the backside, and lacked the rally needed. SHELTERED BAY vied through the opening turn, set the pace with target on her back, was overtaken
near the three eighths marker and retreated. DANCE SHOES reserved off the early pacesetters, moved up closer leaving the backstretch while in the five
path, and had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
SAYGE'S SPIRIT allowed to settle off the early pacesetter, angled to the two path into the far turn, closed the gap steadily on the leader into the stretch, and
was along with time. SWIFT SWALLOW chased inside through the far turn, closed outside and finished up second with good energy. PERPETUAL BLISS
unhurried early, drove four wide in traffic at the three sixteenth pole, angled inside to rail and closed well late stretch. WITHIN REASON sprinted clear at
once, opened up through the far turn, held good margins through the lane, was showing signs of tiring under urging and yielded in the final sixteenth.
ZHAVIA chased wide through the backstretch, drove five wide off the final turn, and finished evenly. THIS TIME SWEETIE trailed the field, avoided fallen
horse and rider entering the stretch, and was unable to improve position in the drive. NO MORE RINGS tracked wide through the backstretch, and failed to
produce a bid. PEARLS AND CURLS chased throughout. ALOOF LADY raced in closest pursuit in the backstretch, wilted after passing the three sixteenth
pole the fell, did not finish the race and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch involving
ALOOF LADY but made no change to the order of finish.

Footnotes
HERE COMES BARNEY vied inside for the early lead, dropped back in the final turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, gained the advantage in the final
sixteenth, and prevailed. TAKE NO PRISONERS raced in close quarters coming onto the backside, stalked the pacesetters from the four wide, shifted out
off the final turn then rallied determinedly outside for place honors. CHARMING VINTAGE chased three wide, rallied inside into the stretch, and got by late
for show. FAST EH attended the pace outside, fanned three wide through the final turn, held the advantage into the stretch, and weakened inside. RAVINA
LANE lagged early, closed steadily late. CHESTER SLEW rallied belatedly. MUCHO MAGIC stumbled badly, chased pacesetters from the five path, fanned
three wide leaving the backstretch, and faded gradually inside. KENTUCKY LEGEND pressed the early pace under a strong hold, dueled in the final turn
inside of FAST EH, and yielded early stretch. OUTLAWED IN TEXAS offered little. REMARKABLE ELI chased wide early, and failed to menace. DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION, RACE TIMES PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
VIATURE chased inside through the backside, drove five wide at the head of the lane, was set down for a drive, rallied steadily outside and nipped the
leader at the wire. WEDGE POND prompted the pace from the rail, inherited the lead nearing the quarter pole, was under steady pressure through drive and
was nipped at the wire. WALKTHELINE saved ground mid pack, advanced quickly nearing the quarter pole, drove five wide and finished willingly to the wire.
SMART PLAY unhurried early, stalked the pace from the five path, posed a threat under urging around the three sixteenth pole, and weakened late.
THESHACK showed some interest late. ZICATELA sat in striking distance from the three path, and passed tiring rival late. SOLO RING set a pressured
pace, was unable to move on with rival after the quarter pole marker, and yielded. BANG ON tracked the dueling pacesetters, and lacked a serious bid.
PROVOCATIVE PRINCE was not a factor. EDDYSHAK never reached contention.

Footnotes
PULL THE PIN settled inside early, swung outside at the head of the lane then gained the lead and drew off. BRADYDABOSS chased inside, angled three
wide at the quarter pole, improved through the stretch but was no match for the winner and was along with time late for place. KEEP YOUR COOL stalked
the pacesetters from the four path, pressed the issue nearing the quarter pole, gained a short lead but was no match in the stretch for PULL THE PIN and
was run down late for place. GRADY'S SONG pressed the early pace outside of PUMP THE BRAKES, and raced evenly through stretch. FIRST BASE
unhurried early, and improved late in stretch. TINY TYCOON bid belatedly. HIGH KELLY SONG sat mid pack while five wide, and lodged a mild late bid.
PAULIE WALNUTS lacked serious bid. MARANGO chased the early pacesetters, lacked running room inside, and had nothing in reserve for drive. PUMP
THE BRAKES dueled for the early lead and retreated along the rail in the final furlong. IMPERIAL DASH never reached contention. CAPITAL CALL chased
outside and tired.

Footnotes
AT ATTENTION rated well off the pace, hustled nearing the quarter pole, tipped out to the five path, and rallied to get up late. CHASE THE SUN settled in
the five path leaving the backstretch, drove five wide off the final turn, rallied gamely into stretch gaining the advantage and was out finished.
UNCHARACTERISTIC sat at the back early, took closer order nearing the three sixteenth marker along the rail, experienced traffic then split rivals with a
sixteenth remaining and finished gamely in a multi-horse scramble to the wire. SOY TAPATIO bumped NORTHERN DREAMIN leaving the opening turn, sat
in striking range while four wide, drove between bumping into STONE CARVER, and missed out. DEPARTURE saved ground from the rail, shifted out to
the five path, and was out kicked. PARKING PERMIT trailed early, and rallied late stretch. GREEK GEEK lacked serious bid. NORTHERN DREAMIN
bumped entering the backside, moved up to sit just off the flank of pacesetter, rallied three wide entering the stretch, and gave way late. STONE CARVER
quickly went to the front to set the early pace while under a snug hold, took pressure leaving the backstretch, was overtaken then bumped at the eighth
marker and retreated.

GREAT ESCAPE contended the early pace passing grandstand, opted to sit in a striking position while three wide, moved up alongside RED KNOBS
nearing the quarter pole to challenge the front, then drew clear under drive to prevail. RED KNOBS contested the early pace from inside, led the field
through the backstretch with target on his back, responded to challenge from GREAT ESCAPE, proved no match for winner in the stretch and held for
place. REGAL RIOT raced four wide leaving the grandstand side, allowed to settle mid pack, fanned four wide off the final turn, closed late and missed out
for place. FLASHFORDANI unhurried early, dropped back through the backstretch, drove between rivals at the three sixteenth marker, improved through
the stretch and flattened in the later yards. COUNTRIFIED trailed early, roused three wide at the quarter pole, and passed tiring rivals.
SOARINGFORTHESUN broke inward into ABOVE AND BEYOND, raced three wide into the opening turn, gained closer order under handling but had
nothing left in reserve for the drive. PRAYFORPEACE circled into the lane, and faded through the stretch. ASYOUBELIEVE tracked the early pacesetters,
chased in the final turn, and tired. SEA SPLENDOR bumped leaving, saved ground inside, and was done early. ABOVE AND BEYOND broke outward
bumping into SEA SPLENDOR, raced four wide leaving the frontside and failed to threaten. CLANCY'S PISTOL was never a factor. ITSMYDAY saved
ground inside, brushed rail losing rider, did not finish and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch
run involving ITSMYDAY. After review there was no change made to the order of finish.

TONE IT UP trailed the field early, took closer order leaving the backstretch, continued to move up willingly nearing the quarter pole, angled the rail at the
top of the lane, rallied inside gaining a slim advantage and prevailed under a long drive. U DID IT sat just off the early pace under a snug hold, pressed the
pace outside of CHICA HERMOSA, overtook the lead nearing the quarter pole, was confronted at the head of the stretch by TONE IT UP, kept on outside
under urging and was wore down. LILBITSPICY unhurried early, took closer order nearing the final turn, was roused at the three sixteenth pole, rallied three
wide mid stretch and inched clear for show honors. BURROW DOWN tracked from the four path, chased the leaders in the final turn, rallied mid stretch and
was
edged
out
late.
CHICA

and chased to no avail. DIPLOMATICA was under a strong hold leaving the opening turn, and was done early. KEKE KIMONO raced wide through the
