Footnotes
PROVEN INNOCENT was rated on the inside while jumping well, came under strong urging around the final turn, moved out in pursuit of the runner-up into
upper stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and closed well to get up late and prevail. BANDUA was reserved while jumping well near the inside,
landed awkwardly over fence seven, shifted three wide while roused midway through the final turn, rallied to the lead into the stretch then kicked clear, led
under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth, was put to the crop while being headed late and missed while well clear for the place. WHO'S COUNTING
jumped well while showing the way, was urged along on the final turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show.
BALTIMORE KID (IRE) leapt inward over fence two, landed a bit awkwardly over fence three, raced the widest throughout and lacked the needed response.
PROJECT TWO (IRE) jumped well while tracking the pace on the outside, was urged along around the final turn and came up empty. ANCIENT TIMES was
reserved at the rear, struggled some over fence five and failed to respond. BRIGHT EYED EAGLE (IRE) was taken in hand while off heels after fence one,
saved ground while rated just off the pace, moved out leaving turn three, pressed outside from that point, struggled some over the final two jumps and
capitulated.

wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, tussled briefly with a pair of rivals before inching clear in the late stages kept to task.
YOGI coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route
into upper stretch and rallied up the rail into contention a furlong from home, ran on through to the finish to be along safe for the place honors. LAUGHTER
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths and came under pressure at that
station, spun three wide for home, dug in under threat from flanking challengers and was headed at the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages while clear
for the show honors. SUMMER SNOW chased two to three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. KUKARO got bumped at the start by I'M NERVOUS NOW, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the

coaxing from midway on the turn and weakened in the stretch. MADDIE'S SURPRISE chased inside briefly and then two to three wide, came under coaxing

CLOSETHEGAME SUGAR settled towards the rear of the field, tucked into the three path for the run around the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths,
came five wide into the stretch then shied out some, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted out under a left-handed crop while taking the lead coming to
the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under steady urging. WEBSLINGER was hustled from the start then urged while green near the back, came under restraint
while behind horses from the half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths, was asked outside the three-eighths, jostled with a foe midway through the turn then
checked, came off the inside shortly thereafter, swung six wide into upper stretch, gained while well out in the course in the final furlong and finished with
good energy to just get the place. OWN THE FIELD hit the gate while breaking towards the front then was hustled, chased the pace down the backstretch,
saved ground along the hedge on the turn, climbed greenly and paused some inside the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, gained in
the final furlong and finished with good courage to just miss the place while able to get the show. THREE ZERO hit the front of the stall doors and broke
open the gate prior to the start, came away quickly and went straight to the front then darted inward, showed the way with an uncontested advantage, raced
slightly off the inside around the turn, hugged the hedge while set down into upper stretch, led under a drive until inside the furlong marker then was
overtaken while weakening. NIEUWENDYK chased the pace on the outside, came out some leaving the backstretch, pursued the leader three then two
wide around the turn and lacked the needed kick. WICKED SECRET dropped to the rear without being asked then moved out, went three then four wide on
the turn, raced greenly near the five-sixteenths, came five wide into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead until just outside the sixteenth-pole and
lacked the needed response. ROCK CHALK broke out and bumped lightly with a foe then was forced in early, moved back out under urging then settled
between foes, was urged in the two path early on the turn, jostled with WEBSLINGER outside the five-sixteenths and also lacked the needed response.
IRON MAN JIMMY bumped lightly with a foe at the start then was taken up when THREE ZERO darted in front, moved up under urging on the outside,
chased three to four wide around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
SCOTISH STAR (ARG) tracked the spurting away leader along the inside leading the spread out main flight, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
assured first run at the front, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take over command with from NEVISIAN SUNRISE with a sixteenth to go
and edged clear to the finish to prevail. NEVISIAN SUNRISE lightly coaxed from the gate, ranged up in tandem with SCOTISH STAR just after the start and
took over command, had SCOTISH STAR back off into the first turn and spurted clear just off the inside through the remainder of the first turn and into the
backstretch, tucked along the inside and was given a notch to open up a further command five five furlongs from home and did so through swift splits, had
the field steadily take closer order and took the inside route into upper stretch, came under light coaxing near the eighth pole under growing threat, got
overhauled nearing the sixteenth pole and was along safe for the place honors. ZAINALARAB led briefly after the start before the aforementioned pair took
over and she was placed to a reserved hold, grew keen and pulled on the bit into the first turn before settling to track along the inside, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and stayed on one paced failing to quicken appreciably in the stretch. SECRET TIME (GER) just off
the inside tracking the front from afar, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and offered no response. BABY BLYTHE
two to three wide in pursuit, tucked inside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. EMILIA'S MOON saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went five wide at the head of the
stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
THE BIG GREY was bumped into the first turn, went four to five wide around that bend, dropped in early on the backstretch, was urged along well off the
pace, moved from the rail to the three path around the far turn, gained late on that bend, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to get the lead just
inside the eighth-pole, fought outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed in a prolonged drive. CONVERTIBLE FREEZE was last to
commence, moved out behind foes while placed under snug restraint, came out and bumped THE BIG GREY into the first turn, went three to four wide
around that bend, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path early on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, lost the lead
to the winner just inside the furlong marker, fought on to the wire but missed while well clear for the place. WILL E SUTTON was asked leaving the gate,
vied inside on the first turn, took the lead approaching the three-quarter pole, set the pace with company to his outside, passed the nine-sixteenths under
urging, was roused for more near the half-mile pole, lost the advantage early on the far turn, came under the crop inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back in
upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. DONTBELATE showed speed between foes into the first turn then dropped back, went two to three
wide around that bend, fell back early on the backstretch, lugged out under urging down that straightaway, went four wide around the far turn and was no
factor. SCOTTY angled in entering the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, lagged at the rear under urging, rounded the far turn in the two path
and showed little. ROAD TO SUCCESS stumbled at the start then was sent by the rider, led in the two path for most of the first turn then lost the advantage,
pressed the pace down the backstretch, was asked near the half-mile pole, vied between horses in the two path around the far turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SALS DREAM GIRL settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied
to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept busy to the finish. BOURBON DIVERSION broke in at the start bumping and
leaning on HONOR STAR, then got steadied just past the finish line the initial time as rivals crossed over from the outside, saved ground in pursuit from mid
pack patiently handled until let out angled five wide into upper stretch, then ran on to chase the winner home while prevailing in the battle for the place
honors. WINE GODDESS settled unhurried just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and angled out six wide
into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home tussling with the aforementioned foe to the finish, ultimately was bested for the place honors while safe
for the show. CERRETTA tracked just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered
up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. EAU CLAIRE tracked the pace along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home, weakened in the late going. HONOR STAR got bumped and leaned on at the start by EAU CLAIRE, then got forced to check off the heels of
a rival just under the wire the first time as rivals outside crossed to the inside, went just off the inside through the first turn and then three to four wide down
the backstretch, tucked back to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide for home and offered
no rally. SO ARE YOU saved ground near the rear of the field coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came
up empty. TREAT STREET showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded
the front nearing the eighth pole and tired. BERN ROSEY BERN forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SHESADANCINGQUEEN stumbled at the start, tracked the pace along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SEVEN SCENTS broke in and bumped with a foe, was forwardly placed on the outside, came under stronger encouragement in the three path on the turn,
pursued the winner under the crop into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging. NOT PHAR NOW was hustled to the
front then opened up a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, was asked at the three-sixteenths, responded well under a
strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop shortly thereafter, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole,
shortened stride while still clear into the final sixteenth and was overtaken while clear for the place. BALLYDOOLEY (GB) was hustled from the gate, raced
towards the front under some urging, chased against the hedge on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick
while just able to get the show. DURESS settled well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the three path, came six wide into the stretch and
improved position with late energy to just miss the show. SHIRAZ was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two
path, came six wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong and just missed the supefecta. SPIRIT ANIMAL was bumped at the start then taken up some,
spotted the front a few lengths, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. XY SPEED was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, raced between foes into the turn, went around that bend in
the two path, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
BANYAN BREEZE coaxed from the gate, showed the way early on in sole command four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
into the turn and dueled with DURKIN'S CALL to the outside through the bend coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in continuing the fracas through the length of the drive bumping lightly with his main danger a sixteenth out and gamely inched away late
on to prevail. DOUBLE SHOT broke out at the start bumping DURKIN'S CALL, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two
path through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was ultimately rebuffed at the
end. DURKIN'S CALL got bumped at the start by DOUBLE SHOT, who broke outwards, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch advancing to
engage in head to head combat with BANYAN BREEZE with nine-sixteenths to go, dueled three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, fought on under a drive head to head through the stretch but was outgamed. SOMEBODY coaxed
from the start, chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch and weakened. MANIFEST DESTINY coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn, went three to four wide for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BOPPY O established a forward position early, prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, took the lead early on the far turn, responded well when
asked nearing the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop under threat in upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead just inside the furlong
marker, switched back to the proper lead after being moved to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, disposed of ANDTHEWINNERIS into the final
sixteenth and just held the runner-up under strong handling. BATTLE OF NORMANDY bumped lightly with a rival at the start, settled on the inside, moved
off the rail outside the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe while kept in behind foes in upper stretch, chased the leader under a drive into the final furlong, raced
behind foes in pursuit into the final sixteenth, found clear space in front late and finished with good courage to just miss while clear for the place.
ANDTHEWINNERIS made light contact with a foe at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled while well positioned in third, ranged up two
then three wide on the far turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, battled outside of the winner until
near the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while able to get the show. DETERMINEDLY tucked into the two path for the run around the opening bend,
settled on the outside, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, brushed with a rival in upper stretch, chased outside
into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. NOBLE HUNTSMAN rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the back, saved ground
for most of the far turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, remained on his inside lead to outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and
failed to rally. OUR DREAM RYE'D bumped hard with a rival at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, went three then
four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. EL CONEJITO broke out and bumped hard with a foe, went to the front, set the pace on the inside with
company to his outside, lost the advantage early on the turn and stopped.

then got engaged in a duel while just off the inside with nine-sixteenths to go, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole,

station and ran on clear of the rest to be along second best. CUMBERLAND BLUES brushed the off side stall at the start, chased five to six paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the late
stages. DEVIL BOY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid a furlong
out, then flattened out in the late stages. BEACH BOY AL seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. CAPT' REMINGTON chased along the inside down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SOUTHERN
