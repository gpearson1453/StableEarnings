YARBOROUGH raced four wide early, then stalked close up two wide, bid on the far turn, rallied between rivals in midstretch, dug in gamely and prevailed
late. CHARGING LADY trailed the field, moved up two wide on the backside, advanced on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, finished
well and proved second best. TIZ KOBE TIME vied inside for the early lead, took over on the first turn to set the pace, showed the way on the far turn, dug
in gamely inside in the stretch drive and earned the show spot. GOLD WATCH raced off the pace with an inside trip, angled out in upper stretch and rallied
between rivals in the final sixteenth. EMMYLOU was a bit reluctant to load, raced close up early, tracked on the inside, waited for room while saving ground
on the far turn, lacked a clear path in the stretch run and finished evenly. GOLDEN BELIEF raced three wide early, stalked two wide, chased on the far turn
and weakened. VALEURETTE raced close up two wide in the early stages, then settled off the pace inside and failed to threaten. LAZARA steadied in the
early stages, moved up three wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and faded.

turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly late. AEQUOR was outrun early, advanced inside on the turn, came three wide into
the lane and rallied for third. RAISE THE RENT chased two wide early, chased on the turn and had no rally. CANT STOP THIS MAN raced off the pace
inside, chased two wide on the turn and lacked a rally while inside in the stretch. DOUBLE PLAY KING raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn and
tired. COMPOUND IT broke open the gate prior, chased close up three wide early, chased on the turn and faded. FROMANOTHAMUTHA raced off the
pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
SKILLFUL raced close up while three or four wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely outside of UMBRAGE
through the final furlong and prevailed after a long drive. UMBRAGE was bumped at the start, tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid at the half mile
marker, briefly took over on the turn, dueled with SKILLFUL turning for home, dug in gamely on the rail and battled to the finish. CANDY KINGDOM raced
off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and got third. BELLAMY DOLCE raced off the pace, moved up four or five
wide on the far turn, rallied and missed for third. SHIMMERING LIGHT bobbled at the break, stalked close up between rivals while three wide, chased on
the far turn and lacked a bid. JOHNNYPUMP raced four wide early, then five wide on the backside, bid four wide on the far turn and tired. AMERICAN
FORCES settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and had no rally. KITH was bumped at the start, set the pace, dueled two wide at the half mile
marker and faded.
