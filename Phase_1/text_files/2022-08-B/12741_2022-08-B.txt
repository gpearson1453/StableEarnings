Footnotes
LOGICO bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the three and
four path around the turn, gained ground outside in upper stretch and pulled clear. ZAP MOTION dueled on the inside through the opening half mile,
continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch, was caught with a furlong to go and chased the winner home.
FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and finished evenly. HIPPODROME
tracked the leaders on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. CONI'S COUP bumped with the horse to
his inside at the break, recovered to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded from there.
MANOLITO stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and tired in the lane. WASPIRANT trailed the field
on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was not a factor.

AFANDI tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, gained ground on the outside down the lane and just held.
BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path, raced in tight quarters near the eighth
pole and gained ground between horses to the wire. BEACH HOUSE dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued
to battle in upper stretch and gave way late. LADY NOY chased the front runners between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the
turn in the two path and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. CAPTAIN SAM dueled on the inside up the backstretch, battled while saving ground
around the turn and weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. PRINCESS CORA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated
the turn from the three path and came up empty in the stretch. NELLYSFORD raced off the pace on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around
the turn and made no bid. NANCYSAIDSO trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.
AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF HORSE SIX, BATH AND TENNIS, CITING INTERFERENCE FROM HORSE ONE, AFANDI, IN LATE

Footnotes
DATAMAN tracked two wide, tipped out to the five path into the lane, and rallied. THEOLOVESAWINNER set the pace from the two path, opened up into
the lane but yielded late. OTAGO stalked in the two path, swung into the four path at the top of the stretch, and held show. FURIOUSLY raced in midpack
inside, was roused from two wide rounding the far turn, but finished evenly. KITTEN AROUND was wellback inside, was cued from three wide into the lane,
but was one paced. JEBY rated two wide, was coaxed from the four path into the stretch, but flattened. BAYTOWN BEAVER trailed into the stretch and was
never a threat. BARAK prompted the pace inside but backed out rounding the far turn.

MERCI ROAD stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a four wide bid approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground steadily down
the lane to get up in the final strides. GLEAMING BRUTALITY dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, battled while saving ground
around the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch and was caught late. MADE MY WISH raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn
from the two and three path and gained ground in late stretch. BRINGTHEWINE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path
around the turn and improved position on the outside in the final furlong. SEA MONSTER stalked the leaders on the outside in the opening stages, came
around the turn in the three path and finished evenly. SHEZ FIRED UP brushed lightly with the horse to her inside at the break, recovered to chase the pace
setters on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the lane while racing in traffic late. BLUE BONNIE dueled for
the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn and faded in the final furlong. LITTLE MISS MINION trailed the field on the outside in the
early going, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there. QUEEN OF CLASS raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the two path, and was in traffic and forced to check several times the length of the stretch. TWO TIMES LUCKY brushed with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack for the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired
further in the lane.

Footnotes
CHECK THE GRADE tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two and three path around the turn, kicked clear in upper
stretch and drew off to the wire. LA DAME pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn,
could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, settled in
the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and gained ground in late stretch.
SUNNYMEDE DREAM chased the pace setters on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the lane.
MISS IS ZIPPY bumped with the horse to her outside and was forced to steady leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack in the opening stages, saved
ground around the turn and made a mild improvement of position in late stretch. OIL ON CANVAS raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path and was never a threat. SIMONELA raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the
turn in the four path and offered no bid. SHE'S CLASSY stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, was forced to
steady when PLATINUM FROLIC backed up into her near the eighth pole and flattened out from there. PLATINUM FROLIC led the way on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while saving ground around the turn, and faded in the final furlong, bumping with SHE'S CLASSY on her way
back. PALMGIRL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch. AN
OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF HORSE THREE, MISS IS ZIPPY, CITING INTERFERENCE FROM HORSE FIVE, MOON OF LOVE,
AND HORSE SIX, SUNNYMEDE DREAM, AT THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

path, swung out to the five path into the stretch, but was tired. FLASH IS BACK was wellback in the four path, was driven from the six path into the lane, but
was empty. ZALFIERRO pressed from inside but gave way into the lane. MONEY SONG raced in midpack from two wide, steadied midturn, and was no
threat. BUSHIDO'S WAY was in midfield while five wide but was no menace. BUSHIDO'S WAY WAS VANNED OFF. THERE WAS A CLAIM OF FOUL

Footnotes
VAN DUSEN (GB) led the way while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, kicked clear in
upper stretch and drew off to the wire. B G LEE raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from
the two path around the far turn and chased the winner to the wire. BUNKER HILL saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside in late
stretch. CURLIN'S MALIBU brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced at the back of pack on the outside through the opening half mile,
continued around the far turn in the two path, switched to the inside in upper stretch and improved position in the final furlong. DIABLO DADDY brushed with
the horse to his outside at the break, recovered to chase the leader from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid coming
around the second bend and weakened in the final furlong. KEN LOVES KITTEN hit the gate leaving it, raced off the pace on the outside in the early going,
angled in to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. LUNAR MISSION raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in
the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the second turn still in the three path and was empty from there. COMMANDER BIZ
saved ground while racing in tight quarters around the first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, continued to save ground around the far
turn and made no bid. LONG STORY was away from the gate slowly, hustled up to track the leaders while saving ground through the opening fractions,
continued to race inside around the far turn and tired in the stretch. HORNBEAM raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
and around the far turn in the middle of the pack on the outside and faded in the stretch. ITS MR POPPI TO U raced in the three path around the first turn,
trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the second bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CAUSE FOR PARDON raced off the pace on the inside for the first lap, moved up to the middle of the pack from there, kicked clear entering the stretch and
drew off to the wire. WELSHMAN raced in the middle of the pack in tight quarters early, continued around the oval on the inside, could not go with the
winner in the lane and chased that rival home. MR. BRIDGER led the field on the inside through the opening mile and half, gave way entering the lane and
finished evenly. SEB'S WELCOME (FR) trailed the field nearby the first time around the oval, raced outside from there and kept on to the wire. PEAT MOSS
(IRE) dueled between horses in the opening stages, continued to battle outside headed into the second lap and was outkicked in the stretch.
PLEASECALLMEBACK pressed the pace on the outside through the opening mile, continued in the middle of the pack through the following lap and
weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
OUR BAB (IRE) tracked inside, bid three wide rounding the far turn, opened up into the lane, and held gamely. CAINUDOTHETWIST raced in midpack two
wide, was ridden from the three path into the lane, and kept on. MAGICAL CHARM prompted the pace from the two path, led along the inside around the far
turn, but finished evenly. EVE'S CITY chased inside, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, bbut flattened. EPONINE trailed in the two path, moved
up from the inside around the far turn but was never a threat. BELLA COOLA set a loose lead from the four path but yielded into the far turn. NEW
APPOINTMENT (IRE) stalked from the three path but was empty into the stretch.
