Footnotes
JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the leader while commencing her bid
two wide entering the final turn and quickly assumed command, held a clear lead into the stretch and was all out to hold on while drifting out in deep stretch
while under right handed urging. JACOBS CALL stalked the leader in the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide
entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss while getting bumped in the final strides. EYE BE SEEING YOU broke
outwards and trailed the field into the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering
the final turn, shifted five wide leaving the turn and closed with a rush to just miss. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER broke sharply and stalked the leader into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly from between rivals in the lane, before steadying
sharply when put in tight quarters nearing the wire. VALUE MAX away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two wide from between
rivals, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR rushed up from along the rail
to gain the lead entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken soon after entering the final turn, and faded late.
Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into an incident approaching the wire. After review there was no change to the original
order of finish. The three quarter split for this race was currently unavailable

Footnotes
VON DOM away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the stretch the first time and in the run
down the backside, maintained his advantage through the final turn and held off an oncoming DEBATABLE late to prevail. DEBATABLE unhurried early
while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, was content to bide his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, launched his three
wide bid entering the final turn, and finished full of run six wide in the lane to get up for the place. KNOPFLER away well and stalked the leader through the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in
the drive to garner a share. PADDY D'ORO stalked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied along the rail entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called on late while finishing three wide in the drive. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN tracked the leader
through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue two wide from the outside of VON DOM in the run through the final turn,
but faded in the stretch drive. TIMELESS SHRUG broke sharply and tracked the leader one out from the rail through the lane the first time while under snug
restraint, began to drop back approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong. Following the running of the race there was a jockey's
claim of foul. The rider of PADDY D'ORO lodged a claim of foul against the rider of DEBATABLE for alleged interference in the stretch. After review the
claim of foul was disallowed and no change was made to the original order of finish.

PORTER GENT tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, tipped three wide entering the backstretch to force
the issue in the run to the final turn, assumed command soon after entering the turn, and drew clear over the final furlong while under confident handling
while proving much the best. SYNERGY broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide through the stretch the first time, eased into a tracking trip in the run
to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and fought on gamely two wide in the drive to get up for the place. FORT LANGLEY stalked the leaders
through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in
the drive to garner a share. STAY FANTASTIC away alertly and dropped into a stalking trip from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dropped
back to trail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BOLD

Footnotes
PAGODA RIDGE away well and vied for the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened over the final furlong. BEST ONE YET away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of
PAGODA RIDGE through the stretch the first time, eased into a tracking trip one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the
final turn, and held off HARBOUR STORM in deep stretch to hold the place. HARBOUR STORM broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail through the final turn, and closed three
wide in the drive to just miss the place. CATTITUDE stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. PERFECT PENNY missed the break, and hopped slightly leaving the gate, trailed
the field into the first turn and in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to mount
a serious late impact. BLING IT ON HOME stalked the leader into the backstretch from between rivals, began to back up approaching the final turn, and had
nothing to offer over the final furlong.

command leaving the turn and quickly drew clear while being kept to task late. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his
bid from the back of the pack while saving ground entering the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides.

LAUGH WITH ME away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied from just off the rail entering the final
turn, and closed with a rush three wide in deep stretch to get up in the final stride. BLUEGRASS ANGUS broke sharply and pressed the pace from the
outside of KHAIKY'S COMMAND entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, began to get the better of his pace rival in deep stretch, but was unable to fend off the late surge of LAUGH WITH ME in the final
strides. KHAIKY'S COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the
run down the backside and through the final turn, continued to battle for the lead through the lane, and just failed to last. SANAWAR settled off the
contested early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and finished evenly two out
from the rail in the drive. BODEGA unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down
the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. RING OF
KERRY tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the
final furlong. TIZ MEOW stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. The three quarter split for this race was currently unavailable.

EH TEE EM tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, shifted three wide for
the drive and wore down KEEPINGTHEDREAM in the final strides to prevail. KEEPINGTHEDREAM was pinched between rivals soon after the start and
took up slightly, settled off the early leaders entering the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, advanced smartly three wide midway down the
backside, rallied two out from the rail through the final turn, assumed command entering the stretch and just failed to last. CAROLINA GENT away well and
dueled for the lead from the outside of JUST FREDDY entering the first turn, took control midway down the backstretch, was overtaken leaving the final turn,
and finished from along the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. EASTERS MEMORY settled off the early leaders while saving ground at the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, but was unable to make a serious late impact while finishing four wide in the drive.
SOLANDER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest two wide in
the drive. CASSIDY COWBOY away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BECKAS BOY settled well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch,
dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and was only able to pass a tiring rival in a dull effort. JUST FREDDY broke sharply and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, eased off his pace rival while drifting a bit midway down the backstretch, and weakened over the final furlong.
