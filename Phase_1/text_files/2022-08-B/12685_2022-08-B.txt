Footnotes
TOUCH OF ROUGE settled outside trailing in the early stages, began to rally through the turn angling out for clear run in the six path in upper stretch and
finished strongest of all taking over with a sixteenth to go drawing away in the end. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH broke a bit slow, advanced up the rail through the
backside, angled five wide outside off tiring runners with a quarter to go, momentarily had head her in front just inside the eighth pole but could not hold off
the winner outside late. CAPTIVATING ART took the lead soon after the start, was on top through the turn between runners, opened up briefly turning for
home, was collared at the eighth pole and weakened late still holding onto third money at the wire. I AM I SAID broke sharp to lead, rated back through the
backstretch, ridden hard to keep up in the turn while being fanned seven wide entering the stretch and was one paced through to the finish. SHISHKA
chased the pace inside early, was in tight losing ground to runners through the turn on the fence and showed some late interest to pick up the pieces
through the lane to get a minor share. BABY DRIVER rated at the back behind runners, was roused behind rivals turning for home and could not offer a
stretch finish. FORMENTOR pressed the pace outside, briefly had her head in front at the quarter pole, began to weaken nearing the furlong marker and
retreated. ELITE PRINCESS rated mid pack in the second flight outside down the backside, offered a mild rally to contend turning for home and backed
away between foes with an eighth to run.

MORE THAN A DANCE bumped a rival lightly at the start, quickly moved clear to dictate terms racing near inside, drew away when asked then was eased
up late. FREE SHIPPING shifted in heading to the first turn going two wide into that bend and moving out a path switching outside a foe, was encouraged
along a bit up the backstretch, continued two to three wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner but second best. SOLIS moved forward outside
three to four wide on the first turn to pursue the leader, was given some encouragement past the half, lacked the needed late kick. CROONER was bumped
into a rival at the start and took up just slightly, settled toward the rear inside till the top of the stretch, came out four wide and ran on mildly. SPANISH
PRINCE tracked the pace from inside up close, was encouraged along into the far turn, lacked the needed late response. SNOOKERED settled at the rear
three to four wide, advanced outside foes into the far turn while moving out from four to six wide on that bend, faltered and faded in the stretch. STRAIGHT
EHS chased the pace just briefly then steadily retreated. AGILE DANCER was bumped at the start, lost the rider, caught by the outrider up the backstretch
and walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

MY REDEMPTION broke inwards at the start, rated inside mid pack into the first turn, closed the gap travelling up the the fence through the backstretch on
the dueling pacesetters, angled off the battling frontrunners turning for home and wore down his rivals in deep stretch to get up at the wire. ASCOT BAY
hounded the early speed from the start, hooked up with the frontrunner with three quarters to go and never left his side, dueled through the far turn for the
outright lead, drifted out under the drive in mid stretch and just missed running between rivals at the finish. BROKE AN BROKEN contested for the lead
inside from the start, was hounded by an outside rival down the backside, was headed and battled on the rail through the far turn and fought on stubbornly
on the fence down to the wire giving away very late. SOCIAL JUSTICE settled outside near the rear with a half to go, advanced six wide around horses
through the far turn and showed some late energy outside foes through the lane to get up for a small share. IVICTORY saved ground throughout, rated near
the back in the early stages and could not reach contention. TIMMINS made a brief run around runners going four wide on the far turn to contended turning
for home, stalled in mid stretch and ran evenly to the wire. SON OF MY FATHER sat just behind the contesting pacesetters down the backstretch, roused to
go after the leaders entering the far turn, offered no response and weakened between rivals in upper stretch. SOCIETY EXPRESS rated behind the early
pace just outside, was asked between horses through the turn in mid pack and showed little run to the wire. DR CHROME trailed from the onset and was
never involved.

Footnotes
COPINSAY moved forward and shifted in entering the first turn, rated in behind the leaders up the backstretch inside, angled four wide past the quarter pole.
SAME AGAIN DOC was hard to load but got away well and stalked just off the pacesetter two to three wide, edged closer on the far turn, asked for more
past the quarter pole, struck the lead outside the three-sixteenths, was engaged by an outside foe soon after, dueled with that one but was outfinished.
DAWSON SILVER broke outwardly then settled toward the rear inside, switched out heading up the backstretch, went four then six wide on the far turn, ran
on to get up for show honors. COUSIN BOB was caught three to four wide in the early going, switched outside a foe late up the backstretch, advanced five
wide on the far turn then evened out and needed more. BAYTOWN ELVIS set the pace inside, weakened once headed in upper stretch. JMR PURE
SENSATION raced off the inside in the two to three path early just off the leaders, was between runners into the second turn and asked for a bit more, came
into upper stretch three wide, needed more. PERFECT PLAY was a step slow and forced out at the break, settled toward the rear two wide, moved out and
advanced a little bit outside foes four wide on the far turn, could not rally for the drive. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL shifted in two wide racing off the pace, failed
to rally when asked. QUIET REBEL caught four wide on the first turn, advanced heading up the backstretch, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
FEELTHEBEAT waited behind the contesting frontrunners just outside through the turn,, angled outside to the four path to cruise to the lead at the top of the
lane and when roused under left handed urging responded well to keep the inside runner at bay in deep stretch. DIAMOND CITY tracked the frontrunners
on the fence around the turn, opted for the rail for the drive turning for home, drifted inwards in upper stretch to brush the rail a quarter out, was kept to the
task by the rider inside with a furlong to go but could not offer a strong finish inside brushing the fence again nearing the wire. AIM FOR THE SKY was away
quickly to lead, headed outside on the turn four furlongs out, battled for a quarter repelling the early challenge only to be collared on either side with an
eighth to go and gave way to be an unchallenged third. JIMMIES BIG DAY rated near the rear in the early stages, angled out in the five path for the run
turning for home and offered a mild stretch run to finish up on the fringes. VICTORIOUS WAVE was hustled to engage the leader at the half mile pole,
battled outside for a quarter to go and faltered in upper stretch then fading between runners. HIDDEN HONOR was off a bit slow to trail after the start, could
not get involved around the turn and passed a tiring runner in the stretch.

Footnotes
CALLE OCHO took command after the break, was well rationed on the front end setting soft fractions while unchallenged through the first half, was set
down for the drive in upper stretch and had saved enough to hold off a closing in rival in the late stages. SPEIGHTSTOWN SHIRL waited inside patiently
throughout the turn, was ridden with a quarter out to go after the loose frontrunner, angled just off the fence through the lane and was gaining steadily the
final sixteenth to make the finish close in the end. INTO TOURING rated mid pack outside of runners through the turn, rallied outside in the four path at the
top of the lane but could not quicken with the top two finishers and finished up well to be a non threatening third. QUINTE ROAD bobbled soon after leaving
the gate to trail, was behind runners around the turn and ran on up the fence in late stretch to play a small role at the finish. NO MORE DIAMONDS tracked
the leader in the first quarter, attempted to engage the frontrunner through the turn, was quickly repelled in upper stretch and faltered through the field
between horses in the run down the lane.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM DANGER was forwardly-positioned with mild coaxing to set the early pace from between runners, was headed on the turn, retook the lead by the
furlong marker and edged clear willingly. PAPA DOBLES pressed from inside, took a narrow lead by the five-sixteenths, was overtaken in mid-stretch and
no match for the winner. LIONESQUE was ridden along a bit in the early going, went two wide on the turn, came out a bit in the stretch and kept on late.
EXECUTIVE GIANT brushed a rival at the start, switched outside foes stalking just off the leading trio four wide, loomed a threat coming to the top of the
stretch but evened out. MISTER M V P tracked inside, ran on evenly. CHOCOLATE RUN exchanged a brush at the start and light bumps early, asked for
run by the quarter pole moving out from five to seven wide leaving the turn, failed to threaten. BREACH OF TRUST exchanged repeated light bumps at the
start and early, went four to five wide on the turn coming six wide into upper stretch, failed to make a bid. ULTIMATE ANSWER brushed with the inside rival
at the start, was urged forward to press from outside moving in three wide, weakened. FREE CAT had repeated bumps early, failed to menace.
