GAMBLING GIRL hustled from the gate, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn advancing to latch on the
leader with five-sixteenths to go, swung two to three wide for home taking over command, edged clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages.
THE SPLENDID ONE showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front and took the inside route into
upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong while safe for the place honors. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS coaxed from the start, raced six to seven paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then five paths off the rail through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into
upper stretch and weakened. SWEET BLUSH broke a half a beat slow, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking briefly inside
half a mile from home, came under coaxing tipped to the two path with seven-sixteenths to run and continued in the two path into upper stretch, then passed
tired rivals. IN GOOD TROUBLE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled three to four wide into upper
stretch and tired. MADDIE'S GRACE coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered just
off the inside into upper stretch and folded. AUGUST BLOOM veered out at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BUILT TO LAST went to the front, showed the way while well off the inside, was coaxed around the turn in the three path, shook off TOMMY GUN in the
four path into the stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging.
KINGSTOWN broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused nearing the five-sixteenths, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner to the wire and safely secured the place. TOMMY GUN stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe,
was hustled then chased the pace, made a bid in the four path midway through the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and tired while clear for the
show. FULL COMPLEMENT chased the pace on the outside then in the five path around the turn, dropped back six wide into the stretch, fell further back
while on his inside lead to the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, drifted in while tired near the sixteenth-pole and capitulated. MAGIC TRUCK
was slowest into stride, dropped well behind the rest of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path and trailed. BUILT TO LAST WAS DISQUALIFIED
AND UNPLACED IN THE ORDER OF FINISH DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

CATHEDRAL BEACH stumbled at the start, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a late surge to get up in the final jumps and prevail. NEVER
EARLY bobbled at the start, showed the way in hand four paths off the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths under threat, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was caught in the final
strides to the wire. BRAWNDO three wide in pursuit, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and kept on to preserve the show honors. ZEN MASTER coaxed from the start, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three
wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and kicked on belatedly through the stretch. SILIPO had the outside
door reverberate inwards and made contact with it getting away a bit awkward at the break, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung five wide for home and tired. COLE SPUR coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under a ride from midway on the turn and faltered. THE

Footnotes
RODERICK went three wide around the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three then four path around the turn,
was asked while taking the lead at the quarter-pole, shook clear under the crop into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. FORTY TWO
ACE bumped with a rival shortly after the start, went to the front in the two path on the opening bend, showed the way while inside of a foe, vied in the two
then three path while still inside that foe on the far turn, was asked while being headed at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong,
kept on to the wire but was outfinished while clear for the place. CORKMAN was hustled from the gate then shifted inward, shifted to the two path around
the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, dropped back under urging in the two then three path around the final turn, came
under the crop outside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. GOOD CULTURE was bumped on both sides at the start
then dropped back, went four wide on the initial bend, dropped in entering the backstretch, settled at the rear, was urged along while saving ground on the
far turn, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. AIR SHOW was bumped on both sides at the start then squeezed back in
tight between horses, went three wide on the first turn, settled while last but one, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and failed to respond. AL'S PRINCE broke out and bumped with a foe, saved ground on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch then
settled on the outside, was roused near the half-mile pole, dropped back four then five wide around the far turn and retreated.

UNDER OATH got bumped at the start by HIS TIME, who broke inwards, and was knocked briefly askew before coming under coaxing, showed the way
lightly coaxed along and clear in front while three wide, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, drew away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in held
well to prevail. OVERBORE chased just off the inside patiently handled until set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, had the rider lose the
handle on the crop to the right side just outside the eighth pole, ran on willingly to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. RISK
PROFILE hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide coaxed along in closest pursuit of the leader, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. HIS TIME broke in at the start bumping UNDER OATH in the hindquarters and knocking that rival askew, chased along the inside from the tail of
the field coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. BASSO coaxed from the start,

Footnotes
THE PRINCE'S SPUR was hustled from the gate, went four wide around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked inside the half-mile
pole, engaged the leader in the three path on the far turn, gained the advantage outside the five-sixteenths, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away
under a brisk hand-ride to prove much the best. GUT FEELING bobbled slightly at the start but broke with the field then was hustled, was rated just off the
pace in the two to three path, came under urging inside the three-eighths, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while
well clear for the place. FREEZE POP came inward after passing the temporary rail leaving the gate, saved ground while keen under restraint around the
first turn, moved out while still a bit keen early on the backstretch then was rated off the pace, came under urging at the seven-sixteenths, chased three then
four wide around the far turn, moved to five wide outside the quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch and came up empty while just able to get the show.
SECRET CARGO went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked with a half-mile to run, chased four wide around the far turn, remained
on his inside lead to outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and tired. MAD MAGIC rounded the first turn in the two path, lagged at the
rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DRAKON went to the front in the three path on
the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was urged along in the two path early on the far turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths then
dropped to the rail and faltered. PROVEN HOPE broke in and bumped with a foe, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside while near the back,
was urged five wide on the far turn and was no factor. ISLANDMAN was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, settled on the inside, dropped back leaving
the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MOUNT TRAVERS bobbled slightly at the break and came under coaxing to vie two to three wide between foes down the backstretch, briefly dueled into
the turn with MUSICAL AMERICA when LASTCHANCEATGLORY briefly got shaken off, had that rival advance once more and vied briefly midway on the
turn before emerging now with that rival shaking off MUSICAL AMERICA before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch confronted for command, dug
in head to head and was displaced a furlong out, fought on to take back command inside that station engaged gamely in head to head combat to the finish
and prevailed on the wire. LASTCHANCEATGLORY coaxed from the start, vied four then three wide outside a pair before briefly backing off into the turn,
advanced three wide through the turn to vie for the front from the midway point, swung four wide into upper stretch now head to head with the
aforementioned foe to his inside, dug in under a drive seizing brief and narrow command a furlong from home, got headed inside that station while under a
drive fighting on to the finish but was outgamed in the late stages. BOLDISH chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong from home, then flattened out in the late stages while safe for the
show honors. CRYPTO CASH chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages.
LIL COMMISSIONER chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, tired. MUSICAL AMERICA
hustled from the gate, vied inside a pair from the get go coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off inside the five-sixteenths and took the
inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

the advantage at the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the runner-up at the eighth-pole, dueled inside that foe in

the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, took a short lead at the eighth-pole, dueled outside of the winner in the final furlong, was headed
in the final sixteenth and denied while well clear for the place. TIDE OF THE SEA came away in good order then went to the front, moved clear nearing the
first turn, showed the way in the two to three path, was headed at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened but was best of the
