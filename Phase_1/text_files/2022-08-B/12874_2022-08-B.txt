Footnotes
CRAVENS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter
pole and kicked clear in the final furlong. BULLITT MCQUEEN pressed the pace between horses early, chased the leader while saving ground around the
turn and kept on in the lane. ENERGY EFFICIENT hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around
the turn and improved position mildly in the stretch. SENTIR ZULIANO dueled on the outside up the backstretch, was held in place by his rider while trying
to run out on the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and flattened from there. DISCREET DEVIL led the field on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to show the way from the two path around the turn and tired from there. FUNNY UNCLE raced off the pace in the opening stages, navigated the
turn from the two path and offered no bid. BUBBA CHROME stumbled leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
was pulled to the outside to race wide coming off the turn and was eased to the wire and walked off.

SHE'S PEACHY KEEN chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the
final furlong while drifting out mildly. JOYA DEL SUR led the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while saving ground around the
turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. TRUE ATKA pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, raced in the
two path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. TOSS A COIN raced at the back of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and
never threatened. IN MY OPINION raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid.
MOONBOOTS was reluctant to load, raced at the back of pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn four wide and was empty from there.

Footnotes
FILIGREE tracked in the three path, was cued from two wide into the lane, and drew clear. DRUM AND DRUMMER stalked from inside, was coaxed while
saving ground into the stretch, and ran on between foes for place. RUN LEA RUN raced in midpack from the two path, tipped out to the four path for the
stretch, and kept on to show. GREAT ASSUMPTIONS led in the two path, opened up slightly at the top of the lane, but yielded late. GOLD GUY chased in
the two path, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but finished evenly. TAPIT TO THE WIRE was wellback in the two path, saved ground into the
lane, but was one paced. MONEY SONG was bumped by an inner foe, rated in the five path, was ridden from the eight path into the lane, and gained late.
HEATED BATTLE was unhurried from the four path and was no menace. THE WILD FLYER was bothered at the start by an inner foe, trailed from the five
path and was never a threat. EXCELLENT MARK was hustled along from the four path but was tired entering the lane. ZALFIERRO broke out to bump and
bother two outer foes, was in midfield while three wide but was empty.

Footnotes
SAMUI SUNSET saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail approaching the quarter
pole and kicked clear late. PRAIRIE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, jostled mildly with THE QUEENS JULES while saving ground around the first turn, led
the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend, was caught in midstretch and kept on to the wire. THE
QUEENS JULES bumped lightly with PRARIE coming around the first turn, chased that rival on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from
the two path coming around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. PETIT FILS (FR) was squeezed back leaving the gate, saved ground at the back of
the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to race inside around the far turn and improved position mildly in the stretch. STRONG
HEADED raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the
three path and flattened out in the final furlong. COLONIST trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around
the far turn still in the two path and faded from there. BELLARMINE HALL raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the
pace between horses, dropped back while racing in the two path around the second bend and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
VOCALIZE chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, kicked
clear in midstretch and drifted out in the final furlong, brushing with BY THE SEY SHORE just before the wire. BY THE SEY SHORE raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside early, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, gained ground on the outside, was bumped by VOCALIZE in late
stretch and kept on from there. TRUE JEDI tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and in upper
stretch, was caught near the eighth pole and kept on to the finish. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving
ground around the turn and weakened in late stretch. SMALL FIELD raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, angled in to save
ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. MYSTIC O'SHAUNESIE raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two path and offered no bid. GOLD HERITAGE trailed the field on the inside in the early going, raced in the two path around the
turn and never fired. ELUSIVE AGENT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was
empty in the stretch. AN INQUIRY AS WELL AS A RIDERS OBJECTION WAS FILED CONCERNING HORSE ONE, VOCALIZE AND HORSE FOUR, BY

BOURBON GYPSY led from the two path, opened up at the top of the stretch, and held on gamely. BACHELORETTE stalked two wide, was driven from the
three path into the lane, and ran on but hung late. JACKIE'S LOVE chased in the four path, ranged up rounding the far turn, and kept on to show. C J 'S
CAT FIVE prompted the pace in the two path, was ridden along into the lane but gave way late. AMARETTO SOUR was unhurried between foes, shifted out
to the six path in upper stretch, but finished evenly. WHEREDIDYOUGO tracked inside, was roused saving ground into the stretch, but was one paced.
BESSIE BLUE stuttered at the start, was wellback in the two path and never threatened. WAY LUCKY was wellback and two wide but was no menace.
SEARCH broke a step slow, trailed into the stretch and was empty. IMPERIAL JET chased from three wide but was done early.

Footnotes
LUDICROUS MODE chased the leader between horses through the opening mile, began a bid coming around the far turn and pulled clear in the lane.
SEISMIC WAVE raced off the pace early, steadied while avoiding jump six and gained ground in the stretch. LA HARA (IRE) trailed the field through the
opening lap, began a bid coming up the backstretch for the second time, took over to lead around the final turn and weakened in the last furlong. PULL
RANK chased the frontrunner from the middle of the pack the first time around and was outkicked in the final quarter of a mile. TWENTYONEGUNS led the
field through the opening mile, raced inside from there and tired in the stretch. KID MACHO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside throughout and
was empty in the stretch. FOG BOUND lost his rider on the first fence and walked off after racing with the field throughout. THE FIELD SKIPPED JUMP 6
TO AVOID A FALLEN RIDER.
