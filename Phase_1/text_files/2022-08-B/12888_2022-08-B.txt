Footnotes
OUT FOR FUN four wide first turn, three wide backstretch and far turn just up. WOLFIE'S PRINCESS saved ground to far turn, angled off rail into stretch
out, no room in the stretch while going for an opening that closed but ran on in the late stages and just missed. OPHA MAY pressed leader to far turn,
weakened in the stretch run for third. CONCORDSDIFFERENCE saved ground on the lead to deep stretch, weakened late stages. JUST ZOEY never a real
menace dropping far back in the stretch run.
