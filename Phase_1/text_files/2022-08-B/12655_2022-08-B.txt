mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. PRINCIPALITY settled off the pace inside, gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path and ran evenly through the lane. LUFTY'S KISSES settled back in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response.

THE IRON BANK settled back off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead in the three path midway on the far turn, drew clear inside
the eighth pole and was kept sharp through the lane. ENVISION SUCCESS saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, contested at
a close disadvantage at the rail on the turn but dropped back leaving the eighth pole and had to settle for second best. CITIZEN'S FIRE raced well back
saving early ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and came along for third inside the eighth pole. TIZ AUCTION TIME
settled off the rail early then eased out leaving the half mile pole, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths, raced close in the three path of the far turn
but weakened in the lane. FRATHOUSE MUSIC stalked off the rail early on then raced at even terms leaving the three quarter pole, drew clear past the half
pole, came under pressure at the three eighths but was caught nearing the quarter pole and gave way on the far turn. SURE WOULD FOREST stalked the

Footnotes
MY CANDY BIZ became a bit edgy pre-break then took over and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over the game effort of SOUTHERN SAVIOUR, who
saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dueled; a game stretch factor. GAMING JACK settled off the pace
about the three path, eased out into the backstretch and started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn and ran evenly
in the lane. FINAL SAY saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened stride. FIND
YOUR BOAZ rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in four and five paths
of the far turn and passed rivals widest. SOMERSET BAY stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole, continued close three
wide on the far turn but weakened leaving the eighth pole. UNNAMED SOLDIER rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. COOL YOUR BOOTS rounded the first turn about the three eighths pole and was through after three eighths.

CHANGE THE WORLD stalked off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested at a slim disadvantage in the three path of the far turn, but
dug in leaving the turn and took the nod later yards. YOLO CHARLOTTE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole,
contested the edge off the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was met in later yards and reluctantly ceded. HESSICA
stalked the early pace from the three path, started a four wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and came along
for third mid-stretch. LONG LEGS LOUISE saved ground well back on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and
showed little in the lane. TIZ A COUNTRY GIRL saved ground just off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at a close disadvantage
from that point, but dropped back at the rail nearing the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. EX RATED saved ground.

through the stretch. THELADYISTRUE chased inside, eased outward on the turn, left the turn in the five path and dug in to take second later yards. ONE
SMART COOKIE chased, rounded the turn two deep, dug in under steady stretch handling and just lasted for third. HOT CAROL chased outside, rounded
the turn about the six path, finished evenly and just missed third. U S FUNDS gave close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path
and weakened in the lane. GOT YOUR NUMBER pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back off the rail past the quarter pole and
weakened leaving the eighth pole. BLACK PANDA exchanged contact with HANNAHS RED RUBY leaving the gate and gave chase inside, raced near the
rail on the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole, while the latter exchanged contact with Black Panda then saved ground.

turn four wide and dueled through the stretch for second while outfinished for the win. SOME IS NINE bore out into the first turn and raced outside leaving
the turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at a close disadvantage in the five path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
WATERLOO ROSE saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the seven path and
passed rivals widest. SARAH BELLUM saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and
passed rivals in the lane. MISS WILD rounded the first turn five wide, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, though
weakened leaving the eighth pole. MONGOLIAN MISSION stalked from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded
