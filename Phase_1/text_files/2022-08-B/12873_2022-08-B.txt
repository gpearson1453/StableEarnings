MISS GIVING opened up early, never pressured, held well. DOT DASH DOT, back early, advanced off rail, rallied outside to be just up for the place.
NOTABLE NORA tracked winner outside, couldn't gain, made a place bid through the stretch, missed. NO SURPRISE, well placed inside, place bid to
sixteenth pole, tired. JUST FOR CHARLOTTE stalked wide, finished evenly. STORM KITTEN, between horses early, dropped back turn, passed a tired
rival. I'M SHINING LADY, well placed off rail to turn, dropped back, faded.
