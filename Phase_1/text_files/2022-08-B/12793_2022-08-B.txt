Footnotes
MOBIL MEISTER chased the pace for a little over five furlongs, inherited the lead, drifted out under left handed urging through deep stretch and drew off.
QUEEN HIGH unhurried early, closed ground through the far turn outside rivals, swung out to the eighth path, drew close outside the winner but was no
match. BOSSY LADY saved ground into the stretch, shifted out to the four path while moving closer, dropped inside the winner as that one began to drift out
then leveled off. LUCKY PENNY ROSE was no threat. CLIFTONS BALLERINA sped tot he lead soon after the start, set a rapid pace into the far turn,
stopped and was eased to the wire. THE RIDER OF QUEEN HIGH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

SCORZA stalked the pace along the rail through the turn, got through to make the lead, battled with the runner up until deep stretch and proved best under
strong handling. DYNAMITE CLOUD pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, dug in when challenged by the winner but finished second
best despite a game effort. BLUE MONARCH found his best stride late in the six path. OHIO STRONG close up between horses, went evenly. WILDCAT
EXPRESS away alertly, set a pressured pace into the turn, had speed until mid stretch then weakened. CRYPTO COPY with the second flight three wide,
failed to respond. RUMBLE STRIP RON failed to menace. GENERAL WINSTON was fractious in the gate, bobbled at the start and was outrun. GIV'EM
THE BIZ had brief speed, stopped and was eased to the wire.

WINE ME UP BABY dueled for the lead three then two wide down the backstretch, shook clear on the turn then widened the balance of the trip under brisk
handling to win as much the best. AUNT BEE trailed into the turn, circled rivals and finished second best in the three path. TALKBACK allowed to settle,
improved position late two wide. PACIFIC COAST had speed from the stretch, moved up on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. BLACK BUTTE failed to
menace. GOLDEN NOLE flashed speed, stopped and was eased to the wire. ROSES FOR ASHLEY away alertly, battled for the early lead along the inside,
had speed for a half, stopped and was eased to the wire.
