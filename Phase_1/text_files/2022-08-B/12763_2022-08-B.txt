Footnotes
TAPPIN ROYALTY moved on pace backing off to the far turn re engaging near the quarter pole shaking clear in upper stretch angling in mid stretch then
back out nearing the wire holding on. BRIAR JUMPER prompted the pace through the backside moving between horses near the quarter pole ceding a
clear lead to rival in upper stretch losing the outside position late as the leader angled moving to the two path being held at bay late. EL SOLITARIO slow
early raced evenly to upper stretch finding late response to close the gap in the three and four paths. SKIDSTREAM pressed the pace dueling on the inside
of one rival to the far turn then a pair of foes near the quarter pole ceding near the rail in upper stretch finishing evenly. FAIT ACCOMPLI tracked the pace
staying close through the far turn weakening near mid track in upper stretch. VINCITORE slow early was never involved. MUTASHABEH showed little.
ERIC THE SALESMAN raced evenly for a half then gave way into the far turn. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF BRIAR JUMPER
AGAINST THE RIDER OF TAPPIN ROYALTY FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

AMERICAN DOLLAR advanced to engage on the backside pressing through the far turn wresting the lead in the four path upper stretch drawing off late as
much the best. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS advanced to contention on the backside chasing through the far turn extending in the two path down the lane
coming on for place. BIKO tracked the pace pressing three deep on the far turn ceding in upper stretch finishing evenly near mid track. MISTER RANSOM
gained on the backside pressing to put a head in front on the far turn dueling into upper stretch weakening late near the rail. WOW LINE set a pressured
pace through the backside giving way on the far turn easing to the wire. E MOLINARI was hustled along pressing through the backside then would fold
abruptly near the seven sixteenths pole easing to the finish.
