Footnotes
LIGHTFOOT MISS slow to get into stride, reserved energy down the backside, queued up for action midway around the far turn, five wide at the top of the
stretch, split rivals late with a tenacious close, up under the shadow of the wire. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL found the rail position around the first turn, rated back
off the leader down the back stretch, remained along the inside into the stretch, under a long steady drive, surged last furlong, valiant effort conceded last
jump. SHE'S GOT GAME tracked off the early leader, raced in the three path off the pace down the backside, came under a vigorous ride leaving the three
eighths pole, reached even terms with the leader, could not hold late surging rivals. BON FIRE DIVA solo leader around the first turn, easy tempo down the
backside, went clear far turn, came under heavy pressure deep stretch, faded very late. PARTY MONSTER four wide first turn, sent into action under a
steady ride down the backside, even strides through the wire. NOTION INTERRUPTUS lacked speed away from the gate, raced off the pace into far turn,
not a threat late.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED SASS took the lead soon after the start, edged away from the field before entering far yurn, was never seriously threatened while running
evenly the rest of the way . GRACEFUL ROSE chased the pacesetter, tried to move up, but could not gain ground on pacesetter and was second best in
the race. I GOTTA BOLT raced on the rail, then drifted outside down backstretch run. Angled back to rail going into the turn. Drifted outside during the
stretch drive after a couple left handed taps from the whip. TRES MARIA'S DREAM moved to the inside soon after the start. Saved ground and dropped
back slightly on the far turn. Started to show renewed energy after turning for home and gained ground slightly. LINAHASPECSHOES did not look
comfortable when racing in between horses down the backstretch. Angled outside in the stretch and ran evenly. ABBY'S LUCKY GIRL was wide throughout
and never seriously threatened.

Footnotes
LIONESSOFBRITTANY pressed the early leader from the outside, raced two to three deep into the upper stretch, shifted out late to race well off the inside
and held gamely to remain clear under strong handling. MUNDLE OF JOY stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced along the inside around the far
turn, angled out to race from the outside and finished willingly to the wire. CRYSTALOLOGY was coaxed along soon after the start, raced five into the upper
stretch and kept on to the wire. MAESTRIA showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened the final furlong while racing from the inside.
COMBAT QUEEN was hustled along early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. CATCHING THE WIND was void of
early speed, raced near the inside around the far turn into the lane and lacked a bid. MY SISTER CLURRIE dropped back early, raced four wide through the
upper stretch and never was a factor.

improve position. CUPID'S PRINCESS was unhurried early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch run and made a good
late gain. FACTUM LOVE STYLE dropped back early, made an advance through the far turn raced six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough.
