TEMPUS unhurried early, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up in the final strides.
INCITATUS well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, shook clear
inside the furlong marker and was outfinished. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, steadied and was blocked, then angled out and closed for the show. SNOW JOB led in the early going, vied outside the leader to the stretch,
then weakened late and held a share. LET PEACE PREVAIL set the pace inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened the final
furlong. CAKE AND EAT IT TO was never involved.

Footnotes
SAILOR'S SALUTE rated back in the early going, angled out while moving up through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain, shook clear and held. KEYPIT rated tracking the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was
no match for the winner and held the place. LACEE mid pack, moved to position on the two path through the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch,
then lacked the needed late kick. DOUBLE DOT allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and
edged up for a share. YO YO MON unhurried early, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled out and evened out.
TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, shook clear from rivals through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.
EMPEROR'S SONG pulled to contention in the early going, stalked the leader to the second turn and faded. HOXIE was never involved.

CASCADE PARK well placed, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain, split foes late and
edged ahead. VILLAGE QUEEN well placed, moved up to stalked the pace, gained a short lead from between rivals through the second turn, then was no
match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. BARBARA sprinted away from the field in the early going, stayed on when challenged through the
second turn, then weakened late and held the show. STARSHIP BELMONT five wide through the first turn, moved up down the backstretch, gained position
three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and weakened the final furlong. BABY DRAGON improved her position, inside. CRACKIN MISCHIEF
showed little. NOT ORBINARY broke slowly from the gate, lost contact with the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
CEDUNA well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then shook clear, drifted out and held.
STARSHIP EMPIRE allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and closed well for the place.
INCLUSIVE mid pack, moved to position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. AULT well placed, moved
to position three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. GAGE HAS A GRAY well placed and off the rail,
gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. HONOR COLLECTION angled in hitting
the rail in the early going, steadied, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside and and improved position. COUNTY COURT passed tiring
rivals. ATLANTIC SUN (GB) set the pace inside, shook clear down the backstretch, then faded into the stretch. ZERO GRAVITY was no factor. CLAW
stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the second turn.
