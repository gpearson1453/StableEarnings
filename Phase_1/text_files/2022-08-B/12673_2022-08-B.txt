BAM BAM CAM broke on top, was settled just off the pace from outside, took over when let out two wide on the bend, was roused leaving the turn, moved
clear inside the last furlong and held sway under steady handling. CITY POSITION pressed from inside, angled out for room on the bend, came three wide
into the lane, gained second inside the final eighth then could only hold his position late. STUMP chased behind rivals, was three then four wide taking the
bend, rallied belatedly and gained third in the waning yards. IT'S BELLAMY TIME displayed early speed between horses, gained the rail into the turn, was
overtaken and gradually yielded for the drive. GONEGHOST raced in contention from outside, was widest taking the bend and failed to have a significant
stretch bid.

HOLD THE SPENDING settled toward the outside, picked up her pace four wide on the bend, responded to hand urging in the lane and took over inside the
final sixteenth under a well-judged ride. COOKIN ROSES shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead and took the rail into the turn, floated out some
entering the lane, lengthened command but was no match for HOLD THE SPENDING deep stretch. QUIET DRAMA raced in contention just off the inside,
was three wide on the turn, moved to the rail into the stretch, gained third inside the last furlong, could not close the gap on the top pair but proved easily
best of the rest. FOGGY KITTEN displayed early speed inside COOKIN ROSES, angled outside that one on the bend and began to flatten out upper
stretch. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN void of speed, though hustled along from inside, angled out some on the turn and failed to have a stretch rally. SMACK
chased from between horses, had the rail through the bend and no late bid. MEETMEINSTLOUIE failed to menace in a wide trip.

Footnotes
MIND YOUR OWN BIZ soon had the lead, was challenged from outside on the bend, drifted out upper stretch, battled between rivals and edged ahead in
time. R H SMOAKEM prominent between rivals, went for the lead three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, dueled gamely from outside
but did not have enough left in the waning yards. SIRCORRI well placed just off the inside, fanned out behind MIND YOUR OWN BIZ entering the lane,
altered inside that one upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick but moved ahead for the show. PACHI in contention early from outside, advanced three
wide on the bend, altered in looking for a clear path upper stretch, had to alter out again inside the last eighth and rallied belatedly between rivals. TALE OF
THE NILE pressed MIND YOUR OWN BIZ from just outside, vied for the lead on the turn, floated out some for the drive and gradually wore down between
horses deep stretch. GONZO raced in the second flight from inside, retreated into the bend, continued to save ground and only made up minor ground in the
stretch. EL ASESINO stumbled at the break, was an early factor from inside the gave way on the turn.

SHEZZ KOLDAZICE a step slow at the break, was sent to get the lead from inside before reaching the first bend, showed the way in hand, was let out on
the second turn then steadily drew away under a drive in the lane. DRAGONFLY KISSES pressed SHEZZ KOLDAZICE from just outside, did not keep up
after a half mile, saved ground taking the second turn, made her bid in the stretch, took over second with a sixteenth left then could only hold her position
late. MARIA'S GIFT hesitated at the start, raced in contention from outside, failed to keep up widest through the second bend, showed a willingness to run in
the lane and caught SHE TAKES FLIGHT for third in the waning yards. SHE TAKES FLIGHT forwardly placed outside DRAGONFLY KISSES, made her bid
after a half mile, progressed two wide on the second turn, floated out some entering the stretch, was no match for SHEZZ KOLDAZICE and began to wear
down between rivals the final furlong. EMILY LANE well placed from inside, gave way with three furlongs left, distanced herself from the rest in the stretch
and was walked off.

Footnotes
TURBINADO pressed from between rivals, gained a slight advantage two wide on the turn, battled in the lane under mostly hand urging and began to draw
off inside the final sixteenth. JACK VAN BERG shared the lead two wide, moved ahead after a quarter mile, was overtaken from outside on the bend, all out
in the stretch and gradually wore down inside the last furlong. LONESOME DREAM forwardly placed toward the outside, moved clear for third three wide on
the turn, began to drift out approaching the eighth pole, held a straight path the last sixteenth and was clearly best of the others. LAKE MILLS raced in
contention between rivals, improved position two wide on the turn then leveled off. YOU'RE IN COREY broke on top but was soon chasing from outside,
faded four wide on the bend, gradually angled out as LONESOME DREAM came out in the lane and had no late bid. THE LAST OPTION made a small leap
from the gate, bumped with ART HEIST, was two wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. ART HEIST hesitated then bumped with THE LAST
OPTION at the start, angled out through the turn and had little to offer for the drive. TODDLES displayed early speed from inside but gave way before
finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
SYMBOLIST was sent to gain the early lead, kept in hand when challenged from outside on the backstretch, roused leaving the quarter pole, moved clear
upper stretch, began to wear down in the late going but kept COMFORT ME NOW at bay under steady handling. COMFORT ME NOW engaged
SYMBOLIST on the backstretch, was also asked for more leaving the second turn, did not relent when the latter pulled ahead upper stretch, closed the gap
in the waning yards but was too late. WILD FOX well placed from inside, angled out three wide on the second bend, threatened with two furlongs to go but
drifted out upper stretch and continued to gradually float out deep stretch. IMPERIAL MOMENT progressed from inside on the backstretch, closed the gap
some on the second turn and improved position in the lane without threatening. MEMORY BANK only passed outside tired ones the last furlong.
FRONTANA chased from outside, was two wide taking the second turn and had no stretch bid. RENEGADE BOB raced in contention three or four wide for
six furlongs then gave way. PISTOL BOX showed little in a ground-saving trip.

SAY CHEESE rated on the front end just outside HONEY MUG, was asked leaving the bend, moved clear under urging upper stretch and maintained
control while kept to task to the waning yards. TRIPLE SCOUT raced in the second flight between horses, was three wide on the turn, floated out some
entering the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressure just inside the last furlong, gained second soon after, held a straight path the final sixteenth but
could not close the gap on SAY CHEEZE late. MARYS LAST SONG fractious in the gate, raced in contention toward the outside on the backstretch,
progressed three wide on the turn, lacked a significant stretch response but caught HONEY MUG for third. HONEY MUG contested the pace inside rivals for
four furlongs, began to yield in the lane and was drifting out deep stretch. PALAGO was prominent between horses for nearly three furlongs then yielded.
BAILESTON LASSIE raced in contention from outside but gave way four wide on the bend. SEAWARD raced in the second flight from inside but began to
fade nearing the end of three furlongs.
