WILDWOODS DREAM broke slowly, advanced from outside, to gain the lead three wide nearing the end of four furlongs, drew clear in the lane and held
sway under steady handling. SEMINOLE BEACH shuffled back leaving the chute, lost ground widest through the turn then lugged in and drifted back out the
last wighth. READTHETRANSCRIPT lugged in some starting a chain reaction of bumping leaving the chute, pressed the early pace from outside, vied for
the lead two wide on the bend, could not stay with WILDWOODS DREAM leaving the turn and flattened out from inside the last furlong. SHANGHAI SILVER
reluctant to load, broke on top, was forced inward leaving the chute, prompted the pace between rivals, did not keep up after a quarter mile and gradually
yielded from path three the final two furlongs. FUTURE VISION was sent to dispute the pace from inside, was checked at the half mile marker when his path
narrowed, altered out some and steadily faded the rest of the way. RODEO MAN overcame being squeezed briefly between horses leaving the chute to set
a pressured pace between horses, gradually angled in after two furlongs and began to yield along the rail before finishing a half mile.

PALACE KITTEN hesitated at the break, moved up inside to gain the lead midway on the backstretch, was challenged on the bend but gradually drew clear
under a drive in the lane. MY LITTLE TIPSY vied for the lead from outside, took the advantage two wide on the turn, floated out some at the top of the lane,
could not stay with PALACE KITTEN but proved clearly second best. THAT KHENNY in contention early, angled to the outside with four furlongs to go, took
over third three wide on the bend, was no match for the top pair but pulled away for the show the last eighth. VIOLENZA D'ORO raced widest and only
passed a couple tired rivals in the stretch. STORMIN EL PRADO pressed the pace from between horses on the backstretch but began to yield two wide on
the bend. CAN MAN DO broke on top but was soon shuffled back, moved to the inside and steadily faded.

Footnotes
FOOT RUB LOVE rated from outside, was let out three wide on the bend, asked leaving the quarter pole, moved clear inside the last furlong, floated out
some with a sixteenth left, kept a straight path in the late going and held on. ALMAFUERTE prominent toward the outside, did not keep up three wide on the
turn, lost ground fanning widest into the lane, drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path the final furlong, was all out but too late. MY MORNING GAL
reluctant to load, was a step slow at the break, raced in contention from inside, was two wide taking the turn and found best stride too late deep stretch.
DUSTY MILLER hesitated at the break, chased from off the rail, picked up her pace from path three on the bend, came into the lane behind FOOT RUB
LOVE, moved outside that one near the eighth pole and showed a willingness to run the final furlong. HELEN MAE'S SONG vied for the lead from inside,
did not keep on the turn, was boxed in upper stretch, steadied behind the fading PLAY TWENTY inside the last eighth then altered out near the sixteenth
pole. PLAY TWENTY shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead two wide on the turn, was clear into the lane, took the rail, began to yield midstretch,
lugged in some and was steadied beside the rail after entering the final furlong and continued to retreat.

Footnotes
SWISHAWISH was bumped and forced into U S HONOUR NAP shortly after the break, took the lead in hand from between horses with five furlongs left,
moved clear after a quarter mile, took the rail, was asked leaving the bend, drew off under a drive upper stretch, wrapped up nearing the sixteenth marker
and was much the best. U S HONOUR NAP bumped shortly after the start, was prominent between horses, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned widest
for the stretch run, fought for second approaching the final sixteenth and moved clear for the place late. HELA unruly in the gate, was hustled early to be a
contender from inside, saved ground taking the bend, drifted out under left-handed pressure as he battled for second approaching the last sixteenth, was
corrected but could only keep third in the waning yards. DARREN'S LEGACY bobbled a bit at the start, quickly recovered to race in the second flight from
outside, bumped with LUKE ATTACK into the turn, was three wide on the turn then began to wear down between rivals inside the final furlong. LUKE
ATTACK lugged in some just after the start, bumping SWISHAWISH, was soon chasing the latter from between horses, bumped with DARREN'S LEGACY
into the turn and also wore down inside the latter the last eighth. I'M YOUR VALENTINE was prominent just outside HELA on the backstretch but began to
yield before finishing three furlongs. PONCHO ATTACK well placed just off inside, also gave way before the end of three furlongs.

Footnotes
THINK BLUE took the lead before entering the first turn, showed the way in hand just off the inside, was asked into the lane, responded to some hand
urging upper stretch, lengthened command, was wrapped up approaching the final sixteenth and easily much the best. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE gradually
progressed from outside, took second three wide on the second turn then gradually pulled away for the place in the lane. JULIAISON urged along from
inside at the start, soon moved outside THINK BLUE, raced closest to that one for nearly five furlongs, began to yield, gained the rail on the second bend
and took over third upper stretch. MIKE'S LADY rated toward the outside, commenced her bid between rivals after a half mile, had a striking position two
wide on the second turn then flattened out for the drive. NEXT TIME YOU WIN failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. DARING DAMSEL moved in beside
NEXT TIME YOU WIN on the backstretch and also had little to offer in the late going.

W W SCOUT'S HONOR rated from inside, moved outside MEDAL OF FACT after a furlong, took the lead when allowed on the bend, was roused into the
stretch, moved clear and maintained control under steady handling. DIAMOND MAXIMUS rated off the pace, commenced his bid four wide on the turn,
gained second approaching the final sixteenth and was closing the gap on the leader in the waning yards. STALLONE forwardly placed from outside, went
for the lead three wide on the turn, took over second at the top of the lane then leveled off. IWILLPERSEVERE bumped at the start, chased three wide and
had no late bid. MEDAL OF FACT broke a step slow and outward, quickly recovered to gain the advantage leaving the chute, gradually angled in, was
overtaken from outside on the bend and gave way for the drive. W W CRAZY saved ground and was not a factor. NAUGHTY ALFRED chased from
between horses, swung out widest entering the stretch and also had little to offer.
