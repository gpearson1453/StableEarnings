Footnotes
DRUM AND BASS , three deep the first turn, opened a clear lead and moved to the inner rail on the second turn, lost the advantage near the three eighths
pole, regained the lead entering the far turn then drew out under urging. ONLY CHILD , steadied when shuffled back leaving the first turn, stalked the pace
racing along the inner rail, eased out to the two path on the final turn, chased the winner but was no late threat. BYRON'S GOLD lacked speed, circled the
final turn three wide and passed a tired rival. HEROIC DEED , three wide the first two turns, gained a brief lead near the three eighths pole and tired on the
final turn. CHOSEN MISS was outrun. BUKOVEL showed speed along the inner rail and faltered. An objection by the rider of ONLY CHILD against the
winner for alleged interference on the first turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
MISS CASEY broke a step slow, recovered and was sent up between rivals to grab the lead, dropped in and secured the rail, turned away threats leaving
the far turn, spurted away under coaxing then widened under solid hand encourgement. MARTHARITA , away alertly, forced the pace two wide, bid
between rivals nearing the five sixteenths, failed to match strides with the winner exiting the fasr turn but stayed on willingly to be clear of the rest. MARKET
OF STOCKS , well placed inside and stalked early, dropped back some nearing the five sixteenths, eased out for the drive and kept on with effort. MAGIC
IN ME , three wide with pursuit, bid three deep after a half mile, failed to kick on past the quarter pole, wandered out a bit entering the lane and weakened.
RATIONALMILLENNIAL bumped with HARPER'S DO soon after the break, settled outside that rival but failed to respond. HARPER'S DO , bumped early,
saved ground off the pace and faded.

Footnotes
ROYAL SPY , fractious in the starting gate, circled the first turn three deep, advanced in the three path between horses on the far turn, closed between foes
and was up late. LIBERTY STAR bumped with STORIED FELLA when drifting in leaving the starting gate, was forwardly placed three wide on the first turn,
circled foes and gained a brief, four wide lead leaving the final turn and flattened out. SPONSORED lacked early speed, was five deep leaving the final
furlong and had a slight rally. STORIED FELLA , bumped by LIBERTY STAR after stumbling at the break, raced along the inner rail down the backstretch,
moved off the rail for the drive, worked between horses in the stretch and lacked the needed late response. NEVER SATISFIED bumped HAMPDEN LANE
when bearing out leaving the starting gate, was taken up entering the first turn when caught in close quarters then railed to menace. NO ANGEL , bumped
on both sides leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace two wide and gave way. HAMPDEN LANE , bumped leaving the starting gate, was no factor.
RAISE A SPEIGHTS , bumped on both sides leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and gave way.

FLAVA'S DREAM pressed the pace outside SHINY PENNY, moved alongside into the far turn, dueled on a slim lead past the three sixteenths, shook clear
then drifted in near the sixteenth marker, kept on under solid handling and prevailed. SWEET TALIA , three wide early, dropped in to give chase through the
backstretch run, eased out with aim on the embattled leaders approaching the lane, was bumped and turned sideways near the sixteenth pole, regrouped
and finished gamely to gain. SHINY PENNY sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, dueled inside the winner from the far turn to the head of the
lane, came out near the sixteenth pole bumping with SWEET TALIA then faded. MICK'SBESTBETYET , bumped and pinched back at the break, failed to
menace. STRANDS OF PEARLS , in tight soon after the break, recovered and edged up while saving ground past the half mile marker, pursued to the
quarter pole then gave way. CANDY CORNER drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, lost ground when drifting four wide near the half, chased,
sustained an injury nearing the five sixteenths, was pulled up soon after and vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning CANDY CORNER. No
action was taken.

DIVINE FASHION , bumped at the break, rated back off the leaders heading to the first turn, eased out and prompted three wide, moved up to challenge
leaving the three eighths, dueled outside TILTED TIARA around the final turn, moved clear under a strong ride soon into the lane, widened a bit past the
sixteenth pole then was kept to task to the wire. FISHERS , jostled at the break, corrected and was sent up to duel inside, dropped back some into the far
turn, eased out past the five sixteenths and came back on gamely through the final sixteenth. TILTED TIARA disputed the pace outside FISHERS, held a
slim lead past the three eighths, secured the rail leaving the far turn while battling inside the winner, stayed on to the sixteenth pole then gave way
grudgingly. DOOMSCROLLER lost ground three to four wide and lacked a solid response. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY came out at the break bumping a rival,
rated off rivals early, moved up between runners past the three eighths, chased and faded through the drive. GRISETTE hopped at the break and was away
slowly, lagged well back, saved ground into the lane and had a slight response.

BEVERLY PARK stalked the pace racing near the inner rail to the far turn, swung to the five path turning for home, swept to command outside horses and
drew out late under steady handling. E J'S REVENGE bobbled slightly at the break, set the pace near the inner rail, drifted to the three path turning for
home and held on for the place. THE WOLFMAN , three wide the first turn, was fanned five deep leaving the far turn and lacked the necessary late
response. BERNIE'S ON FIRE prompted the pace outside E J'S REVENGE, gained a brief, four wide leaving in upper stretch and weakened late. JETTIN
OUT , lightly steadied in traffic mid way on the first turn, had ample room along the inner rail through the stretch and failed to take advantage of the opening.

PROVE RIGHT broke a step slow, rushed up and came in slightly when bidding three deep past the five sixteenths, poked a head in front with a quarter to
go, dueled to upper stretch then drew clear under a drive. POMPOUS PRINCE sped to the front and set the early pace towards the rail, met bids leaving the
five sixteenths, dueled around the turn and into the lane then kept on willingly to be well clear of the rest. COFFEEWITHCHRIS bobbled at the break, was
hustled up early and bid between foes near the five sixteenths, steadied out of a tight spot soon after, regrouped to chase three wide and continued with
interest to save the show. DONTINVADEMYSPACE , off the early pace, angled in for the drive and kept on with interest. LIVIN LARGE drifted in and was
rank soon after the break and failed to menace. Following an objection by the rider of COFFEEWITHCHRIS against the PROVE RIGHT alleging
interference into the turn, PROVE RIGHT was disqualified from first and placed third.

Footnotes
MR. MOSLEY set a pressured pace along the inner rail and drew off the final quarter mile while kept to his business. CAIRO BOOGIE , patiently rated along
the inner rail around all turns, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. DASHING CIRCLES , never far turn, moved up in the three path on the
final turn and flattened out. VIRGINIA FULLA , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail and was caught in close
quarters mid way on the final turn. MANKLIN CREEK lacked speed and was not a factor. TYLER TIME prompted the pace outside the winner, gave way
turning for home and was eased late. TRIPLE AMERICANO , wide, weakened. ROCKIN RON , no factor, raced wide on the final turn, gave way and was
eased late.
