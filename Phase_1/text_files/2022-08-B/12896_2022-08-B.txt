Footnotes
VALIANT MINI STAR moved evenly in mid pack racing four path on the turn floating out six wide in upper stretch finding best stride a sixteenth out pulling
away. OUR LADY NELSON away alertly set the pace on a short lead through the turn digging in from the four path down the lane being overpowered inside
the sixteenth pole hanging on to salvage place. LOVE PERFECTION rallied to pressure on the turn losing momentum in upper stretch vying evenly near mid
track late. TORIANNE slow early lagged to upper stretch gaining some late on the inside. MIDNIGHT PASS chased close up through the turn extending
near the rail in upper stretch weakening late. SAPPHIRE MOONLIGHT hustled along through the turn would fade in upper stretch. DELIA'S PRIDE hard
ridden from the get go had no speed. PIE DOUGH bumped at the break trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SASSY JUSTICE prompted the pace pressing through the far turn shaking clear in the two path upper stretch finding more late holding firm to wire.
NEVERSAYNOLETSGO unhurried early advanced outside on the far turn vying five then four wide down the lane giving willing response though no match
for the winner. KINGSTON TIME stalked the pace through the backside ramping up to pressure abreast rival on the far turn being rebuffed in upper stretch
weakening late. BAD KARMA stalked the pace chasing along the inside on the far turn fading in upper stretch. LEGENDARYS FIRST slow early raced
inside to upper stretch weakening late. ACCOLADES GALORE failed to respond. DIXIE RED pressed a narrow lead through the backside coming up empty
from the three eighths pole. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF KINGSTON TME AGAINST THE RIDER OF SASSY JUSTICE CLAIMING IN
TERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
