Footnotes
SWIFT RITHMS dueled from the two path on the backstretch, gained command at the seven sixteenths pole then shook clear in the upper stretch to prove
best in the end. LUSH BE A LADY chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive to bid three wide on the second turn and was closing well on the
stretch drive but it wasn't enough. C F V TU BRUTUS stalked the pace from the inside then bid three wide on the turn to menace in the stretch but gave way
in the final furlong for the place prize. EMPIRE DANCER tracked the pace while three wide, was moving up on the far turn to bid in the stretch but came up
evenly. OH LA DE DA settled along the inside on the backstretch then bid mildly on the turn while four wide and was no menace. GIDDY GOOTZ was away
from the gate slowly then was unhurried early and failed to rally. GIODORABLE dueled for the lead from the inside, was in a long drive entering the far turn,

Footnotes
OH SO SOCIAL showed the way early then dueled with an inner rival into the turn, gained command at the five sixteenths pole and held on well throughout
the stretch drive to prevail in the end. MYLITTLEREDVETTE chased the pace from the inside, then came out three wide on the turn to menace in the stretch
and was closing belatedly but it was not enough to catch the leader. J'S NAUGHTY BOY was unhurried early then bid on the turn from the inside, angled
out to the five path to rally in the late stretch but it was too little too late. FRIDAY NIGHT RIGHT bid from the two path while in the middle of the pack, was in
steady drive then flattened out in the stretch drive. RUN AWAY ROJO was bumped at the start, was unhurried early then menaced four wide on the turn into
the stretch and was no threat. MAS ORO stalked the pace from the inside, was in a hard drive on the turn then continued to hold on gamely for the place
position in the early stretch but was hard used and weakened in the end. AMELIA'S MACHO was unhurried early and no threat. DEALER dueled for the
lead from the inside, was in a hard drive, gained the short lead at the half marker, was overcome by the dueling rival heading into the turn, was used up and
stopped in the stretch. STARLITE RUN was bumped at the start then raced in the middle of the pack from the three path at one pace and never fired in the
stretch.
