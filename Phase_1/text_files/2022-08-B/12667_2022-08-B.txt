Footnotes
BRANDON'SMYLAWYER took over between rivals soon after the start then dropped in when clearing heading to the half mile marker, rated kindly while
handling some outside pressure, spurted away when given her cue inside the three sixteenths, drifted out a bit inside the furlong grounds then comfortably
held while under a mild drive. PAMMY'S READY, nudged from the gate, prompted the pace two to three wide outside the winner, shifted in for the final
furlong and kept on with good energy. HAVANA LOVE (IRE) rated in range and outside a rival, steadied off heels near the three eighths, regrouped and
chased three wide into the lane, came out a bit and finished willingly. XMAS SURPRISE, off the pace while saving ground, angled five wide soon into the
lane but could only generate a mild kick. THAT'S AMARE, three wide pursing mid turn, angled six wide in upper stretch but came up empty. AFTER
MIDNIGHT rated off the winner soon after the break, stalked inside, failed to kick on under pressure entering the lane and faded.

Footnotes
IT'S SAUL RIGHT , bumped at the break, quickly recovered and gained a tracking spot towards the rail, bid inside a pair of runners to be on near even
terms leaving the far turn, dueled to the inside of THE REIGN SONG while under a hearty ride entering the lane, briefly went clear in mid stretch then was
fully extended to hold sway. GRAZED MY HEART , bumped at the break, corrected and raced close up between runners early, tracked a three pronged
battle leaving the three eighths, angled four wide into the lane, kept on grinding through the final furlong and earned the place in the final yards. THE REIGN
SONG , in hand outside prompting the leader, went on the attack three deep into the turn, sparred outside the winner to just about mid stretch then stayed
on with good courage while losing the place late. QUICKLY PARK IT , fractious in the gate pre race, was backed out, drafted back off the early pace, saved
ground into the lane and finished with some interest. DANZIGS STAR STORM , urged four wide early, dropped in leaving the far turn, came back out for the
drive but lacked a solid finish. WINK WISH AND PARK , four wide with pursuit, shifted out a bit wider soon into the lane and faded. RUFF RIDE hopped at
the break and was away last, dropped well off the early pace, came three wide for the drive and had some late life. LUCKY VEGAS lost ground four to five
wide and gave way. PAISLEY'S VISION came in at the break and caused some bumping, straightened and hustled up to gain the early lead while two wide,
was taken on from both sides into the turn, stayed on past the five sixteenths then succumbed.

Footnotes
DOMINANT SOUL moved up to the inside of COMMANDER KHAI heading into the first turn and took command, moved clear for the backstretch run, came
under a hustling ride entering the lane, turned back a challenge heading to mid stretch, kicked back away and proved best under a drive. FORT MOULTRIE
was taken back soon after the start and settled well off the lead while saving ground, eased out and split rivals near the quarter pole, shifted out five wide in
upper stretch, straightened and finished strong to nab the place. COMMANDER KHAI led early then ceded to the winner after about three sixteenths of a
mile, stalked two wide, was put to asking and chased from the three eighths, gained some nearing mid stretch then kept on willingly while outkicked for the
place. HOMETOWN HERO settled outside, came under a ride leaving the far turn and started a run, came four wide for the drive and churned on to gain.
COSMO , off the pace and between rivals, shifted out for the drive, moved up past mid stretch then flattened out very late. EXPLOSIVE rated close up three
wide, saw the leaders get away a bit after being called upon past the three eighths, pursued to the head of the lane then faded. IN THE MIDST broke
sluggishly, raced wide and failed to menace. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY saved ground and faded. MR. T'S THIRSTY , well placed towards the inside, failed to
kick on leaving the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
R DOC secured the inside early on and rated kindly off of a contested pace, moved up in hand heading into the far turn, angled out past the five sixteenths
and responded to asking, rolled up four wide outside the leader soon into the lane, overtook that one in mid stretch and moved away under a steady hand
ride. DURANTE bobbled at the break, quickly recovered and advanced inside to take over, set a pressured pace while under rating, moved clear under a
ride soon into the lane, failed to contain the winner with a furlong to go, faded late but was well clear of the rest. BUTKUS , four wide past the three quarter
pole, dropped in a path and stalked the pace, bid three deep near the half mile pole, pressed the leader past the quarter pole, stayed willingly to about mid
stretch then gave way. PEPPERMAN , four wide early, raced three wide under urging leaving the three eighths, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a
bid. MAXIM MOMENT , away in good order, pressed the pace outside DURANTE, was caught between rivals from the half mile marker to the five
sixteenths, failed to go on nearing the lane, angled out and weakened. FIREMAN DAN stumbled at the break, saved ground off the pace and failed to make
an impact. TODAY MATTERS , four wide, was ridden along nearing the half mile pole and faltered.

Footnotes
TRUE PATRIOT rated kindly while saving ground, eased out advancing into the far turn, moved further out and ranged up four deep to bid into the lane,
responded when set down soon after, reeled in the leader inside the furlong grounds, kicked clear under a drive then held firm. MAGIC GAME , in hand
saving ground, edged closer leaving the far turn, eased out and worked her way between rivals soon into the lane, altered out five wide and finished well to
gain'. FINNLEY'S KITTEN secured the inside into the backstretch and stalked under some rating, took closer order after a half mile, slipped through an
opening along the rail entering the lane and gained command, spurted clear under pressure, was engaged past mid stretch, battled on past the sixteenth
pole then faded. SMART MONIQUE was steadied off heels into the first turn, regrouped and settled off the inside, gained five wide into the lane but failed to
seriously sustain. SHE'S A BIT SASSY broke a bit slow then was difficult to settle and pulled her way forward into the first turn, remained rank while three
wide past the three quarter pole, settled better near the five eighths, moved to threaten the leader leaving the five sixteenths, pressed between into the lane,
shifted in near mid stretch and faded. WARREN'S SHOWGIRL , sluggish from the gate, settled off the pace, moved up off the rail leaving the far turn,
angled six wide for the drive but failed to seriously kick on. TIZ MY PRINCESS lagged back, raced three wide into the lane, angled out and had a belated
response. ROUBAIX popped the gate pre race, cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined mid way on the final turn, came two wide for the
drive and weakened. GRAZIE DAISY , three to four wide, failed to respond.

Footnotes
BLACK STORM , under some coaxing along the rail early on and off of contested pace, commenced a run leaving the five sixteenths, had ample room
along the rail to continue his run into the lane, bid inside the leader with furlong to go, took command soon after and drew out under a drive. SMILEFORME
vied three wide outside a rival, moved to command past quarter pole, kicked clear into the lane, wandered outward and gave way grudgingly. SQUARE
DEAL stalked the duelers while outside a rival, eased out to have dead aim into the lane, drifted out and failed to follow through in the final furlong. BEAR
CHUM (AUS) drafted back early, was taken five wide nearing the turn, circled into the lane and had a mild run. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH broke on top
despite a stumble, dueled to the inside of SMILEFORME, ceded the lead nearing the lane while in the two path and weakened. ALLEVA , off the pace and
inside foes mid turn, came three wide for the drive, shifted in but failed to threaten. HALF RIGHT rated close up while saving ground off the duel, eased out
for the drive and gave way. JACKS OUTLAW , off the pace and between runner nearing the half mile pole, swung very wide for the drive but failed to
menace. HORN OF PLENTY , four wide chasing, failed to kick on nearing the lane and faded.

Footnotes
SISTER OTOOLE settled in last early on, angled out leaving the three quarter pole, quickly gained outside foes with a little more than a half mile remaining,
saw the leaders get away a bit as they dueled into the far turn, came back three wide under asking into the lane, closed in under right handed
encouragement to challenge past mid stretch, took command outside runners inside the sixteenth pole then dug in tenaciously to deny SCARABEA.
SCARABEA , taken to rate while saving ground, eased out near the five eighths, raced between runners leaving the half mile marker, dropped in tightening
ALMOST A FACTOR leaving the three eighths pole, eased out making headway into the lane, worked between runners soon after, shifted out for the final
furlong and finished gamely. BELLAMORE prompted the pace in hand, moved alongside the leader nearing the half mile pole, dueled into the far turn,
carried that battle holding a slim lead nearing the furlong grounds, ceded soon after while between runners then gave way grudgingly. MACADAMIA (BRZ)
cleared early, set the pace about two wide, met challenges heading to the half mile pole, emerged in a duel to the inside of BELLAMORE, carried that battle
past mid stretch then faded very late. NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) tracked inside, was coaxed along chasing the dueling leaders into the lane, lacked some room
near mid stretch, eased out but came up empty when clear. DUVET DAY (IRE) broke a step slow, settled off the rail, came three wide past the quarter pole,
shifted in but failed to make an impact. FREEDOM LASS , firmly rated between rivals early, moved up three wide then steadied when tightened approaching
the half mile pole, angled out and chased four wide past the quarter pole, failed to kick on soon after and faded. ALMOST A FACTOR was steadied between
runners early, saved ground off the pace leaving the five eighths, was taken up sharply when SCARABEA was angled in near the three eighths, regrouped,
angled out but failed to kick on in the drive. There was a stewards inquiry concerning the run near the three eighths pole. No action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN KINGDOM chased to the inside of a rival, eased out advancing into the lane, closed under solid handling and reeled in the leader inside the
furlong grounds, went clear inside the sixteenth marker then was fully extended to prevail. CHRIS FIX , well back early while saving ground, was under
pressure three wide leaving the far turn, dropped in to advance nearing the lane, came back out and closed willingly to gain. ARMAVEER saved ground
early, angled out near the five eighths, came five wide for the drive and rallied. KING ROB stumbled at the break, recovered and moved up to clear early,
opened up a long lead through the backstretch run, kept on to be well clear into the lane, gave in to the winner past mid stretch and faltered. GRAZEN IN
THE PARK , four to five wide, was not a factor. FIFTY CENT DOLLARS settled in the clear, raced four wide nearing the half mile pole but failed to generate
a solid run. RYE RUNNER broke awkwardly and failed to menace. EREBUS , three wide early, chased outside the winner and weakened. SASQUATCH
RIDE bobbled at the break, saved ground under a ride nearing the far turn and faded. WESLEY'S BOY , between rivals chasing the early pace, faltered.
