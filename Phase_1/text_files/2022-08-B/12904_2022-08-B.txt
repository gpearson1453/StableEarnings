Footnotes
RANGER GUS broke sharply, was urged clear of his rivals near the inside racing to the turn, tipped out dueling for command inside a rival into upper
stretch, was headed between calls late but continued with a game effort to narrowly prevail under firm right handed encouragement. DEPUTY LAW tracked
the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening three sixteenths, steadily drew on terms with that rival racing through the turn to challenge for command in
upper stretch, struck the front between calls in a prolonged drive but was just outfinished. DYNAMOMETER tracked the pacesetter inside a rival racing to
the bend, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly late. WEAREINITTOWINIT shifted out tracking off the second flight racing in three path through
the turn but offered no rally. GONE A LIL LU HU was off last and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
QUANTUM LEAP, in touch with the pacesetter in the opening stages, conceded some position to that foe entering the first turn to track that rival from just
out of striking distance in the two path racing to the backstretch, steadily closed the gap on that foe through the far turn into upper stretch and produced a
solid closing response to narrowly prevail in time under firm handling. JOE PHILLIPS sprinted clear of the field along the inside racing into the first turn, held
sway on a clear margin into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but was collared nearing the wire. SOUPER FORTUNE tracked the leaders inside rivals
in second flight, saved ground through the far turn, tipped off the inside entering the lane and prevailed for a share while failing to close the gap on the top
pair. GOPHER GOLD tracked the leaders between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient
handling on the far turn, was caught in close quarters between rivals racing past midstretch but continued with late momentum to gain some position. HOLD
THE SPICE, caught four wide racing into the first turn as part of the second flight, shifted inwards tracking off the second flight on the backstretch, was
fanned to the five path entering the lane but lacked the needed final kick. CLUB MESQUITE tracked the leaders three deep between foes in second flight
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position nearing the far turn but lacked the needed final bid. JOKER MATT, held up avoiding close
quarters along the rail in the opening furlong, saved ground throughout but failed to gain striking distance.

Footnotes
DIAMOND MISSY, carried inwards a bit at the start, was quickly righted to track off the first flight between foes in early stages, shifted out three wide on the
turn, drifted out losing some momentum nearing upper stretch, but produced a solid closing response to wrest command leaving midstretch, then shifted to
the inside while maintaining the advantage to the end under pressure. NORTHERN CHARMER, off slowly, tracked the leaders along the inside as part of
the second flight, saved ground on the bend, tipped out racing through the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner nearing the wire.
IT'S ME came around some traffic at the break settled five wide on the backstretch, shifted in to track off the first flight between foes on the turn, swung out
four wide racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. DROPPED COLD ducked out at the start impeding WILD INVASION,
was righted, then urged prompting a rival's through the backstretch into the turn and faded in the drive. MISS CARMEN CIBO ducked in at the start crossing
into the path of the eventual winner, was collected, then urged along the inside disputing the pace into the turn, edged forward into upper stretch but gave
way leaving the furlong marker. WILD INVASION, cut off at the start, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
HOITY TOITY broke readily, stalked just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid closing the gap on the leader racing through
the far turn, took over leaving midstretch and shook clear late under firm handling late. SHE B GLAMOROUS settled outside foes behind the second flight in
the opening half, advanced three wide racing into the far turn, was fanned to the five path entering the stretch but continued with a steady late response to
edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. INDAWIN sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch,
maintained the advantage disputing the issue through the far turn into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. MERLIN'S SISTER, off slowly,
then carried out a bit by STARLIGHT TWIST at the start, was righted, then angled inwards racing to the first turn, splitting rivals nearing the backstretch to
gain some position, angled to the rail to track the leaders into the far turn, saved ground to the lane and continued evenly late while being outkicked for a
share. NOFANSINTHESTANDS settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the first turn, switched out racing into the second bend but offered no
rally. STARLIGHT TWIST broke outwards crossing into the path of MERLIN'S SISTER, was righted to track off the first flight in the three path racing to the
backstretch, continued outside a rival into the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. PIPER ROSE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing
to the backstretch but retreated after a half.

Footnotes
THAT'S NOT FUNNY was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing four wide leaving the midway
point of the far turn, was fanned five wide in upper stretch but produced a steady late response to edge clear under firm encouragement. SAMYAZA settled
well off the leader a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out leaving the far turn gathering momentum, angled to the four path racing through
the stretch and found his best stride late to prevail for the place honors in time. WAR CHEST was settled along the inside as part of the last flight racing to
the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch, altered course five wide midstretch and continued willingly while being outkicked for a share. MAJOR
ATTRACTION, pulling three deep between foes in the opening stages, tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, shifted three
wide on the far turn to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) tracked off the second flight
along the inside racing to the far turn, tipped out racing through the stretch but had no late response. MOUNTAIN PINE angled inwards racing to the first
turn while being urged prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch, pressed the issue to the far turn, then between foes into upper stretch and gave way
late. TREASURE RUN, urged to dispute the pace along the inside from the outset to far turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and emptied out leaving
the furlong marker. ITS A BOY angled to the rail tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, was urged along the rail when presented an opening
nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid inside foes but flattened out midstretch. KING NATE settled last racing to the far turn and failed to menace.
MISHKO, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, faded from contention early.

OPTIMAL COURAGE was urged to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening stages, dueled for command on the turn into upper
stretch, was headed but regained the advantage in the closing stages to narrowly prevail under strong handling. BAYOU COLONEL tracked off the first flight
between foes in the opening stages, shifted to the inside racing into the turn, tipped out three wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to challenge for
command nearing the wire. MACHO ROCCO, forwardly placed from the outset, was urged to terms pressing the pacesetter into the turn, gained the
advantage nearing upper stretch, dueled for command between foes to late stages but was just outkicked. THIRTY SECONDS OUT, forwardly placed three
wide tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, faded into upper stretch. HURTS SO GOOD switched out tracking off the second flight in the opening
stages, was fanned to the five path entering the stretch but offered no rally. REMEMBER THE MAINE was settled last while angling inwards racing to the
turn and failed to gain striking distance. MIAMI CROCKETT angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the first flight and steadily faded into the turn.

Footnotes
SHINBORO tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch, steadily advance along the rail to gain the advantage midway
through the far turn, edged clear in upper stretch and just maintained the advantage to the end under brisk handling. DIRECT ACTION broke outwards
crossing the path of GOLDEN TRIBUTE, went clear into the first turn pulling hard against restraint, dictated the pace to the second bend, lost the advantage
nearing upper stretch but produced a solid second effort to challenge for command nearing the wire. BEHAVIN MYSELF tracked off the second flight racing
to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to earn a share. SHATTERED DREAMS settled along the inside
as part of the last flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing through upper stretch and ,made an effort to improve his position between foes.
CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, off slowly, settled off the second flight and continued evenly three wide between foes into the stretch. GOLDEN TRIBUTE, shuffled
back out of close quarters at the start, never gained contention. THIRSTY KISS, washy in the post parade, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second
flight to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.
