Footnotes
CLOSING DEALS was up close early, raced four wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole and edged clear for the win. TRIPLE P was unhurried
early, raced seven wide out of the turn, was passing rivals late, was no match and finished second best. BUSTED CREDIT chased the early pace, went
three wide into the turn, shifted out and was along for third. DOYOUKNOWWHOIAM was away alertly, angled to the rail, set a clear early pace from the
inside and faded. GOING GOING GONE was allowed to settle early, raced four wide and finished belatedly. ISLE STORM tracked the early pace, raced five
wide and was empty. GRIS TORMENTA was void of any speed, raced six wide through the turn and offered no late rally. CARLY HUSTLE trailed
throughout.
