IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE tracked the pace in opening stages and saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, dug in determinedly in late
stages and edged away. MY BOAZ vied inside of WIN IN THE CITY for the early lead then shook free midway around the turn, remained clear into the final
furlong then got reeled in late. WHO'S BIG DADDY lacked early speed and raced in the back, came two wide into the lane, angled four wide a furlong out
and gained show. WIN IN THE CITY vied outside of MY BOAZ for the lead in opening stages and battled on into the turn, failed to match strides past the
five sixteenths pole then flattened in the lane and lost show. JUST JOHNNY was off a step slow at the start, was not too far back entering the turn then
flattened along the inside and offered no late bid. ROCKYMOUNTAIN BREW raced in range three to four wide around the turn then faded in upper stretch,
fell approaching the wire, lost the rider and got vanned off after the race.

WAR REPORTER broke out and bumped repeatedly with DRAG MALIBU at the start, tracked inside around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane,
roused forward along the rail and edged away under steady urging. CYBER MONDAY bumped repeatedly with DRAG MALIBU at the start, raced midpack
then edged closer three wide midway around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and got up late for place. MOONSHINE MAX sped to the lead at the
start and held firm around the turn, got collared by rail running WAR REPORTER in the final furlong and weakened to show. COUNCIL GROVE raced off
the early pace, saved ground around the turn and improved position without threatening the top trio. STRONG STORM raced in the last flight heading into
the turn, urged outside entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. WILD APPEAL was forwardly placed soon after the start, remained up close around the
turn then tired in the drive. DRAG MALIBU got bumped back and steadied sharply at the start losing ground, rushed up into closer contention then drifted
wide into the lane and retreated. LOOKIN' BOMBED got bumped at the start and failed to move into contention. THE RIDER OF DRAG MALIBU LODGED

paths under right handed pressure and gained show. COBYMEISTER hustled up entering the turn, got carried out six wide entering the lane and had a mild
improve. WARRIOR'S RUN lacked early speed, swung wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. HOOKED ON DREAMS was forwardly placed in
opening stages, sustained a three wide bid around the turn then faded in the lane. LURCH raced up close two wide in early stages then retreated in the

stayed on with response into the lane and got up late for place. EBONY PEARL dueled with the winner through the backstretch and around the far turn,
could not match strides past upper stretch and got edged late for place. BLACK KAT TAPS got carried in and slightly steadied at the start then was keen
leaving the first turn, tugged into closer contention, then angled in and engaged the top pair midway through the backstretch, dueled for command into the
final turn then weakened in upper stretch. GLAMOROUS LIFE raced off the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and never threatened.
