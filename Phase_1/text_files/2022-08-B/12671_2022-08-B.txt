Footnotes
GEORGIA DAWN broke on top, dueled into the first turn closest to the inside, continued to alternate the middle half mile, narrowly showed the way into the
stretch then drove well clear. IZEONPOINT in the second flight while four wide for five furlongs, came three wide and under urging into the stretch, rallied to
be up for the place, not a threat to the winner. CYPRESS QUEEN dueled up front while racing in the two path, was the first to blink entering the stretch,
chased the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for the second spot. SAVVY SHIPMAN in the second group early in the two path, fell back, saved
ground second turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals stretch while never dangerous. MY LITTLE JEN behind the pace while between foes, chased the
dueling leaders into and through the final turn just off the inside, faltered through the stretch. CRIMSON FELINE in the second flight closest to the inside, fell
back before a half, moved out to be four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick.

Footnotes
OAK HILL SOLUTION broke alertly, altenrated up front in the two path, narrowly showed the way into the lane while continuing off the inside, long drive to
the wire, slight drift late to brush with the runner up, proved best in determined fashion. POLICY LIMIT bumped with COUNTRY CUT at the break, set or
forced the pace along the inside, continued to alternate into and through the final turn, headed into the lane, exchanged a brush with the winner late,
outfinished. BLAZING CHARLIE last away, moved up anbd chased the top two throughout while racing off the inside, had little for that pair the final furlong,
fully extended to save the show. COUNTRY CUT bumped at the start then was steadied, raced back and well off the inside, came three wide for the drive,
slowly gaining for the show. FIFTYFIVE STRONG saved ground to no avail in trailing home. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE
RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

PROBLEM CHILD broke behind the leaders and was unable to keep up despite being asked, moved out, came four wide out of the turn when beginning to
move, collared the leader just inside the furlong marker and edged clear while kept to pressure. TUCKER THE GRUMP away in good order, narrowly set
the pace closest to but not on the inside, two path into the lane, shook briefly clear, offered resistance to the winner for a short while after being headed then
could not keep pace, clearly second best. MAKE YOUR DESTINY broke alertly, fell back off the lead pack, saved ground through the turn, continued up the
rail to be along for the show. FISHIN WITH PETE with the early pace while between foes, faltered. SPREADING RUMORS off slowly, fell far back,
continued to trail by a sizable advantage into the lane, displayed some mild late interest to pick off a rival late. ALL COUNTRY vied up front early outside,
four wide out of the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
UNCLE FRANK broke on top, quickly clear into the first turn, saw that lead diminish up the backstretch while in the two path, shrugged off a couple of rivals
out of the final turn to be clear into the lane, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. GUNNER PAUL prompted the pace outside, crept closer
before a half, continued in striking position through the second turn, could not keep pace with the winner upper stretch, clearly second best. SMOKY TOPAZ
void of speed, continued back into the far turn, staged a mild rally from between rivals entering the stretch to be clear of the others. SPHEROID broke back,
lacked speed off rail, four wide exiting the final turn, finished up evenly the final furlong. FORT BONZ pressed the winner from along the inside for almost six
furlongs then gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane. GRAND PRIORITY last away,moved up to race in the second flight, also had
little left the final quarter.

Footnotes
APRIORITY GIRL took command along the inside after an even start, dueled into the turn, headed entering the stretch, regained the advantage nearing the
furlong marker and edged clear under firm handling. SCARLET STORM prompted the issue early off the inside, advanced to duel through the turn in the two
path, held a slim advantage into the stretch, outkicked in the run to the wire, remained well clear for the place. ROSEISALWAYSRITE forwardly placed in
the two path backstretch, fell back off the top pair turn, dropped inside, continued up the rail and proved no match for those same two rivals through the
lane. CHARMING KAT went one paced early along the inside,moved out a bit in the turn to the two path, continued in even fashion through the stretch in
lacking a closing response. KELLIE MAE fell back to trail after the start and never menaced.

Footnotes
GREEN MONSTER broke in good order, patiently handled into the turn, began to advance midway on the bend, set down, kicked down the leader from the
outside to win going away. WILD MALLORY broke on top, quickly clear through a lively opening quarter, continued to hold a sizeable advantage through the
turn, proved no match for the winner late, remained well clear of the rest. GEE GEE back off the pace and the inside, moved closer to the rail turn, roused
into the lane and staged a mild rally while not a threat to the top two. BROKE FINANCING lacked speed, raced four wide into the turn, went evenly through
the lane in lacking a late kick. GALAXY THIRTYSIX last to leave, was never dangerous while saving ground. BUILDING HOME chased the runner up off the
inside, gave way. GABY'S PROMISE trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
EASY TO MISS hustled clear away from the gate and got to the inside, continued to set the pace while rating up the backstretch, garnered a larger
advantage when straightened for home, found more late when challenged by the runner up from the inside, dug in final strides to prove best. DOCTOR LEO
lacked early foot off the inside, continued back when accounting traffic midway on the final bend, dropped inside turning for home, roused, lodged a bid
inside the winner with less than a furlong remaining, denied. MINNESOTA MIRACLE forwardly placed while in hand along the inside, continued to stalk into
the far turn, bit closer turning into the stretch while in the two path, chased the winner past the furlong marker then flattened out a bit in the late going while
holding the show. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER fell back to trail after the start while off the inside, moved out four wide late backstretch, continued outside to the
wire while improving position, gaining late for the show widest. OLD SOT back off the early pace while parked five wide through the first turn, closer before a
half outside, closer still while four wide through the second bend then failed to continue that advance through the stretch. BIG BOY DAVE REX pressured
the winner for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. STANDING MAN four wide through the first turn, moved into a forward position before a half,
raced three wide through the second turn and tired. ONE TIME GEM was finished after a half and trailed home.

Footnotes
DEBBIES PASSAGE quickly sprinted clear after the start, continued to maintain a considerable advantage through the turn, roused upper stretch and was
not threatened to the wire while being kept to task. KLEINMEISTER back off the pace while saving ground, improved along the rail into the lane, chased the
winner home in vain, clearly second best. MARAMA last away, trailed for three furlongs, four wide into the lane, rallied widest through the lane to report
home best of the rest. ENOUGH HEART one paced while racing off the inside. STOP THE FRIEND chased the winner off the inside for three furlongs, gave
way while between horses.
