Footnotes
STAGECOACH BOYS, reserved while angling to the inside in the opening stages, tipped off the inside racing through the far turn gaining momentum, split
foes nearing upper stretch, shifted out three deep in the lane, took charge leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. SILVER
DASH, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, moved to challenge that foe racing into upper stretch gaining a momentary
advantage but proved no match when confronted by the winner. TALENT AND TRICKS sped to the lead along the inside racing into the backstretch,
widened the margin dictating the pace to the far turn, dueled inside foes into upper stretch and gave way late. TRI SPOT tracked the leader three deep as
part of the second flight to the far turn, shifted inwards under pressure in the drive and had no final kick. MIDNIGHT ROYAL settled outside foes racing to
the backstretch and failed to gain contention. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA tracked the leader inside rivals in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded
nearing the lane. SAHM TEQUILA dropped out early.

Footnotes
LOVER GIRL was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, forged clear nearing upper stretch and widened the margin while being
kept to firm encouragement. MIGHTY MADI was rated off the first flight while angling to the inside, advanced along the rail nearing upper stretch when
presented an opening and proved best of the others. DROPPED COLD was rated off the first flight outside a rival in the opening stages, shifted out wide
nearing the lane while being urged to advance but couldn't match terms with the top pair while prevailing for a share. BARBARA ROHLOFF, urged between
foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way nearing the lane. JOMAMA SASSY broke readily, pressed the pace three wide into the turn
and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
THUNDERS ROCKNROLL broke sharply, prompted the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, kicked clear into upper stretch and widened the advantage
to the end under firm handling. CUPIDS CRUSH, forwardly placed from the break, tracked just off the leaders through the backstretch, moved to challenge
three deep nearing upper stretch, drifted out entering the lane and couldn't match terms with the winner through the final three sixteenths. ELLE'S LIL DIVA
tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out entering upper stretch while being roused to advance but had no late bid. ANA, under
pressure racing three, then four wide pursuing the leaders to the stretch, had no closing bid. LET ME DOWN EASY was hustled up the rail pressing the
eventual winner's pace into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. MISS CARMEN CIBO, held up while rank between foes in early stages, angled to the
inside on the backstretch but failed to menace thereafter. GRACE A'LACE was under pressure and emptied out early. CLASSIC CHARM broke slowly and
trailed throughout.

WHISKEY PLANK, caught a bit wide early, tracked just outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, advanced on the leaders four wide through the far
turn into upper stretch, then continued with a grudging effort to prevail in time. KID'S INHERITANCE tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second
flight to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue on the far turn, dueled between foes in that path past midstretch but was outkicked. JOE PHILLIPS
angled to the rail in early stages tracking off the second flight, saved ground on the far turn, came around a tiring foe to split rivals just off the inside
midstretch, was urged to bid for command inside the leaders but was outkicked. GOPHER GOLD was rated off the second flight between foes to the far
turn, was urged to bid between foes nearing midstretch when presented an opening, altered course avoiding tight quarters, then was shuffled leaving the
furlong marker and had no final response. CLUB MESQUITE came through close quarters in early stages to stalk just off the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, moved to press the issue into the far turn gaining a narrow advantage between foes, dueled into upper stretch but flattened out late. YOUR
TIME'S COMING settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never proved a threat. GRAVES MILL ROAD, bumped start, settled along the inside
early and proved no threat. SUPRISE CAT was urged setting the pace along the inside, to the second bend, briefly resisted when challenged but gave way
inside foes late. COMING UP ACES tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn and faded into upper stretch.

OPTIMAL COURAGE, urged to the lead while angling inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, edged forward leaving midstretch and
just held BAYOU COLONEL under firm handling. The latter, off a bit slowly, angled inside tracking off the second flight early, tipped out racing through the
turn, split foes three deep when presented an opening midstretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner to the wire. LONELY PRIVATE
tracked off the first flight four wide in early stages, angled in entering the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest between foes
to narrowly prevail for a share. MACHO ROCCO tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an even effort
while being outkicked for a share. MIAMI CROCKETT was urged pressing the pace between foes from the outset into the turn, dueled with the eventual
winner to midstretch and yielded late. JUSTICE WARRIOR settled off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, angled to the five path racing through
the stretch but offered no rally. TEST PILOT, urged three wide prompting the pace into the turn, drifted wide into upper stretch and gave way.
DAREABIGDREAM was always outrun.

Footnotes
FREIBURG tracked just off the first flight three deep through the backstretch, advanced to challenge while being fanned four wide into upper stretch but
continued with a steady late response to narrowly prevail under firm handling. YESTERYEAR was urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the
backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch, grudgingly resisted the winner to the end but couldn't contain that foe. SWAY ROAD tracked off the first
flight along the inside on the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch to bid between foes inside the top pair but was outkicked. JUST ASK JOEL
tracked the leaders four wide off the second flight racing into the bend and continued evenly in that path to late stages. CANNONBALL COMIN was rated off
the first flight between foes and faded into the turn. KING OF THE COURT was urged inside a rival pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn
and gave way into upper stretch. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER, caught in close quarters at the start, settled well off the leaders while angling to the inside early
and failed to menace thereafter. HOLY MUCHACHO settled outside a rival in the last flight early and proved no threat.

Footnotes
HALF SCOUT broke readily, was urged clear along the inside, held sway on a commanding margin into the stretch and was kept to firm encouragement.
MISS DUTTON, reserved well off the leaders in early stages, angled to the inside racing to the turn, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and
proved best of the others. GRANDIOSE SUMMER, away slowly, then bumped at the, settled well off the second flight on the backstretch, swung out five
wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. ZEE PERFECT RUN was urged four wide pursuing the pacesetter in second
flight on the backstretch, angled inwards into the lane but had no rally. PLANETARY, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way
into the lane. CHAMA tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. BALAS broke slowly
while being bumped at the start and failed to menace thereafter. OH SO BLEU flashed brief pace along the inside on the backstretch but emptied out early.

BRING ME A CHECK tracked the leaders between foes from just out of striking distance racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the turn
while being prompted to advance, then produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage from EXXEL in time under firm handling. The latter was
urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late
stages but was collared nearing the wire. PRINCE RAMA, urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter into the turn, pressed the issue between foes
into the lane and weakened late. REEF'S DESTINY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but
offered no closing bid. LENNY K settled between foes dropping off the second flight early and never gained contention. COLONEL KLINK threw his head at
the start breaking slowly, was settled into stride early and failed to menace thereafter. ASTRONAUT OSCAR, away well, dropped out of contention early.
