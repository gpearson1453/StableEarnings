Footnotes
LONESOME CAT contended the early pace inside of IRISH TRICK, dueled leaving the final turn, gained a short advantage at the eighth marker, and held
under steady pressure. IRISH TRICK contested the early pace entering the backstretch, dueled four wide through the final turn outside of LONESOME CAT,
but was unable to stall the winner through the stretch, and fought on to the wire. BOOKIE tracked four to five wide early, took closer order nearing the
quarter pole, chased outside looming boldly but raced on evenly afterwards. BAR NO Q stalked from the rail, lodged a bid between foes and lacked a kick
needed. RYANWATER rated off the pace outside, and bid belatedly. WHERE'S THE GOLD rated off the pace inside and offered a late mild bid.

between foes, dueled through the stretch and was out nodded. MUSIC HOUR roused near the quarter pole after saving ground early, and closed well late.
