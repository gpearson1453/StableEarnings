PACIFIC HARBOR pressed the pace from the three path for the first quarter then took the lead at the five sixteenths pole and edged away to draw clear
late. BURBACH was placed close up on the leaders in the two path then split horses in upper stretch to make a late run to be second best. ROYAL
OUTLAW was hustled to a pressured lead in the two path for the first quarter was headed at the five sixteenths pole and fought gamely to the sixteenths
pole and faded. FRIENDLY FOE saved ground from off the pace moved out to three or four wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rival. JUST WING IT

strides. JACK WITH SEVEN was last away then rushed to the lead to set all the pace then was collared in the final seventy yards to be second best.

four wide while steadily advancing through the turn and was out kicked in the final yards. ITS A DEAL tracked the leaders from the three path and gave way.
