ACCUSE chased the pace from the two path, was in a steady drive into the turn, then menaced while three wide in the late stretch and closed fastest to be
up at the wire to prevail. MISSONI tracked the pace in the middle of the field while two wide, was gaining ground steadily heading into the far turn, then
rallied while four wide and closed strong down the home stretch and was up for the place prize. CLASSIC COYNE lead the way into the first turn, then
dueled with an outer rival on the backstretch into the upper stretch, rallied, veered out and cut off rival, then gave way in the end. SEIVER was unhurried
early then tracked the pace from two path on the backstretch, was moving up to bid three wide on the second turn, angled out to the five path and close
willingly down the lane. LANTERN'S CANDY tracked the pace from the inside, then continued to raced even through out the backstretch into the far turn,
then bid mildly in the stretch and was no threat. PEACH COBBLER chased the pace from the inside then bid entering the second turn but came up evenly in
the stretch. SAKONNA was unhurried early then bid three to four wide on the second turn and was no menace. ULTIMATE MISSION was forwardly placed
in the two heading into the first turn to duel for the lead on the backstretch into the upper stretch, was in tight and was taken up and lost all chance. SUPER
WEST raced in the middle of the pack along the rail then faded entering the far turn and failed to rally in the home stretch. There was a STEWARD'S
INQUIRY following the race. After reviewing the replay, CLASSIC COYNE was disqualified from third and placed eighth for causing interference in the
stretch drive.

Footnotes
BUMBLE OF LOVE saved ground on the backstretch while five wide, was gaining on the far turn, then dug in gamely in the mid stretch, took command in
the final furlong and held on well to prevail. LOUDER THAN WORDS settled along the inside, was saving ground on the backstretch then swung five wide
on the second turn to close belatedly in the stretch drive and was up for second. TIMELESS ROSE tracked the pace while three wide, was moving up on the
second turn to menace in the early stretch, gained command but was caught in the end and held onto the show prize. NATIVE LION chased the pace from
the inside, was in mild drive on the far turn to menace in the upper stretch and closed well but it was not enough. BLOODY MARY MORNIN was in a steady
drive while tracking the pace along the rail, then came out three wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late.
MINTCHOCOLATECHIP stalked the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive on the far turn, was used up then flattened out in the home stretch. MAMALA
KAMALA raced from the three path in the middle of the field on the back stretch into the second half, then rallied in the early stretch, brushed rival then
continued to bid and was no threat. HOLY JUSTICE settled along the inside on the backstretch then bid on the far turn and was no threat. DIAMOND
SOLITAIRE raced from the two path in the middle of the pack then faded heading into the far turn and was no menace. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN was
unhurried early then came out three wide on the far turn and was no menace. SOUTHERN SMILE set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive, cleared
the far turn, was used up and weakened in the late stretch. CLIMBER chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive on the far turn, was in tight in
the upper stretch, steadied then lost bid.
