STANWOOD WARRIOR was well placed early on the inside, shifted out and made a two to three wide bid on the turn and slowly edged clear to prove best
under a drive. FANTASTIC DREAM was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and rallied and got the place award late. HOLYJAZZ dueled for
the lead on the inside, made a bid on the turn to shake clear, then was confronted by the winner and battled that rival to nearing the furlong marker and then
ran on but lost the place award late. TAP THE BANK was reserved early and advanced on the inside on the turn, shifted out three wide and had no punch.
SALTY DAN dueled for the lead on the outside and was three to four wide on the turn and weakened. VALIDATE chased the pace three wide and
weakened.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR was rated between rivals early, then made a inside bid leaving the turn and edged clear to prove best under a drive. R B EYE was
reserved early and saved ground on the turn, then waited in traffic nearing the furlong marker, finished well following the winner on the inside. MASTER
RECOVERY was void of early speed, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied. BIG ENDEAVOR chased the early pace and
made a four wide bid on the turn to loom boldly leaving the turn but flattened out. DUSALUT was away alertly to set the pace on the inside early, then was
two wide leaving the turn and weakened. SIX BLESSINGS was reserved early three to four wide and had no rally. CROOKED FINGER RAY tracked the
pace two wide and made a three wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive.

rival in the lane, exchanged bumps at the sixteenth pole and seventy yards from the wire and held on gamely to prove best. RUNNIN OUT OF DAYS was
off a step slow, then rushed up to duel for the lead on the inside, then had a long drive with the winner, came out slightly and bumped rival by the sixteenth
pole, then the two bumped hard again by the seventy yard marker and just missed. WITHEE chased the early pace four wide, then dropped to the inside on
the turn and came two wide into the lane and weakened, held show award. UNCLE PETE was taken back early and saved ground on the turn, then
improved position in the lane. GOLD RUSH JUNIOR pressed the early pace three wide and weakened. TIME 'ER TOO was bumped at the start, chased the

ANNETTE MARIE vied for the lead and then dueled for the lead three wide on the turn, made a bid to shake clear by the sixteenth pole and then held sway
late to prove best under a drive. DRIVEWAY chased the early pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn and was shuffled back on the turn, angled out
leaving the three sixteenths and closed well on the outside. MISS DYNAMIC broke a bit flat footed and then went up to press the pace on the inside, then
made a bid on the turn to duel for command, but5 faded in the final furlong, held show award. SHELBY GOLD chased the early pace towards the inside,
eased out on the turn and swung out to make a five wide bid leaving the turn but flattened out late. MS FLASHY HARBOR was off slowly, then was taken
wide on the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and closed the gap late. ILA VEIW TOO lacked a solid rally. OUT OF STARS failed to respond.
MYREEBEN HARBOR was off slowly, made a middle move and weakened. GOIN' COASTAL was not a factor.

terms for the lead nearing the furlong marker but hung late, second best. MR. MISCHIEF chased the early pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn
