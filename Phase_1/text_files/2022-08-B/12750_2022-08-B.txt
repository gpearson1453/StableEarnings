FAKE SOLUTION was unhurried in early stages then edged closer late on the backstretch, launched a three wide bid midway around the far turn, cleared
command at the quarter pole, widened advantage in upper stretch and held clear under steady pressure. APOLLO BAY was allowed to settle off the early
pace and saved ground up the backstretch, edged closer then tipped three wide approaching the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and finished
clearly second best. DREAMER'S DELIGHT rated off the clear top pair up the backstretch, moved into closer contention and chased three to four wide
around the turn, came five wide into the lane and prevailed for a share. TEQUILA was well reserved racing in the back, swung four wide into the lane and
narrowly missed show. LUCKS BIG BOY was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, hustled along two wide around the far turn then tired in the
drive. CLEARLY MAD sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by the winner midway around the far turn and steadily
retreated.

Footnotes
MORO FLYBOY tracked the embattled pair into the turn, launched a three wide bid past the quarter pole, dueled for command into the final furlong then
edged away late under firm handling. BORK dueled outside of R SERENGETI in opening stages and battled on into the turn, took on the added challenge of
MORO FLYBOY just past the quarter pole, fought back into the final furlong then got denied late. R SERENGETI vied for the early lead racing inside of
BORK, took on the added challenge of MORO FLYBOY late on the turn, battled for command into the final furlong then weakened late. JOE BILL was
forwardly placed after the start then weakened off the early pace, saved ground then coaxed three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. HALEY'S BEAU
came up empty midway around the turn, got pulled up at the head of the lane, reported to have bled during racing, vanned off.

THE FINN sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn, sustained response into the lane but could not contain the winner late. DISCREET
INVASION launched a four wide bid around the turn, swung five wide into the lane and ran on for a share. ITSALLABOUTYOU was forwardly placed and
hustled along three wide around the turn, coaxed four wide into the lane and responded evenly. NOSBOR was ridden along two wide around the turn and
lacked a needed rally. MATCHLOCK raced in range along the inside, cut the corner entering the lane and gave way. APPLICANT lacked speed, saved

the turn then faded in the lane. SPUMONI FLOAT raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn then two wide in the lane and had no

Footnotes
HEZA WILD RIDE raced three wide around the first turn and stalked up the backstretch, edged up to challenge LUCKY LOUIE for the lead midway around
the turn, took command past the quarter pole and finished going away. COOL CAT CHARLIE tracked the pace two wide up the backstretch, hustled along
three wide around the far turn, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. LUCKY LOUIE set a
pressured pace up the backstretch, got collared by the winner late on the far turn and steadily weakened through the lane. BET YOU A BEER applied pace
pressure to LUCKY LOUIE through the backstretch, flattened midway around the far turn and continued to tire in the lane. STAGE DOOR raced off the early
pace then hustled along the inside entering the far turn and had no response. TAP THE BRAKES raced in the back, ridden along four wide into the lane and
never threatened.

Footnotes
WOKE UP IN LOVE raced off the early pace and raced three wide around the turn, launched a bid in the upper stretch, roused forward to challenge LODE
OF BLARNEY in deep stretch, dueled in final strides, dug in gamely and prevailed. LODE OF BLARNEY tracked the pace into the turn, moved up four wide
at the quarter pole, held a slim lead a furlong out then came under attack from WOKE UP IN LOVE in final stages, fought back gamely and got nipped for
the win. LAKE RADIO gained closer contention after the opening quarter, was ridden along four wide around the turn, roused forward into contention and
stayed on with response to the wire. JUSTA STREAK was forwardly placed soon after the start, dueled for the lead around the turn, sustained bid to the
furlong marker then flattened out. TURFY was away awkwardly and spotted the field several lengths, raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and
had a mild improve. SHIP BOSS pressed the early pace then dueled around the turn, sustained bid into the lane then came up empty in the final furlong.
BOLD COWBOY angled to the inside running through the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally. SWAGGY GEORGE chased three
to four wide around the turn and faded in the lane. KLIMCO raced off the pace, chased two wide around the turn and failed to move into contention.
CAPTAIN DON hustled up to the lead at the start, dueled for command around the turn then retreated.
