EMOJI PRINCESS settled inside, picked up her pace on the backstretch, waited for room on the second bend, got through along the rail entering the
stretch, took the advantage inside the final furlong and held on in the waning yards. BULU raced in contention from outside from the beginning, was two
wide on the second turn, lost some ground floating out to path four into the lane, was all out the last eighth, took over second with fifty yards left but was too
late for the win. VIVA VIOLENCE broke alertly, was soon clear of the rest, showed the way just off or along the rail in hand, was roused approaching the
quarter pole, floated out some entering the stretch and slowly wore down between horses the final furlong. JACK'S FINALE also settled early, progressed
from outside on the backstretch, gained a striking position two wide on the second turn but could not sustain her bid inside the last eighth.

Footnotes
FRANKEL BABY soon had a clear lead from path two, floated out slightly after a furlong, stayed clear from off the inside taking the turn, was challenged
from inside in the lane, gradually drifted out under vigorous handling but held sway. CANTOO raced in the second flight just outside FRANKEL BABY,
altered in some for a clear path into the bend, engaged the latter from inside upper stretch, also gradually drifted out as he battled on even terms the last
eighth and did not have enough late. TIZWOW pressed from outside, came into the lane from path four, gradually angled out as FRANKEL BABY came out
and did not have the needed late kick. SMALL SAILOR raced in contention from inside, was in tight quarters briefly along the rail near the three furlong
marker and began to fade soon after. The rider of CANTOO lodged an objection alleging interference from FRANKEL BABY nearing the seven-sixteenths
marker. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

LAYTON THE DAY pressed the early leaders, took over two wide into the bend, moved clear, lengthened command upper stretch then steadily opened up
while drifting out under urging the last eighth. BLEEDING BLUE was bumped and taken to the outside at the start, progressed to gain second with three
furlongs left, gradually drifted out through the lane and could only just hold his position late. THACKER FROMM soon trailed, advanced three wide on the
bend, took over third upper stretch then finished evenly. WAVE THE GOLD in contention early between rivals, faded two wide on the turn. CREAL SUGAR
broke outward, bumping BLEEDING BLUE, soon had the lead but began to yield before finishing three furlongs.

INDIAN SIGN rated from outside, commenced his bid four wide on the turn, angled in some entering the lane, moved clear upper stretch, was all out in the
late going and kept AIKEN TO BE TAKIN at bay. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN raced in contention between rivals, was two wide on the bend, lost some ground
fanning outside INDIAN SIGN for the stretch run, moved clear for second and found best stride too late in the waning yards. ASTOROTH void of speed,
though hustled along from inside, lost considerable ground five wide through the turn, rallied belatedly the final furlong but was clearly best of the rest.
TIZRIK prominent early, had the rail on the bend, began to fade after four furlongs, floated out into the stretch and steadily gave way. IRISH LIGHTED
ROAD pressed GREENSPAN from just outside, took the advantage with two furlongs left but gave way for the drive instead. GREENSPAN displayed early
speed just off the inside, was headed at the quarter pole, took the rail into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
SWEET FRAULEIN settled at the back, picked up her pace five wide on the turn, was all out in the lane, surged deep stretch and got up in time. HEAVENLY
SCENT helped prompt the early pace from outside, went for the lead on the bend, gradually drifted out upper stretch, came again to GHALY POSSE as she
held a straight path inside the furlong marker, lugged in late as she battled the latter for the lead and was outfinished in a game effort. GHALY POSSE was
sent to soon gain a clear lead, was challenged from outside on the turn, moved ahead again upper stretch, fought gamely to hold on deep stretch but did not
have enough left. TENSE pressed the early speed from just outside, did not keep up leaving the bend, gradually angled out as HEAVENLY SCENT came
up upper stretch and found best stride too late inside the last furlong. SHINE DOWN was a step slow at the break, four wide through the turn and gradually
angled in for a clear path as she rallied belatedly the final eighth.

TWO MORE TIMES broke on top, was settled to the back, picked up her pace behind the leaders on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, altered out
some for a clear path after entering the final furlong, rallied and got up in the final strides. HIDDEN FIGURE pressed the early speed from outside, took the
advantage three wide with two furlongs to go, drifted out slightly as she moved clear upper stretch, was straightened, gradually lugged in the last sixteenth
and was outfinished in a game effort. SUPERTRIX soon had a clear lead, was overtaken from outside on the bend, gamely came again along the rail deep
stretch but did not have enough in the waning yards. PRINCESS CONSUELA broke outward, bumped solidly with LA GUERRERITA, raced in contention
from outside, threatened widest on the turn and found best stride too late inside the final eighth. LA GUERRERITA broke inward, bumping solidly with
PRINCESS CONSUELA, recovered well to prompt the early pace, vied for the lead between rivals on the turn but weakened for the drive. HALO COUTURE
prominent early, faded from inside on the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch and continued to yield.

RACE DRIVER broke on top, was rated off the early speed from outside, took over three wide when allowed on the bend, lengthened command as he
drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path the last furlong and proved much the best. MKAR THE FAST unruly in the gate, chased from outside, came
into contention from just off the inside on the turn, fanned outside RACE DRIVER entering the lane, angled in some for a clear path upper stretch, took over
second then could only hold his position late. DIAMOND DAVE moved to the inside after a furlong, angled toward the outside into the lane, showed late
interest deep stretch and pulled away for third. D'FEVER was sent to gain the lead after the first eighth but began to yield along the rail before finishing a
half mile. ONE PUTT RICHIE hustled to stay close early, went for the lead just outside D'FEVER into the turn, did not stay with RACE DRIVER approaching
the quarter pole and flattened out for the drive.
