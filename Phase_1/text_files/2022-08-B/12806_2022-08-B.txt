JUNE GLOOM tracked the pace while well placed inside, bid along the rail into the second turn, took over then edged clear and held driving. TADEO
pressed the pace outside of RUN FACTOR, was three wide to the second turn, eased down to the two path but was outkicked by the winner and not
threatened for the place. VERMEER broke slow, trailed while inside to the stretch and did not threaten. RUN FACTOR hustled to the front while racing off
the rail then began to tire nearing the second turn, drifted out to the five path and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SIR LAUGHALOT had the best speed, set the pace then edged clear down the backstretch, was inside to the stretch and was under steady pressure to
hold. HULA KING came out slightly and bumped TIZ INDY shortly after the start, chased the winner, was put to the test into the second turn and closed
willingly but too late. POTENTE ALBA was four wide to the backstretch, chased to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch and was gaining steadily
while widest in the lane. TIZ INDY was bumped after the start by HULA KING then took up sharply, trailed while four wide and was never a threat. CAPES
HOT ROCKET stalked the winner three wide, got outkicked into the second turn and gave way in the driving. The trainer of TIZ INDY lodged an objectioon
against both HULA KING and POTENTE ALBA for alleged interference shortly after the start but the objection was dismissed by the stewards.

Footnotes
MO SUGAFOOT was well placed behind the leader, rallied two wide to take over on the second turn then drove clear. JAN'S BEST trailed to the second
turn, was three then four wide to the stretch then closed steadily for the place. LEAD ACTRESS broke in the air, chased the pace two wide to the second
turn then lacked the needed late response. CLEAR WIN hustled to the front, set the pace to the second turn then was overtaken by the winner and tired.
MISSY PARKER broke slow then settled, saved ground to the stretch then ran up CLEAR WIN'S heels in mid stretch, steadied hard and lost any chance.
The trainer of MISSY PARKER lodged an objection against LEAD ACTRESS for alleged interference in mid stretch but that claim was dismissed by the
stewards.
