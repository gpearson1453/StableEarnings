Footnotes
WISH UPON A STAR allowed the pace to go early, raced in the second flight along the inside in the run up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane,
set down, late push, up at wire. AND FIFTY broke best of all, narrowly set the pace in the two path, shook well clear into the lane, continued to hold a
daylight advantage late, nailed at the wire. COMMANDER SCOTT pressed the winner from along the inside four just under six furlongs, could not keep pact
with that in the drive nor prove a match for the runner up, saved the swhow. ALIGNED INTEREST lacked early foot off the inside, dropped to the rail for the
run through the second turn, improved inside of rivals into the lane, lacked a further advance to finish up evenly. CHIEF KIMOSABI last away, trailed, moved
out, came four wide for the drive, improved slightly while passing tiring rivals. HOT LE ROY lacked speed, failed to muster a rally. I LIKE DREAMING in the
second flight while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, gave way late in the second bend to trail home.

TUGBOAT last away, trailed early as a result, began to advance on the outside early turn, came three wide for the drive, closed with good resolve to kick
down the leader. IRONIT vied early four wide into the turn, showed the way through the bend in the three path, shook well clear, failed to contain the winner
late, well clear for the place. RESPOSADO vied early between foes, fell back into turn, swung widest for the drive, mild rally, finished willingly to be well
clear of the others. SUMMERTIME BANDIT with the early pace inside, gradually weakened late in the turn and through the lane. LA SMOOCHIE flashed
some brief speed three wide, gave way after three furlongs.

FINAL QUEST broke well from the outside, fell back, three wide through the turn, closer entering the stretch, challenged inside the leader with less than a
furlong remaining, floated in a bit soon after, proved best under firm handling. QUOTABELLE with the early pace while racing off the inside, shook clear into
the stretch while three wide, drifted in slightly floating the winner a bit closer to the rail, gave ground grudgingly to that one late, clearly second best.
LAWLESS TIMES in the second flight early while off the inside, failed to keep pace with the the winner when that one went by exiting the turn, chased the
top two home, well clear of the others. LEARNING TO WIN last to leave, lacked speed, improved position three wide without posing a serious threat.
DIVINE DEFENCE broke well, narrowly set the early pace, dueled into the turn inside the runner up, weakened steadily through the stretch. VALERIE
LOUISE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, in mid pack early, failed to respond through stretch. RYAN'S GRACE remained back. GLORIOUS GEARS
fell back to trail, was always outrun.

Footnotes
MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT fell back to trail after the start, raced four wide into the turn, five wide out of the turn, closed with a rush down the middle part of
the strip to be up in time. JOEY'S LIGHTENING shuffled back in early traffic, saved ground through the turn when back, two path into lane, dropped back to
rail nearing midstretch, rail bid late, missed. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY moved up inside, continued to save ground when moving closer into the lane, bid past
the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the top two. PERFECT STRIKE in mid pack off the inside, came three wide into the lane, also challenged in
midstretch between rivals,not enough in the late going while drifting in a bit, just missed the show. PAC THE PULPIT in the main body outside for a half,
three wide exiting the turn when being called on, closed the gap on the leaders the final furlong with some mild late intrest. HEZA BREEZIN in the second
group up the backstretch, advanced and challenged turning for home, faltered final furlong. LANE void of speed, was never dangerous while racing off the
inside. D'FESTIVE CAT fell back in early traffic, was void of speed for a half, four wide into the lane, failed to rally. COUNT ON RAIN chased the early
leader and began a steady fade after a half. EXOTIC GENTLEMAN sprinted well clear after the start, continued to show the way into and through most of
the turn, gave way when headed into the stretch. MINE YOUR BIZ was finished early while four wide out of the turn.

PIPES AND DRUMS last away, void of speed off the inside, began to advance while five wide into the far turn, challenged three wide into the lane, long duel
to the wire, gained the nod at the wire to narrowly prevail. SARCASTIC TONE moved up to take command soon after the start, continued to show the way
up the backstretch and into the far turn, responded when challenged late in that bend, hooked up with the winner inside that one for the long duel to the
wire, missed in a game effort. GET THEM JUSTIN mid pack while four wide first turn, continued back while well out in the strip up the backstretch, began to
move forward while still four wide and inside the winner into the far turn, could not keep pace with that one to the wire, along for the show. FORTUITY within
striking distance in the second flight, shuffled back in tight quarter far turn, two path after recovering, steered out for the drive and went evenly to the wire.
PACIFICISLANDTIME prompted the pace toward the inside, moved out a bit to help tighten up FORTUITY early second turn, had little left for the drive.
MOCITO ROJO five wide into the first turn when well off the pace, continued outside, lacked a closing response when called on for the drive. RUNAWAY
TRACY in the second flight while racing outside, tired after five furlongs. METROPOL fell back to trail, continued sluggish, eased then pulled up final turn,
vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE FAR TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN,.

Footnotes
CAJUN GUMBOW broke well, set the early pace in the two path, continued to show the way into the turn, remained clear into the lane, turned back a brief
and mild bid from the runner up past the furlong marker then drew comfortably clear under steady handling. JANET IS READY also away in good order,
pressed the winner from along the inside, appeared to shy then checked up along the rail despite having room with four furlongs remaining, recovered,
moved closer in traffic while remaining along the inside late in the turn, moved out for the drive, brief bid nearing the furlong marker then could not keep up
with the winner to the wire, remained clear for the place. FOR HARPER lacked early foot outside, raced four wide through the turn, rallied mildly through
upper stretch to reach closest to the top two past the furlong marker, could do little with that pair to the wire, well clear of the others. LADY FLURRY broke
out and a bit back off the early leaders, moved up to race in the second flight, moved closer with a challenging move three wide turning for home then
flattened out through the stretch. STHEPANIE PRINCESS bumped start, in mid pack off the inside up the backstretch, two path through the turn, roused for
the drive in the three path, went evenly to the wire. DORGENOIS broke back, devoid of speed for a half, two path into the lane, lugged in upper stretch then
improved a bit without posing a serious threat. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE bobbled at the break to be last away, lacked speed inside, improved while saving
ground into the stretch, went flat late in lacking a closing punch. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE in the main body off the rail, three wide through the turn, tired.
COPPER MOON broke sharp, relinquished the advantage soon after, pressed the issue for three furlongs three wide then gave way into the stretch. LA VIE
EN ROUGE bumped both sides break, remained always back. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF THE RUNNER UP AGAINST THE
WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE LATE ON THE BACKSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
K R TARGET broke with leaders, forwardly placed inside first turn, remained in the second flight up the backstretch, advanced and took over two path far
turn, clear, turned back the runner up with a furlong remaining, kicked well clear. VERDUNVILLE lacked early foot, began to advance before a half off the
inside, continued to gain into the lane, briefly tried the winner from the outside past midstretch then could not keep up, clearly second best. NVRFORGET
URDREAMS away in good order, with pace into the first turn, clear to the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, offered brief resistance to the winner far
turn, proved no match for the runner up through the lane as well, far clear of the others. ANGOLA VACATION bumped when five wide into the first turn,
continued outside in lacking speed, staged a mild rally to improve position while not a serious threat. K V TARGET in tight, bumped when four wide into the
first turn, moved closer in the three path into the far turn when being asked, flattened out through the stretch. PLAY MASTER lightly bumped into the first
turn, fell back to race near the back, never menaced. LITTLE MAN E DUBAI forwardly placed early off the inside, bumped BARNEY'S PASSION into the
first turn, raced in mid pack then had little for the drive. BARNEY'S PASSION in tight, bumped a furlong in, chased the leader up the backstretch, stopped
second turn, jogged in. LAMONT lacked speed, retreated through the stretch to finish far back, also jogged across the wire. HUDSON HOP four wide move
to contend early, also stopped and jogged across as well to be far back.
