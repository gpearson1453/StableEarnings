EMITYAAZ pressed the pace two wide, made the lead before a half, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run through deep stretch to win going
away. MY GOOD FORTUNE trailed into the stretch, circled rivals and got up for second. ESTILO ELEGANTE stalked the pace three wide and went evenly.
GRAY ROYALITY hopped at the start then failed to menace. SIMONA'S CHOICE had good early speed, offered a mild bid two wide before a half, chased
the winner until deep stretch then weakened. FLAXEN away alertly, set the early pace along the rail, kept pressure into the far turn and was through after six
furlongs.
