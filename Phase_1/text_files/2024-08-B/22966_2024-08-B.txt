Footnotes
LOOKOUT POINT unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the first turn, inched closer along the backstretch run, was taken off of the rail entering the
far turn, swung four wide leaving the furlong marker, rallied nicely in the stretch drive, surged in the late stages and got up in the final strides for a
determined win. CITY OF CHAMPIONS assumed command away from the start, dictated terms into the first turn and was well handled through modest
fractions into the backstretch run, was pressured into the far turn, repelled OUR EMPIRE into upper stretch and was clear with a sixteenth to go, was all out
in deep stretch and was tagged by his stablemate for the win, while clear of the rest for second. ROYAL JESTER settled off of the early pace while never far
back, tracked outside of an inner rival into the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and chased from the inside into upper stretch, needed more in
the late stages and was clear of the rest for third. OUR EMPIRE raced close up to the moderate pace, made a middle move to challenge the pacesetter
along the backstretch run, lost position into the far turn and weakened in the stretch drive. RIVER'S BEHEST allowed to settle, had a bit of trouble into the
first turn and lost ground along the bend, trailed through the backstretch run and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
ACCLIDER allowed to settle in the early stages while not far back, was well placed while saving ground into the backstretch run, roused into the far turn,
split rivals at the furlong marker and took command into the stretch, kicked clear at the sixteenth-pole and pulled away in the late stages to prevail as much
the best. TOO TALL TO CALL sent to assume the early lead, set a pressured pace into the first turn while outside of an inner rival, set the contested pace
along the backstretch run, was confronted by ACCLIDER at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner in the stretch and held safely in the
end for second. WE GOT SWAG hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early stages and was content to trail into the
backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and improved position at the quarter marker, was outkicked in the stretch drive and was clear of the rest for
third. MR MEMPHIS broke alertly and vied for the early lead away from the start, saved ground approaching the first turn then drifted out nearing the
three-eighths pole, was taken outside of the pacesetter and contested the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost position into the far turn and
weakened in the stretch drive. DRIVE BY rushed up to be forwardly placed in the early going, drifted four to five wide entering the first turn, maintained an
outside path into the backstretch run and chased the moderate pace heading to the far turn, ran in pursuit four wide nearing the furlong marker, lacked a
response in the late stages and gave way.

GORDY'S BOY well placed in the early stages, got caught a bit in tight while between runners entering the first turn, stalked the modest pace passing the
wire the first time, maintained a two wide path along the second turn and inched closer with a quarter mile to go, mounted a three wide bid at the furlong
pole, took command into the stretch and drew clear in the late stages. MASHHAD FLATS sent to assume the early lead, set a modest pace while clear
passing the wire for the first time, dictated terms into the backstretch run, came under pressure at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the
winner into the final sixteenth and held well for second in the late stages. OH GREAT (IRE) close up while three wide into the first turn, tracked the modest
pace the first time past the wire, chased from the outside through the backstretch run, mounted a two wide bid at the furlong marker, was outkicked in the
final sixteenth and missed for second, while well clear for third. BIG BAD BRIAN chased the modest pace from the inside, could not keep pace into the third
bend and tired in the final furlong. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD lost his path at the start and spotted the field to begin, bore out entering the first turn, trailed into
the second turn and lacked a response in the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
BRONZE GIRL sent leaving the break, assumed early command and set a moderate pace into the first turn, dictated terms while well handled through the
backstretch run, drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was ridden out in the stretch and widened her lead in the late stages to prevail as much the best.
TEASPOON OF PEPPER sharply stumbled at the start and spotted the field to begin, settled while saving ground through the early stages, improved
position two wide into the second turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive but stayed on well into the final sixteenth and was a clear second
best. CHEDOODLE RYLEE forwardly placed away from the start, chased the moderate early pace outside of BRONZE GIRL, attended to the modest pace
through the backstretch run, was outkicked at the furlong marker, weakened in the stretch drive and was outfinished for second. MIGHTY GYPSY settled
outside of runners into the first turn, slipped to the inside entering the backstretch run and chased the leading pair while not far back approaching the second
turn, saved ground to the top of the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
GOLF DRAMA a bit fractious in the starting gate, settled off of the decent early pace and saved ground into the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch
run, angled three wide nearing the furlong marker and was roused into the stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth to overtake SPEEDY TOM and was up in the
final strides for a determined win. SPEEDY TOM was crowded at the start and was away slowly, rushed up in the early stages and contested the pace
outside of SEIGE THE DAY approaching the first turn, assumed command into the backstretch run and set a decent pace heading to the far turn, drew to a
clear lead nearing the furlong marker, was all out to hold off GOLF DRAMA in deep stretch and was overtaken for the win in the final strides, while besting
the rest. DR PESCADO took back off of the early pace, raced two to three wide along the first turn and was hard to place into the backstretch run, chased
two to three wide into the second turn, could not impact the top pair in the stretch drive but finished well and won the head nod for third. SEIGE THE DAY
broke through the gate prior to the start then broke out at the start, vied for the early lead leaving the gate, was hard to place into the first turn and drifted out
a path nearing the three-furlong pole, chased SPEEDY TOM through decent fractions nearing the second turn, lacked a response in the stretch drive and
just missed for third.

Footnotes
BULLETPROOF TOO prominent away from the start, contested the pace outside of ZEPHYR CAT into the first turn, disputed moderate fractions with that
foe along the backstretch run, took command and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was given a tap of the crop in upper stretch and drew away
under hand urging in the late stages to prevail as much the best. TOUGH TO CATCH was a bit slow away from the gate and trailed into the first turn,
improved position along the backstretch run, roused three to four wide along the far turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive but stayed on well
in the final sixteenth to be best of the rest. BRONZE'S FLOWER was squeezed at the start and away a bit slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed
approaching the first turn, was taken outside of rivals into the backstretch run, chased the moderate pace nearing the far turn, weakened in the stretch drive
and held for third at the finish. LOVELY BRIDE broke in at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, settled off of the moderate early pace while not far
back and saved ground into the first turn, lost position and trailed through the backstretch run, lacked a response in the stretch drive and passed a tired
runner in the final sixteenth. ZEPHYR CAT broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, engaged with BULLETPROOF TOO into the first turn
and contested the pace with that rival into the backstretch run, disputed moderate fractions approaching the far turn, could not keep pace nearing the furlong
grounds and faded in the stretch. MAGGIE'S FAYE was bumped at the start and unseated the rider, ran loose the race, was apprehended following the race
and walked off under her own power. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT
MAGGIE'S FAYE CAUSED HER OWN ISSUES AT THE START AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
