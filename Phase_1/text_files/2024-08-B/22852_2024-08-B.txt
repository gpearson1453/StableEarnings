HAUNTRESS dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and finished well. A LIL PSYCHOTIC pressed the
pace, raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. STEPHANIE'S MARIA hopped at the start, raced near the front, was
outfinished for second, but held on for show. MRS. KATZ vied for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and lacked a late kick. CAPELLA RED
raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn and finished evenly. ISLAND GOLD lacked early speed, raced outside around the final
turn, finished wide and was no factor. IM SINGLED UP raced evenly near the back and showed little. SIGNING always raced near the back and was outrun.
SURREY raced near the middle of the pack and retreated.

pack, came around the turn between rivals, made a bid down the lane, finished willingly and was outfinished for the win. VELOCIDAD went to the front,
drove clear, saved ground and was outfinished late by the top two. R AND R STAR lacked early speed, saved ground, showed late interest, but was no
factor. THE LAST CAT raced near the back in the beginning, came around the turn on the outside, moved up and finished evenly. SEEKING A SOLDIER
raced within striking distance, faded and was no threat late. THREE SEVENS vied for the early lead and faded. THE FACT IS raced within contention and
dropped back. R T'S CAJUN pressed the early pace and retreated to the back. PLENNIE LAFAYETTE always raced near the back, came around the turn
on the outside and showed little. JOEY'S FAST PLAY raced in the back, lost contact with the field and walked off.

EASY BET unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the turn, pulled away, ducked in down the lane, steadied and went ahead and
proved much the best. COZY COURTNEY raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second.
ROSIE SPRIT void of early speed, gained ground, racing wide and finished willingly. FIELD OF LIGHTS raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and
hung. TAKEN IT had an awkward start, raced in the back and was never close. FIVE LEAF CLOVER pressed the early pace and faded. CHARGED UP
ROSE went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and dropped back.

BANKROLL vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, stretch bid, best late. ADIEU ACES raced within contention, drove clear down the stretch
and was caught at the wire. TRIPPLE D RULLER broke out, showed early speed, eased back, made a stretch bid, proved no match for the top two, but got
up for third. CALIBRACHOAMATTERS broke out, racing near the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside, made a bid and hung.
CABOCHON TREASURE void of early speed, showed late interest, while racing wide and was no factor. OUR DETERMINATION had a tight start, racing in
the back and passed tired ones. HE'S JUST LUCKY broke in, rushed up, vied for the lead, saved ground around the turn and faded. GUS'S DREAM
WORLD void of early speed, raced outside around the turn and was never close. EMPIRE KID showed early speed and dropped back.

Footnotes

for the early lead, entered the home stretch wide, took the advantage, but proved no match for the winner down the lane. F J'S FLACO showed early speed,
raced close throughout and was outfinished for second. SAUCY ARGUMENT raced in the back of the field, saved ground around the turn and passed tired
ones. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE broke a step slow, rushed up, challenged for the lead and made a steady retreat. PAC THE PULPIT pressed the pace,
dropped back and was outrun.
