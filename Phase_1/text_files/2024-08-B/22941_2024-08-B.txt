TICKET TO THE TOP showed early speed under a snug hold, showed the way through the far turn, and held under pressure. SIR BREGOVIC was
outsprinted to the turn, shifted out three wide, closed gradually and was unable to stall the winner. ALL RUN allowed to settle then shifted out five wide, and
rallied belatedly to earn show. WALKTHELINE broke outward, chased along the rail into the stretch and was bested. READYTOTAPNSING brushed leaving
the backstretch while four wide, and came up empty in the drive.

PLUM BLUE saved ground inside, moved up inside of MINE ME then was roused at the quarter pole, edged clear at the head of the stretch and held. MINE
ME contested the pace while three wide, dueled into the final turn outside of PLUM BLUE, but lacked the rally needed. ECHO CREEK was four to five wide
into the opening turn, tracked four wide through the backstretch and came up empty in the drive. RECIO'S SKYE set the pace and tired early.

SINGING BELL vied inside, shuffled back in the far turn, found running room approaching the stretch and prevailed under a drive. SKIP'S ROCK fanned
four-wide leaving the backstretch, gained a narrow lead into the lane, dueled outside of SINGING BELL and missed after a good effort. MOHAYMEN DAY
sat just off the pace while three wide, and lacked the kick that was needed. NIGHT FLYER lacked a clear path leaving, trailed, and improved position late.
LIGHT FAST FEET rallied belatedly. MAJESTIC HORIZON set a pressured pace, and had nothing left in reserve.

while drifting in, and won the bob. J J'S CAPER contended the early pace, responded to a challenge from MEDELJOHN, was bumped repeatedly and lost
the bob. BARAK trailed early, lodged a rail bid, and finished with good energy. CHARLIE'S COPY bid belatedly. VANTASTICCANAVERAL pressed the
early pace and faded. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of J J'S CAPER against the rider of MENDELJOHN alleging interference in

Footnotes
LEGAL ASSASSIN contested the pace outside of CHASUBLE, brushed rival in the backstretch, drew away in the final turn, and just held under a late drive.
EL CORRECAMINOS brushed gate leaving, stalked the pace four wide entering the backstretch, closed gamely into the stretch and just missed. WORKIN
FOR THE MAN squeezed out at the start, was in tight, and lacked a closing response. PRENTON squeezed out leaving, trailed and bid belatedly. PADDY'S
SPEEDSTER bothered badly leaving, lacked running room inside, steadied and faded. MORE THAN A FLASH bumped leaving, and was not a factor.
CHASUBLE broke outward, bumped rival, vied for the early lead, was brushed in the backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
NO MORE JO KING tracked the pacesetters while four to five wide, was asked to quicken on the final turn, battled gamely through the stretch outside of
BEAUTIFUL BABE, dug in the final yards and prevailed. BEAUTIFUL BABE contended the early pace under a snug hold, drew away in the far turn,
responded gamely to a challenge from NO MORE JO KING, and was outfinished. KEEPMEINPOWER broke outward into QUEEN RHONDA, rallied three
wide into the stretch, and inched clear to earn show. GOLDIE SOCKS sat three to four wide off the early pacesetters, rallied between foes into the stretch
and weakened late. QUEEN RHONDA bumped leaving, chased inside, rallied into the stretch and gave way deep stretch. BEAUTIFUL CALL offered little.
VILLA NOVA flashed early speed while three wide, and yielded.

Footnotes
BUZZINGA KARMA raced five wide into the opening turn, was under a strong-hold into the backstretch, sat just off the pace while three wide, inherited the
lead at the quarter pole, kicked away when given his cue and was ridden out. HANDSOME HENRY was wide through the backstretch, fanned three-wide,
chased determinedly through the stretch but was no match for the winner. LATE NIGHT LIVING jostled leaving, lacked running room in the opening turn, sat
in range while four to five wide, placed a bid into the stretch and held on for show. THISCATSGOTSPEED broke into LATE NIGHT LIVING leaving the gate,
was steadied in traffic entering the first turn, lost ground, and bid belatedly. SILENT COUNT trailed early, and offered a mild interest late. HE'S A SAINT
quickly took command entering the backstretch, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and faded gradually inside. SAWCHUK saved ground inside, and
lacked a kick. OUR SUNSHINE was unable to keep pace with the field.

Footnotes
BLING DANCER returned to the paddock for an equipment adjustment, broke alertly to set the pace, turned back a challenge from DARE TO COMPARE,
was given her cue nearing the eighth pole and opened up willingly. JODEYS LIL PAIN sat in striking distance while four wide, advanced quickly in the final
turn, was roused into the stretch but was no match for the winner and held firm for second. DARE TO COMPARE prompted the pace, was unable to move
on with the eventual winner and was outfinished for place. WHO'S THAT BABY bumped leaving, trailed in the backstretch, and offered a mild rally. OOPS
AND DOWNS raced wide early, mild rally then gave way. BROKEN PROMISES showed little. B B'S WILDFIRE bumped at the start, and offered a late mild
bid. DIAMOND DI chased four wide, and was done early.

DR. DAVE broke in bumping CAPE'S LEGACY, sat just off the pace while two wide, overtook the lead at the quarter pole, kicked away and won handily.
TAYLOR FIELD advanced quickly in the final turn, chased in vain and finished up second best. JUMP THE QUEUE stalked from the rail, chased in the final
turn, and flattened out. TENNESSEE MOSES contested the pace while five wide, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and faded. DOUG'S
HERO late bid. OAK BAY QUALITY failed to threaten. CAPE'S LEGACY bumped early and lacked a bid. HARBOR DANCER flashed early speed and
stopped.
