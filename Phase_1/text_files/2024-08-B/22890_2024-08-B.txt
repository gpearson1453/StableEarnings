Footnotes
GILT EDGE broke outwards on the start, tracked the frontrunner inside after the break, was allowed to settle into stride down the backside, seeing the field
at the half, commenced a run two wide at the quarter pole, swung out in the five path gathering speed, had his sights set on the contesting lead duo at the
furlong marker and easily went past in the final sixteenth to be going away for the win at the finish line. ROLLING ALONG was content to track outside along
the backstretch, moved in three wide to press the issue midway on the turn, battled outside for the lead in the three path at the top of the lane, won that
stretch duel but was no match for the winner on the outside who went by smartly in the final seventy yards. HAWKESBURY seized command from the start,
continued to dictate terms along the backside with little pressure applied by rivals, was headed outside midway around the bend, was holding narrowly onto
the lead dueling in a challenger at the top of the lane, but needed more in deep stretch to threaten and settled for the show money at the wire. OTTAWA
was away a step slow on the break, shifted outside quickly to the three path leaving the chute, prompted the pace under a hold travelling on the rail at the
five furlong pole, shifted back outside in the two path with three eighths remaining, vied between rivals for the lead midturn, could not keep up with the top
two turning for home, was on the wrong lead until deep stretch and held on for a minor share in the end. PROUD RONIN was unhurried to trail in the
beginning, improved going past the eventual winner at the half, kept pace, saving ground on the fence throughout the turn, closed in on the fence in upper
stretch to fight for a minor share but lacked a finish in the final furlong.

STEAK AND CHEESE seized the lead under a snug hold entering the first of two turns, set the pace while hounded outside along the backside, continued to
have a slim advantage around the final bend and stubbornly fought to the wire in the stretch drive to prevail at the finish line. HANK OLLIE broke out on the
start, settled just behind the pacesetter in the first turn, moved to the outside to force the pace down the backstretch, continued to shadow the frontrunner
outside in the final turn, fought on determinedly outside up front down the lane but was denied by a game winner in the end. TOO MUCH TALK had a
tracking trip on the rail throughout, was hard ridden but was making no advancement on the front pair on the final turn, dueled stubbornly inside for the third
money down the stretch and got up by a nose at the wire. TARANTO TITAN tracked outside in the first turn, travelled in the second flight, watch the front
duo while outside a foe down the backstretch, was roused but could not gain on the lead pair around the final bend, battled outside for the show award down
the entire stretch but was nosed out at the wire and settled on the fringes. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY settled on the rail near the back of the pack, had a stalking
position on the fence along the back straight, offered a brief run two wide between rivals at the quarter pole, could not continue on in the lane and stalled at
the furlong marker. CLASSY WHISPER travelled in midfield, stalked outside in the third flight, made no headway through the far turn and failed to menace in
the stretch. MEHLEK was off a step slow to begin, trailed in the beginning, made an early move getting a better rail position at the half, kept pace with rivals
on the fence throughout the final bend, skimmed the rail turning for home but had no finish to offer inside. A ROSE FOR RAVEN hopped slightly on the
break, settled near the rear outside foes in the early going, trailed the field at the half, made little headway travelling four wide around the far turn, swung out
to the six path for the drive but could not be a factor in the stretch running.

Footnotes
NOTORIOUS GANGSTER broke out on the break, was three deep ahead of only the poor starter down the backside, started to rally when splitting rivals
midway around the turn, shifted outside three wide at the quarter pole gathering momentum, swung out to the five path for the drive and found his best
stride late and got up in the shadow of the wire for the win. MEGALODON tracked outside in the backstretch, was shuffled back some to stalk three wide on
the outside in the turn, made a quick move around foes three wide at the five sixteenths pole, battled for the lead outside in upper stretch, poked his head in
front for a moment at the sixteenth pole but was caught by the winner very late. CRUCIAL TAUNT had a tracking role on the fence in the early stages,
moved in midway on the turn two wide, briefly had control in the three path between horses in upper stretch, dueled inside down to the wire, gave way to the
top two in the final sixteenth on the fence and easily held for the show award in the end. TEMPLE HALL broke sharply for the lead, set the pace while eager
in the early going, opened up on the field at the three eighths marker, was collared outside straightening out for home, fought on inside until the eighth pole
but faded late for a minor role. SUGAR BUZZ stumble and broke inwards on the start to travel near the back of the pack in the beginning, took closer order
going the shortest way around on the turn, shifted outside to be four wide in range of the leaders turning for home but evened out at the furlong marker and
could not threaten late. DOUBLE RIDE had a poor beginning, when taken hold off due to the outside rival who broke inwards at the start, trailed along the
backside, caught up to rival travelling on the rail at the half, took the short way around running evenly on the turn and was one paced in the stretch on the
fence. COLCHESTER travelled alone in midfield, stalked in the third flight between horses on the turn, could not match strides with others who were making
a move at the quarter pole and came up empty for the stretch drive. COCO COOL stalked three deep on the outside down the back straight, had little
interest and was relegated to last while three wide with five sixteenths to go, shifted to the tree path for the drive but failed to fire in the lane. TIGER TOWN
prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, tracked outside at the three-furlong marker, backed away abruptly by midturn and galloped home.

LEGAL CATCH soon led, was pressured by an outside foe racing just off the fence and headed by that one, retook a narrow lead heading to the far turn,
dueled from the five-sixteenths, edged away late and just held from another rival closing late. SILENT SUNDAY broke outwardly, was forwardly-positioned
stalking five then four wide, dropped back after a half, shifted in late on the far turn then back out in upper stretch, had aim and came again in a second
effort but was too late and missed. SOUPER WATSON was forwardly-placed four wide into the turn moving in three wide and forcing the pace having put a
short head in front, was relegated to second heading into the far turn, re-engaged the inside foe to duel from the five-sixteenths, yielded late. LUCKMAN
broke awkwardly bumping a rival and steadying slightly, unhurriedly brought up the rear, saved some ground, was rallying strongly inside in the lane but was
too late. GRANDE SOIREE stalked about mid-pack from off the fence mostly in the two to three path, swung out four wide advancing past the quarter pole
entering upper stretch in range five deep and under urging, flattened out in the lane. FAN CLUB was caught mostly four to five wide in the early going, made
an early advance up the backstretch outside runners to reach striking distance heading into the far turn, dropped back and faded thereafter. HAVE IT MY
WAY raced between foes four then three wide through the first turn, was still forced wide into the far turn going four then five deep on that bend and under
urging before the top of the stretch, failed to threaten. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE saved ground but was never a threat.

Footnotes
JUST FOLLOW ME rated kindly on the fence in mid-pack down the backstretch, was scrubbed on in the turn seeing the field, swung outside in the six path
starting to reach for more ground, was full of run outside at the furlong pole and got up in the last few jumps for the victory. LITTLE TEDDY broke outwards
on the start, tracked the front duo onside a rival down the back straight, was shuffled back under a tight hold at the seven sixteenths marker, had a quick
turn of foot when asked, shifting out three wide at the quarter pole, began to wear down the leaders in the four path in upper stretch, briefly held the lead
with rivals on both sides at the sixteenth pole but just could not fend of the winners late charge. TABLOID MATERIAL assumed the lead while in hand,
comfortably taking this field down the backside, was loose on the lead with no challengers around the turn, was collared late at the sixteenth pole outside,
offered no resistance to the top two but did fight on to save third money at the wire. RED SAMURAI broke in a tangle to begin, had a tracking position three
deep outside watching the front two, shadowed the pacesetter outside at the half, moved closer chasing the frontrunner around the bend, loomed two wide
turning for home but needed more in the last eighth to threaten at the wire and settled on the fringes instead. JUST MAGNIFICENT was off a step slow to
begin, trailed three deep in the beginning, made an early move outside foes at the half, was roused for more in the two path in midturn to go after the lead
pair, was in the fray three wide at the top of the lane but evened out in the final furlong. YOU BE THE JUDGE settled near the rear inside, stalked three wide
between foes at the back by the half, was going in the wrong direction four wide through the turn and could only pass a weary foe in deep stretch. VANDOO
pressed the pace inside at the start, sat behind the pacesetter down the backstretch, was scrubbed on the fence but could not keep up on the turn with
others and yielded on the rail at the furlong marker.

JUNIOR HOT SHOT pressed the pace, bid at the five-sixteenths, moved clear by upper stretch, held off a rival under steady urging. YACHT BOY hopped
slightly at the start, settled last but one, advanced four wide between runners on the turn coming out six wide by upper stretch, kept on late and closed the
gap but needed more. GAROFOLI broke outwardly, settled off the pace outside, went about five wide through the turn, came out a few paths further for the
stretch run, ran on evenly late. COOLER MAN broke inwardly bumping a rival, unhurriedly brought up the rear, shifted out at the quarter pole swinging six
wide into upper stretch, ran on but needed more. SUMMER COMMANDER stalked from outside four wide, was within range coming to the quarter pole but
flattened out in the stretch. VALYRIAN SKY pursued the leaders from mid-pack racing mostly three wide, swung out five deep leaving the turn, failed to rally.
CRIMINAL INTENT broke awkwardly and was bumped at the start, made an early advance inside, saved ground on the turn into upper stretch and faded.
SPEEDEEMAN moved forward to the lead soon after the start, set a moderately pressured pace off the rail, was overtaken late on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
OUTLAW KID settled close to the back three deep ahead of a couple on runners down the backside, began to lengthen stride smartly three wide moving
around rivals at the three-furlong pole, moved in confidently four wide turning for home, powered past the leaders effortlessly at the sixteenth pole and won
under a hand ride at the wire. FORESTER'S FORTUNE had only one rival beaten while settling on the rail down the backside, was checked when trying to
advance on the fence nearing the three furlong pole losing momentum, shifted outside to re-rally three wide at the quarter pole, swung five wide for the drive
to the wire, had plenty of run in the stretch and got up at the finish line to best the rest for the place award. LIGHT THE LAMP had an ideal position on the
rail, alone watching the engaged duo down the backstretch, started to edge closer to the contesting pair midway through the turn, angled out three wide for
clear run in the stretch, keep on closing in but was outkicked by the winner and just missed saving for the place share. ROCKCREST dueled for the lead
when hustled from the start, battled on the fence bobbing heads with the other speed foe for the lead through the turn, put away the early speed rival to
spurt clear midway down the stretch, fought on gamely on the rail but faded late to settle for a minor role. MASON'S GAMBLE trailed the field along the
backside, travelled three wide on the turn but made no progress seeing the field and finished up with some interest to pass weary foes in the final sixteenth
of a mile. DADDY SEND MONEY settled in mid-division outside rivals, made little presence while saving the ground around the turn and had little to show in
the stretch running. SILENT RESERVE had a slim lead on the outside down the backstretch, dueled neck and neck up front outside the other rival
throughout the turn, gave way up front turning for home, wilted in the two path by the furlong marker and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
SOUPER SUPREME was lightly bumped at the start, soon made the lead, set the pace from off the inside, drew off when asked, held safe. SKYLIGHT
CAPER broke outwardly, settled off the pace, advanced outside foes passing the half, went mostly five to seven wide, was no match for the winner but
secured the place. PERIWINKLE was bumped into a rival at the start, raced in the back half off the rail, entered the turn three deep and under urging,
angled seven to eight wide at the top of the stretch, gained late. PRINCESS OF STORM broke awkwardly then angled in just off the inside bringing up the
rear, made a swift early advance inside foes then had to tap on the brakes about the half dropping back to last, moved out fanning nine wide into upper
stretch, kept on while widest. SCARY SPEEDY stalked mostly four to five wide, was in range turning for home but lacked the needed late kick. I LOVE TO
WIN advanced in tandem with and inside a rival past the half racing four to six wide, evened out for the drive. SERIOUS GREEN was off the pace between
foes into the turn, went four to five wide on that bend mostly, shifted seven deep turning for home, altered course in upper stretch guided to the rail, ran on
inside. DANCIN MARY MARIE chased from mid-pack off the inside two to three wide, weakened. SOUPERGIRL chased from outside three to four wide,
weakened. TABEI bumped the outside rival at the start, was coaxed forward inside near the leader, taken hold of about the five-eighths easing back off the
pacesetter tracking in behind, saved ground on the turn, came up empty.

SCORCHING was away alertly to dictate terms up front unchallenged down the backside, cruised around the turn with the rider statuesque in the saddle,
was finally set down when encouraged right-handed in mid-stretch and drew away impressively late for the front end score. KEKOA had a rail position in
mid-pack, shifted out making a quick move three wide passing foes with five sixteenths to go, shifted in from the three path to the rail at the furlong marker
reaching for more ground and closed belatedly to be second best. SHADOW REALM was antsy prior to the start, settled in midfield outside foes in the
beginning, edged closer when under a ride midway on the turn, shifted out six wide turning for home and with a good late kick almost closed in to capture
second money at the wire. AWESOME RAINBOW was off a step slow to be ahead of only the other poor starter after the break, had to be checked mildly
entering the backstretch, began to pass runners outside with three furlongs to go, continued the sustain run four wide at the quarter pole, angled to the six
path for the stretch running, was checked again when an inside rival came out in upper stretch, drifted in under right handed encouragement in the lane but
finished up with intent for a minor share. MAGIC POWER improved outside down the backstretch to track the front two by the half, moved in three wide at
the quarter pole off the flank of the leader, dueled in the four path for the place share in upper stretch, had little left and faded with a sixteenth to run.
TIERNAN pressed the pace outside down the backstretch, was scrubbed with five sixteenths from home but could not gain on the leader by the quarter
pole, was in range for a piece of the prize three wide at the top of the lane by weakened in the two path in the final sixteenth of a mile. KOKOMO tracked the
lead duo on the fence in the early going, was roused on the rail in the turn, had to be steadied sharply in tight losing his path with five sixteenths remaining,
shifted out three wide at the top of the lane but could not offer a finish in the final furlong to pose a threat. CARNEW stalked three deep near the rea on the
outside of rivals, made little headway on the turn though roused in the two path with three furlongs to go, angled out five wide for the drive but failed to
menace in the stretch run. LOVER BOY MO broke in to begin, tracked with rivals on both sides in the second flight down the back straight, shifted in, to the
fence by midturn keeping pace with the lead group, was in range on the rail in upper stretch but yielded inside at the sixteenth pole. CHARTED MAP was
under a hold between rivals in midfield at the five eighths marker, was shuffled back with three furlongs remaining, made no progress when urged on the rail
around he bend and could not reach contention in the stretch running. CHASING MEMORIES leapt up at the start to trail the field along the backside,
caught up to the pack by the three-furlong marker, could not offer any more in the stretch and was not involved in the running down the lane.

Footnotes
TWIN CITY was well-placed tracking in behind the leaders into the turn, edged nearer and lacked room in behind and inside foes at the quarter pole, came
out four wide in upper stretch, rallied between runners coming to furlong marker, struck the lead soon after and held under continued urgnig. CLAYTON
settled off the pace, was between foes on the turn, swung out six wide turning for home, drew closer to make a mild bid under urging near the eighth pole,
was no match for the winner but held place. PALIO lacked early speed racing at the back off the inside, moved out gradually late on the turn in behind and
inside foes, altered seven wide in upper stretch for room and finished well to be steadily gaining but too late. HUNT MASTER had the very early lead but
ceded that to press from outside, took the lead three deep about the five-sixteenths, led to mid-stretch, lacked the needed late kick. PERFECT CRIME broke
a step slowly, moved forward inside, saved ground, went evenly. BOSTON TEA PARTY stalked from outside, came into upper stretch four to five wide
looming a threat, flattened out. BLAST IN THE SNOW broke a step slowly, raced outside toward the back, fanned eight wide, failed to menace. FIGHTER IN
THE WIN settled off the pace going three to four wide on the turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch, failed to threaten. POULIN IN O T moved forward
inside to the lead nearing the five- and one-half to force the pace, set the tempo from inside a rival but off the fence, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
RAPID GREY stalked between runners in the third flight in the first turn, improved along the backside to track the lead duo outside by the half, moved in
sharply three wide at the quarter pole, went on past easily in the five path nearing the sixteenth pole and was going away for the win when crossing the
finish line. POLITICAL WARFARE was coaxed early on to get the lead on the rail into the first turn, continued up top with only mild pressure from an outside
foe along the backside, was clinging onto the lead in the three path with rivals moving in outside in upper stretch, could not fend off the winner at the
sixteenth pole while on the rail but did determinedly stay on the best the rest at the wire. APOPHIS veered out on the break, tracked three wide in the first
turn, moved closer to hound the pace outside down the backstretch and far turn, was in the hunt up front in the four path between rivals in upper stretch,
was no match for the winner who had another gear by mid-stretch, finished up willingly to save third money while still trying to close in for the place share in
the end. RIDEAU HALL settled on the rail near the rear at the start, shifted off the rail entering the turn, had a couple of rivals beaten down the backstretch,
was hard ridden going around foes midway on the far turn, angled out five wide straightening for home, kept on coming through the stretch and almost
closed in to capture third money at the wire. TUTTI CONTENTI travelled in midfield on the rail in the early stages of the race, had to wait for a moment on
the fence at the five sixteenths pole behind a backing up rival, shifted outside in the two path to go around at the quarter pole, dueled for a minor share on
the rail in the stretch but was outfinished late. WELLER GREEN was checked for a moment between runners in the two path entering the first turn while
near the rear, had one rivals beaten down the backside, closed the gap around the final turn in the three path, shifted outside runners four wide at the
furlong pole and finished with purpose late. BEYOND ADVERSITY settled three wide in the first turn travelling in midfield, continued in mid-pack three deep
down the backside, was roused three wide at the three eighths marker to edge closer to the leader around the final bend to be in the mix for a piece of the
prize in upper stretch but could not find more in the lane and stalled at the furlong pole. STOKE THE FIRE was part of the trailing pair three wide outside
into the first turn, could see the field along the backside and never could get involved around the far turn to be a factor in the stretch running. WAR EMPIRE
had a good position early just sitting behind the pacesetter in the first turn, tracked on the rail down the backstretch, was urged on the fence by midturn,
offered no response and retreated on the fence by the quarter pole.
