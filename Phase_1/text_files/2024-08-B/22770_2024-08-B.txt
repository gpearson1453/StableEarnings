past the leader and cleared the field in the final stages. TEMPTING LADY bobbled at the start and raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane,
rallied down the lane and was just up for place at the wire. MISS ESCAPADE stalked the pace early on, made a bid nearing the lane, was in the five path
into the lane, drew clear in the stretch but faltered late and lost place at the wire. STREETS OF PARIS was steadied early on along the backstretch, chased
the pace through the turn, was in the six path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. LADY ROBO set the pace early on,
raced in the three path into the lane and gave way in the stretch run. ELLIOTT MOON chased the pace early on, raced in the three path into the lane and
faded late in the stretch drive. SHE'S IT tracked the pace early, raced in the five path into the lane and was empty down the lane. CHARLINA was never a

ALWAYS FOREVER tracked the pace early from the inside, was in the three path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. RATHER
DISTINCT was bumped at the start, raced two wide along the first turn and back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch
drive. LES IS BEST chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and improved position late in the stretch drive. SERVING TIME (GB) was
bumped at the start, tracked the pace early two wide, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. EL JOURY set the pace early,
raced in the two path into the lane and gave way down the lane. BOUTWELL TIME was never a factor. ADDED TOUCH trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
WINDY BAY hopped at the start, chased the pace early on, made a bid from between horses nearing the lane, was in the two path into the lane, took over
command in the stretch and drew clear under a steady drive. LITTLE SISTER SUE trailed the field early on, raced in the three path into the lane, made a bid
down the lane and chased the winner in the late stages. HIGH FASHION KATE set the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the
stretch run. SACRED SAINT was unhurried early on, raced in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. ITSABLINGTHING bobbled at
the start, tracked the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane but faded in the stretch. EVIE'S ENCORE was a tad slow at the start and never a
factor. BELLA CRUELLA had early speed then folded up. SHERBET FOUNTAIN was through after a half.

Footnotes
LIAM THE BRAVE bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path, came under a ride in the four path entering the far turn, bumped with an
inner foe while swinging from the six path into the lane, but rallied to draw past the inner leader in the final sixteenth. PERUVIAN LUCKY prompted the pace
in the four path down the backside, bid between foes while two wide midway around the far turn, kicked on to take the lead in the three path passing the
eighth pole, but was caught in the closing stages by an outer foe to place. PICO D'ORO bumped at the start with an outer foe, rated in the two path, got
stymied passing the quarter, angled out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and ran on for show. JUNGLE CAT tracked in the three path, was roused
between foes two wide midway around the far turn, bumped with an outer foe from the five path in upper stretch, tipped back to the three path, but finished
evenly. LAUGH A LOT stalked in the five path, bid three wide around the far turn, took the lead from the four path at the top of the lane, but flattened in final
furlong. WOODCOCK FLIGHT (IRE) laid up close inside, waited along the rail around the far turn, was coaxed while angling out to the four path at the top of
the stretch, but got herded in passing the eighth pole, then weakened. CASHMEUP had a slow start, raced wellbck in the three path, fanned out to the eight
path at the top of the lane, but never threatened. COTE D'IVOIRE was unhurried in the two path early, received a right handed cue along the rail midway
around the far turn, but got stymied along the rail in upper stretch, then steadied around the sixteenth and failed to menace. THREE ON THE TREE got a bit
keen around the first turn to set the pace just off the rail turning into the backstretch, but gaveay in the two path at the top of the lane.
