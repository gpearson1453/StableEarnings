CODE CHARLIE dueled with CM ONCE INA BLUEMOON for the lead to the stretch and proved best under strong handling. MISTER MAFIOSO was
forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished strongly. MEANT FOR ME was allowed to settle, rallied two-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild
rally. D K'S CROWN settled in the middle of the field early, rallied seven-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. CAPITAL EXPENSE was reserved off
the early pace, rallied six-wide the final quarter but was unable to seriously threaten. CONRAD MEADOWS was prominently placed while racing three-wide
and weakened. CM ONCE INA BLUEMOON dueled for the lead from along the inside and tired. ATTA BOY LLOYD was seven-wide on the turn and
eight-wide entering the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TIA SUZI saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased her advantage. MANY MEMORIES was prominent on the turn while racing four-wide,
angled to the inside nearing the eighth pole and finished well for second. LINCHPIN'S LOCKET was close-up early racing along the inside, steadied nearing
the three-eighths pole in tight, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and rallied late. ENGAGING SOUL was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the
stretch and was gaining late. SHILSHOLE BAY was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the stretch then went evenly late, was unsaddled on the turn and
transported off the track via the equine ambulance. SUMTHINTOTALKABOUT saved ground while dropping back early failed to seriously threaten.
PLEASANT IMPACT was prominently placed early while racing two-wide and tired. DANCING IN CABO was off a step slow then moved up between horses
while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole and then faltered during the drive.
