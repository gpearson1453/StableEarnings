IN MY MEMORIES chased the pace, bid two wide at the quarter pole, closed steadily outside in the final furlong and wore down the leader in the final yards.
NO NEED TO ASK set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled inside into the stretch, dug in gamely on the rail in the final sixteenth and was caught
nearing the wire. FEEL THE BOLT was outrun early, moved up midway on the turn and bested the others. SIMSARA chased inside, chased on the turn,
drifted wide at the quarter pole and tired. ADE chased inside, checked sharply in tight entering the turn, then failed to threaten.

pace inside, came five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. PURE MAGIC GIRL raced off the pace inside, chased two wide on the turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
SIX THE HARD WAY tracked along the inside, saved ground up the back stretch, waited for room to clear leaving the three eighths marker, when readied
drew off with ease. MY BOSS LADY lacked speed around the first turn, unhurried down the backside, upped the tempo in upper stretch, raced in the five
path nearing the furlong marker, was second best today. NURSE RACHETT under urging soon after the start, found the front around the club house turn,
vied along the inside down the backside, lost the lead leaving the three eights marker, and flattened out to the wire. STYLISH ANNA tracked the pace from
the two path, vied on the front end into the far turn, in hand took the lead around the far turn, asked for more in upper stretch, gave way to the wire.
INCONTROVERTIBLE lacked speed away from the gate, chased along near the rear of the field, had no response late.
