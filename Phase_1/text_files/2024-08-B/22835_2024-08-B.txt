Footnotes
OUR LAST CHANCE held a slim lead racing under pressure from WILDATLANTICSTORM up the backstretch, vied inside around the turn, shook clear at
the head of the lane, had plenty left in reserve and pulled away from the field under steady encouragement. ANNUAL BUDGET tracked the top pair up the
backstretch, was ridden along in pursuit of the leaders around the turn, ran on three wide into the lane and secured second best. ROCKIN THE DAD BOD
raced off the top trio in early stages, hustled up four wide around the turn, briefly drifted a path wider entering the head of the lane, shifted in a couple paths
under right handed pressure and gained show. MINECRAFT MANIAC raced in the back although never too far from the frontend, saved ground into upper
stretch, tipped out a path and failed to kick on. WILDATLANTICSTORM was away in good order and quickly angled over to apply pace pressure to OUR
LAST CHANCE, vied outside of aforementioned rival around the turn, could not not sustain bid at the head of the lane and steadily weakened.

Footnotes
LONG NECK PAULA was forwardly placed three wide in the opening quarter, let out a notch and moved up to match strides mid-way around the turn, took
over the lead in hand at the upper stretch, shook the reins just past the furlong marker, drew off willingly, raced in hand the final sixteenth then finished
wrapped up. GLEE rated in range while saving ground through early stages, hustles up two wide into upper stretch, ran on with response and finished
second best. LITTLE POISON dueled outside of MARITIME MILLIE up the backstretch then took on the challenge of LONG NECK PAULA mid-way around
the turn, was no match for eventual winner at the head of the lane, chased to the furlong marker then steadily weakened and remained clear for show.
UNSPOKEN TRUTH raced off the early pace, hustled along four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position without threatening the top trio.
GUNITE MAX was ridden along off the early pace, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. MARITIME MILLIE dueled inside
of LITTLE POISON for the lead up the backstretch, weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. MILLIE'S STARDUST chased along the
inside in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SASSY B KEEN tracked the early pace along the inside, tipped two wide and advanced near the quarter pole, took over the lead in upper stretch and
finished going away. COUNTY JAIL raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, finished with response and captured place.
TACTICAL REBEL settled through early stages, was ridden along two wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and grabbed a share. BAD BOY
BRAWNY hustled up out of the gate and set a pressured pace, edged away around the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner past upper stretch
and flattened out. OXFORD OUTING raced outside in the second flight going by the half mile marker, hustled along five wide into upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick for impact. SPIRITED DREAM raced off the early pace, cut the corner entering the upper stretch, tipped two wide and lacked a needed
rally. DO IT LIKE KEVIN tracked in contention up the backstretch, chased three to four wide around the turn then weakened in the lane. BOBULINSKI
pressed the pace up the backstretch, flattened mid-way around the turn and faded in the lane.
