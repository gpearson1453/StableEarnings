Footnotes
ROBERT'S MOON showed the way as an outer rival prompted into and around the turn, shook free of that one entering the final furlong, drove clear and
held sway. CAPTAIN FANCY brushed with rivals on both sides soon after the start, tracked two wide and between horses, chased inside of foes while
staying on in the final furlong and reached place at the wire. GERALDRAYDAPLEGRAY prompted outside of the eventual winner around the turn, yielded to
that one at the furlong grounds, then lost place to an inner rival while saving show from outer bidders at the wire. STASHU stalked four to three wide,
pursued outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, sustained stride to bid for place with rivals on either side approaching the wire, but missed. VERY BOLD
broke slowly while last away, trailed in the two path into the turn, gained ground in the three path between horses turning for home before swinging five wide
entering the lane, leaned in before tipping back outside of rivals in midstretch, stayed on willingly late but missed a minor share. MR. COLOSSAL brushed
with an inner rival early on, laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three path into the lane and pursued one paced between horses. HOTLINE
BLINK broke slowly, pursued from the four path and failed to factor. TAP ME A SONG pursued from midpack three wide, chased in teh four path around the
turn, got floated six wide by an inner rival nearing the lane and tired. DANCER'S SHADOW broke a beat slow, lacked speed while hung in the six path and
made little impact. ENJOY THE GAME brushed with an outer rival soon after the start, stalked forwardly along the inside and faded. MISTER BABY chased
five wide into the turn, then faded between rivals turning for home.

Footnotes
EAST SHORE laid off of the pace in the two path, closed in on the leaders around the far turn, split foes to offer a three wide bid between horses entering
the lane and drove clear. EYES OF GOLD forwardly place two wide, pursued the top pair from within striking range in the three path around the far turn, but
got floated four wide before bidding along with an inner rival entering the lane, got outkicked by that one in upper stretch, yet ran on to be second best.
KRICKLE prompted three to two wide into the backstretch, gained an advantage nearing the five sixteenths pole, but offered little resistance to a pair of
outer challenges entering the lane, yielded yet lasted for show. TANGO ZULU raced at the rear in the three path, surpassed tiring rivals turning for home,
then moved up to reach fourth late but failed to threaten the top pair. UP ON THE EDGE set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer prompter
nearing the five sixteenths pole and weakened. CUMBERLAND FALLS tracked along the inside but faded around the far turn. THE BIG CALHOUNA
stumbled severely and almost dislodged his rider at the start, pursued four to three wide, then weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
BATON ROUGE was hustled forward after a flat-footed beginning to show the way into the first turn, remained in hand as an outer prompter came under
urging to sustain position around the far turn, inched clear of that one entering the lane and held sway. CORNISHMAN bumped with an inner rival nearing
and entering the first turn, tracked four wide, moved forward to press three deep into the backstretch, came under urging to sustain pressure outside of the
leader and from the three path into the far turn, failed to keep pace entering the lane, yet sustained stride to prove second best. NATIVE SHAMAN laid off of
the pace two wide, improved position entering the far turn, pursued along the inside to edge show from an outer rival entering the lane, shifted out in upper
stretch and chased the top pair home. FIRST OF HIS NAME was bumped between horses entering the first turn, tracked from the three path, chased the
top pair form the four path around the far turn, got floated out in upper stretch and gave way. INDY MAGIC was hung five wide into the first turn, dropped
back to trail around that bend, moved out of last into the far turn and failed to menace. MY BROTHER KEITH bumped with an outer rival entering the first
turn, stalked outside of the leader early on, pursued the top pair from the two path down the backstretch, but came under strong urging with nine sixteenths
to go, chased into the far turn and weakened. MO RHODES broke a step slow while last away at the start, saved ground off of the pace but was through
early.

Footnotes
REAGAN'S FLAME sped clear early on, showed the way unchallenged around the turn, but was collared by an outer bidder at the quarter pole, got narrowly
headed by that one entering the lane, fought back to reclaim an advantage in the final furlong and drove clear with a sixteenth to go. SISTER KISSES
brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, tracked the clear leader from the four to three path into the turn, bid outside of that one at the quarter pole,
forged a narrow advantage entering the lane, but was turned away in the final furlong and proved second best. THESE APPLES laid off of the pace in the
six path and outside of rivals, took closer order to gain show while tucking to the four path at the three furlong pole, the willingly pursued the top pair through
the final furlong to prove best of the rest. PARTY broke half a beat slow, raced at the rear early on, improved position in the six path around the turn to claim
fourth at the quarter pole, but failed to threaten the top trio. RED HOT JEANIE broke a step slow and was last away, laid off of the pace along the inside,
shifted to the two to three path around the bend before moving to the four path entering the lane, tipped out further leaving upper stretch and failed to factor.
PLUM TRICKY grazed an inner rival upon leaving the gate, pursued from midpack in the five path and between horses, tucked down to the three path while
yielding nearing the lane and faded between horses. LUCY GOT GAME brushed between horses at the start, pursued from the three path before dropping
back into the turn, saved ground around the bend and tired. FROSTY AFFAIR brushed an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the clear leader early on,
gave way in the two path around the turn and faltered between horses nearing the lane.

EAST AVENUE showed the way along the inside, built a clear margin with five sixteenths to go, then widened under strong hand urging. POPPA ECHO
bolted outwardly many paths and carried an outer rival with him at the start, recovered to track three wide while forwardly placed, dueled with an inner rival
for place into and through the lane and prevailed. CAMPAIGN TRAIL stalked two wide and between horses, proved no match for the eventual winner turning
for home, sparred for place with an outer foe through the lane but was bested. BUILT laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path turning for home
before fanning to the six path into upper stretch, and improved outside of rivals. SPEECHLESS was severely hampered by an inner rival while forced out
many paths at the start, laid off of the pace four wide, crept closer around the turn, pursued in the five path into upper stretch and flattened out without
threatening. EXUBERANT MISCHIEF pursued from midpack in the two path, surpassed a tiring rival before chasing along the inside into the lane, and
lacked a bid. RAVENS DREAM pursued from midpack three wide and between horses, but failed to factor among foes. OUT OF THE CLOUDS trailed in the
five to six path and made little impact. GREATDAYFORHOCKEY saved ground off of the pace to no avail. WINDTALKER stalked along the inside, then
weakened with five sixteenths to go. THE RIDER OF SPEECHLESS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST CAMPAIGN TRAIL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE
START. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS INQUIRY, CAMPAIGN TRAIL WAS DISQUALIFED AND PLACED FIFTH.

SANCTIFY saved ground off of the pace, shifted out five wide at the furlong grounds, then rallied between horses to reel in the leader in the closing stages.
TOASTED ROLL showed the way along the inside, met an outer challenge entering the lane, gamely held sway into the final sixteenth, but was collared by
an outer bidder in the closing stages and narrowly saved place. EGYPTIAN CANDY bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid well back two wide, shifted
to the four path entering the lane before fanning six wide nearing midstretch, rallied with an inner rival in the final furlong, but was outkicked by that one in
the late stages, sustained progress willingly and missed reaching place. BEST KISS YET pressed outside of the leader, bid entering the lane, but was
staved off through midstretch, got outkicked by outer rivals in the final sixteenth and missed place among foes. TWIRL AROUND stalked in the three path
before tucking to the inside entering the backstretch, saved ground in pursuit while awaiting racing room behind the leader nearing the lane, but only
managed to chase through the final furlong and lacked a bid. LIVI ME DREAMING tracked two to three wide, inched closer four wide entering the lane, but
flattened out in the final furlong and got outkicked late. DETERMINED CANDY tracked along the inside, then two wide down the backstretch, chased in the
three path and between horses entering the lane but lacked a kick. STERLING LUCK broke a beat slow and bumped with an outer rival while last away at
the start, trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
FIRMUS tracked the leading trio from the three to four path, bid four deep entering the lane, drove clear passing the furlong grounds and held sway.
COCKTAILSNKRINGLE pursued from midpack two wide into the turn, crept closer before awaiting racing room between horses entering the lane, brushed
his way to the three path in upper stretch, changed leads passing the furlong grounds, rallied to reach place at the sixteenth pole and closed in on the clear
leader late. DESERT AIRE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, led narrowly turning for home, but was headed by an outer bidder in upper
stretch, lost place while yielding at the sixteenth pole yet lasted for show. PIQUANT laid off of the pace in the three to two path, swung out to the six path in
upper stretch and stayed on willingly. BORROWED TIME prompted three deep, vied around the turn, but got outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane,
took light contact from an inner foe in upper stretch and faded. BYE BYE MILES vied for the lead with an outer pair of rivals into the turn, got headed turning
for home, then weakened through the final furlong. BIG WALK trailed early on, advanced in the five path around the turn, but emptied out entering upper
stretch. PREPOSITION lacked speed along the inside, trailed around the bend, shifted out entering the lane and made little impact. SHOTGUN pursued off
of the pace in the four path and failed to factor. WAR AND MAJESTY broke a beat slow while last away, then was outrun in the two path. SILENT BREEZE
stalked along the inside, but gave way with three furlongs to go and weakened.

HIGGINS BOAT stalked behind the leaders and from the two path, bided time while awaiting racing room turning for home, remained short of room behind
the leaders in upper stretch, issued a rail bid passing the furlong grounds, edged an advantage in the final sixteenth and held from an outer bidder. WILL
TAKE IT pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, tracked three to four path around the far turn, chased while getting floated to the six path at
the furlong grounds, yet sustained a late rally to gain place in the closing stages, but was denied reeling in the leader. HAMMERSTEIN showed the way
along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, but was headed by a rail bidder in the final furlong, yielded between foes late yet narrowly saved
show. FORTUNE SELLER laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the seven path and between horses passing the furlong grounds, offered a late
kick but missed show. TWO BEERS BY TEN tracked three wide, took closer order before stalking outside of the top pair around the far turn, chased while
drifting to the five path in midstretch, then lacked a bid between horses. SOVEREIGNS JOY pressed three to two wide, vied around the far turn, sustained
the battle three wide into the final furlong, but was outkicked between horses late. PURE POETRY pursued from midpack along the inside, then two wide
and between horses, turning for home, shifted four wide at the furlong grounds but lacked a rally between horses. SAN SIRO trailed in the two to three path,
then four to five wide around the far turn, got floated to the eight path in midstretch and failed to factor.

Footnotes
MULTITASK laid off of the pace in the two to three path, rallied between horses in midstretch, bid inside of the leader leaving the sixteenth pole, led late and
held from an outer challenger. DUKE OF DUVAL stalked two wide and between horses, shifted four wide in upper stretch, sustained grinding progress to bid
in the final sixteenth but was fended off. TOP GUN ROCKET tracked three wide, bid outside of the top pair and in the four path at the three furlong pole,
drove clear at the furlong grounds, but yielded between bidders in the final sixteenth. KNOW WHO YOU ARE laid off of the pace three wide, crept closer in
the five path around the far turn, then chased willingly. HE'S A JOKER vied with an outer pair into the backstretch, yielded to them with a half mile to go,
chased along the inside around the far turn, shifted two wide into the lane, pursued in tight quarters among foes at the furlong grounds, yet stayed on mildly.
MOBSTER vied between a pair of rivals in to the backstretch, then inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but gave way entering upper stretch. BIG
SALT LICK prompted three deep, vied between horses and in the three path around the far turn, got outkicked entering upper stretch and gave way.
GREER'S GOLD raced at the rear four wide and failed to factor. CAN'T STOP WILLIS leaned in and shied from the inner railing soon after the start, then
lacked speed two wide and made little impact. LINE OF SCRIMMAGE veered in while attempting to duck a gap early on, then was outrun along the inside.
AMENTUM laid close up along the inside, got shuffled back behind a rival at the half mile pole, then weakened turning for home.
