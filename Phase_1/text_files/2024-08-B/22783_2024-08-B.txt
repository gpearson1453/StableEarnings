rallied and just missed. MICHIGAN LEFT saved ground and gained the fourth spot late. GET ME ONE TOO stalked the pace between rivals and lacked a
late bid. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE was brushed at the start, raced in the four path and improved position late. SINGLE DIP stumbled at the start, led
between foes and faded in the stretch. PROPHET OBADIAH stalked the pace in the four path and faded in the stretch. DERAILED hopped at the start and

Footnotes
GO BALI GO stalked the pace inside, bid in the three path at the quarter pole and was in time and lasted in the drive. REAL FAST raced inside, bid at the
three-sixteenths pole, was steadied late in tight quarters, came again and missed. GOLDENEYE raced in the four path and rallied belatedly. ZIPPIN GIGI
led inside, drew off and gave way in the stretch. PILKINGTON dwelt, then rallied belatedly. CAT ON TIME and EPIMYTHIUM raced evenly. GAMER reared,
threw his head and was off late. MOHAY PLEASE pressed the early pace outside before giving way on the far turn. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE
RIDER OF REAL FAST AGAINST THE WINNER, THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT GAMER CAUSED HIS
OWN SITUATION IN THE GATE.
