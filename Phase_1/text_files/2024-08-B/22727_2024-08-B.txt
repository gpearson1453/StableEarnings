clear. TRIBAL IMPACT saved ground tracking PRIME EXCAMPLE AND SMOKEN SHADOW, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole then gained
the lead entering the stretch but was unable to resist the winner while proving second best. HADLEES HONOR dropped back early, came five-wide into the
stretch and finished in a mild rally. CAJUN TREASURE saved ground while being allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch and went evenly late.
SMOKEN SHADOW dueled for the lead to the stretch while racing two-wide and weakened. PRIME EXAMPLE dueled for the lead from along the inside
near the quarter pole and tired.

nearing the quarter pole but lacked a rally. PEACEFUL WATERS was prominently placed along the inside early, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole in
