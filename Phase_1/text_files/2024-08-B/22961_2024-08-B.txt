Footnotes
NON COMPLIANT away quickly from inside, stalked the top quartet in the early going, waited behind the top pair to the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two then
three wide late on the bend, drew alongside MARGARITA GIRL at the top of the stretch and drove clear in the final sixteenth. MARGARITA GIRL set the
pace three deep to the half-mile pole then fought on even terms into the turn, lost command while dueling with USHA early on the turn, regained command
and put USHA away leaving the bend, challenged by NON COMPLIANT shortly after, was overtaken at the eighth pole, yielded to the winner approaching
deep stretch and was clearly second best. USHA pressed the pace from inside then fought head to head leaving the backstretch, took over early on the
turn, gave the lead back to MARGARITA GIRL late on the bend, gave way in the final furlong but finished a clear third. BOUJEE BEACH pressed four then
three deep up the backstretch, lost touch with the top pair at the three-eighths pole, chased three to four wide around the bend and tired. MAGALE
prompted the pace between rivals to the half-mile pole, chased after the top trio leaving the backstretch, took the turn two to three wide and came up empty.
GEMADINI bobbled for a few strides then dropped back when climbing early, trailed in the two path into the turn, moved out wide around the bend, eased in
the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
CAROL'S COMIC coaxed from the gate, chased from inside, drew closer on the turn, rallied inside the leader and took over with a sixteenth remaining and
held gamely over rivals on both sides in the final moments. PINEAPPLE JUICE lacked early speed, trailed the field from off the rail then angled to the inside
early on the bend, saved ground and passed rivals approaching the stretch, angled out in upper stretch, steered back inside in deep stretch and got up for
second. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK up close early four deep between foes, chased after the top pair four then three wide on the turn, bid from outside
midstretch and got outkicked by the top pair. SPIRITIST up close briefly between rivals then dropped back off the pace, went three wide into the turn, moved
into the two path but ran into traffic behind MR. BIG HEART at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out to the three path again then swung six wide nearing the
stretch, closed well from the middle portion of the track and got up for a minor award. THE BIG CHEESEOLA pressed from outside to the turn, headed the
leader at the three-eighths pole, inched ahead then disposed of inner rival late on the turn, showed the way into the final furlong, tested shortly after, lost
command at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. POP D'ORO stalked seven then six deep up the backstretch, moved into the five path around the bend,
came six wide into the stretch and finished willingly to whittle the gap. MAGIC ACCOUNT chased five deep between early, ridden along while moving to the
four path around the turn and weakened in the drive. JONAS' DREAM tossed his head a bit leaving the gate but still came away with the field, went up to
take control from inside, fought on even terms with three furlongs remaining, lost command midway around the bend, yielded to the new leader late on the
turn and weakened. BILLY'S BET forwardly placed six deep early on, moved into the four path on the turn then spun five wide into the drive and also
weakened. MR. BIG HEART raced up close three deep between, climbed and dropped back on the turn, trailed two wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
JOYRIDER traveled two then three wide towards the rear, moved up to the mid-pack outside rivals on the backstretch, gained four deep on the far turn, got
bumped entering the stretch, fought four deep into the final furlong, cleared with a sixteenth remaining and lasted over the late run from the runner-up.
SPYCATCHER stalked two wide, ran up on heels on the first turn then started to pull, tugged between on the backstretch, got boxed in on the far turn and
upper stretch, gained a clear path and roused midstretch, finished with a late rush but missed. MIDDLEBURG stalked between then moved inside, drew
closer on the backstretch, tipped out in upper stretch and launched a bid between foes at the eighth pole, got bumped from outside midstretch and flattened
late. AMERICAN ONLY stalked briefly from the rail then took over around the clubhouse turn, set a pressure pace up the backstretch, dueled around the far
turn, resisted to the eighth pole, got brushed midstretch and weakened. ENGLISH ICON sat off the pace outside a rival then moved inside on the
backstretch, angled five wide on the far turn, bumped at the eight pole, drifted in and bumped midstretch and kept trying to the wire. NATION dueled inside a
rival from the two path into the first turn, ceded command to inner rival around the bend, pressed from outside up the backstretch, dueled around the far
turn, drifted slightly into the stretch, fought between into the furlong grounds, shifted in and bumped rival and flattened out. MALIBU ROCKS stalked in hand
three then two wide, rounded the far turn three then four wide, bumped between and put in tight in the final furlong and could not regain momentum. BRAVE
BLEND settled inside, drew closer on the backstretch, tipped out into the lane, then got bumped repeatedly and had his path taken in deep stretch.
SPEARFISH hopped slightly to lose a step, saved ground near then at the back and made no impact. ANDREADYTORUMBLE lifted at the start to come
away slow, unhurried after on the inside, went outside a rival on the backstretch, tipped out into the lane, altered back in upper stretch, took a bump then
had to check off heels at the sixteenth pole and was too late to recover. CRAZY CAVALIER showed early speed then pulled in the three path early, stalked
outside rivals in the middle stages, roused on the far turn, shifted out and bumped rival into the stretch, got bumped between foes near the eight pole, ran
into traffic and bumped late and could not recover. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT MULTIPLE RIVALS CONTRIBUTED TO
THE BUMPING AND THEREFOR THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
HOPE ROAD away quickly then was a bit rank briefly when ceding command to SOHO into the first turn, remained closest up the backstretch and reeled in
the leader approaching the far turn, took over early on the bend and cleared at the three-eighths pole, guided over to the inside, drew away under light
coaxing in upper stretch and widened on her own to the wire. NOTHING LIKE YOU unhurried in the beginning and angled in early on the clubhouse turn,
moved up from inside and challenged into the far turn but could not keep up with HOPE ROAD at the three-eighths pole, chased after that rival a bit off the
rail into the lane, finished determinedly but was no match for the winner. GRAND SLAM SMILE tracked five wide into the first turn then moved in a few
paths, moved up quickly four deep into the far turn, chased the new leader in the three path to the stretch and weakened. DESERT RHAPSODY settled off
the pace and angled to the two path on the clubhouse turn, gained between rivals under coaxing in the middle stages, tipped three wide on the far turn and
had little left for the stretch run. BACK ON TRACK tucked inside at the rear, went outside a rival into the backstretch, gained up the backstretch, dropped
back on the inside through the far turn and faded. SOHO stumbled leaving the gate, coaxed to the front from inside, opened up around the first turn, held a
diminishing lead leaving the backstretch and was overtaken from both sides, dropped back quickly on the far turn, eased through the lane, eventually
crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) angled to the rail on the first turn stalking behind the top pair, needed to find room on the final turn, gained an opening approaching
the stretch when the leader moved off the rail, chased from the fence to the sixteenth pole, then drew alongside DICEY MO CHARA (GB) and drove past
late. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) stepped to the front and showed the way under pressure from inside, headed late on the final turn, came off the rail into the
stretch, inched ahead from outer rival approaching deep stretch, was confronted by GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) past the sixteenth pole and was overtaken late.
BALNIKHOV (IRE) tracked from inside, pulled a bit first time in the stretch, continued to save ground around the clubhouse and far turn, tipped out in the
lane, finished with late run and missed second. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) settled outside a rival at the back and pulled around the first turn and tugged a bit
more first time in the stretch, moved out and tracked three deep through the far turn, brushed with inner rival at the quarter pole, finished willingly down the
lane but got outkicked in the late stages. MASTER PIECE (CHI) prompted the pace from outside, headed the leader late on the final turn, fought into the
final sixteenth and weakened late. EL ENCINAL (ARG) moved into the two path early stalking the top pair, brushed with outer rival while between foes at the
quarter pole and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
I'M A BAD BOY brushed by outer rival leaving the gate, showed early foot and pressed the pace from outside, fought on even terms with a quarter mile
remaining, led in the three path turning for home, put away inner rival at the top of the stretch and kept SPEEDY WILSON at bay in the final furlong.
SPEEDY WILSON broke a step slow from the far outside, chased off the pace then moved into range between rivals into the turn, took aim four wide into
the stretch, finished gamely through the lane but lacked the needed late kick to reach the winner. KEEP DANCIN NICK bobbled a bit leaving the gate,
moved inside stalking the top pair, tipped out at the top of the lane and lacked a bid. CHARMZ AWAY raced in range four deep up the backstretch, exited
the bend five to six wide and weakened. GOT'M COT'M sent for the lead from inside, set the pace under pressure from outer rival, fought head to head at
the quarter pole, lost command shortly after, yielded at the top of the lane and weakened. THREE GEORGES fractious in the gate, laid off the pace and
moved inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a response when asked. GOZER off slow and broke in to brush the hind-quarters of a rival, chased
near the back off the inside, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to menace. FRANK BULLITT broke a hair slow then climbed badly early and
dropped back, angled out on the turn and came five wide into the lane but failed to be a factor. DROP THE BIT fractious in the gate, forwardly placed off the
inside, chased three deep between rivals into the turn, dropped back around the bend while easing further out, came seven wide into the lane and tired.

PURE MADNESS vied four then three deep early, stalked three deep on the first turn before getting floated to the four path, challenged from outside at the
three-eighths pole, seized command at the top of the stretch, cleared past the eighth pole and was kept busy to the wire. BIG GEORGE settled near the
back, moved inside, shifted to the two path on the far turn, ran into traffic and altered in at the three-sixteenths pole, had to alter course again midstretch,
finished with late run but was too late. TAKES THREE tracked two wide early, three deep between on the backstretch, ridden along four wide into the drive
and got up for third. MCGREGOR LAKE reserved along the inside, raced in mid-pack between rivals on the backstretch then moved into range, chased two
wide into the drive and lost the show honors. SIZE DOES MATTER trailed early and steered to the two path, moved inside for the first turn, tipped two wide
exiting the last bend and summoned a mild rally to improve position. LORD TRIPPING vied in the two path leaving the chute then moved inside fighting
inside a pair of rivals first time through the stretch, took a clear lead around the clubhouse turn, controlled the pace up the backstretch, took pressure at the
three-eighths pole, resisted through the far turn, lost command in upper stretch, fought to the eight pole and weakened. DONT FIGHT THE FED broke a bit
slow, forwardly placed two wide then between rivals, went three deep into the far turn, continued three wide to the stretch and weakened. DAZZLE THE
COMMAND reserved on the inside then moved into the two path on the clubhouse turn, coaxed along two then three wide on the far turn, angled out at the
top of the stretch and lacked a rally. CAPO LUIGI traveled off the rail near the back, went two then three wide around the first turn, trailed three deep into the
second bend, had one rival beat entering the lane and failed to menace. STYLISHLYACCLAIMED stalked in the six path leaving the chute, angled in and
raced outside a pair of rivals into the first turn, got shuffled back a bit late on the bend, moved into range four deep in the middle stages, spun five wide into
the lane, moved in upper stretch and weakened. HAYWOOD stalked the pace from the rail, coaxed along the fence on the far turn and faded in the drive.

far turn, trailed three wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
ULTRA POWER stalked in the two path, loomed three wide at the quarter pole, took over into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and hand urging,
widened in the final furlong and coasted through the final sixteenth. BRIGHT LEAF brushed leaving the gate, sat off the pace on the inside, went two wide
into the far turn, gained while easing out to the four path around the bend, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. BETTER THAN GOLD came away a
bit slow, went three then four wide around the clubhouse turn, gained while remaining off the fence through the far turn, entered the lane in the four path and
was along for third. EL REY DORADO broke in and bumped rival, coaxed to the front from inside, cleared around the bend, dueled past the nine-sixteenths
pole, overtaken midway around the far turn, lost contact with the new leader into the stretch and tired down the lane. DUAL THREAT unhurried three then
two wide early, ridden along on the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane and improved position. FAST DRAW MUNNINGS dueled from outside briefly
then drifted out a bit early on the clubhouse turn, stalked the pacesetter then challenged head to head past the nine-sixteenths pole, inched ahead midway
around the far turn, lost command to the winner entering the lane and tired. FREE AGAIN climbed early and on the first turn trailing the field, saved ground
through the far turn and could not make an impact. PASSARANDO bumped between rivals at the start, settled in the two path, angled six wide around the
far turn and was never a factor. SCATIFY raced up close outside the top pair before getting floated out by FAST DRAW MUNNINGS early on the clubhouse
turn, chased three deep into the far turn, started to weaken under asking around the bend, came five wide into the lane and tired. TESORO tracked in the
three path around the first turn, dropped back in the middle stages, eased and walked off.

range at the sixteenth pole and overhauled the winner late. JOHNNY PODRES trailed two wide into the turn, swung out into the stretch, came with late rush
from outside and got up for second. NO NAY HUDSON (IRE) stalked the speed three deep, tipped out into the stretch, struck the front with a furlong

on the turn then tipped back to the three path and kept on for a minor award. FAST BUCK chased along the inside under coaxing, hugged the rail through
the turn, challenged from the fence in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages. STAR RACER allowed to settle towards the rear and moved inside,
saved ground to the stretch and improved position. SASSY NATURE dueled from inside then inched ahead leaving the backstretch, cleared outer rival on
the turn, moved off the fence a bit entering the lane, was overtaken approaching the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong. TURN ON THE JETS

Footnotes
MIXTO pressed FULL SERRANO (ARG) from outside to the far turn, lost touch with that rival with a quarter mile left to run, continued in pursuit within
striking range into the final furlong, came back on and drew alongside FULL SERRANO (ARG) once more at the sixteenth pole and dug in late to overtake
the runner-up. FULL SERRANO (ARG) took control quickly and set the pace inside MIXTO through the early stages, shook free from that rival late on the far
turn and inched away in upper stretch, confronted again by MIXTO with a sixteenth remaining and succumbed to the pressure late. REINCARNATE stalked
in the three path outside DR. VENKMAN around the clubhouse turn, asked right-handed while four wide past the quarter pole, finished determinedly outside
the top pair in deep stretch could not find the needed late kick in the end. DR. VENKMAN stalked from a bit off the rail around the first turn, traveled along
the fence into the far turn, tipped three wide around the bend, roused at the quarter pole, altered in at the eight pole and finished evenly late. THERE GOES
HARVARD reserved in the two path, between rivals in the middle stages, continued two wide then moved to the inside on the far turn and could not rally
when called upon. NONE ABOVE THE LAW trailed in the two path to the far turn, passed a rival midway around the bend and another foe in upper stretch
but failed to threaten. KATONAH tracked the top pair three deep to the far turn, came under a ride, spun four wide into the stretch and weakened. IL
MIRACOLO reserved along the inside, ridden along while dropping back to last on the far turn and faded down the lane.

CONCLUDE stepped to the front and moved inside, took pressure from outside in the middle stages, maintained a short lead through the far turn, shook
free into the stretch, moved off the fence, remained clear under hand urging then put to a right-handed crop approaching the sixteenth pole and was able to
hold on. ALMENDARES (GB) sat off the pace in the two path, gained while moving out three then four wide on the far turn, rallied under left handed
encouragement, switched to the right-hand with a sixteenth remaining, drew alongside CONCLUDE but failed to get by. ASTRONOMER stalked behind the
pacesetter along the inside, saved ground through the far turn, roused entering the stretch, chased after the winner into deep stretch, put in a late bid but
could not find the needed late kick. DU JOUR settled next to the fence in the opening stages, saved ground to the stretch, stayed on the rail in the lane and
put to right handed urging, summoned a mild rally but needed to find more late. LAMMAS (GB) tracked in the two path through both turns, got boxed in
briefly in upper stretch, gained a clear path and roused approaching the eighth pole but finished evenly late. FIRST PEACE forwardly placed three deep
early, confidently ridden still three wide on the far turn, steadied briefly when crowded in upper stretch, roused after but weakened in the late stages.
EXAULTED was closest in pursuit from the two path, applied pressure to the leader on the backstretch, remained alongside through the far turn, lost touch
with the winner into the stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. IRIDEO (ARG) unhurried in the beginning, traveled two wide outside a rival at the
back, got moved out by inner rival around the far turn, spun five wide into the lane and never threatened. FLASHIEST off slow in the beginning, moved to
the inside trailing early, eased out to the four path around the far turn, had to pause behind a rival in the lane but was never a factor. HALFWAY LINE (GB)
stumbled leaving the gate, reserved towards the rear on the inside, tipped two wide at the quarter pole then came three wide into the stretch, angled out
further in the drive and failed to respond.
