Footnotes
ANABAM broke alertly and sprinted clear, repelled a rival on the turn then pulled away while kept to her task. HOPEFORGREATNESS pursued the winner
throughout, bid on the turn then proved no match i the stretch. VIVI ROSE lagged far behind inside then closed well along the inside. WINNING PLAY
stalked the pacesetters three wide and came up empty in the stretch. GOLDEN PHILLY urged just off the leaders inside and faded. IRISH BANBA unruly
prior to the start, dropped back and was no factor. COURSE saved ground, made a brief bid on the turn then faltered. I AM RUE lacked speed and was
never in contention. STRONG DECISION broke slowly and was always outrun. IMPERIO AZTECA chased wide off the pace and gave way.

stretch to just miss the place award. NEW HIRE prompted the leader outside, faded at the top of the stretch, drifted out badly tiring. PLEASANT DREAMS
dropped far behind then caught a stopping rival. EIGHT DANZAS chased within range for half a mile and stopped abruptly.
