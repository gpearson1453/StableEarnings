BEACH HOLIDAY allowed to settle, moved up while angling out through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late.
ELECTROSTATIC unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, edged ahead, then was no match for the
winner late, while clearly best of the rest. MUTTLEY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened
late and held the show. CLEMSON TIGER rated back early, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a
share. JOSH'S HONOR pulled to contention inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and weakened.
AESTHETICALLY never far back, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then faded
the final furlong. BANDITOFTHEPRAIRIE stalked the pace on the outside and faded three wide through the turn. CHOCOLATE PHILLING well placed and
outside, lost some ground four wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
MOR SPRING SPIRIT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. HOYLAKE
well placed and outside, gained position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. IMPOSTER
SYNDROME well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. GLOBAL HYSTERIA
allowed to settle, angled in through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for a share. MAKE THE BED passed tiring rivals,
widest. NOT TODAY GOVERNOR tracked the pace, lost some position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded the
final furlong. YANKEE TEA PARTY unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
BLOODHOUND stalked the pace on the outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded. ELUSIVE
CHANGE was a brief factor.
