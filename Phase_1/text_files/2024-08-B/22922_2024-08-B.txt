Footnotes
BAKENEKO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. JO JO HANS
stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not
match strides with that one and held the place. PATRIOT DRIVE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, angled out inside the furlong marker and flattened out. HEIRLOOM KITTEN unhurried, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came
through on that path into the stretch, angled out and improved position. SIR TERRE well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second
turn, bid on that path into the stretch and faded. PONT DU GARD was never involved.

Footnotes
SPECTACULLARI allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late.
LOIS tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then evened and edged up
for the place. SCENIC VIEW sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the final sixteenth, then weakened and held the
show. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL hard to rated inside, angled out and pulled to contention, gained position three wide through the second turn, fanned four
wide into the stretch, evened the final furlong and held a share. ALL ABOUT KATHERN well placed inside, steadily lost ground. STRAIGHT MADNESS was
never involved. TIZ PROMISING RVF well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, then faded four wide into the stretch.
