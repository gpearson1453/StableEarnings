Footnotes
AWESOME FANTASY prompted the pace to midway on the turn, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter turning for home, took control in upper stretch
and drew away convincingly. SWIFT DANCER broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, set the pace under mild early pressure, led at the top of the
stretch, had no answer when challenged by the winner and kept-on willingly through the lane to hold the place. IT'S SAUL GOODMAN tracked the leaders
on the turn, rallied in upper stretch and found best stride late to nearly capture the place. WATERMELON CRUSH stalked the pace from the rail on the turn
in striking distance, angled wide late on the bend and went evenly through the stretch lacking a closing bid. COAL MINER reserved off the leaders at the
rear of the main body early, rallied turning for home cutting the corner and flattened out unable to sustain the bid. MAS VICTORIA broke in a tangle, lost
action rear and was not persevered with.

Footnotes
COMPASS FIRE set a pressured pace through the turn, kicked away in upper stretch and held the closers safe through the lane in a game effort. MORENA
DANCER reserved off the pace, circled eight wide and closed well in the stretch to be gaining belatedly. SHUT IT CALI reared at the start to give the field
several lengths, gathered together several strides from the gate, steadily gained on the field down the backside and continued a steady advance in the lane
despite having lost all chance at the start putting in a great effort. CORINTH was well placed tracking the leaders from the rail through the turn, rallied in
upper stretch to threaten at the eighth pole and flattened out unable to sustain his bid. CLASSIC DIVA stalked the pace from four wide on the turn, loomed
up turning for home and finished evenly. LOVE UNLIMITED was never a threat. CAJUN EXPECTATION pressed the pace from the fence to the top of the
lane and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
TEMPEST set a pressured pace from two wide to the head of the stretch, drew clear midway down the lane and was unthreatened in the final eighth.
AGENT KELLY hustled up the fence to hold the rail early, raced mid-pack into the turn, waited on the turn for racing room on the bend, split rivals in upper
stretch to rally two wide to take a clear second place at the sixteenth pole and held the place late in the drive. SIN PERMISO reserved off the early pace,
rallied on the turn, angled nine wide at the top of the lane, drifted in several paths late in the lane and just missed the place. MOONFLYER unhurried in the
early going to trail in hand, rallied in upper stretch splitting rivals and was gaining late from two wide. TAP YOUR HEART tracked the leaders on the bend,
rallied six wide in the lane to be prominent and finished evenly lacking a late kick. WE GOT THIS stalked the pace from three wide, bid in upper stretch from
four wide and lacked a late kick. VOY Y VENGO pressed the pace from the rail to the head of the lane and tired. FRONT DANCER broke through the gate
pre-race, flashed brief speed to be on the pace between rivals, was in a bit tight entering the turn and dropped out of contention. THE RIDER OFVOY Y
VENGO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST TAP YOUR HEART AND SIN PERMISO FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
PEYTON'S DAY unhurried for the first half mile to trail the field, commenced a steady rally circling on the final turn and finished well to be up in time.
STAYINYOURLANE reserved off the pace while racing along the fence down the backside, rallied to the lead in mid-stretch and was caught late in the drive
in a game effort to be a clear second best. NIPPY FITZ pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the stretch loomed through the lane and was
outkicked late. DUBAI AND BACK (IRE) tracked the leaders to upper stretch, was prominent in mid-stretch and failed to sustain the bid late.
THATSMYBOXER stalked the pace from three wide through the far turn and failed to respond when called upon. MIZTERGRANDCENTRAL set a
pressured pace for three-quarters, responded to battle turning for home when challenged and weakened late in the drive. STRAIGHTOUTTAOCALA failed
to menace. DOUBLE AUGHT BUCK was not a factor.

Footnotes
LIL' REGARD unhurried in the early going, gained ground on the turn, rallied in upper stretch from three wide splitting rivals and found best stride late to
close with a rush and be up in the final yards. SPORTING LADY pressed the pace from three wide through the turn, rallied turning for home to take the lead
midway down the lane and held that advantage until caught in the final yards in a game effort. BELLE OF THE SOUTH set a pressured pace from the fence,
battled down the lane on the lead and was out-finished by the top pair in deep stretch. UNSHAKABLE stalked the pace from the rail saving all the ground
cutting the corner turning for home, angled out to the clear down the lane and rallied well while unable to gain on the leaders. SMART UNION rated in
mid-pack through the turn and mounted a mild bid in the lane without impact. ABUNDANT LOVE contended through the turn to be well placed turning for
home and lacked a late kick. OK BY ME tracked the leaders from the rail on the turn, mounted a bid turning for home and flattened out in the stretch. DIANE
LEE chased the pace from four wide through the turn and weakened in the lane. WIKOLIA LADY was not a factor. MAGIC FRONT raced in contention early,
dropped back down the backside and continued to retreat to the rear in the lane.

Footnotes
ELEVATED GAME set a well rated pace while well in hand, responded when called upon turning for home to kick clear and held sway through the lane.
ROUNDTOP tracked the leaders from the inside, was set to a drive midway on the turn to make a steady gain and found his best stride late to surge nearing
the wire. SMALL FIELD stalked the pace from three wide, rallied in upper stretch and finished willingly while unable to close on the winner. SOUPER
ATTENTIVE was well held while just off the pace for the run down the backside and chased the winner coming home while outkicked by the top three.
MACKILLOP reserved off the leaders for the first five-eighths rallied from four wide turning for home, altered course to angle in down the lane and closed
mildly without impact. BOLT FROM ABOVE unhurried racing with the rear trio to the top of the lane, swung out turning for home and failed to mount a
closing bid. SAVE THE KING went evenly never posing a threat.

WILD WEST JUSTICE set a well rated pace on a well measured lead, pulled clear in upper stretch and held the closer safe late in the drive. KING COVEE
slow away from the gate to be several off the pack early, gained ground to the field down the backside, continued a steady rally to be gaining late. JOLLY
BOSS prompted the pace throughout and kept-on chasing the winner through the lane and being outkicked for the place. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN reserved
off the leaders to the head of the lane and showed good late energy with a belated bid. DESTIN'S RAINBOW stalked the leaders from the fence through the
turn, tipped out three wide turning for home and flattened out in the lane. PROSPECTIVE LOVE failed to menace. JOLLY BY GOLLY was not a threat.
KING'S RIVER was not a factor trailing throughout.

Footnotes
GETTIN'DOWNONIT well placed tracking the leaders from the fence down the backside, was taken well in hand to be kept off heels, continued to track
through the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and closed well to wear the pacesetter down in deep stretch. CORONOVA set the pace while well rated
throughout, responded when called upon turning for home to kick clear and finished willingly while unable to hold off the winner in a game effort. ONE BITE
reserved off the pace to the far turn, swung out six wide to rally well belatedly in the lane. ADMIRAL'S WAVE rated off the pace while saving ground along
the rail to the far turn and mounted a mild late rally in the lane. CASSIUS trailed for the first half and made a steady gain coming home passed tiring rivals.
DR. HYDE prompted the pace from two wide down the backstretch to be in striking distance turning for home and faded in the lane. BETTER WATCH IT
stalked the pace from three wide and lacked a response when called upon nearing the quarter pole. MARIO'S ON POINT raced mid-pack for a half mile was
set to an early drive into the far turn and dropped back tiring on the bend.

Footnotes
BABY BLOCKS tracked the pace and made a two wide bid off the turn and edged clear by the sixteenth marker and then held well to prove best under a
drive. AFTERNEATH was rated along the inside, coaxed along on the turn and eased off the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the trun and finished well
but could not get tot the winner while being second best. WHITE HEAT was away alertly and moved over to the inside to set the pace on while clear,
remained clear off the turn and was headed leaving the furlong marker and faded while staying on for the show award. MOONSHINING was settled back on
the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied well late for the minor rewards. CALL THE QUESTION was settled early, three wide on the turn,
came four wide into the lane and had no rally. DELIZIOSA was settled early, two wide on the turn and lacked a rally. WAIT FOR TOMORROW chased the
early pace two wide, then was on the inside by the quarter pole and weakened. HOPEFUL CURE was settled back early, between rivals on the turn and
was not a threat. BYRD OF EDEN was settled back on the outside and was not a factor. CHALICE chased the pace three wide and stopped.
