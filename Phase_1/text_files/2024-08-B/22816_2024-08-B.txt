PERFECT DATE broke in front then settled with the second flight, advanced steadily four then three wide to make the lead nearing the top of the stretch,
shook clear under right handed urging and proved best under strong handling. WAVES OF LIBERTY pressed the pace three then two wide and finished
second best inside the winner. MOBIL ENSIGN never far back, finished with good courage outside rivals. PEEKABOO MOM away alertly, gained a narrow
lead soon after the start, set the pace past the seven sixteenth pole then gradually weakened. IAMAMASON pressed the early pace four wide, made the
lead entering the turn, gave up the advantage at the top of the stretch then came up empty in the final stages. DAH FUH had brief speed. NOT JUST

clear in the final stages under a strong hand ride. SECRET TROUBLE was bumped at the start, taken outside, loomed boldly through the turn and into the
stretch then couldn't handle the winner while well clear for second. Z BOSS dueled for the lead along the rail into the turn, had speed into the stretch then
gave way. DRILL'S BOY drifted in bumping SECRET TROUBLE at the start, was a sharp threat three wide into the turn then stopped in the stretch.

prevailed under strong handling. FAT DADDY stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally three wide and finished second best. MAKING ME
CRAZY trailed along the inside, altered course to the six path entering the stretch, drifted to the eight path under left handed urging before the furlong
marker, was righted then closed fast through the final stages. THE RED MAN unhurried while widest, found his best stride late outside. DOCTOR WU
pressured the winner two wide for a half then was outfinished.
