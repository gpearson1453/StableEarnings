Footnotes
GOLD ALLIANCE took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure at the rail into the turn and was steadily handled to hold
on. THUNDAR CLOUD rated just off the pace through the backstretch, entered the turn near the rail, bore out approaching the top of the lane but finished
strong when straightened away. JUST A RAINBOW broke a step slow then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch for
third. GRAN PATRONA stumbled leaving the gate then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. P B FOXY
gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn but showed little further. MIDCENTURY MODERN gave chase then flattened in the three path on the turn.
KLUVYAMEANANDNASTY was shuffled back at the start, gave chase outside and raced in the six path on the turn. GATOR TWENTY FIVE saved ground.

Footnotes
DICEY GREY chased the early pace, raced three wide through the turn, was closing steadily through the stretch, took control late stretch and edged clear.
UNCLE CHINITO was away alertly, set a clear early pace while angling over before the turn, raced off the rail through the turn, couldn't hold off the winner
while drifting out late and finished second best. PINK DINGHY stumbled slightly at the start, was then allowed to settle, raced four wide into the turn, was
gaining late and needed more ground. AREYOUGONNAKISSME was reserved off the pace, advanced five wide out of the turn and offered a mild late rally.
BINGO WAS HIS NAME was unhurried early, saved ground into the turn, found an opening though the turn and was closing late. JUBA BOUND was outrun
early from between rivals and offered some late gain. CHARITABLE WINDSOR was void of any early speed, raced six wide out of the turn and finished
belatedly. BIGZ'S CABANA BOY raced in mid pack early, went three wide into the turn and was empty late. SPIRITED DEBATE was reserved early, went
four wide into the turn and never fired.

Footnotes
WHATTA NOTION stalked off the rail the opening turn then took over leaving the half mile pole, dueled clear of Linda's Taj toward the five sixteenths, raced
at the rail on the far turn and held on under steady encouragement. LUCKY BLONDE saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole
and improved in the four path on the far turn, dueled to clear second late yards and finished well. AIM'S JUBILEE rounded the first turn in the four path,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path on the far turn, then flattened stride mid-stretch. TRAVEL SMART saved ground
racing well back, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, altered course mid-stretch but flattened late yards.
EMBERLY stalked inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane.
RIDE THE RAPIDS rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and weakened in the
lane. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn, and showed little response through the backstretch.
TRANSPARENCY raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. LINDA'S TAJ
angled to the inside to show the way, was met leaving the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole and
weakened at the rail on the far turn.

PENGUIN POWER gave chase and raced two deep on the turn, then dug in under steady encouragement to get up the final stride. PORK CHOP PETE
engaged in close chase through the backstretch and took the lead two deep past the quarter pole, dug in under steady handling to hold off JEFFERSON
NATIVE through the stretch but was nipped for the win under the wire. The latter rated the early pace off the rail, dug in to the challenge of Pork Chop Pete
past the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead to that one leaving the quarter pole and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch.
YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished well outside. DUNCAN IDAHO exchanged contact with LITTLE
ROO ROO leaving the gate then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. The latter exchanged contact with Duncan Idaho
leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened leaving the eighth pole. BOSS E BOOGS gave chase, raced in the three and
four paths on the turn and flattened in the lane.

Footnotes
HESSICA stalked inside on the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and moved alongside BARBERS POINT entering the stretch, dueled for the
nod approaching mid-stretch and inched clear late yards. The latter rated the pace inside, kept the edge over the challenge of MOONLIT SHADOW leaving
the three eighths pole and held the edge at the rail on the far turn, but was met entering the stretch and relented late yards. MOONLIT SHADOW stalked
two deep the first turn, challenged the runner-up at the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. JUBA'S
PARADE settled in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, angled to the five path through the far turn, left the
turn outside and finished evenly. CHANGE THE WORLD saved ground racing well back, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far
turn near the rail, then flattened mid-stretch. JUBASLILBALLERINA angled in and stalked the early pace off the rail, started a three wide bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and weakened in the lane. GREAT SPIRIT stumbled to her nose leaving the gate, rounded the
first turn about the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, then faded past the three eighths pole and was eased in the stretch. YOLO
CHARLOTTE raced in the four path the first turn, was through early, raced wide on the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
VALENTINE CANDY rated close inside on the first turn, started his bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and took over
passing the eighth pole, dug in under steady handling to draw clear inside the sixteenth pole and held on well. BENTORNATO raced with the early pace
inside, dropped back leaving the first turn and picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and dueled to
even terms into the lane, remained a factor through the upper stretch but relented the final sixteenth. TAPALO became a bit anxious in the gate then raced
with the pace two deep, took the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole and raced clear into the backstretch, gave up the lead off the rail entering the stretch,
dropped back leaving the eighth pole and weakened. JUBAWITHATWIST became anxious when the neighboring horse flipped in the gate, saved ground
into the first turn and steadied lightly entering the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, steadily gained off the rail on the far turn, eased
out entering the stretch and finished evenly. GRAND OPENING settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole then weakened
at the rail on the far turn. PETINGAS TWIN settled close off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path
on the far turn. MR FILLIP stalked from the three path the first turn, ran outside into the backstretch and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, but
weakened while wide on the far turn and was eased. WANTS N NEEDS raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the turn but was pulled up
with a fatal injury past the three eighths pole and had to be euthanized on the track. Catalytic became very fractious, flipped in the gate and was a late
scratch.

Footnotes
SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING took quick control of the pace and moved to the inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the
rail on the far turn and was kept sharp to draw off the final sixteenth. VELOCITOR settled close to the early pace in the three and four paths, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled to clear second late yards. KOMOREBINO OMOIDE (JPN) stalked toward the
inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dueled to hold third. COASTAL MISSION settled off the pace in the
three and four paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. WARRIOR JOHNY
saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail into the far turn, angled to the five path approaching the head of the
lane and ran evenly in the lane. BENDOOG saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the three path on the far turn.
FROSTED DEPARTURE stalked the early pace two deep, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail approaching the
head of the lane. DOUBLE CROWN mostly saved ground. PIROLI raced well off the pace and showed little response. LORD MILES was never a factor.

Footnotes
CANDY TRICKS pressured the pace and dueled for the nod nearing the quarter pole, contested even terms through the turn, drew clear mid-stretch and
was taken in hand late. AIM'S REDIRECT gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and finished well to take second the final yards. CRAZY ANITA
took the lead leaving the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, was met at the rail approaching the quarter pole, contested even terms through the turn,
but dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride. BUCKPASSING WAY gave early chase but steadied between horses in the vicinity of the three eighths
pole, entered the turn off the rail then moved to the inside midway on the turn and flattened the final sixteenth. HOLIDAY ODDS veered out on the chute
then gave chase, was pinched back at the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the three path, eased out entering the stretch and passed rivals in the
lane. SUBTLE STORM gave chase, roughed at the inside flank of Buckpassing Way midway on the turn and could only improve her position. I'M FLYING
UP pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back in the three path approaching the quarter pole and weakened leaving the turn. GOLLY
GUMDROPS gave chase while saving ground. COUNT THE FLOWERS had a brief lead from a sharp start then gave chase outside, raced off the rail on
the turn and weakened in the lane. BARAPHA gave chase and rounded the turn in the five and six paths.
