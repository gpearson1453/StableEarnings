VERRAZANO FIRST tracked the early leaders outside, bid four wide into the lane and was slowly edging clear late. TIMEHASCOME forced the pace
outside EXPLOSIVE PRIDE through the turn into the lane and could not handle the winner in the closing furlong. EXPLOSIVE PRIDE broke sharply but was
soon joined a rival, made the pace about the three path and came up empty in the drive. KAELY'S BROTHER in reach of the pace outside, moved up in the
lane and closed some ground but could not threaten late. NOBLE CONNECTION was in reach early three wide and lacked a rally. SHARP AZ NAILS
weakened from along the inside. CORTE dropped out entering the turn and finished well back.

Footnotes
LARCH contended the pace outside rivals, bid clear from four wide in the turn and opened a good lead then held the margin under steady handling.
OUTRIGHT was in reach of the leaders outside, moved up four wide into the lane and gained the place. WHOOPING JAY challenged from between rivals
early with the winner, chased through the lane but could not hold position late. CASH EXPRESS stalked the leaders three wide and lacked a final closing
run. STAGE DOOR moved four wide but failed to make a solid bid. SAMI'S TROOPER followed the pace four wide and weakened. RUN FOR MATTY was
not a threat three wide. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN showed in front and cleared briefly, was joined early backstretch to dispute the lead and weakened. IN THE
MIDST was always back.
