throughout, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. PATEK raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, made a bid down the lane and
got up for third. MACKAY BOY raced within striking distance, made a bid, racing behind the top two, but was caught late for third. U RASCAL U pressed the
early pace, weakened and was no threat late. MR. RONNIE raced near the middle of the field, had a wide trip, put forth an even effort and lacked a rally.
HALF GUILTY lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. WILD APRIORITY ducked out at the start and was never close. DEAL OF FAITH broke
sharp, dropped back and was no threat late. FRIO RIVER broke out, lacked early speed and showed little. DADDY'S CODE forced in at the start, raced

Footnotes
OUR HEATSEEKER vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took command down the home stretch and was kept to the task. TALK OF THE
TOWN raced near the middle of the field in the early going, moved up at the 3/4 pole, made a wide bid and got up for second. R T'S D'ORO brushed at the
start, raced within striking distance, made a late bid and was outfinished for second. WHISKEY AND EASY dueled on the front end, took the lead, drove
clear and lacked a finish. MOON TRIP broke in, brushed rival, came around the first turn on the outside and raced evenly near the back. ZIPPY TOGA
lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn and was never a threat. CARLOS'S MAMA always raced near the back and showed little. ST BASIL
dueled on the front end in the beginning, dropped back and was eased to the wire.

second. MIDNIGHT CIGARETTE raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SECRET TEE broke in,
raced near the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside, improved position, but was no real factor. PENNIES FOR PAULLA lacked early
speed, came around the turn on the outside, finished wide, moved up, but was no threat. WITH A SONG void of early speed and passed tired ones late.

Footnotes
ROYA raced within contention, being reserved, saved ground around the final turn, made a bid down the lane and was going away at the end. MISS
DISTINCTIVE unhurried in the early going, racing near the back, saved ground around the second turn, made a stretch bid, proved no match for the winner,
but was a clear second. DASHYNS DREAM lacked early speed, had an outside trip, made a bid and proved no match for the top two. IRONIT went to the
front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. TWIRLING TIGRESS pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. CZAR'S BALLERINA raced within
striking distance, came around the second turn on the outside and retreated. FORGOTTEN FORTUNE void of early speed and was never close.
