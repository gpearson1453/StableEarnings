Footnotes
DEL MO stalked the pace in the four path, bid on the far turn, dueled briefly and drew off under mild urging. AKAMAI pressed the pace in the three path, bid
on the far turn, dueled briefly but was no match for the winner. OFF THE MEDS saved ground early, angled to the four path at the three-eighths pole, bid
late but couldn't close. GRACEFUL KITTEN stalked the pace inside but had no bid. CRIMINAL DEFENSE raced in the three path, moved to the five path at
the three-eighths pole but couldn't mount a bid. MONTAUK POINT saved ground, steadied near the three-eighths pole, bid at the quarter pole but faded in
the stretch. VERSATILE stalked the pace between foes but faded. MINE OWN STAR was not a factor. YOLO SANTIAGO led inside, gave way in early
stretch and faded.
