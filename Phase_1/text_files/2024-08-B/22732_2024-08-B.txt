Footnotes
BRENNA raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then moved up around the turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch to make the late rally and be up
in the final jumps. MRS. CLEAN stalked the pace to the turn then made a three wide bid at the quarter pole and challenged the leader in the stretch drive
but was overtaken by late closing rival and proved second best. DIGITAL SALE pressed the pace from the two path and engaged the leader in mid turn then
took the lead at the quarter pole, drew clear into the stretch but was caught near the eighth pole and tired. GREAT SHASHI chased the leaders through the
turn and showed a late kick but was outfinished. LIGHT THE TORCH went to the front to set the early pace from the inside then was headed midway
through the turn and weakened. FULL EXCHANGE showed no early speed to the turn, angled out to five wide in upper stretch and made a mild bid to pass
tiring ones. ROYAL PRADO was off slow and trailed the field to the top of the stretch moved between horses at the three sixteenths pole and improved
position. U BET JO'S PRAYING saved ground to no avail. GREENWICH PIKE was always back. VALENTINA MINISTER raced near the back and was not
involved.

Footnotes
BLUE SPEARMAN hustled between horses to take the lead and drew clear on the turn and held well to prove best. MACKOR vied for the early lead from
three wide but was no match for the winner and dug in late to save the place. VINICIO stalked the pace from three wide then tipped out to four wide in upper
stretch to finish strong and just missed the place. PRAISEWORTHY raced off the pace from between horses to the turn then angled out on the turn to move
up, went five wide into upper stretch and made a late bid but was outfinished. BERNARDO'S LEGACY vied for the lead from the inside early then slowly
faded. FLASHOVER tracked the leaders from the inside but lacked the late response. PERSONAL DRAMA saved ground but was never a factor. DIGGER
BARNS was never in contention. BERNARD THEATRE was unruly behind the gate then was void of speed and trailed.

HUB CITY go speed away from the gate then tracked the leaders from off the pace on the inside, slipped through entering the stretch to take the lead in
early stretch and drew off. DOWN IN THE BAYOU raced in the middle of the pack from the inside through the turn then angled out to three wide in upper
stretch to make a late run and was closing well to be second best. SHE'S SO SEXY sprinted away to take a clear lead to the top of stretch where she was
collared and yielded. JAYANA trailed the field to the turn then moved up slightly and made a rail bid in the stretch to improve position. BEL ROSSO raced in
the middle of the pack from two wide then angled out to five wide in upper stretch but was empty. THREE GIRLS chased the leaders to the top of the stretch
then weakened and was transported in the equine ambulance. KAITIE KAIT raced near the back then was moving between horses, checked and lost action.

Footnotes
CADRON SETTLEMENT raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn, angled out to four wide in upper stretch to take
aim at the leaders and had a strong late surge in the final yards to prevail. AMAZING WOO was forwardly placed to the turn then moved up on the inside to
midway through the turn, angled out to three wide at the quarter pole to make a late run in the stretch but was outkicked. MILCHIN hustled to the front to
co-lead from two wide to the turn then edged away to draw clear into the stretch but was denied late. GOWOKEGOBROKE sprinted away to co-lead from
the inside to the turn and weakened. GROWTH MINDSET raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the turn,
tipped out to three wide in upper stretch but flattened out. HE'S A COMMISIONER raced near the back and showed mild late interest but was not a factor.
FIRSTFLASHOFMOON was off a step slow, saved ground but was not a threat. CAJUN'S CHOICE was always back. REAL ROCKET BOY broke sharply
then vied for the lead from three wide to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
CHICK'S SHADOW was allowed to settled while saving ground down the backstretch then moved up on the final turn while angling out to four wide in upper
stretch to make the late rally and drew clear in the final yards. SWOONATRA roused to the clear lead down the backstretch then was challenged by
ABUNDANCIA on the final turn but fended off that one and drew clear into the stretch but was outkicked in the final yards and was second best.
ABUNDANCIA stalked the pace from three or four wide down the backstretch then moved up to challenged SWOONATRA on the final turn but couldn't
collar and stayed on for the show. STRAND OF GOLD bumped with FRIENDLYPERSUASION going into the first turn then raced off the pace but had to
check going into the backstretch and settled in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, made a rail bid on the final turn but couldn't catch the leader
and weakened late. ROSIE'S HALO raced five wide into the first turn then raced four or five wide down the backstretch but never made a serious bid.
FRIENDLYPERSUASION bumped with STRAND OF GOLD going into the first turn then prompted the pace from between horses to midway down the
backstretch and gave way. JAN'S GIRL was unhurried on the first turn then moved between horses entering the backstretch, tipped out to three wide down
the backstretch and made a mild bid on the final turn but faltered.

Footnotes
ZIZKA was forwardly placed on the inside through the turn then slipped up the rail in the stretch drive to run down the leader to prevail. TRES CORONAS
rushed up to the lead from the inside and was unchallenged to early stretch then drifted out in the stretch drive and yielded late. IRON HAND trailed the field
to the turn then made a four wide bid around the turn and kept on to be best of the rest. LOU raced near the back then angled out to four wide in upper
stretch to pass tiring rivals. LET'S GO LIAM showed good early speed away from the gate then stalked the pace from three wide and lacked the late
response. LAWLER balked loading into the gate, showed good early speed to be within striking distance to midway through the turn and gave way. RUIZ
JUNIOR was never a threat. MR TYSON broke outward and raced the widest down the backstretch but moved up to be in contention midway through the
turn then stopped. GEORGEISIMPORTANT was hustled along from between horses to prompt the pace on the backstretch but was shuffled back going into
the turn, lost action and trailed.

Footnotes
BEASTLY SPEED went to the front to set all the pace while leading throughout and won going away. COPPERMASTER raced back through the turn then
angled out to five wide in upper stretch for a late rally to be up for the place. SCAR stalked the pace from three wide while matching strides outside of MR
JACK and was outfinished late. MR JACK was forwardly placed while matching strides inside of SCAR and was outkicked late. OCALA DREAM raced in the
middle of the pack but failed to menace. EVERDOIT tracked the leaders to mid turn and gave way. KNOX saved ground through the turn then angled out to
six wide in upper stretch but was never a factor.

BETH'S DREAM pressed the pace from off the rail then took command at the half mile marker and edged clear on the turn to draw off in the stretch to prove
best. MARYQUITECONTRARY trailed the field to the turn then saved ground around the turn, tipped out to two wide in upper stretch, moved between
horses at the sixteenth pole to prove second best. CHARLIE'S WISH tracked the leaders from the inside early, angled out to three wide at the half mile
marker but was no match for the winner and held on for the show. IMONRA rushed up to a pressured lead to the half mile marker then fell back on the turn
and was empty. BLUEFIELD raced near the back while racing three to four wide but lacked the response. SOPHIA'S STORM vied for the lead from two
wide for the first furlong then slowly retreated.

Footnotes
KING CAB hustled to the front to an unchallenged lead and was kept to task in the drive to hold on for the win. ROLLING ON sprinted away from the gate
and chased the leader to deep stretch while making the late gain but couldn't catch and was second best. NO DELIBERATION raced in the middle of the
pack to the turn then moved up from three wide on the turn and flattened out but held on for the show. AWESOME CRUSADER saved ground throughout,
made a late stretch bid and missed the show. NICHIREN raced in the middle of the pack, racing four wide on the turn but failed to menace. GRIMES raced
off the pace early then dropped back. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE was in contention from three wide to the turn and gave way. BELLA FUTURE was off a step
slow and trailed the field while being outrun.
