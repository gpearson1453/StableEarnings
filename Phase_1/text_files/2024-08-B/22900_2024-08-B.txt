Footnotes
BRAHMS IMAGE sped to the lead at the start and set the pace along the inside, took on the challenge of VALE at the quarter pole, edged away from rival
leaving the turn, continued to hold a slim lead over VALE, dug in under firm handling and held firm. VALE sat three deep off the leader in early stages,
moved up to challenge BRAHMS IMAGE for the lead at the quarter pole, could not treach equal terms but remained in striking distance and yielded late.
DRIFTER was unhurried and raced in the back, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and gained late. ROCK CITY ROCKET tracked the early leader
and saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the upper stretch and evened out late. SAILOR CHOW raced in contention through early stages,
chased two to three wide around the turn and flattened in the lane.

SORCERER'S GIRL sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, turned back the bid of RISKY WHISKY leaving the turn,
drifted out three wide near mid-stretch and finished clear. C L LEGACY tracked the leader along the inside, hustled up late on the turn, angled two wide
entering the head of the lane, continued in range a furlong out, angled to the rail mid-stretch and secured place. MOR FOXY was forwardly placed racing
just off the early leader, was ridden along two wide between rivals past the quarter pole, continued in contention into the final furlong then ran on evenly late.
RISKY WHISKY raced in the second flight three deep, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, could not get by the eventual winner, ran on
three wide into upper stretch then flattened in the final sixteenth. DUE TO TIMER MALFUCTION THE OPENING QUARTER WAS HAND TIMED

MR. THUNDERSTRUCK was allowed to settle out of the gate and rated off the early pace, picked up the tempo and gained on the leader near the quarter
pole, sustained a three wide bid into the lane, stayed on determinedly and got up in final strides. UXMAL saved ground around the first turn and stalked the
clear top pair up the backstretch, hustled along four paths wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under firm handling, closed with a rush and got a
nose up for place. DAVIDIC LINE was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, took over the lead in hand three furlongs from home,
continued to lead the way into the final furlong, appeared all out late but stayed on gamely then got edged in final strides. HIDE THE DEMON sped to the
lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by DAVIDIC LINE with three furlongs left to run, but ran on with response along the rail
into the lane and yielded late. OCEAN OF STORMS trailed in the back throughout.

A JUST CAUSE set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for then lead going by the quarter pole, shook free turning for home, dug in just off the inside
and held late. KINFOLK rated just off the pace along the inside, ran on two wide around the turn, shifted out four wide and given cue at the head of the lane,
responded willingly and closed fast on the winner. LAZARUS tracked the pace up the backstretch, hustled along three wide approaching the quarter pole,
sustained bid into the lane and ran on for a share. BUREAUCRATIC raced in range in the opening quarter, flattened along the inside around the turn, cut
the corner and launched a rebid along the rail, edged closer then evened out late. EYE OF THE PANTHOR lacked speed and trailed the field, came two
wide into upper stretch and improved late. GEM COLLECTION raced off the early pace, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch and failed to
respond. FLEETWOOD SMACK was forwardly placed up the backstretch, vied for the lead going by the quarter pole then faded a furlong out.

HARRY BLUEBLOOD vied for the lead three deep in early stages, continued to battle three wide between rivals going by the quarter pole, drifted in at the
top of the lane which caused MY RAPHA to check and lose all momentum, battled on two wide and drifted in late which caused DONTDRINKANDRIVE to
steady then gained a slim lead and kept on. VIRTUE'S REWARD raced just off the top trio, moved up four wide to engage rivals at the quarter pole, vied
along the outside into stretch, could not match strides late but kept on with response. DONTDRINKANDDRIVE dueled for the early lead along the inside,
battled on along the rail into upper stretch, got in tight when HARRY BLUEBLOOD drifted in a path in the final furlong, steadied, lost momentum and
weakened. FIVE CHARLIE raced off the early pace, swung two wide into upper stretch and improved position without threatening. HOORAY raced in the
back, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. TIME TO SING raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn and
failed to threaten. MY RAPHA dueled two wide between foes for the early lead, continued to battle around the turn, was forced to check sharply when
HARRY BLUEBLOOD drifted in a path at the head of the lane and quickly retreated. THE STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF
DONTDRINKANDDRIVE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HARRY BLUEBLOOD FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW HARRY
BLUEBLOOD WAS FOUND GUILTY OF INTERFERENCE TO MY RAPHA AND DONTDRIVEAND DRIVE, WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND

Footnotes
MUSICAL DIVA sped to the lead at the start and quickly widened to a clear advantage, remained the clear leader a furlong out then held late over fast
gaining runner up. WREAKING HAVOC lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, responded gamely, closed fast to
the wire but ran out of time. SINGING EMMA chased the leader up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide at the head of the lane
and sustained a steady bid to clear a share. COLLECTED GLORY was ridden along off the early pace, cut the corner entering the lane and had a mid
improve. FEARLESS KRISTIE chased the pace up the backstretch, continued three wide around the turn and lacked the needed response for impact.
CHOJO hustled along in pursuit of the early leader, ran on two wide around the turn then tired in the drive.

ITWASTHISBIG vied between rivals for the lead up the backstretch, continued to battle outside of BILLY BOB ROCKET into stretch run, shook clear
approaching the sixteenth pole and edged away. LUCKY'S SECRET chased two to three wide into the turn, sustained bid through the lane and cleared
second best. BILLY BOB ROCKET vied for the early lead along the inside, battled on with the eventual winner into the lane, failed to match strides
approaching the final sixteenth and gave way. BRILLIANT COLORS saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide and given cue at the head of the lane,
raced in contention a furlong out but failed to kick on. RIDING THE TRAIN vied three deep for the lead up the backstretch, flattened out around the turn and
continued to tire in the drive.
