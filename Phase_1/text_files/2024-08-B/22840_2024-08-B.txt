Footnotes
ELLA IT IS was part of the mix up front while four deep on the outside, edged closer four wide around foes at the three furlong pole, seized control midturn,
had a narrow advantage outside at the top of the stretch, inched away for a clear lead by the eighth pole and won comfortably at the wire. J M R TACITA
travelled five deep in midfield down the backside, settled three wide outside challengers in the third tier around the bend, was still in the three path behind
the leaders when straightening out for the drive and had a strong late kick in the final sixteenth to get up at the wire for second money. ZIPPY GAMBLE
pressed the pace in the three path down the back straight, continued to duel up top between foes on the turn, battled in the two path straightening out for
home, was no match for the winner at the furlong marker and was just caught on the wire trying to save the place share. TAKEMYBOURBONNEAT hopped
slightly on the break, settled in mid-pack four wide in between horses down the backside, had a good spot in the second flight outside foes three wide
watching the foursome contest at the three furlong marker, took closer order midway around the bend, loomed boldly in the four path at the top of the stretch
but was one paced in the final furlong and could not pose a threat late. SWEET PASSIONS was taken in hand briefly when entering the backstretch losing
some positioning, stalked on the rail in the third group at the half, waited on the fence near the back around the turn, shifted out, finding a clear path four
wide at the furlong pole and was gaining quickly in deep stretch but could not pose a threat when crossing the finish line. PICKFORD SWEET prompted the
pace in the two path between rivals in the early stages, gave way up top on the rail at the top of the lane and flattened out inside foes in the final seventy
yards losing a couple of placings late. SERENADING KITTEN stalked in the third tier between horses, was roused two wide midpoint on the turn, angled out
six wide for the drive and finished up with good late energy in the end. ENCHANTED FOREST improved on the fence down the back straight to sit behind
the quartet up front at the half, shifted off the tiring earlier leader in the two path at the quarter pole but could not offer a rally down the lane. PEACE POSEY
broke inwards and was checked mildly at the start to trail along the backside, angled out to the five path turning for home but could not play a role in the
drive to the wire. SECRET SOUL was bumped on both sides at the break, travelled in the two path, tracking the front foursome down the backstretch, could
not gain on the lead group when scrubbed for more midturn, angled to the four path in the drive but had nothing to show in the stretch running.
HERETHEREVERYWHERE broke out on the start, recovered to have a slim lead on the rail down the backside, was hard ridden but was going the wrong
way when relinquishing the lead on the rail with five sixteenths to go and emptied out at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
FASCINATION STREET had a good spot, tracking the engaged pair in the early going, began to reel in the contesting duo by the quarter pole, angled out
six wide for the drive, wore down the leaders by the sixteenth pole to claim the lead and held safe at the wire. DESIGNATED HITTER improved smartly on
the rail down the backstretch, rallied on the fence just behind the winner in midturn, shifted outside with momentum in the seven path to be in the thick of
things for the stretch run, determinedly chased the winner to the wire but was just second best on this day. HE SHOOTS HE WINS broke in to begin, was
coaxed early to take command on the fence by the five-eighths marker, dueled on the rail having a slim advantage around the bend, spurted away from the
pace foe in upper stretch, faded at the sixteenth pole but just had enough left late to save the show award in the end. DIXIE'S FLATTER stalked close to the
back of the pack while outside a runner, began to circle some foes three wide with five sixteenths remaining, angled out in the five path straightening out for
home and had a strong late burst to almost nail the show money at the wire. NEEDS FULFILLED had a rail trip near the rear in the early stages, began to
pass rivals in the two path midway on the turn, was in range when shifting back to the fence for the drive and ran on willingly inside foes to the finish line.
HARPER CITY travelled outside horses four deep in mid-division, improved three wide around horses by the quarter pole, shifted to the five path at the top
of the lane but failed to menace running to the wire. HAAHEE was brushed on the break, settled at the back, only ahead of one foe down the backstretch,
made no progress on the rail in the turn but did show good late interest to pass a few rivals in deep stretch. COMPUTER HACKER settled in the three path
in mid-pack between rivals, made little impact four wide outside horses around the bend, angled out to the eight path for the drive but could not factor in the
stretch running. DEFOGGER was brushed at the start, stalked in the third flight with runners on both sides along the backside, kept pace with horses
through the turn but wilted in the three path in upper stretch. RYE'S MY GUY had a tracking role on the rail, could not quicken with others who started to
make a move three furlongs out and backed away around the turn. THIS KATZ FOR REAL broke out on the start, trailed on the rail in the beginning, could
not get involved at the back throughout the turn and passed a weary foe in deep stretch. SILVER PISTOL had the lead at the start, was then content to track
outside down the backstretch, forced the pace outside through the turn, faded up top in the three path in upper stretch and stopped quickly between foes in
the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
SECRET THREAT settled off the pace outside the second group into the turn three to four wide, began to pick it up while shifting out five deep coming past
the quarter pole, bid in mid-stretch and edged past late. KING ELVIS attended the pace from between runners pressing three deep into the turn, bid in upper
stretch taking a narrow brief lead while carried out a bit, was outfinished. DIOMEDES broke outwardly, shifted in tracking the leaders inside, moved out a bit
leaving the turn then altered back nearer inside, advanced inside runners to near contention by mid-stretch but went evenly late. JAGGERSGOTAGUN
broke a step slowly and lost the path at the start, lacked early speed bringing up the rear, swung five to six wide for the drive, kicked on mildly. VICTORY
TOWN soon led, set the pace from off the rail hounded by outside foes, could not kick on with the top ones and was guided out late. ITS TIME TO SHINE
broke outwardly a bit, was well-placed stalking from outside, went four wide on the turn, flattened out in the stretch. JO DADDY moved forward to stalk in
behind and between runners up the backstretch, was encouraged to keep up at the seven-sixteenths but dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
ECHO WITH LAUGHTER hounded the pace down the backstretch, moved to bid for the lead three wide by upper stretch, spurted away up front when
encouraged right-handed at the furlong pole and held safe by a comfortable margin in the end. THREE SONNY SIDEUP settled in the middle of the pack
four deep outside horses at the half, started to commence a rally four wide in midturn, angled out to the seven path for the stretch running and closed in
smartly in deep stretch to get up for the runners share just before the wire. JAMIESTA co-trailed on the outside at the half, began to pick up runners going
around foes three wide midway on the turn, gathered more speed when angled out to be widest in the ten path straightening out for the drive, was gaining
with every stride down the lane and closed in to garner third money at the finish line. SOUPER SUCCESS had a good spot just behind the pacesetter on the
rail down the backstraight, patiently waited to move on the fence behind the frontrunner throughout the turn, shifted just outside off the tiring early leader in
mid-stretch but was out finished when clear on the rail in deep stretch. LONG POND travelled inside foes while in the middle of the pack along the
backstretch, moved closer in the two path midpoint around the bend to keep a close eye on the engaged pair on the turn, was a menacing presence in the
four path straightening for home, ran to the wire on the wrong lead and stalled in the final sixteenth of a mile. ONE MORE BREW was in between runners in
midfield with four furlongs left to run, was scrubbed on around the turn but made little impression but did show some grit in the stretch, trying to the wire to
be in the mix for a share of the prize when crossing the finish line. DECIMATOR travelled on the rail, ahead of one rival in the beginning, saved ground but
made little impact around the turn and lacked a bid in the three path down the stretch. STYLISH GENT cleared from the outer post to lead on the rail along
the backside, dictated terms up front on the rail while shadowed by the winner around the bend, was collared outside entering the stretch by runners and
folded on the fence by the sixteenth pole. MIDNIGHT ARKLE was unhurried to trail at the start, closed the gap but did not gain positioning around the bend,
had little to give in the stretch drive and could not get involved in deep stretch. HIGHLAND SOCIETY was under a snug hold, watching the top two while
three wide at the half mile marker, kept pace on the turn while four wide between runners, shifted six wide at the top of the lane but had no finish to offer in
the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
CAIRO CAPER settled outside off the leaders, advanced four wide on the turn, drew even near the furlong grounds, drifted out in late stretch under urging
but edged past. DREAM ON was up close pressing from outside, went about three wide on the turn taking the lead outside the quarter pole, was given
some encouragement in upper stretch and challenged soon after, proved no match for the winner but was second best. COOLCOLLECTED exchanged a
light bump at the start, moved forward to chase from between runners off and in behind the leaders, kept on evenly in the stretch. YLIVOIMAINEN was in
tight and tapped on the brakes shuffling back to last after the opening furlong, was encouraged along by the five-sixteenths, fanned five wide into upper
stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole, ran on. MENSA soon led, set the pace from off the rail shadowed by a rival, gave way in the stretch. YOUR
VALENTINO was a bit reluctant to load, exchanged a light bump at the start, chased from near the inside, was in tight quarters past the eighth pole but
never a late threat. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF YOUR VALENTINO AGAINST YLIVOIMAINEN ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
JOURNEYMAN seized command from the onset, slowed the pace down in the second quarter up top, was challenged outside, even surrendering the lead
briefly in mid-backstretch, was let out a notch to easily regain control entering the final turn, opened up on the field in upper stretch and was kept to the task
in the lane but was never really threatened at the wire. MEYER loped along on the rail near the back, co-trailed on the fence under the wire for the first time,
was unhurried down the backside settling nicely into stride near the rear, angled outside gathering momentum in the seven path for the stretch drive, was
full of run late and closed in smartly to win the runners up share at the finish line. GREYSTONE was nestled on the fence behind the pacesetter, was
shuffled back a touch on the rail into the backstretch, waited for room on the inside, saving all the ground around the far turn, continued on the rail with a late
rally through the stretch and just missed in a photo for the place share at the wire. ELUSIVE KNIGHT galloped along ahead of one rival in the beginning,
co-trailed on the outside with seven furlongs to run, narrowed the margin along the backside, circled three wide at the three furlong marker making a good
move, shifted out with a chance in the five path turning for home and finished up willingly to settle on the fringes. TWOWAYCROSSING tracked in the
second flight, took closer order moving three deep to bid for the lead with nine sixteenths from home, dueled outside in the far turn, could not go with the
winner by upper stretch but did battle for the place share down the lane and weakened in the final sixteenth. BRITISH ROYALTY prompted the pace outside
in the beginning, chased between rivals along the backside, was scrubbed on for more on the rail three furlongs out just behind the front two around the far
turn, fought on in the two path for a mild share down the stretch but faded in the final sixteenth. LIL BIT GANGSTA had a stalking role near the back of the
pack on the fence in the early stages, improved to be in the second flight between rivals down the backstretch, angled out five wide for the stretch run but
could not quicken with others in the drive to the finish line. PAT'SSEWINGMACHINE trailed the field in the beginning, shifted out to the three path stalking
outside under the wire for the first time, tracked in the second tier three deep down the backstretch taking closer order, made an early move circling three
wide around foes with three furlongs to go, dueled for the place share in upper stretch but faltered in the four path with runners on both sides at the furlong
pole. GHOSTLY SPITFIRE was under a tight hold in midfield while on the rail, was last on the fence entering the backstretch for the final time, came under a
ride when the pace quickened at the half mile marker, lost touch with the runners around the far turn and galloped home in the stretch.

Footnotes
FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) broke a bit awkwardly with the rider pulling on a rein, quickly recovered to set the pace from outside, moved clear after the
opening furlong, was challenged in upper stretch and under urging, dueled the length of the stretch, was bumped just strides from the wire but dug in
determinedly to prevail. WAR BOMBER (IRE) settled off the leader stalking from outside, went three to five wide on the turn, fanned seven deep turning into
upper stretch, bid at the three-sixteenths, drifted in gradually through the lane engaged in a duel outside the eventual winner, drifted in a bit further and
bumped that one just outside the finish line and was denied while clearly second best. SECRET RESERVE settled in behind the pace tracking from inside
just off the fence, angled out past the five-sixteenths then drifted back in once in upper stretch, kept on late to get show honors while no threat to the top
pair. WICKED DJANGO settled toward the rear off the inside, moved out late on the turn fanning seven wide into upper stretch, was within range in behind
the leaders nearing the furlong grounds but lacked any late kick and was outfinished for show. CRUDEN BAY switched out off the inside early racing at the
back, angled eight wide in upper stretch, ran on. LIKE THE KING was in a hair tight and taken back in the early going, shifted in gradually up the
backstretch, saved some ground on the turn, lacked a late bid. KAUKOKAIPUU briefly pressed the winner from inside but off the fence, dropped back,
chased from between foes into the turn and was under urging about the seven-sixteenths, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN broke outwards on the start, was hustled to take command into the backstretch on the rail, set the fractions inside on the turn, was
collared outside at the quarter pole, dug in to spurt away for a clear lead again by upper stretch and was kept to the task to the wire to hold off the closing
rival by a diminishing margin in the end. PLAYMEA TUNE travelled on the outside in mid-division along the backstretch, began to lengthen his stride,
measuring the contesting duo with two furlongs left to run, angled out five wide for the drive, drifted in when set down at the furlong marker, had to be taken
hold of briefly to stay straight, was closing smartly late but just could not get there in time. I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) stalked between horses ahead of only one
runner in the back straight, rated kindly between rivals watching the engaged twosome at the quarter pole, shifted out to the three path to be in the hunt
straightening out for home, drifted out under left handed encouragement with a sixteenth left to run and while not switching leads in the lane, battled for the
top three placings late but settled for third money at the finish line. FIRST EMPIRE was content to track just outside off the pacesetter, edged closer
throughout the turn, turned up the pressure to bid for the lead with a quarter mile remaining, was repelled by the winner in upper stretch, then was brushed
outside when in tight between foes at the sixteenth pole and faded late to settle for a minor role. IRONSTONE was allowed to settle at the back of the pack
in the early stages, shifted outside in the three-path trying to commence a rally at the quarter pole, angled out for clear run in the five-path turning for home
but lacked a late kick in the stretch running and could not be a factor. BORDER TOWN was pushed out on the break, settled on the rail in midfield along the
backside, could not keep up with others who where making a move outside at the quarter pole and had little presence in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CAITLINHERGRTNESS was in tight quarters and steadied slightly nearing the wire the first time while forwardly-placed, stalked from between runners in the
second flight, tracked in behind the new leader late on the far turn, moved out a bit turning into upper stretch, had aim on the leader, drew alongside in
mid-stretch then edged away late under steady handling. MY BOY PRINCE moved forward soon after the start, settled alongside just off the leader to press
the pace two to three wide, took over past the seven-sixteenths, moved clear late on the far turn leading them into upper stretch, was under urging through
the lane but could not hold off the winner while clearly second best. MIDNIGHT MASCOT settled well back racing off the rail, picked it up on the far turn
willingly advancing while moving out from three to five wide on that bend, kept on well in the stretch to secure show honors but needed more to threaten the
top pair. PIERRE was forwardly-positioned outside the second flight stalking three to four wide, maintained good position in range of the leader coming to
the quarter pole but needed more in the stretch. JOKESTAR was outpaced early bringing up the rear, received encouragement up the backstretch but still
could make no progress, fanned six wide coming to the top of the stretch, kicked on well but too late. VITALITY settled outside at the back, made up ground
leaving the far turn and in upper stretch, kept on well but needed more. THOR'S CAUSE shifted in, raced about mid-pack between runners early, had good
position into the stretch, came out five wide mid-stretch and ran on. NO MORE OPTIONS eased back off runners and tucked in a bit entering the first turn
but still caught three to four deep racing mid-pack, steadily dropped back up the backstretch and into the far turn, moved out for the drive, needed more late.
RAFAROO was forced in a bit after the start, moved forward inside, raced up close tracking inside, was done at the three-eighths and retreated. ESSEX
SERPENT came in a bit after the break but quickly moved to the lead, set the pace near the inside, faltered and faded. FRIENDLY GHOST was taken back
and shifted in moving up to mid-pack heading into the far turn, was within range of the leaders but done at the five-sixteenths and faded. ROAR OF THE
CROWD tucked in three wide racing in the back half of the field, dropped back further, failed to menace.

Footnotes
SHIFTY took control right from the beginning, was unopposed while moving easily setting a brisk pace through the turn, continued up front in the two path
with runners closing in, was let out a notch with just a move of the rider's hands to fend off all challengers by mid-stretch, finally was set down when asked
at the furlong pole and drew off with authority in deep stretch. READY FOR CANDY tracked outside behind the front quartet in the back straight, was
nudged three furlongs out, beginning to move closer around the turn, angled six wide with good run at the top of the stretch, could not match strides with the
winner who had more in the tank for the drive but finished up strongly to best the rest at the wire. SHOTGUN WEDDING travelled on the rail keeping a close
eye on the top two down the backside, ran evenly just behind the frontrunner around the turn, continued the inside trip skimming the fence straightening out
for the drive and finished up with a solid late run to close in to capture the show award. WILL REIGN stalked near the back of the pack while running on the
fence, shifted out three wide with five sixteenths to go to start a rally, continued to angle out gathering more speed in the eight path at the quarter pole and
finished up with purpose to close in for a minor role in the end. SALT sat just behind the lead foursome settling on the fence, continued to wait inside
throughout the turn, was in range shifting out to the four path behind the leaders at the top of the lane but could not find more late and was one paced in the
final furlong. BULLET broke out and bobbled slightly on the start, kept in touch with the leaders while three deep along the backside, edged closer outside
rivals through the turn, posed a threat in the four path at the top of the stretch, was asked for run right-handed with three sixteenths from home, switched
back to the wrong lead at the sixteenth pole and faded in deep stretch. BOUND TO BE TRUE tracked outside in the beginning, was scrubbed on in the two
path between rivals chasing the pacesetter with three furlongs to go, was asked left handed for more in the three path in upper stretch, had little left to offer
down the lane and yielded at the sixteenth pole. AMBITIOUS LASS stalked outside near the rear down the backside, made little advancement through the
turn, angled five wide for the drive to the wire and could not play a role in the stretch running. CARLISLE BAY trailed on the break, took the short way
around through the turn making little headway, angled three wide turning for home but could not get into contention down the stretch to the finish line.
CRYSTAL VISIONS was ahead of one rival in the early going between foes in the two path, could see the field running around the turn, shifted four wide in
the stretch but was never involved in the drive to the wire. MISTY POINT settled in mid-pack three deep outside foes down the backstretch, was going the
wrong way losing positions around the bend, angled out six wide for the drive but failed the menace in the stretch.

Footnotes
RAPID TEST settled inside through the first turn, switched out and stalked the leading quartet, advanced four to five wide turning into upper stretch, was
gaining steadily in the lane and got up late. LAST DAWN was well-placed moving out from two to three wide and outside a rival on the first turn, stalked the
pace, advanced three to four wide, struck the lead near the eighth pole, drifted out late engaged with the eventual winner and was outfinished. CLASSIC
MO TOWN tucked in three then two wide off the leaders into the first turn, bided time racing well back, advanced on the far turn moving out from two to
three deep on that bend, rallied in late stretch between then inside runners but was just too late. RON'S GIZMO settled off the inside at the back, fanned
eight wide turning for home, gained steadily late but fell short. DUN DRUM tucked in to the two to three path into the first turn racing in the back half of the
field, advanced three to four wide on the far turn under encouragement, reached striking distance by mid-stretch but could only go evenly late. NEVER
SURPRISED had the early lead heading to the first turn then ceded that advantage and switched outside the new pacesetter to stalk that one, edged closer
willingly to take control about the five-sixteenths, was challenged in mid-stretch and overtaken narrowly then faltered about the sixteenth pole and faded.
COOL KISS settled off the rail well back, advanced in tandem with and outside a rival four to five wide on the far turn, was guided outside foes further near
the sixteenth pole and needed more late. CLEAR DESTINATION was caught four wide into the first turn, raced well back outside, encouraged along coming
near the quarter pole five wide, passed tired rivals. GRANDSON saved ground early inside at the rear, came out past the five-sixteenths, was never a factor.
MAAKWA was urged forward and clear, set the pace near the inside, gave way. MR. WHO tucked in to the two path on the first turn, stalked in behind the
leading pair, came up empty. LORD OF WAR was caught three wide early racing toward the back, was never a threat.

Footnotes
LIAM'S AWESOME was in a good spot, three wide tracking the engaged duo outside down the back straight, edged closer to shadow the pacesetter outside
three wide around the turn, posed the main threat in the four path when entering the stretch, was inching closer with a furlong to go and wore down the
frontrunner in the final few strides for the victory. SCORED broke in at the start, seized command inside at the five furlong pole, set the pace while up front
by a narrow margin on the fence through the turn, drifted out a touch clinging onto the lead in upper stretch, stubbornly fought on late but was caught
nearing the wire by the relentless winner. RYO AMAZING stalked on the rail near the rear, was under a snug hold waiting for running room at the half, made
a smart move bursting between runners in the two path midway on the turn, bid for the lead three wide with rivals on both sides in upper stretch, was in tight
quarters nearing the furlong marker, could not continue on with the top two late and gave way to be a clear third at the finish line. SPECTACULAR FORCE
travelled in mid-division in the two path between horses in the beginning, kept pace while going four wide through the turn, was fanned out in the five path
with a chance at the top of the lane and finished up with intent to get up late and settle on the fringes in the end. NOYZEE GIRL had a good position while
tucked in on the fence behind the frontrunner down the backside, was roused on the rail for more trying to keep up to the leaders around the bend, dueled
for a small share of the prize inside down the lane but lost out on a minor placing in deep stretch. SCAT HUMOR broke in, trading blows with the inside
horse on the break, recovered to track the lead pair outside down the backstretch, was shuffled back some to sit in midfield three wide with three furlongs
remaining, took closer order through the turn to be in range six wide turning for home but levelled off in the final sixteenth of a mile. ALL FOR HONOR was
off slowly, spotting the field many lengths after the start, rallied smartly on the fence in the turn to catch up and pass rivals inside by the quarter pole,
continued to fight on down the stretch and finished up evenly late but still was a very good effort when you consider the poor start. SOMETHING
BORROWED broke sharp for an early lead, was relegated to a chasing role outside midway down the backstretch, vied between rivals in the two path
around the turn, had no more left to give turning for home and retreated four wide in upper stretch. OUR STELLA had a stalking role close to the back of the
pack while outside foes, made little progression when under a ride throughout the turn, angled out in the seven path straightening for home but failed to fire
in the drive to the wire. ARRAKASTA ISTORIA broke out, exchanging bumps with the outside foe on the start, was ahead of only the poor starter along the
backside, made no impact three wide throughout the turn, angled out widest in the eight path for the drive but could not factor in the stretch running.
