Footnotes
LADY LAWRENCE Set the pace along the two path, was collared, exchanged bumps with SHEZENTICIING through the final sixteenths and under pressure
proved best. SHEZENTICING Close up along the rail, eased out, challenged and then exchanged bumps and just missed. BABI DREAMS Four wide on the
turn and finished with interest. JEN'S KISS Forced the issue early, tracked along the three path and weakened. LIGON'S LEGACY Three path on the bend
and weakened. STONEY LONESOME Took up sharply at the start, saved ground, was not a factor. FLORA ROSE Two path on the turn and tired. SPEEDY
Z Five wide around and tired. WHISTLING GOLD Five wide well back, three path on the turn and tired. NORTHUMBERLAND Two path around, was outrun.
A Stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, resulted in no change.
