Footnotes
C F V TEXAS RED led outside of a rival and drew off in the stretch under mild urging. RIVER BOY broke inward, was clear briefly, pressed the pace inside
and was no match for the winner. CONTACT TRACING was never far back outside, was floated seven wide at the quarter pole and rallied belatedly.
CANTSTEALMYTHUNDER was bumped and impeded at the start, stalked the pace between foes, bid at the quarter pole and faltered. DO YA WANNA
DANCE trailed inside and moved to the three path on the far turn and made a mild late bid. LUCK OF THE DRAW saved ground and had no late bid. J W
RUCKUS raced in the three path, bid at the half-mile pole, moved six wide at the quarter pole and faded. COOL MEMORY stalked the early pace inside,
gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT WEST was clear early and lasted under steady handling. GENTLE SOUL stalked the pace in three path, bid late but couldn't get past the
winner. RISK MANAGER was off awkwardly, raced in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then couldn't close in the late yards. ALTAZOR (ARG)
trailed before rallying late in the four path. ICEATUDE pressed the pace outside of the winner before giving way on the far turn. BAKWENA was off slowly,
bid between foes at the half-mile pole, was checked near the three-eighths pole and gave way. FOWLER BLUE saved ground to no avail. THE STEWARDS
DISALLOWED AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF RISK MANAGER AGAINST GENTLE SOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE
STRETCH.
