Footnotes
DORTH'S SOL DANCER Two path into the turn, four wide out of it, hooked up with SHELLY, exchanged bumps with that one to the wire and proved best.
SHELLY In hand along the three path, took the rail into the turn, drifted out some in upper stretch, hooked up with the winner, exchanged bumps with that
one and finished well. STONE CREATOR Set the pace along the rail, was hooked and weakened inside. RUBYS MISSION Tracked along the three path,
two path into the lane, appeared in tight between rivals leaving the three-sixteenths pole, took up and then failed to threaten. COZEE MAGIC Lagged far
back, three path into the turn and then was four wide out of it while always outrun. A Stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run. Also a claim of
foul was lodged by the rider of RUBY'S MISSION against the winner for interference in upper stretch, was not allowed.
