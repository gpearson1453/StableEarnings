Footnotes
GRAN ANDREWS took a quick lead and was firmly rated well off the rail, kept the edge over Tapio leaving the three eighths pole, pulled clear of that one
toward the five sixteenths and widened through the far turn, was only moderately asked entering the stretch then taken in hand later yards. PRACTICAL
SENSE rated just off the pace inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and settled for
second best. TAPIO stalked from the five path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths,
rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. RAGTIME RICHES settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. ROAD SLEW was jostled leaving the gate and rounded the first turn about the four path, showed
little response through the backstretch and raced in the five path on the far turn. ADVANCE CASH broke in and made contact with Road Slew then stalked
from the six path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn. INDIMAAJ broke outward
and made contact with Road Slew, raced in the three path the first turn then saved ground on the far turn.

RAINBOWSNSUNSHINE was bumped leaving the gate then stalked from the three path the first turn, took the nod two deep into the backstretch, dueled
clear approaching the quarter pole and was kept sharp to hold on well. LITTLE BABY GIRL saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and dug in to take second the final jump. QUEEN NEFERTARI veered out and made contact
with EXTRA DIRTY leaving the gate then settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path on the far
turn and dug in from the head of the lane, but was nipped from second under the wire. The latter veered out and made contact with Rainbowsnsunshine
leaving the gate and was bumped again from the inside a stride later then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn, then weakened while being eased out in the upper stretch. TIDBIT rated a slim early lead, was met into the backstretch and
gave chase from that point, dropped back approaching the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn. LOVELY DRAMA rounded the first turn in
the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.

YANGARRA raced with the pace inside and dueled to a slim lead at the five sixteenths pole, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in
under determined handling to inch clear late yards. ROMANTIC WARRIOR raced with the pace and dueled with a slim advantage leaving the half mile pole,
was met at the five sixteenths, contested even terms through the far turn and remained a factor to late stretch before relenting. BLOOD BROTHER veered
out and made contact with Well Spotted leaving the gate then raced boxed near the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. NO BRAKE NEEDED stalked from the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened. TOUCHED UP broke a step slow and was bumped early, bore out on the first turn
and was not a factor. WELL SPOTTED was forced outward and into Touched Up leaving the gate, dropped back in the three path into the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
RUSH CENTER stalked toward the inside, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dug in leaving the
turn and was determined to hold off NEVER GREW UP through the final sixteenth, while the latter stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out into the lane and challenged mid-stretch, but was outfinished the final sixteenth. HE ROLLS rated a slim lead
while tapering in through the front stretch, dug in to the challenge of Rush Center leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms at the rail on the far
turn and remained a factor to mid-stretch, relented at that point but held on for third. RAINBOW DAY stalked in the three path the first turn, challenged three
wide nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead in the four path on the far turn but flattened the final furlong. IRISH KING settled off the rail
the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. NICO LUCKY eased
outward through the first turn, showed little and rounded the far turn about the seven path. SMOKIN SMITTY raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and weakened in the three path on the far turn. TAPADINE raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. CATCHING STARS saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the
far turn.
