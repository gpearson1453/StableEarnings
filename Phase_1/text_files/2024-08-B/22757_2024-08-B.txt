Footnotes
FINDAWAY was out of the gates on the lead, raced in the three path, was joined by another competitor to the outside, traveled into the stretch where he
was cut loose in mid stretch and happily drew off for the win. DOMINANT D brushed the gate leaving, bolted a bit while being aggressive and on the bridle,
finally settled a bit, raced just off of the leader until the sixteenth pole, could not sustain the bid but was second best today. GOOD YEGG raced along the
rail. saved ground, was asked at the top of the stretch, responded well, closed but had too much to do and finished third. MY LAST ESCAPADE raced mid
pack in the four path, shifted out at the top of the lane into the five path, lacked a late bid. FLYING CRICKET raced off of the pace, stayed down on the rail,
then re treated early.
