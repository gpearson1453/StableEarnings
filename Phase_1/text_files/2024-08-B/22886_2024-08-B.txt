kicked clear in the final furlong. COLORFUL NATIVE moved up strides out of the gate and briefly led the way, then took on the inside challenge of ELIOT
NESS, vied outside of rival around the turn and into the stretch then got overtaken in late stages. LIL SCREECHER raced just off the top trio in the early
going, hustled along four wide going by the quarter pole, ran on into the lane and cleared a share. ELIOT NESS moved up after opening stages and
engaged COLORFUL NATIVE for the lead, vied inside rival around the turn and into upper stretch, fought back past the furlong marker then flattened out.

FREEDOM TO SPEED held a slim lead around the first turn then set the pace with JUSTICE ONCE not far behind, held clear still in hand late on the final
turn, saved ground into the lane, shook the reins, widened advantage and finished ridden out. IOWA CLUB raced just off the top pair around the first turn
and stalked the top pair up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid leaving the far turn, produced a solid bid but was no match for the winner and had to
settle for clearly second best. JUSTICE ONCE pressed the pace around the first turn then continued just off FREEDOM TO SPEED up the backstretch,
hustled along two wide near the quarter pole, ran on two wide into upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. ON A DARE raced off the early pace,
hustled along two wide into upper stretch and failed to move into contention. STROLLIN NORMAN B raced in the last flight, saved ground, had no response
when called upon and retreated in the lane.

SWEET LAURA stalked the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued in close range around the far turn, was ridden along three wide into
upper stretch, poked a head in front of ADRIA at the furlong marker then finished going away. ADRIA led the way around the first turn and set the pace up
the backstretch, led the way around the far turn and into upper stretch then got headed by the winner a furlong out. XCARET was forwardly placed through
early stages, continued just off the leader around the far turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch and kept on for a share. GOLD STRATEGY raced in
range while saving ground, tipped three wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. LORRAINE'S LEGACY lacked speed and raced in the back, was
under a drive three to four wide turning for home and had no response.

LU'S TIME sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held clear into upper stretch, urged left handed along the rail in late stages and just lasted.
JACKIE SPARROW raced up close into the turn, sustained bid into the stretch, dug in gamely in late stages, was edging up on the winner approaching the
wire and just missed. SUNSET FOR SANDRA raced off the top pair into the turn, ran on three wide into upper stretch, was no match for clear top pair but
dug in late and held show. ESPERANZA'S SPIRIT raced off the early pace, swung four wide into upper stretch and just missed show. NO RHYME OR
REASON raced in range in the early going, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. LUCKIE GOLDIE saved ground and raced in the
back throughout.

Footnotes
LADY RAZORBACK vied inside of VANALEE for the lead up the backstretch and around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, widened to a clear
advantage and kept to task. RUN A FIRE was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and
secured second best. DR. WOODS MIRACLE was reserved racing in the back, came two wide into upper stretch, tipped wider for the drive, rallied and
cleared a share. TIZ A STRATEGY was ridden along racing off the top flight, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick for
impact. MS BUMBLEBEE chased the early leaders, hustled along four paths wide into the head of the lane and failed to kick on. VANALEE got bumped at
the start then quickly advanced to take a slim lead, vied outside of the eventual winner up the backstretch and around the turn, was no match at the head of
the lane then faded in the final furlong. KATELYN'S MESS was ridden along off the early pace, came wide into upper stretch and failed to move on. RUBY
LYNN raced in range through early stages then steadily weakened. LITTLEDABWILLDOO got bumped at the start and never threatened.
