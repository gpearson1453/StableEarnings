Footnotes
GATE TO WIRE showed early speed then settled just off the pace, gained to make an outside bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn,
took the advantage while asked for his best in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and prevailed under steady urging. JACK'S PROMISE
ran off with the rider during the post parade, was hustled from the gate then was taken in hand briefly before dropping back under urging, raced inside to the
two path on the turn, gained fast on the rest of the field late on that bend, came under the crop in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, altered out
near the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy to garner the place. GENE AND JUDE was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace,
moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, navigated through traffic between foes coming to the quarter-pole, shifted four wide into the stretch then
quickly moved further out, chased the leader into the final fulrong and finished willingly for the show. NOD TO TRAN was urged near the back while on the
outside, raced in the three path for most of the turn, moved closer to the rest of the field late on that bend then shifted five wide over heels, came into the
stretch in the seven path, gained in the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead inside the sixteenth-pole and improved position. CODE OF JUSTICE
showed speed from the far outside then set the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, was guided around the turn in the two path under extra left-rein
pressure, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and gave way. INCANTO (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed between horses
then settled off the pace, dropped back under some urging near the half-mile pole, raced in the three path early on the turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths pole, moved to the four path while crowded between horses in traffic coming to the quarter-pole, shifted five wide into the stretch, was held
up in traffic while not having enough burst or willingness to go through vacillating holes in front throughout the drive, brushed with a foe in the process and
failed to impact. LOUGH CURRANE broke out and bumped with a foe, prompted the pace on the inside, was taken under restraint near the half-mile pole,
drafted inside on the turn, moved out into upper stretch then was roused, chased into the final furlong, was taken in hand while crowded and being
out-kicked near the sixteenth-pole then weakened. MAUI STRONG was a bit reluctant to load, bumped with foes on both sides at the start, showed speed
between horses then dropped just off the pace, was taken in hand off heels leaving the backstretch, chased in the two then three path on the turn, came out
to the six path into the stretch then dropped back, brushed with a foe while crowded between horses just inside the furlong marker and tired.

drive rallying through the final furlong to latch on the leader a sixteenth out, tussled through to the finish and was up in the last jumps to prevail. REAL

taking command at the three-sixteenths, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and tussled with the aforementioned foe
through the final sixteenth and was nailed in the final strides. SHAKEITFORTHEBIRD broke in brushing the near side stall and forcing POWERED BY

chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired. TWELVE NELSON broke

Footnotes
BRAMITO chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, came under encouragement with five-sixteenths remaining and angled out four wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail. DILLINGER hustled from the gate, dueled
with TURN UP THE TREES while along the inside down the backstretch, got joined three deep by TOMMY TWO SOCKS half a mile from home and vied
inside a pair of rivals through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in
under lone threat and was caught in the final strides to the finish. TOMMY TWO SOCKS coaxed from the gate, raced four wide in aim of the duel up front
down the backstretch, tucked three wide half a mile from home and advanced to vie for command through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
continued three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and kept on under a drive clear of the rest to garner the show honors.
NEUSCHWANSTEIN coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and weakened. SHOW TIME away well, led briefly before chasing three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch
and tired. TURN UP THE TREES bobbled at the break, dueled from the two path with DILLINGER to his inside, got joined outside by TOMMY TWO SOCKS
at the half mile pole and vied between foes through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, got shaken off inside that station and took the inside
route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BACKSTRETCH ROSE bobbled at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, drafted in the two path while in dead-aim of the leader on
the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then dropped to the rail to make a bid at the three-sixteenths pole, squeezed through inside two opponents to
take the advantage approaching the furlong marker, shook clear under a strong hand-ride outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady handling.
MISS LAO angled in quickly at the start, raced inside on the first turn, was well rated with an easy lead, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked
under threat near the five-sixteenths pole, came under a right-handed crop after turning into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner nearing the furlong
marker and was outfinished but out-nodded PAM PAM for second. PAM PAM raced in the four then three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the
outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, passed the quarter-pole under the crop, turned into upper stretch on even
terms for the lead, battled outside the top two into the final furlong and was also outfinished then lost the head-bob for second at the finish. ALLEY'S SONG
remained out in the nine path early on the first turn then dropped down to the four path by the end of that bend, settled on the outside, was coaxed along
late on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two then three path under urging, turned into the stretch in the five path then moved further out and
failed to respond.

WEST HOLLYWOOD along the inside through the first turn, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, tipped five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and assumed command near the sixteenth marker
when the leader suffered an injury, ran on in front clear to the finish. YO DADDY broke in at the start and brushed TAKE ME TO CHURCH, raced just off the
inside through the first turn and then three wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide through the far turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun
two to three wide into upper stretch, got taken hold of and was altered out slightly inside the eighth pole and improved position to the finish. THE PROCESS
just off the inside tracking the leader from just off the pace, got set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and then
expertly paused and altered around fallen foes inside the eighth pole and was along for the show honors when in hand to the wire. VILLAIN broke out at the
start brushing TAKE ME TO CHURCH, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, paused
and altered out nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened in the drive. TAKE ME TO CHURCH (IRE) got brushed between foes at the start who each broke
his way, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied appearing to want to
tip out when THE BIG TORPEDO drifted out in front, remained inside, then got struck by that rival falling from an injury and was hip checked heavily on the
right shoulder and fell into the temporary rail losing the rider in the process, ran off the opposite way and was apprehended by outrider and subsequently
transported off the course by equine ambulance. THE BIG TORPEDO set the pace along the inside under a rating hold, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and was set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under a left handed crop inside the eighth pole and
suffered a catastrophic injury to the left front falling heavily inwards and colliding with TAKE ME TO CHURCH knocking that foe into the temporary rail, then
was euthanized on track. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the incident inside the eighth pole before the result stood and the
race was declared official.

Footnotes
ANOTHER CLEESHAY tossed her head at the start while away a bit awkwardly then was carried in, shifted out to avoid running into the rail entering the
main-track, moved up to get the lead then went clear, dictated terms while inside on the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, turned into
the stretch in the three path, drew off under a drive until just before the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. DIVINE WORKS lost her
footing some at the start but broke with the field, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, was driven into the stretch in the four
path and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. VERY COSMOPOLITAN broke awkwardly and was off a bit slow, climbed outside the
five-eighths pole, went three wide on the turn, steadied behind a retreating foe outside the five-sixteenths pole, was roused late on the turn and improved
position to get the show. BLUE EYED SCOUT settled off the pace, was urged in the two then three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path
and failed to impact while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. CENTRAL CASTING broke a step slow then was taken up, settled on the outside, was
urged in the four to five path on the turn, spun into the stretch in the six path and lacked the needed response. GAGA'S HAMSOME settled off the pace,
was urged in the three to four path on the turn, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch and came up empty. BOUVIER chased the
pace down the backstretch, pursued the leader in the two path on the turn and tired. CHICAZTECA bobbled inward at the start, was well placed just off the
pace, passed the half-mile pole under urging, dropped back along the rail on the turn and capitulated. BOURBON BLANKET was coaxed along off the pace,
dropped back fast late on the backstretch and climbed a bit, went around the turn in the three path, drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor.
CAMPAIGN CHAMPAGNE broke out at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back under urging near the seven-sixteenths pole, went
around the turn in the four to five path and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
SMOOTH BREEZE got bumped at the start by BIG BROWN DELIVERS, tracked along the inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked back inside into the far turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out two
paths near the eighth pole and followed DEEMER until tipped out an additional path or two a sixteenth from home, then surged late and was just up in the
shadow of the wire to score. DEEMER settled just off the inside through the first turn in mid pack, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and
through the far turn advancing well outside rivals under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command just inside the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and was nailed on the line. TRINITY RIVER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand
inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked back inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths under challenge, took the inside route into upper stretch and was headed for command straightened away, dug in under a drive and kept on
along the rail to preserve the show honors. NATIONAL ARCHIVE just off the inside through the first turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home and offered up a mild kick. ORIE broke in at the start bumping DIGNIFIED REPSONSE, raced just off
the inside through the first turn and then tracked the front from just off the pace three to four wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide through the far
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, dug in between foes to
the eighth pole and was displaced from the front inside that station, then weakened in the late stages. CALVIN'S RIDE chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position then made no headway through the final furlong.
DIGNIFIED RESPONSE broke a half a beat slow and was bumped at the start by ORIE, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. HIGH WATER MARK three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. DARK
MAGIC broke a beat slow and then bobbled at the start conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside through
the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered
just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. BIG BROWN DELIVERS broke in at the start bumping SMOOTH BREEZE, chased three then two

Footnotes
VALTELLINA was hustled from the gate, settled just off the pace, was asked while three then four on the turn, rallied outside to make a bid in upper stretch,
battled outside of the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. OFF SCRIPT tracked the pace, ranged up in the three path on the turn,
made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead at the quarter-pole then dropped to the two path into the stretch, dueled with the winner to the finish and
missed while able to get the place. KAY CUP broke in and hit the gate then bumped with a foe, was well placed while rated just off the pace, drafted inside
for most of the turn then moved to the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased the top two in the stretch and was unable to reach those foes
while willingly earning the show. EARLY ON bumped hard with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the three path, turned
into the stretch in the five path and improved position without threatening. MOONLIGHT GAL broke in and bumped with a foe then checked, moved up while
in hand then climbed some around the nine-sixteenths, raced behind a foe while inside early on the turn then was roused, saved ground into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. LIGHTNING MAMA stumbled at the start then came in and bumped with a foe, moved up to get the lead outside the
five-eighths pole then went clear, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole and
tired. PRACTICALLY SUMMER was forwardly placed on the outside, went four then five wide under urging on the turn and came up empty. C C
ROULETTE ran off with the rider for a bit during the post parade, bumped hard with a rival at the start while also making contact with another foe, raced at
the rear, went around the turn in the four then five path and failed to threaten. OLIVIA'S WISH came in at the start then bumped with a foe, raced well back
under urging, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. BLAKELY'S WISH showed speed then chased the pace, came up empty in the two path on the
turn and retreated.

EMIRATES ROAD chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and looking to tip three wide but had to
wait as THAT'S MONEY was under urging to keep his path, tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths and advanced on the top pair floating out seven wide
into upper stretch when under an active left hand rein, straightened away and shied out three paths quickly at the three-sixteenths again under an active left
rein but corrected by a right handed crop, seized command nearing the eighth pole and went clear under a drive to prevail. HARVARD coaxed from the
gate, prompted the pace from the two path coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while keeping on to just preserve the place honors on the wire. WARRIOR RICHARD chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to the finish clear of the rest for
the show honors. COOL OPERATOR coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, got collared nearing the eighth pole and weakened through to the finish. EIRIK RIDGE chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. PRINCIPE D'ORO chased four to five wide coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired. THAT'S MONEY four then three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY stumbled at the start conceding
four to five lengths to the front, chased seven then six wide through the firs turn before chasing four to five wide down the backstretch and through the far
turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
HURRICANE DEBBIE was well placed just off the pace, moved from the inside to the two path on the turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole then
quickly angled further out to the six path, rallied outside to make a bid near the furlong marker, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, responded
well to the challenge of the runner up in the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. LINARITE was urged along near the back on the outside, went
three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then moved out the eight path, rallied outside to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole, fought
with the winner to the finish and missed while able to get the place. U SHOULD B DANCING settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, rallied
inside to make a bid near the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. LACONIA stalked the pace
on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, took a short lead inside the three-sixteenths pole, led into the final furlong, lost the advantage to the
winner outside the sixteenth-pole, battled between horses into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just missed the show. CANDI GIRL brushed with
a rival at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was asked in the three path on the turn, shifted to the five path at the
quarter-pole then moved out to the seven path near the three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed kick. SHAMAN PRINCESS broke out then stumbled
some, moved up to get the lead then set the pace, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. CALL ME PENNY broke out and brushed with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader while loosely between horses, reached even
terms for the lead in the two path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and tired. TIPSY RUNNER
settled off the pace then angled in, raced between foes leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was roused near the five-sixteenths
pole and failed to threaten. KAYMUS was hustled from the gate then settled just off the pace, went around the turn in the five then six path, lugged out to
the nine path into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
KID KREESA bobbled at the break, recovered to show the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, fought on inside gamely under a left handed crop leaning on and bumping his main
danger taking back the front seventy yards from home and gamely prevailed at the end. DAYBRIGHT DELIGHTS coaxed from the gate, pulled his way
three wide through the first turn before settling three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three then
two wide into upper stretch, rallied to poke a head in front a furlong out, dug in head to head through to the finish getting leaned on and bumped minorly and
was ultimately bested at the end. NEW YORK SCRAPPY chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch, offered up a mild kick drifting in a path in the late stages to the finish. CHARLES J chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing in late, lost the ability to tip out when NEW YORK SCRAPPY drifted in
and was stymied behind the top pair in the final jumps to the finish. HARD PAR broke out at the start bumping DILLON in concert with SEBASTIANTHE
FIRST, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. ORENO
broke a beat slow and hit the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went
seven to eight wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SIX FORTYFIVE chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and weakened in the stretch. SEBASTIANTHE FIRST broke in a step at the start bumping DILLON in tandem with
HARD PAR, chased three to four wide through the first turn, chased five then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into
upper stretch and tired. DILLON got bumped between foes at the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and tired.
