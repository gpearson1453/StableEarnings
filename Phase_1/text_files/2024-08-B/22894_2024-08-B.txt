Footnotes
FRAC AMOUR showed speed from the inside, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. SUPER
HONEY TIMBER was off slow and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MAIKEN THE VIKING
stalked the early leaders and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. ROHESE was away alertly but
trailed the field on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was never a threat. DAISYCREST was hustled early but chased turn and from the
three path at the top of the stretch was empty.

from the inside and had a clear lead on the far turn but was caught late. REDOUTE'S LIGHT settled off the pace and moved up on the far turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch needed more. BIG BROWN BREWSKII was off the pace, trailed the field on the far turn and from the three path at the top
of the stretch was up for a share. PRIVATE NETWORK stalked the early leader but lost ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch
