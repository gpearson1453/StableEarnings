Footnotes
PROTECTIVE coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside past the stands the initial time and then raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased
three wide down the backstretch and the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command swinging three wide at the quarter pole,
edged clear to the eighth pole and held safe kept to task. ELKO COUNTY three then two wide past the stand the first turn, chased just off the inside through
the first turn and thereafter coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive trading brushes with
IL SICILIANO to his outside while rallying in tandem with that foe offering up a mild kick to just secure the place honors. IL SICILIANO stumbled badly and
awkwardly at the start conceding six to seven lengths to the front before settling into stride, pulled early on and keen and caught up to the field into the first
turn briefly tipping three wide before tucking to the two path and then the rail, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths and continued to angle out to swing seven wide at the head of the stretch,
rallied in concert with the aforementioned foe trading a trio of brushes with that rival while showing good courage to offer up a mild bid. ACCIDENTAL BID
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming under light coaxing at the half mile pole, angled out four
wide into upper stretch displaced from the front, tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SACROSANCT was hustled from the gate, moved up on the outside then chased the pace, made a bid in the four path midway through the turn, dropped to
the three path late on that bend, was asked near the quarter-pole, took over into upper stretch then came inward, was given one pop of a right-handed crop
while moving clear outside the furlong marker then switched to a left-handed crop and drew away under strong urging. SKYTOWN bumped with a rival
early, raced just off the pace under coaxing, was forced in near the five-eighths pole then dropped back, chased in the four path on the turn, pursued the
winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while willingly clear for the place. BOLD FORTUNE brushed with a foe early, moved in while
just off the pace near the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the three path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and
lacked the needed response while best of the rest. JOKER ON FIRE showed speed and went to the front, moved in near the five-eighths pole, rounded the
turn in the two path, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch and tired. TOGA LIFE was last away
then came outward, dropped back while showing no speed, traveled around the turn in the four path, drifted inward in upper stretch and never reached
contention. SCHEDULING DUDE dropped back between horses then was guided inward, became rank behind horses starting outside the nine-sixteenths
pole into the turn, leveled out while moving from the two path to the four path on that bend and came up empty. CHASING COLTON was hustled from the
gate then bumped with a foe early, pressed on the inside of the leader then was eased back just off the pace with five furlongs to run, drafted along the rail
on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive and capitulated. BRINK was hustled from the gate, steadied while in tight between
horses after the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the three then four path, turned into the stretch in the six path and failed to
threaten. POWMISSIO was urged along well back in the field, rounded the turn in the two path and showed little.

Footnotes
CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) established the front and showed the way three then two wide through the first turn, spurted away five to six paths off the inside past
the stands the initial time under a rating hold, remained clear on the front just off the inside through the second turn and then three wide down the
backstretch settled into a comfortably rhythm, got given a notch just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive clear to the sixteenth marker and was geared down inside that station to prevail comfortably at the end. SIX MINUS broke out at at the start bumping
ANDTHEWINNERIS, raced just off the inside through the first turn and then four paths off the inside through the stretch the first turn, tucked back to be just
off the inside through the second turn before going four wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. ANDTHEWINNERIS got bumped at the start by SIX MINUS,
chased just off the inside through the first turn and then four wide down the backstretch, tucked back to the two path through the clubhouse turn before
heading four paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch,
weakened while along for the show honors. CURBSTONE brushed the off side stall at the start and then lost his lane to a rival, raced three wide through the
first turn and then five wide through the stretch before heading back three wide through the second turn, tipped five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. WINNING SPIRIT (GER) saved ground near
the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired.

backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead in the four path into the stretch, shook off the runner-up into the final furlong and drew clear
under strong urging. OPTIC WAY bobbled while breaking clearly in front, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the first turn, showed the way down
the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage in the two path into the stretch, fought with
the winner under a drive until near the furlong marker then proved no match while clear for the place. LORD CAPTAIN bumped with a rival at the start then
dropped back early, fell well behind along the rail while climbing on the first turn, lagged well behind while off the inside on the backstretch, dropped from the
two path to the rail early on the far turn, shifted to the four path later on that bend, moved out in upper stretch and reached his best stride too late while
showing good energy for the show. SIX PERCENT hit the outside of the gate at the start, rounded the first turn in the three path, was rated off the pace,
came under urging late on the backstretch, was hard ridden while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, chased in the five path into

pole, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. GUT FEELING angled in early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace,
moved out outside the five-eighths pole, was asked late on the backstretch, went around most of the far turn in the three path, was put to the crop around

the far turn, rallied late on that bend, took the lead in the five path into upper stretch, kicked clear under a strong hand-ride inside the three-sixteenths, was
given one tap of a down-turned crop inside the furlong marker and proved much the best under a solid hand-ride to the finish. HEAVENLY LIGHT bumped
twice with a rival after the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, went around the far turn in the three path, was roused outside
the quarter-pole, swung out to the six path into the stretch, pursued the winner to the finish and was clearly second best. CHA CHA WREN was last to
commence, fell well behind the rest of the field while in the three path on the first turn, lagged at the back under urging, moved closer to the rest of the field
late on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the three path, was roused near the quarter-pole and improved for the show. MANGETSU bumped twice
with an opponent just after the start, raced in the four path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader while asked in the

Footnotes
BIG PRANKSTER stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up four then three wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead
while set down in upper stretch, inched away into the final furlong and just held under strong urging. LI'L LANG bumped with a rival after the start, was taken
under tight restraint then reserved off the pace, saved ground while still in hand on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, swung four wide into the
stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed determinedly to just miss while clear for the place. GRAYWING bumped with an opponent after the
start, was well placed just off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued
the winner in the stretch and finished with good courage to get the show. EMPIRE SKY settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, bumped
with a rival at the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. LIMIT UP went to the front, set the pace under
pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch and tired. ON THE HILL was hustled from the gate then
urged along on the outside, chased five then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty then was reported to have bled.
TWISTED FILIGREE stumbled at the start then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped
back late on that bend, bumped with a foe into the stretch and capitulated.
