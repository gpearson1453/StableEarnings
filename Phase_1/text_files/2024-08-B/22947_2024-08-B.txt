right-handed urging. MIGUEL'S BELLE set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner in upper stretch and held for the place. BOTH SIDES

Footnotes
SMILE PO prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, took aim from the four path at the top of the stretch, and drew
clear on her left lead in the final furlong. HAPPY SUNDAY raced up close in the two path, was driven from the rail around the turn, and ran on from the three
path down the stretch for place. MADAM MITOLE rated in the two path, had to steady passing the three-eighths mark, swung from the five path into the
lane, and finished evenly on her left lead for show. IN OTHER WORDS set the pace in the three path, was coaxed along from off the rail around the turn,
but faded on her left lead from the two path down the lane. MS. AVENTINA chased in the five path but never threatened. BOSTON TWEET raced off the
pace in the five path and never menaced. SPAGHETTI TREE always trailed.

Footnotes
COPPERLITE was off a bit slowly, trailed in the two path early, circled five wide around the far turn, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear
under a drive. SHANKAR bumped with DISATTACHED at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, took the lead near the quarter pole, battled between
foes to deep stretch but was no match for the winner late. SWASHBUCKLE set the pace in the two path, was collared near the quarter pole, fought on
inside of foes to deep stretch and held for the show. DISATTACHED bumped at the start, raced in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. THREE
WOLVES chased the pace inside and faded in the lane. THE MAR failed to menace while racing four wide. ICE THE KICKER pressed the pace in the three
path and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
I'MALWAYSTHINKING laid up close in the three path, was driven around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kicked on to draw
clear of an inner foe in the final sixteenth. MADDY R broke out at the start, set the pace in the three path, was cued from the two path midway around the
turn, stayed on while floating out to the four path passing the eighth pole, but was caught around the sixteenth by an outer foe to place. RIP RIDING AWAY
chased in the four path, was coaxed midway around the turn, floated out to the nine path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. CASH DUE trailed in
the two path early and never threatened. JAZZ N BLUES stumbled at the start, raced off the pace in the five path and never menaced.

Footnotes
SARAH'S DREAM stalked the pace inside of foes in the two path, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, took over not longer after and drew
clear in upper stretch. BUBBLY CHAMPAGNE raced in range four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and ran on for the place. ROSE VIEW raced
off the pace two wide around the first turn, went four wide around the far turn, was steadied while forced out in midstretch and rallied outside for the show.
SUDOKU TERRY hit the starting gate, saved ground off the pace, drifted out under left-handed urging in midstretch and had mild rally. DIALITHIC set the
pace in the two path and weakened in the lane. GOSSIPER failed to menace while racing five and six wide. FREE TO ROAM played no factor while racing
two and three wide. ROTONDO was strung out six wide around the first turn, made it down the three path for the far turn and never threatened. MISS
HOLLY was outrun while racing two wide. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY pressed the pace three wide and retreated through the stretch. BONMATI raced up
close five wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
BROADCASTER prompted the pace in the three path, bid under coaxing passing the quarter, took the lead at the top of the lane, and inched ahead under a
drive. ANCHISES bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue along the inside early into the turn, dug in
from the two path turning into the stretch, but was edged out by an outer foe to place. MITBY bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased inside, angled
out to the four path under a drive entering the stretch, and kept on for show. VINO FOR THE QUEEN raced off the pace in the two path, was ridden from the
rail around the turn, but made no impact. TAPARINO trailed in the four path early, moved up passing the half, was driven in the three path around the turn,
tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, but flattened. LYLA'S LUCKY BOY dwelt, raced wellback in the four path and never menaced.

advanced four wide around the turn and ran on for the place. GOLDEN SKULL chased the winner two wide between foes, tipped out in upper stretch, could
not keep pace with the winner from there and lost second late. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED raced off the pace in the three path, angled five wide near the
quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. FORT ATTITUDE chased the pace inside and faded through the stretch. CARSOWN broke through the starting gate
prior to the start, chased the pace three wide and faltered in the drive. NORFIE played no factor while racing two wide. CAMPTOWN RACES trailed in the

Footnotes
BREEZERO prompted the pace in the two path, bid from the rail midway around the turn, took the lead passing the quarter, tipped out to the three path in
upper stretch, and kicked on to hold sway. THE DOVE RULES stalked in the three path, was coaxed along between foes around the turn, swung from the
five path into the stretch, and rallied for place. FOGGY NOTE trailed in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and ran on for show.
TATOR MADE set the pace in the four path, got challenged by an inner foe while in the two path midway around the turn, lost the lead passing the quarter,
was roused while floating out to the five path in upper stretch, stayed on while on her left lead, but got out-finished. PRETTYKEEN raced off the pace in the
two path but made no impact in the four path down the lane. VAL'S GAL tracked in the four path, was roused passing the quarter, but failed to threaten.
CLAY SOLDIER laid in range along the inside but flattened.
