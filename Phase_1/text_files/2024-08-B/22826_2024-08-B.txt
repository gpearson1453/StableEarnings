Footnotes
HENNESSY WILD unhurried in the early going, moved up, between rivals around the final turn, made a late bid and was going away at the end.
WITCHOLOGY raced near the back in the beginning, came around the final turn on the outside, made a stretch bid, proved no match for the winner, but
was a clear second. IRON FORTUNE lacked early speed, had an outside trip, made a wide rally and got up for third. I NITA WARRIOR showed early speed,
raced close throughout and was caught for third. MAGIC BIND void of early speed, moved up to the middle of the field and finished evenly.
INVOLVEDNTERACTION went to the front, saved ground and faded. COZY GEM pressed the early pace and was finished early. SWEET SUNNY B lacked
early speed and was never close. MEASURE OF FAITH raced within contention and dropped back. POPPA NOAH always raced near the back, had an
outside trip and was never a threat.

ORDER UP pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a wide bid and got up late for the win. MAGAWILDTIME dueled on the front end, took the
advantage and was caught late for the win. WISHERT challenged on the front end, saved ground around the turn, weakened and proved no match for the
top two. GOTMY MO JO WORKIN raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide gain, but was no
factor. FIESTY FIST lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, improved position, but was no threat. BIND FAITH raced within contention, faded
and was no threat late. REAL ACTION raced within striking distance, faded and finished evenly near the back. ALLEVA was an early factor, came around
the turn on the outside and dropped back.

CAPTIVATING STAR reserved, racing within striking distance, came around the final turn on the inside, shot to the front at the head of home stretch, was all
out and held off a late charge by TONI'S INFERNO for the win. TONI'S INFERNO lacked early speed, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch
and needed more ground. MO CAN DO pressed the pace, raced outside around the second turn, finished wide and proved no match for the top two. IT'S A
SECRET raced evenly near the back in the early going, saved ground around the final turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. STAR APRIORITY dueled
on the front end, drove clear and faded. CANAL ST. CUPID hopped at the start, raced in the back and was never close. ALINES VALENTINE showed early
speed, saved ground around the final turn, dropped back and was eased.

CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA raced within striking distance, came around the turn four wide, dueled down the lane and prevailed for the win. SUM CHARM vied
for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. NICE LIKE MICHELLE
lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, angled out down the stretch, made a bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. HIDDEN
LOVE challenged for the early advantage, took the lead around the turn and faded down the stretch. CHARMING KAT raced in the middle of the pack and
put forth an even effort. SUPER SPIRIT lacked early speed and was never a factor. COSTA LADY always raced near the back, came around the turn on the
outside and showed little. HARD EXIT vied for the early lead, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
DYLAN'S DREAM vied for the early lead, took command around the turn, pulled away and won handily. DON'T BE BOSSY unhurried in the beginning,
made a steady gain, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. ABBEY CAKES lacked
early speed, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide gain and was a clear third. GLORIOUS GEARS pressed the early pace, eased back, made
a late mild bid, but was no factor. TIZ A BREAKUP late early speed, showed late interest, but was no threat. PRINCESS MOCCASINS raced within
contention, weakened and finished evenly. SHE'S THE SHERIFF dueled on the front end and faded. RANOLOGY bumped early, racing near the back and
was never a threat. FIRST CLASS GIRL was bumped at the start, raced in the back and was never close. GLITZ AND GLAMOUR showed early speed and
dropped back. MEAN DREAMER always raced near the back and was outrun.
