Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY stalked the early speed from just outside, was let out three wide on the bend, edged ahead upper stretch, moved clear and angled in
slightly inside the final furlong and maintained full control while kept to task in the late going. TAPICITA settled outside, commenced her bid four wide on the
turn, rallied the last eighth and took over second with thirty yards to go. LICHITA vied for the lead outside DIXIE PENNY from the start, moved ahead two
wide on the bend, could not stay with LIL BIT TIPSEY in the lane, gradually yielded in a narrow path just outside DIXIE PENNY, brushing occasionally deep
stretch, was bitten on the neck by the latter nearing the wire, threw her head up but managed to outnod DIXIE PENNY for third at the wire. DIXIE PENNY
contested the pace from inside, did not keep up on the turn, came again upper stretch, was also no match for LIL BIT TIPSEY when set down for the drive,
continued to duel inside LICHITA, brushing occasionally then turned her head and bit that one nearing the wire. FANCY HILL was an early factor from inside
but faded on the bend. There was a stewards' inquiry into the savaging incident in the final strides of the race. After their review, no action was taken.

Footnotes
W W GRAND FINALE soon had a clear lead, was challenged from inside midway on the backstretch, regained a clear lead when allowed two wide on the
turn then drew off under mostly a show of the crop in the lane. BAR MONEY soon trailed running widest, advanced four wide on the bend, fanned out further
into the stretch, drifted out briefly as she gained second just inside the furlong marker, was no match for W W GRAND FINALE but clearly best of the others.
GREEN GRACE raced in the second flight from outside, was three then four wide taking the turn then gradually wore down deep stretch. LUTION unruly in
the gate, broke inward, starting a chain reaction of bumping, raced in contention between rivals, faded two wide on the bend, swung out widest for the
stretch run and passed a couple yielding rivals. COWGIRL FRANKIE was bumped at the break, raced in contention from inside for a half mile, came off the
rail some entering the lane and began to flatten out. PRIMITY was bumped and forced into COWGIRL FRANKIE, quickly recovered, vied for the lead inside
W W GRAND FINALE, did not hold back that one on the turn and began to fade with a quarter mile left.

I LUV THIS BAR rated off the early speed, went for the lead two wide on the turn, drew clear in the stretch and was kept to task to the waning yards. ROCK
THE BIRDHOUSE chased while toward the outside, angled in on the bend, came off the rail some for a clear path into the lane, rallied just inside MUD HUT,
edged ahead for third inside the last furlong and got up for the place deep stretch. MUD HUT raced in contention from outside, was three then four wide
taking the turn, battled for third then second nearing the wire but did not have enough late. ABBMAR took a clear lead nearing the end of the first eighth,
was challenged from outside on the bend, no match for I LUV THIS BAR when set down for the drive and gradually wore down deep stretch. JULIAISON
chased from off the rail, angled out widest at the top of the lane, drifted out some upper stretch, was straightened and made up minor ground on the second
flight in the late going. DELTA LADY soon trailed, saved ground through the turn, floated out some entering the stretch and also made up minor ground
without threatening.

AVIANO broke a bit inward, was corrected, brushed with CITY OF GOD, was settled, progressed while toward the outside, went for the lead four wide on
the second turn, lugged in slightly under right-handed pressure as he took a clear lead at the furlong pole and kept his rivals at bay. CITY OF GOD brushed
with AVIANO just after the start, was urged to stay close, advanced three wide on the second bend, vied for the lead briefly between horses upper stretch,
altered in some when his path narrowed with a furlong left, fought gamely for second the rest of the way and outnodded IRISH DECLARATION at the wire.
IRISH DECLARATION moved up outside SOUPER FORTUNE to vie for the lead on the first bend, retreated some between rivals on the second turn, came
again in the lane, was crowded briefly midstretch, battled for second to the wire, lost the photo but was easily best of the rest. SOUPER FORTUNE broke
well, was quickly clear and moved to the inside going to the first turn, was soon challenged, edged ahead again on the second bend but flattened out for the
drive. TAPIT SAM in contention briefly between rivals, began to fade on the backstretch, moved to the outside before finishing a half mile, stayed widest the
rest of the way and had no late bid. DIAMOND DAVE was a brief factor from inside but gave way after a half mile, was eased deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
BABAS GAL prominent between rivals, took over second three wide on the turn, floated out some entering the lane then rallied the last eighth to edged
ahead of MORO MAESTRO the final seventy yards. MORO MAESTRO vied for the early lead inside horses, moved clear on the bend, began to gradually
drift out upper stretch, held a straight path inside the final furlong, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was easily second best. SPIRIT SMOKE
chased from inside, came off the rail some for a clear path at the top of the lane, gained third with a furlong to go then could only just hold her position late.
DERBY DAY GOLD void of speed, though hustled along, came into the stretch three wide and passed between tired horses. SKIP TO BALI contested the
pace between horses, began to yield just off the rail on the turn, took the rail into the stretch and steadily faded. CUPID'S HOPE prominent toward the
outside on the backstretch, gave way four wide on the bend. HER SPEAKER'S ON displayed early speed from outside but faded widest on the turn.

Footnotes
FREE LOVE pressed from between horses, did not keep up while just off the inside into the bend, fanned out leaving the turn, rallied four wide and got up in
time. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL shared the early lead from outside, moved clear and stayed just off the inside on the turn, lengthened command upper stretch, was
all out inside the last furlong but did not have enough left. WILDWOOD POSSE chased from midpack while toward the outside, advanced three wide on the
bend, fanned outside FREE LOVE into the lane, rallied belatedly but drew away for third the last sixteenth. GOLD OAK displayed early speed inside horses,
did not stay with MIDNIGHT'S GIRL on the turn, angled outside that one nearing the end of a half mile and continued to gradually fade in the strech.
BEIRUT BEAUTY hesitated at the start, altered to the outside with four furlongs to go, lost ground widest through the bend and failed to have a significant
stretch bid. WAR COLORS slow and a bit awkward at the start, chased from outside, angled in at the half mile pole, was just off the rail taking the turn and
also had no serious response in the lane. DOROTA was a factor from outside on the backstretch but faded from contention four wide on the turn.
EMITYAAZ raced in contention early but began to yield along the rail before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
OFF TO THE RACES soon had the lead, showed the way just off the rail, was roused leaving the bend, widened command in the lane and proved much the
best under mild urging. CROWN ROYAL KID a stride slow at the break, advanced between rivals, did not stay close while four wide on the turn but drew off
for second outside rivals inside the final furlong. SMILE LIKE KYLE was bumped a time or two while in tight quarters along the rail from the half mile marker
to the seven-sixteenths pole, progressed along the rail through the bend and upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick but edged ahead for third.
KRUELESS raced in the second flight from outside, was three wide on the turn, moved clear for second leaving the bend but wore down between horses
the last eighth. SECRET HONOR jostled briefly with SMOOTH ATTACK at the start, angled in beside SMILE LIKE KYLE nearing the half mile pole,
bumping with that one a time or two approaching the turn, angled out some on the bend, moved out widest at the top of the lane and lacked a serious
stretch bid. C C RITHMS also jostled with SMOOTH ATTACK at the break, raced in the second flight on the backstretch but faded two wide on the turn.
SMOOTH ATTACK jostled briefly between horses at the start, recovered to race just off the early pace, was two then three wide taking the turn then gave
way through the stretch.
