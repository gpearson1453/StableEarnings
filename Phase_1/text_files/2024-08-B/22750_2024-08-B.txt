Footnotes
ANG N ASH tracked the top pair inside SMILING FOR NANA then got shuffled back a bit early, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the lane, rallied
steadily from outside, drew alongside APRIL VINTAGE late and drove past. APRIL VINTAGE away quickly and showed speed outside FISTY MITOLE,
came over to the put that rival in tight, moved over to the rail once in the clear, set the pace along the inside to the lane, roused in upper stretch, put to right
handed urging and led clear into the final sixteenth, drifted from the left hand late and could not hold off the winner. FEISTY MITOLE showed early speed
then got put in tight by APRIL VINTAGE and had to check along the fence, chased from the rail to the stretch, moved out in the lane still in striking distance
with a furlong left to run but weakened in the late stages. PUTT FOR DOUGH sat off the pace, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace while
earning a minor award. SMILING FOR NANA stalked the pace outside a rival, raced a bit greenly at the quarter pole, bothered by rival in upper stretch,
continued to race a bit greenly in the lane and weakened. LADY MARY LOU lacked early speed from inside, trailed to the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
ELECTOR dueled from inside into the first turn then cleared around the bend, led two wide through the second bend, drifted out from the left hand in upper
stretch, switched to the right to straighten out and drew off under urging. MOBOU broke in and bumped TAISHAN, traveled in the two path near the back,
raced outside a rival in the middle stages, exited the backstretch in the four path, angled down to the rail around the far turn, offered a mild rally near the
fence and bested the rest. TAISHAN took a bump from MOBOU at the start, tucked inside at the back, ridden along at the midway point, went between
rivals leaving the backstretch, moved to the rail on the turn then tipped back to the two path approaching the quarter pole, steered out in upper stretch and
gained the show. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT dueled from outside into the first turn then stalked the leader from outside, was three wide in pursuit of the winner
through the far turn, could not produce a bid in the lane and got outfinished for the place and show. KEEN HEIR forwardly placed in the two path briefly then
dropped off the pace, came under a ride on the far turn, entered the lane three to four wide and lacked a rally. NAUVOO got put in tight between rivals then
became rank into the first turn, settled inside well off the pace, pushed on through the middle stages, trailed on the inside then two wide through the second
bend and tired.

Footnotes
GIOVINAZZO quickly cleared and raced keenly in hand setting the early fractions, ridden along through the far turn in the two path, met bids from both sides
at the top of the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. KING APOLLO stalked three wide then three deep around the clubhouse turn,
asked four deep at the quarter pole, challenged from outside into the lane, drifted out from the left handed urging, battled with the winner in deep stretch and
got denied. RED CROSS KNIGHT tracked five wide leaving the chute then moved into the two path, started to pull on the clubhouse turn and tugged
forward eventually having to steady off heels at the five-eighths pole, stalked two wide on the far turn, asked at the top of the lane, finished willingly and
gained third. HOTROCKET (IRE) tracked the pace from the fence, ridden patiently saving ground on the far turn, launched a bid from inside into the stretch,
fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. BIG BET JAFINSAFA reserved to the back and trailed inside, angled four wide around the far turn, churned on
through the lane but needed to find more late. HULA CANDY unhurried in the beginning and steered over to the inside, coaxed along on the backstretch
had to pause behind a rival on the far turn, resumed urging leaving the bend, asked right hand and failed to respond. EGON was closest in pursuit from off
the rail to the far turn, chased three deep to the stretch and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
TENMA broke a step slow on the outside, raced widest at the back early on, gained five, four, then three wide around the turn, challenged three deep in
upper stretch and put a head in front at the eighth pole, battled outside MANCUSO through the final furlong and edged the runner-up. MANCUSO broke in
but was corrected, chased off the rail while climbing early, drew closer three then two wide around the bend, challenged between foes in upper stretch,
dueled inside TENMA in the late stages and finished gamely in defeat. USHA stumbled leaving the gate but recovered quickly to sprint clear and opened up
a comfortable lead, remained well clear near the inside to the quarter pole, held a diminished lead while ridden along into the lane, shied from the left hand
outside the eighth pole while begin overtaken, then weakened in deep stretch. OVETA'S HOBBY broke a step slow, coaxed along between rivals then
chased outside MANCUSO to the turn, rounded the bend four then three wide, lost position and drifted leaving the bend and weakened down the lane.
WREN raced off the pace up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, angled to the two path then eased back out leaving the bend and failed to
menace. MAC AND CHEESE broke in, chased from off the pace on the inside, saved ground to stretch and had little left for the drive.

IVAN THE GREAT reserved in the two path near the back early, drew closer three deep in the middle stages, chased three wide between on the far turn,
spun four wide into the stretch, collared SABERTOOTH at the sixteenth pole and dug in to edge past. SABERTOOTH stalked the speed outside a pair of
rivals, drew alongside the top pair on the backstretch and vied three deep into and around the far turn, took over into the stretch, resisted into the final
sixteenth and got edged late by the winner. UNCLE DUDE stalked between rivals in the two path, coaxed along on the far turn, came three wide into the
lane, finished willingly and gained third. SNOWDONIA stalked along the inside around both turns, tipped two wide into the stretch, chased within range
through the final furlong but finished evenly late. LEGITIMATE broke well and raced up close outside IMAGINARY LOVER then took a stalking position in
the two path, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, challenged for command then vied between rivals into the far turn, fought two wide into the
stretch, battled into deep stretch and faltered late. FRIENDLY CONFINES reserved along the inside, started to pull and had to take up behind a rival at the
five-eighths pole, saved ground through the far turn, lacked room and altered out with a furlong remaining and could not rally after. EARNED NOT GIVEN
broke a step slow, trailed along the fence early, steadied slightly behind FRIENDLY CONFINES early on the backstretch, continued at the back then went
outside a rival into the far turn, eased out and came four wide into the drive and failed to menace. TAB WALKER off slow in the beginning, raced three deep
at the back around the clubhouse turn, bid four deep leaving the backstretch, could not keep up and began to lose ground four then five wide on the far turn
and faded down the lane. IMAGINARY LOVER went up to take control from LEGITIMATE early and steered to the inside, cleared outer rival on the
clubhouse turn, took pressure from LEGITIMATE then vied inside rivals up the backstretch, battled inside a pair of foes holding a slight advantage through
the far turn, relinquished the lead entering the lane and gave way in the final furlong.

PALI KITTEN away quickly, pressed from outside then dueled past the half-mile pole, shook free approaching the quarter pole, drew off into the stretch,
grew weary in the late stages and managed to hold off the runner-up. UNBREAKABLE TRUST lifted slightly but still came away with the field, climbed briefly
shortly after and dropped back, raced along the rail into the turn, angled between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, spun four wide into the lane, closed in
steadily through the lane but ran out of time. TOPPERS AT SEASIDE raced at the back well off the rail, took the turn three to four wide and was along for
the show. ROAD TO ELDORADO stalked the top pair off the inside, went three wide into the turn, moved to the two path then chased three wide into the
lane and weakened. CLOUDY WOMEN was off alertly and went up to take control from PALI KITTEN, showed the way early under pressure from that rival,
fought on even terms past the half-mile pole, dueled to the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with the winner approaching the quarter pole and
tired down the lane. TIGER STRENGTH hustled from the gate, raced in range off the fence, dropped back two wide then along the rail around the bend and
faded.

GYPSY WOMAN (IRE) brushed with outer rival early, dueled from outside into the first turn then stalked two wide around the bend, applied pressure from
outside at the halfway point, lost touch with the leader early on the far turn, chased a bit off the rail to the stretch, drew alongside LLORONA once again
approaching the sixteenth pole and dug in late to edge clear. LLORONA moved right as the gates opened then bumped outer rival, went up to duel from
inside and cleared GYPSY WOMAN (IRE) around the first turn, took pressure from that rival at the half-mile pole, cleared again early on the far turn, showed
the way into the final furlong, tested once more entering the final sixteenth, finally yielded command and saved second, then was unsaddled on the
backstretch and transported off the track via equine ambulance. SHOCKING GREY broke well then ceded command and stalked outside a pair of rivals into
the first turn, dropped back off the pace and moved into the two path, roused two then three wide on the far turn, tipped out further in the lane, showed late
effort but could not get by LLORONA for second. IRISH PATSY brushed with inner rival early, unhurried after and moved into the two path then tucked
inside at the back on the first turn, saved ground trailing around the far turn, came off the rail in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally. SIXTEEN
ARCHES (IRE) settled along the fence, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole and could not rally. CAST MEMBER bumped by inner rival at the start,
stalked the pace from inside, crept closer backstretch, ridden along cutting the corner into the lane and weakened. INDY'S STAR stalked between foes then
outside a rival, tugged the rider along on the backstretch, ridden two wide on the second bend and weakened.

WAYNE THE BRAIN went up to duel for command outside WILD RECRUIT, battled inside MIRAHMADI through the turn, inched ahead at the top of the
lane, shook free midstretch and drew away in the final sixteenth. MIRAHMADI pressed the pace three deep, dueled outside WAYNE THE BRAIN around the
bend, kept the pressure to the eighth pole but faltered in the late stages. ARABIAN FLIRT chased from inside, came out past the half-mile pole, took the turn
three then four wide, kept trying through the lane and shared the show honors. SHOFNER lacked early speed, passed a rival on the turn, cut the corner into
the stretch and got up to share third at the wire. STICK SHIFT chased out of range, trailed past the five-sixteenths pole three to four wide and passed tired
rivals down the stretch. EISENHOWER raced up close four deep, lost ground four, five, then six wide on the turn and faded. WILD RECRUIT dueled from
inside up the backstretch, lost touch with outer rivals early on the turn, drifted off the rail late on the bend and tired.

Footnotes
MOMENT'S PLEASURE settled off the pace along the fence, sent through an opening at the quarter pole, tipped out into the stretch, bid between rivals and
took over at the eighth pole, asked left handed shortly after and drew clear in the final sixteenth under strong handling. ROSE MADDOX tucked inside racing
towards the rear, crept closer around the far turn still racing along the fence, steered out in upper stretch, rallied and edged COURT SNORT for second.
COURT SNORT traveled in the two path near the back, moved inside on the backstretch, hugged the rail to the stretch, moved out a bit in the final furlong,
closed determinedly and missed second. CORNELIA FORT tracked in the two path early then between rivals, coaxed along into the far turn, tipped three
wide at the quarter pole, showed late effort but got outkicked for the place and show. STAY AND SCAM raced in range from the two path around the first
turn then chased from off the pace, drew closer two then three wide on the far turn, bid three deep in upper stretch, lost touch with the winner with a
sixteenth remaining and flattened late. ABHITA allowed to settle at the back and moved inside, moved out to three path midway around the far turn, steered
out further in the lane and improved position. SNEAKER showed early speed and cleared inner rival approaching the clubhouse turn, moved inside, opened
up on the backstretch, remained clear while carrying a diminished lead into the stretch, yielded to outer rivals when confronted with a furlong left to run and
weakened in the late stages. SAFA rated three deep out of range, pushed on three then four wide on the second bend and failed to rally. ULTIMATE HY
pulled and became rank in the early stages, continued to tug two wide into the backstretch, chased three then two wide on the far turn, got boxed in briefly in
upper stretch and could not threaten once in the clear. UNCONTROLLABLE bobbled a bit at the start, raced outside a rival at the back early, trailed three
then two wide on the far turn and could not make an impact. WORTHY OF MAGIC broke well then took a stalking position and moved inside, was closest in
pursuit of the lone leader up the backstretch, chased between foes with a quarter mile remaining and faded through the lane.
