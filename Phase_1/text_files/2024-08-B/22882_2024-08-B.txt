Footnotes
TAKEITAWAY broke alertly to set a pressured pace from the rail, dueled with the runner-up through the turn surrendering the lead turning for home and
came again to out-battle the runner-up through the lane in a game effort. ELIZA VANCE pressed the pace from the onset, dueled on the bend taking the
lead at the quarter pole, drifted out in the lane and was out-finished in deep stretch in a good try as second best. SNEAKY FEET slow early to be at the rear
of the field, was urged along to keep pace with the pack, kept grinding throughout to be along for the show. RUMBLING stalked the leaders from the fence,
cut the corner turning for home and lacked a closing bid going evenly through the lane. QUALITY STORM well placed racing between rivals in striking
distance through the turn and flattened out in the stretch. LEOS WISH chased the leaders from three wide and dropped back in the lane.

Footnotes
PETE'S LEGACY tracked the run-off leader from the rail to the far turn, made a steady advance up the fence on the bend, cut the corner turning for home,
angled out around the wandering pacesetter in the lane and prevailed in the drive. CRUZIN N CURSIN unhurried for the first half mile, made up ground on
the final turn rallying between rivals to be five wide turning for home, angled to the inside of the tiring pacesetter in mid-stretch and finished well up the
inside. CUPID'S WAR bobbled a bit at the start, quickly regained his footing to take command, opened a clear lead down the backside, widened the
advantage on the turn and wandered about while tiring through the stretch run hanging on to the show spot. RAYFIELD raced mid-pack for three-quarters,
mounted a brief bid from four wide in upper stretch and finished evenly unable to sustain the rally. MONEY AGENT made an early bid down the backside to
be prominent on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. DRAFTSMAN trailed most of the way and was never a factor. CUCUY pressed the pace for a
half mile, came up empty and was eased to the wire.

ANOTHER MYSTERY tracked the leaders down the backside under patient handling, rallied on the far turn from five wide to be in striking distance and
reeled in his stablemate down the lane with a determined drive. TOWERING STORM stalked the pacesetter for five-eighths, rallied three wide on the turn to
take command nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and finished willingly while unable to hold off the winner. SILVER
QUARTERS slow early to trail the field through the first turn, remained unhurried down the backside while closing the gap to the leaders, rallied angling five
wide at the head of the stretch and finished willingly while unable to get to the top pair. MAN ON ATTACK set the pace on a clear, well rated lead to the far
turn and had no response when engaged on the final bend.

Footnotes
EMPIRE BUILDER set the pace on a comfortable lead while under mild pressure, responded when called upon turning for home to open a clear lead, drifted
out down the lane and dug-in gamely in the final strides to just hold on. READTHECLIFFNOTES reserved off the pace to the far turn, was set to a drive
early on the bend, cut the corner turning for home and mounted a good rally along the fence to get to even terms with the leader in the final yards and lost
the bob in a good effort. ARDANWOOD stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied on the turn to loom at the quarter-pole and was unable to sustain the
bid in the lane while finishing as best of the rest. SIVAKO broke off balance and was immediately bumped by inside rival causing him to give the field sever
lengths and showed some late interest in the stretch having lost his chance at the gate. WHAT A COUNTRY was not a threat. RUNWITHHEART pressed
the pace for a half, came up empty and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
MOHAAFETH reserved off the pace to the five-sixteenths pole, rallied up the fence cutting the corner turning for home and wore down his rivals with a
steady rail rally. STRANGE ARRANGE set the pace on a clear lead to the quarter pole, responded when challenged turning for home and was out-finished
in deep stretch. GOOD APPLE stalked the pace through the turn to be well placed, lacked a response when called upon at the quarter pole, dropped back in
the lane losing ground and came again late. BREAKING NEWS tracked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied to loom in upper stretch and finished evenly.
PHILIPSBURG (IRE) went evenly never posing a threat.

Footnotes
ONE PUTT RICHIE stalked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied three wide, engaged the pacesetter in mid-stretch and pulled away convincingly. UNCLE
HEADLEY dueled on the lead in the early going, opened a clear advantage on the turn, responded when challenged in upper stretch, was no match for the
winner but kept-on willingly to be a clear second best. MALIGATOR slow early to be far back, angled out in the stretch and showed late interest to be along
for the show. BE LUCKY pressed the pace from the inside to the turn, dropped back losing ground on the bend and finished evenly. OVER CALENDARED
raced mid-pack and lacked a response when called upon. DEMAND RANSOM went evenly failing to menace. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN was not a threat.
SOVIET STANDARD was not a factor.

Footnotes
CROSSANNA unhurried for the first half mile to trail, made a steady advance on the far turn, rallied five wide turning for home to take command in
mid-stretch, opened a clear advantage and held the closer safe in the late going. MACHIVA reserved off the pace for five eighths, rallied turning for home
and chased the winner home through the lane to be second best. DEAL'EM AND WEEP stalked the pace to midway on the far turn, rallied to the lead in
upper stretch and was outkicked late when unable to sustain the bid. DATAW ISLAND set the pace down the backside under mild pressure, opened a clear
lead on the final bend and weakened coming home. MY VERSION tracked the leaders from the fence to be well placed and lacked a closing rally. ELODINE
leapt at the start, hustled to prompt pace and tired coming home. TIZMEONEMORETIME chased the leaders from four wide to the far turn and flattened out
dropping out of contention. THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER-UP CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, UPON REVIEW THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SAMARITA hustled up the fence to duel on the early lead, took command nearing the turn, opened a clear lead, repelled challenge turning for home and
drew off through the lane. FIRST KITTEN restless in the gate being hard to straighten her head, broke awkwardly to be a step slow, had path taken away by
the inside rival for a step, dropped back giving the field many lengths, settled into stride and circled the field racing wide in the lane with a belated rally to be
up for the show. RACEDAY ATTIRE dueled from between rivals on the pace in the early going, settled in hand to track the leaders and made a grinding rally
through the stretch. TRIPLE SCOUT pressed the pace from three wide to the turn, challenged nearing the quarter pole and was unable to sustain the bid
through the lane finishing evenly. LILY'S WOOFY chased the leaders from three wide through the turn while in contention and flattened out coming home.
BETTY'S SECRET went even as no threat and raced erratically through the lane. THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER UP CLAIMED FOUL FOR
INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER LEAVING THE GATE, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.THE WINNING PLACE PIC EIGHT

Footnotes
APRIL'S GEM stalked the leader through the far turn gradually narrowing the advantage while still in hand, was called upon in upper stretch to quickly
overhaul the tiring pacesetter and drew away as much the best. COTTON CANDY ANNIE raced mid-pack while rated off the leaders for the first half and
made a steady advance to be up for the place. KINGSBURY DREAM reserved off the pace while well in hand, rallied on the turn closing from five wide in
the lane and showed good late energy to just miss the place. TRIBEST (ARG) took command shortly away from the gate, opened a wide advantage on the
backside to be loose on the lead to the top of the lane and tired in the strech. TAPERINEA tracked the leaders through the first turn, made an early move to
be well placed down the backside and weakened coming home. ROMANTIC ATTACK raced near the rear of the field and showed mild late interest without
impact. SENSE OF SELF well placed while racing along the fence down the backside, travelled with her head cocked to the outside most of the backstretch
and failed to respond when called upon on the final turn. LOTTA ROSES was the distant trailer early and never posed a threat. ZENCHUA SKY was not a
factor.
