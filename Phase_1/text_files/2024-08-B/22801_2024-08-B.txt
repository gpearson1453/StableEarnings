IT'S FATE unhurried early, circled his field five wide through the stretch under right handed urging and was along in time. K P SILVER BULLET stalked the
early pace, rallied three wide through the far turn, made the lead in upper stretch then couldn't hold off the winner. OPEN OUT bore in bumping KLAATU
into UNIDENTIFIED MAN at the start, was never far back and improved position late three wide. LEXATOGA always within striking distance, loomed boldly
along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished. UNIDENTIFIED MAN was bumped hard at the start, battled for the lead two wide around the clubhouse
turn, gained the advantage, edged clear on the far turn then came up empty in the final furlong. KLAATU was bumped hard from his outside into
UNIDENTIFIED MAN at the start, contested the early lead along the rail, kept pressure into the stretch then weakened.

MANAGING MISCHIEF chased the early pace, responded readily two wide to make the lead at the quarter pole, opened a daylight advantage before mid
stretch and prevailed under strong handling. MOMENT TO SHINE stalked the early pace three wide, drifted to the middle of the racetrack entering the
stretch and finished clear for second. GRACIE DANCE went evenly. MY SUZIE Q trailed, ran up on the tiring GETAWAY BAY'S heels at the furlong marker
and lost momentum. GETAWAY BAY was hustled to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace along the rail for nearly a half then was used up.

LADY JASPER stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, responded readily to make the lead at the top of the stretch and finished full of run under brisk
handling to win as much the best. THE MIRACLE KIUT away alertly, the pace two wide past the quarter pole then was no match for the winner while gamely
holding on for second. MISSION GIRL pressed the pace along the rail and was outfinished. OUT FOR FUN was outrun. BROWNIE allowed to settle, began
to close ground nearing the quarter pole, suffered a catastrophic injury, fell and was euthanized. CROSSED UP tracked the pace four wide for six furlongs,
fell over the fallen rival past the quarter pole and was walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

SWEEPING GIANT always within striking distance, responded readily when set down nearing the top of the stretch, rallied three wide to make the lead
before the furlong marker then drew off under mild left handed urging to win as much the best. CRYO pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch
and was no match for the winner while clearly second best. RANDELLO close up along the rail, checked repeatedly from the half mile marker to the seven
sixteenths pole, dropped back then passed tiring rivals late. HERD IMMUNITY failed to menace. AUGER away alertly, set the pace along the rail to the top
of the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. NO ANGEL pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half.
