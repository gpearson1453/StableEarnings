Footnotes
CONDITIONAL was under a snug hold near the back outside challengers in the early going, rallied two wide splitting foes into the turn, circled three wide
around horses by the quarter pole, steadily gained on the leader down the stretch, took over control between rivals with seventy yards from home and held
safe with runners on both sides at the wire. BOSTON BAY was unhurried to trail on the fence along the backside, edged closer on the rail with three
furlongs left to go, shifted outside at the quarter pole, found his best stride late closing in five wide in the stretch but could not get to the winner in time.
STOLZER ONKEL was brushed inside to start, quickly seized command down the back straight, opened up with three eighths remaining, continued to be up
top but by a diminishing margin straightening out for home, dug in stubbornly to the line but could not hold off oncoming rivals a few jumps before the wire.
CHEAP SPEED was brushed outside to begin, forced the pace on the rail in the early going, chased just behind the pacesetter throughout the turn, was in
range on the rail turning for home and ran on willingly down the lane but evened out in deep stretch for a minor role. HEY LUIGI tracked three wide outside
rivals down the back straight, chased the frontrunner two wide outside around the bend, was hard ridden with horses on both sides at the quarter pole trying
keep up with the leaders but failed to menace in the drive to the finish line. ACADIA settled in midfield four deep outside rivals along the backside, could not
match strides with others while running three wide outside horses with three furlongs to go, angled out to the four path for the stretch drive but could not be
a factor in the late runnung.

Footnotes
BOLD RELOAD took control right from the onset, was hounded briefly outside while setting the pace at the half, edged clear from rivals in upper stretch to
opened up convincingly when urged left-handed with a furlong to go and drew away comfortably for the front running score. ARASHI was allowed to settle at
the back of the pack along the backside, began to mount a run, picking up runners outside with three furlongs remaining, angled out widest in the eight path
for the drive, continued to go by rivals outside in the stretch and got up at the wire to be a distant but second best on this day. GUNS N' ROJAS settled
between horses near the back after the start, crept closer with runners on both sides around the bend, shifted out to be six wide for the drive to the wire and
ran on determinedly between foes late to just get nosed out for the second money battle. PRINCE OF THIEVES stalked on the fence along the backside,
had to wait behind a rival on the rail midway through the turn, found a seam in the four path turning for home and finished up with intent to the wire, dueling
for the place share but unfortunately was on the losing end of a three way photo for the place share. COLONEL MUSTARD was ahead of only one foe down
the backside, saved ground on the turn but trailed the field with five sixteenths left to run, lacked running room when behind runners in the two path in upper
stretch and finished up with good energy to almost get involved in the place photo at the wire. MUSICAL SPELL tracked three wide on the outside in the
early going, took closer order to chase the pacesetting winner outside by the half, was still in the hunt three wide straightening out for the drive but yielded
with runners on both sides in the final sixteenth of a mile. VALLEY VICTORY travelled three wide outside foes in midfield down the backstretch, regressed
while running three wide outside horses on the turn, shifted out in the seven path between rivals in upper stretch but could not get into contention driving to
the finish line. TOWN'S WARRIOR settled on the rail in the third flight along the back straight, improved on the fence around the turn to be in the mix two
wide at the top of the lane but gave way on the fence by mid-stretch. KINETIC STONE track on the inside in the early going, took some awkward steps
being shuffled back some at the half, shifted out five wide at the top of the lane to be in range of the leader but had little left and retreated at the furlong
marker.

Footnotes
MI TORMENTA bumped the inner rival a few strides out of the gate, was unhurried at the back racing inside, saved ground early on the turn, began to move
out while advancing nearing the quarter pole, angled out further at the top of the stretch to be eight wide past the three-sixteenths and under stout urging,
was flying late to get up in time. SUMMER SNOW got away alertly and set the pace from off the rail in the two path, moved out a bit further for the drive still
with a similar advantage, was outfinished. AMERICAN GAMBLE stalked up close from outside four to five wide, kept on late and held show. SUGAR IS
GOLDEN settled mid-pack off the leaders racing off the inside, swung six wide for the drive, finished up with mild late gain but missed show. TEMPORA
chased three to four wide, was between runners in the stretch, needed more late. SILENT GUROO was bumped fairly hard shortly after the break, chased
from in behind on or just off the rail, was encouraged along but lacked the needed late response. DEMURELY broke a step slowly and lost the path, was
never a threat.

Footnotes
ROCK IT RED settled smartly on the rail, tracking the front two down the backside, patiently waited behind the embattled trio at the quarter pole, burst
between runners when a seam in the two path opened up straightening out for home and relentlessly fought on, wearing down the frontrunner in deep
stretch to secure the win with seventy yards to go. FOREST WOODSMAN had a slim lead inside down the backstretch, edged away under a good hold for a
clear lead at the half, continued up front but was hounded outside throughout the turn, dug in stubbornly in upper stretch but could not fend of the surging
winner in the final seventy yards. SCREEN LEGEND tossed his head at the start to trail in the beginning, was rank early on, fighting the rider on the fence
after the break, finally settled nicely into stride by mid-backstretch, shifted outside gathering good speed with five sixteenths left to run, angled six wide
turning for home, was full of run but could not threaten the front duo to the wire and ended up a clear third in the end. QUESTION MARK prompted the pace
outside in the early going, was then content to sit just back off the frontrunner with a half mile to go, was hard ridden keeping pace and position vying
between horses up top at the quarter pole, could not find more late and faded with challengers on both sides in the final furlong to settle on the fringes in the
end. UNCLE'S THE BANKER tracked the lead pair outside down the back straight, moved in to force the pace three wide outside rivals by the quarter pole,
angled out in the five path dueling for a piece of the prize with others at the top of the stretch, could not continue on and tired between foes in the two path
at the furlong marker. JOEYBONES trailed outside foes at the half, was roused but could still see the field through the turn, could not be a presence in the
stretch drive but did pass a weary runner outside with a furlong left to go. TROPICAL GETAWAY had a stalking role, ahead of a couple of horses through
the backstretch, made little headway while scrubbed for more around the bend and had nothing to offer for the drive, wilting by upper stretch.

MOMENT OF PEACE got away well then settled off the leader content to stalk that one, edged closer early on the turn, took command nearing the
five-sixteenths, drew clear through the stretch and was kept to the task. AGILE DANCER settled outside off the pace, raced mostly four to five wide, angled
nine wide turning for home, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, was no match for the winner, saved the place. TODAY settled off the pace, went three to four
wide into the turn, was in eight quarters near the three-eighths, shifted eight wide turning for home, finished up to improve position getting up for show and
narrowly missing place. SNOOKERED tracked from inside mid-pack, saved ground on the turn, swung out five wide turning for home drifted in through the
stretch and was outkicked for the minor awards. RED ENSIGN broke outwardly, stalked from outside, was three to four wide through the turn, angled out six
wide at the top of the stretch then steadily drifted in through upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. STAR SCHOLAR broke a step slowly, was allowed
to settle early then encouraged forward between runners three wide, dropped back three to four wide on the turn, angled six wide at the top of the stretch
and ran on. TREBUCHET broke a half-step slowly, moved forward between runners up the backstretch, was in tight between entering the turn and dropped
back a bit, came out a path late on that bend then angled in once in upper stretch, needed more late. PROFESORRIDESAGAIN quickly made the lead
under early encouragement, set the pace inside, drifted out leaving the turn, faltered and faded in the stretch. PER RULING 2811192 FROM THE
ALCOHOL AND GAMING COMMISSION OF ONTARIO, AGILE DANCER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

TRICKY MAGICIAN stalked near the rear on the inside of rivals at the half, began to pick up the bit when asked in the two path between rivals in midturn,
angled five wide for the stretch run gathering momentum and exploded past many runners from the eighth pole to the wire to get up for a well timed late
rally. WARP RIDE was nestled on the fence watching the top two battle along the backside, waited on the fence behind foes through the turn, shifted out
from the two path in upper stretch while behind the dueling leaders for clear run in the four wide at the furlong marker and quickly gained on the front pair
but was just outkicked by the winner who had a full head of steam in deep stretch. EXCHANGE DAY settled at the back, five deep outside horses at the
half, lost ground while shifting in through the turn to get to the rail, closed the gap on the leaders in upper stretch and had a good late rail rally in the stretch
to close in a capture third money. BLACKTECA bobbled on the start, recovered quickly to emerge from the pack to have the lead in the early going, was
reined back on the fence to let another rival go forward into the turn, shifted outside to re-engage for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled with an inside foe in
upper stretch, finally got the better of him with a sixteenth left to run but could not find more late to fend off the closing rivals on both sides a few jumps
before the wire. GHOUL (BRZ) settled in the middle of the pack between horses in the three path in the early going, was nudged on to take closer order,
tracking the front two while three wide around the bend, loomed a threat in the four path at the top of the stretch but could not offer a finish in the late stages
of the race. QUARKY broke in a tangle to miss the start, trailed early on, then was hustled six deep outside foes down the backstretch to clear to the rail for
the lead with three furlongs to go, was collared outside by a runner with a quarter left to run, fought on stubbornly inside until the seventy-yard pole but had
no more in the tank by then and folded in deep stretch. SUNSPEAR settled close to the back of the pack, four wide between horses along the backstretch,
kept pace with inside rivals when roused three wide throughout the turn, was fanned out in the seven path at the top of the lane and failed to fire in the drive
to the wire.

Footnotes
RED RIVER REBEL settled mid-pack inside, was blocked a bit on the turn losing some position shuffled back, came out turning for home then further still in
upper stretch to be eight wide and with aim, struck the lead about the sixteenths out and just held from a fast-closing rival. FORESTER'S FORTUNE settled
at the rear, waited in behind and between runners briefly about the five-eighths then again from past the three-eighth till the top of the stretch, was angled
eleven wide at that juncture then out a further two paths to go around a rival in upper stretch, was gaining fast in late stretch but just missed. JAZZ HANDS
was urged to the lead taking command about the nine-sixteenths, shifted in dictating terms from closer to but off the rail, kept on late but was simply
outkicked. AIR COMBAT settled stalking into the turn, raced three wide on that bend, angled seven deep turning for home, made a mild bid in mid-stretch
past the furlong marker but had no extra for the lane. COTTON settled off the pace, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths, was twelve wide in upper stretch,
kicked on mildly but needed more. RAT PORTAGE was forced out just a bit at the start, settled off the pace, was forced five to six wide through the turn,
swung nine deep into upper stretch, ran on with mild late interest but was not enough. GALVASTON quickly obtained a narrow early lead albeit soon
overtaken, settled into stride off the new leader switching outside foes about the nine-sixteenths, was within range three wide coming to the top of the
stretch, weakened late. MOON LANDING bobbled ever so slightly at the start, was unhurried racing well back, failed to menace. QUITE READY exchanged
a very light brush at the start, settled back of the leaders near mid-pack, went four to five wide early on the turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch, failed
to rally. AIM FOR THE SKY broke outwardly, stalked from outside, was within range nearing the five-sixteenths, faltered and faded. TRUEBELIEVE
exchanged very minor contact at the start, was urged to the lead after the opening sixteenth, had a brief early lead racing just off the fence, dropped back
and continued to chase from about the two path, faded.

Footnotes
GUNNAWIN settled on the rail in the third flight in the early stages, closed in with authority at the three eighths pole measuring the engaged leaders around
the far turn, pounced outside in the three path straightening out for the drive and went on by at the furlong marker to draw away sharply in the end. NOW
YOU SEE ME made a good move early on, weaving between rivals to get to the rail from the outside post entering the first turn, settled on the fence in
mid-pack along the backside, improved on the rail three furlongs out, mounted a rally shifting out three wide midway on the far turn going around runners,
angled out four wide for the drive and closed in late to best the rest at the finish line. CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS tracked outside in the early going, prompted
the pace three deep outside early into the backstretch, bid for the lead, poking her head in front momentarily at the quarter pole and could not go on with the
top two late, losing the place share inside in deep stretch. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY was unhurried to trail the field in the beginning, progressed four deep
outside rivals down the backstretch, advanced four to six wide around foes in the final turn, was floated out, widest in the eight path to trail the pack again
turning for home, never gave way and fought on courageously to come on again to get up for a minor role at the wire. ZODIAC BEACH hopped at the start,
trailed the field at the half, started to catch up to rivals outside at the quarter pole and in the three path finished up willingly to the line, passing many runners
in the final furlong. RUMOURS FLY was ahead of only a few runners down the backside, took closer order, slipping up the fence with five sixteenths to go,
shifted out to be four wide turning for home but was one paced in the stretch and could not pose a threat. MRS. HOT SHOT had a tracking role on the fence
in the beginning, closed in to press the issue between runners along the backside, could not quicken with the leaders through the far turn and backed away
three wide by mid-stretch. HURRICANE GIZMO settled in midfield outside horses, was roused with others on both sides while running three wide at the
three-furlong pole making little impression around the final bend, angled to the six path at the top of the lane but lacked a rally in the stretch running. BIRCH
BARK travelled outside rivals in the third flight in the early parts of the race, was asked for more while in the two path between foes with three furlongs left to
run with little progress through the far turn and in the five path had little to offer in the stretch drive. HIGH TREASON stalked near the rear on the rail down
the backside, continued to take the shortest way around on the final turn and could not be factor in the stretch running inside. FOREVER DANISH was
hustled early to clear to the rail for the lead, slowed the pace down while still up top along the backside, was headed outside at the quarter pole, re-rallied in
upper stretch to regain a slight advantage on the inside with a furlong to go, began to get leg weary with a sixteenth from home and stopped on the fence a
few strides before the finish line.
