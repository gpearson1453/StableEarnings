Footnotes
QUICK FINISH took command early, established an open lead of two to three lengths into the backstretch run, extended on the far turn and drew away in
the stretch. CONTINENTAL UNION stumbled coming out of the gate, trailed the field to the quarter pole then began a forward move through the far turn,
and rallied up the rail in the stretch to gain second. QUICK INTRO bobbled at the start and spotted the field a couple of lengths head start, rushed forward
the first time across the finish line and got a tracking position behind QUICK FINISH, chased that one to the far turn, could not match strides when that foe
pulled away and was unable to hold the place. NATIONHEART took a bump from QUICK FINISH after the break then became rank through the early
stages, had to be pushed on to hold the third position heading down the backstretch, dropped to last before the last turn and was unable to improve position
in the stretch. RAY OF THE SEA broke well then ducked into the gap near the eighth pole, crashed through the inside rail and left the course, was caught by
the outrider in the infield and walked off.

Footnotes
TOPANTICIPATION (GB) tracked in second position for two furlongs then slipped inside an opening along the rail, took command, let the field through the
last two turns a won clear as much the best. A CROWN FOR KITTEN outrun early, started a forward move going into the third turn and finished best to gain
the second spot. A BROKEN BREEZE stumbled at the break and then tracked mid-pack two wide for the first half of the race, got to the rail with a half-mile
to run, was kept to task and finished willingly but lacked a winning bid. LADY RANGER seized the early lead but raced in the two path and left the rail open
for TOPANTICIPATION (GB) coming out of the far turn for the first time, started to weaken after a half mile, dropped back through the field down the
backstretch the second time chased the rest of the way while managing to pass one near the finish. LUTE'S DIAMOND was not asked for speed from the
break and allowed to settle behind the pace early, kept to the inside and emerged from the first turn tracking TOPANTICIPATION (GB) from the second
position, had to be ridden down the backstretch the second time to keep up, started to lose ground on the last turn and was not a factor from that point.

AIRKITA was hustled to the front and dueled with BRONZE GIRL for a half-mile, took command at the top of the stretch and held clear. BRONZE GIRL
showed speed, dueled two wide with AIRKITA through one full circuit, gave way in the stretch but held second. TEASPOON OF PEPPER was mid-pack
early while racing three wide, went into a drive with three furlongs to run, advanced on the dueling leaders on the last turn, came into the stretch three wide
and continued to close ground but came up short. WARNING SOUND trailed through much of the early going, kept to the inside, saved ground on the last
turn but could not improve. MO SUGAFOOT bobbled at the break, spotted the field a little bit of a head start, shifted away from the inside down the
backstretch then went four wide through the far turn and was not a factor. ARCTIC FIRE was pulled up going into the first turn and transported off of the
track in the equine ambulance.

Footnotes
GENTLE JULIA broke well then veered out sharply, causing SAINT HELEN to have to take up, straightened then rushed up through the clubhouse turn and
caught and dueled with GALWAY SHAWL from the three furlong pole then put that rival away with a sixteenth to run and prevailed. HARBOR DEAREST
veered in at the start and made contact with GALWAY SHAWL, dropped over to the rail when clear and was content to trail, was pulling on the rider through
the clubhouse turn then advanced into contention down the backstretch, launched a bid from the quarter pole, continued the run into the stretch, was rapidly
gaining on GENTLE JULIA but came up short. GALWAY SHAWL got pinballed after the break but escaped from the and secured the lead past the finish line
for the first time, got company from GENTLE JULIA past the three furlong mark, dueled that rival to mid-stretch, then gave way under left handed urging.
LITTLEQUEENOFMEAN broke well then was put in tight spot as a result of the fracas between SAINT HELEN and GENTLE JULIA to the inside, raced
forwardly through the clubhouse turn two to three wide, tracked behind the dueling leaders to the far turn, launched a bid from the quarter pole and finished
with some interest but was not enough. STANDFORGRIT broke outward at the start but avoided the action from the inside posts, raced mid-pack while
about three wide throughout, was making mild gains in the stretch run but was not enough to threaten. SAINT HELEN broke well then took up sharply when
GENTLE JULIA came over sharply, chased the field through the early stages then made a mid-race move to get close before the final turn but could not
sustain that move into the stretch and was outfinished. GOLDEN PINUP stumbled at the start then veered out making light contact with GALWAY SHAWL,
raced near the back of the field and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MASTER RECOVERY vied for the early lead then took over after a furlong, was allowed to dictate pedestrian fractions while maintaining a clear advantage,
quickened away with a quarter mile to run, opened up a big lead then sprinted clear to a comfortable victory. SATANTA was content to stalk MASTER
RECOVERY while letting that one set the pace, was unable to quicken with that foe in the final sprint for home but kept to task and won the battle for
second. BIG FLAME raced mid-pack through the early going while racing three wide, made bold move when the pace picked up going into the last turn,
finished well but could not catch SATANTA for the second spot while finishing clear of the rest. MOUNT PELLIAR raced three wide for most of the race,
tracked near the rear of the field, tried to launch a bid with about three furlongs to run, finished best of the second group but well behind the top three. FORD
FLYER rushed up on the inside after the break, became rank going through the far turn the first time, saved ground the rest of the way but had nothing to
offer in the late stages. HALF THROTTLE broke last, rushed up into traffic and took up before going into the first turn, chased the rest of the way and never
made an impact.
