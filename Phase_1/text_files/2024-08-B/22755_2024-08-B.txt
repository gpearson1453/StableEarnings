Footnotes
SHEILA'S MISSION stumbled slightly at the start, was unhurried early, made a four wide middle move through the second turn, collard dream diamond in
mid stretch, dueled with that rival briefly and edged clear in late stretch. DREAM DIAMOND was allowed to settle early, loomed three wide into the second
turn, took control at the three furlong maker, angled in, was collard by the winner, drifted out late and finished second best. AWESOME EMPRESS raced in
mid pack early, saved ground along the inside into the home turn, angled out to the five path through the turn, shifted in late and flattened late. TARIBA
DREAM was void of any early speed, raced six wide through the second turn, passed rivals late and offered no late rally. I LOVE IRELAND was outrun
early, saved ground early, angled out to the seven path through the home turn and never fired. NOUVEAU RICHE was taken back early, raced four wide
through the second turn and was never in contention. BARBARESCO BABY set a clear early pace, raced off the rail through the turns and was finished
early. ALL ABOUT KATZ followed the early pace, raced along the inside into the second turn and faded. BASILICA LIGHT was reserved from between
rivals and was empty.
