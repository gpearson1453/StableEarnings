Footnotes
WHISKEY N SODA fractious in the gate prior to the start, got bumped at the start by FRIZZANTE, who broke inwards, came under coaxing and chased four
then three wide, briefly tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing near the half mile pole, went three wide through the far turn,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch when the leader drifted out carrying out a pair of foes and inherited command, edged away under a drive, dug in
under growing late threat to the outside and just held on to prevail. FRIZZANTE broke in at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, chased five then four
wide, came under coaxing briefly three wide near the half mile pole, went four wide through the far turn and was carried out six wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive rallying on the outside and just missed on the wire. ANDY CANT coaxed from the gate to the front, raced three wide in closest aim of the
leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got floated out five wide into upper stretch as the leader drifted out four wide at the quarter pole and in turn
carried FRIZZANTE six wide to his outside, dug in under a drive tucking inwards and rallied to be between foes inside the final sixteenth and missed at the
end. CHALKY CAT a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start and inspired by WHISKEY N SODA, chased just off the inside and then along the inside
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths back in the two path, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish angling
out late from in behind rivals. INCANTATION broke in striking the near side stall at the start, came under light coaxing and established the front shortly after
the break and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing under pressure with five-sixteenths to go, drifted out four wide at the quarter
pole carrying out ANDY CANT and FRIZZANTE five and six wide into upper stretch and yielded the front straightened away, then weakened through to the
finish. ALLIED ATTACK stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground, chased five then four wide before tucking three wide into the far turn and faded, got
eased along and cornered three wide into upper stretch and was eased home through to the finish.

Footnotes
LADY FIREFOOT was taken under restraint early, saved ground on the first turn, tugged keenly on the bit while hard held inside the three-quarter pole,
raced off the pace under reserve, was let out near the seven-sixteenths pole, moved from the rail to the two path while roused on the far turn, spun three
wide into the stretch, chased the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, gained on that foe into the final sixteenth and got up to prevail. HIGHWAY
HARMONY came away in good order, was taken in hand and let the pacesetter cross in front early, went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the
pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, took the lead into upper stretch then shook clear, swapped back to her inside lead while
under threat coming to the sixteenth-pole, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to hold the place. WISH LIST stumbled at the start and was
off slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved from the three path to the five path while roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch in
the six path, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished with good energy to get up for the show. FROM HELLO went two to three wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained in the final furlong and
finished willingly to just miss the show. SACRED IMAGE tucked in down the opening straightaway, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved
off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn and lacked the needed kick. ALETTE D'ORO settled on the inside, was urged along on the
far turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop and lacked the needed response. MAGIC EIGHT BALL angled in while going to the front, showed the way
while inside on the turns, was asked on the second bend, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. DESTINE TO RACE went around the first
turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

DUNEDIN CAUSEWAY got away to an awkward start and came out bumping and pinching back FOUR EYES in tandem with IRIE MAN, who came
inwards, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, tipped out to the two path placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled two to
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge a furlong out, seized narrow command at the sixteenth marker and inched away to the
finish kept busy to the end. MAMA'S MIDDIE broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand along the inside and then just off the inside
from the half mile pole, tucked back inside at the five-sixteenths trading lanes with the aforementioned foe at that station, took the inside route into upper
stretch roused for the drive and dug in coming under challenge a furlong out, got collared a sixteenth from home and fought on inside to the finish clear for
the place honors. IRIE MAN coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, offered up a mild kick. BRACA coaxed from the start, chased three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. FOUR EYES got bumped between foes and was pinched back just after the break conceding three to four lengths to
the front, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped four to five wide at the head of the stretch and improved position to the finish.
SAFFREDI chased five then four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, tipped six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. IRISH TIDES
loaded in the gate sans rider, tossed his head at the break and was off a beat slow and conceded three lengths to the front before settling into stride,
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. DISCO DANCER chased five to
six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three then two wide through the turn and placed to coaxing with three furlongs to run, cornered
two to three wide at the top of the stretch, made no impact.

PAY THE JUICE was hustled from the gate, chased then pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path midway through the turn, was
asked near the five-sixteenths pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. ONE
VISION chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive while outside in the stretch and was second best.
ARMY PROUD brushed the outside of the gate at the start, showed speed inside of a foe then chased the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then
moved to the two path, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but earned the show. SWIFT MAGIC was sent hard to the
front, showed the way down the backstretch, moved from the two path to the rail on the turn, lost the lead under urging with three furlongs to run, battled
under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SON OF HONOR was sent hard from the start then urged along off the pace,
chased in the two then three path on the turn, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and came up empty. STORMY BIRTHDAY was
last to commence then ridden along at the rear, went around the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the four path and was no factor.

BREATH AWAY (GB) settled tracking the front just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths and remained patiently handled until
roused spinning from the two path into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps
to prevail over a pair between rivals on the wire. TAX IMPLICATIONS (GB) three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and
angled three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly through the final eighth but missed at the end. MALLEYMOO settled just
off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim isolated between that rival and the main flight in behind, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under growing threat from a pair of rivals and was caught in the
final jumps by both while safe for the show honors. SWOOP TO FINISH tracked the front from just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole and angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the last major share. ELOUNDA QUEEN
(IRE) broke in at the start half a beat slow and was forced to steady in behind MALLEYMOO, chased along the inside from near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid kicking home belatedly to the finish. QUARREL
established the front and spurted away from the two path through the first turn into the backstretch, widened and took the inside route into the far turn with
seven-sixteenths to go, had the field take closer order and spun just off the inside into upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in under threat and was
collared a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. CAROLINE STREET chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
four wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. TITLED LADY broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TRICKY TEMPER showed speed between horses, dropped just off the pace leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, gained four wide
into the stretch then made a bid near the three-sixteenths pole, took over outside the furlong marker, disposed of the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole
and drove clear to prove much the best. LEELOO pressed the pace on the outside, dropped from the four path to the three path early on the turn, had the
rider take a look behind him late on that bend, took a short lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and proved no
match while clear for the place. SECURITY CODE pressed the pace on the inside, chased along the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. MAJESTIC RETURN went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the three
path to the two path early on the turn, was asked around the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the
final furlong and tired. COUSIN KRISTI chased the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
CAPTAINSDAUGHTER was urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the three then four path, floated into
the seven path entering the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VINO ROUGE three wide through the first turn in mid pack, settled three wide just off the pace, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four
wide into upper stretch roused for the drive, took over command with three-sixteenths to go, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under
threat and shied out being shown a left handed crop and got tugged on the right rein and came out forcing WRIGLEYVILLE to check a sixteenth from home
which in turn forced both PRETTY ANA and TOY COLLECTOR to check and alter in inside that station in turn forcing a chain of steadied and checks back
through to HOPESNDREAMS, dug in under threat and held on to prevail. MIXOLOGIST four then three wide into the first turn, settled just off the inside into
the backstretch, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the finish. DANCING DEAN settled two to three wide at the tail of the field,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out widest of all eight to nine wide at the top of the stretch, closed well and belatedly to the finish to
secure the show honors. WRIGLEYVILLE got bumped at the start by HOPESNDREAMS, who recovered outwards from a bobble and in turn bumped
PRETTY ANA, tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
inside the final furlong and was forced to check at the sixteenth marker when impeded by VINO ROUGE getting directed out to look MIXOLOGIST in the
eye and in turn forced a pair of rivals in behind to check and alter inwards and couldn't recover to the finish. PRETTY ANA got bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe due to pressure from HOPESNDREAMS, settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing just past the
five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive when forced to check off the heels of WRIGLEYVILLE and alter inwards
nudging the steadying TOY COLLECTOR in with her and forcing GREAVETTE to steady now in behind them and didn't recover to the wire. TOY
COLLECTOR got paused in tight between foes briefly at the start, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field patiently handled until set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, angled out a path or two a furlong out, then got forced to steady just inside the sixteenth pole and was nudged
to the inside by PRETTY ANA when WRIGLEYVILLE got impeded directly in front and was taken hold of through to the finish. GREAVETTE raced three
then two wide through the first turn and settled in closest aim of the leader three wide, tucked to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch om near even terms for command, dug in under a drive and was forced to steady when weakening
inside the final seventy yards to the finish. HOPESNDREAMS bobbled at the break recovering outwards and bumping WRIGLEYVILLE into PRETTY ANA,
showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, got collared with
three-sixteenths to go and weakened through to the finish, got taken hold of late as a precaution while not effected by the checking and steadying nearing
the finish. GOA (IRE) saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing just off the inside nearing the quarter pole, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch and weakened. PROGENY tracked the pace just off the inside from just off the pace, tipped three wide into the far turn and was carried four
wide by rivals tipping out and came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. There was a
Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on VINO ROUGE and WRIGLEYVILLE. After review, VINO ROUGE was disqualified from first and placed
fourth for interfering with WRIGLEYVILLE prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
BOBBY JEAN dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, prompted the pace on the inside of the leader, vied in the two path while turning up the
pressure on the far turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. LOOKING FOR GINNY
leaned out at the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, lagged well behind the rest of the field, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and
improved with good courage to get up for the place late. NOT GUILTY broke out at the start, dropped from the three path to the two path on the first turn,
showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, lost the lead approaching the quarter-pole and proved no match for the winner
then lost the place near the finish but was clear for third. TRUE MYTH was hustled from the gate then angled out early, rounded the first turn in the three
path, was coaxed along while tracking the pace, passed the nine-sixteenths under stronger encouragement, went around the far turn in the three path and
came up empty. ALTHENA raced in the three path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths pole, traveled in the
three path on the far turn, came out into the five path entering the stretch and failed to respond. DASH OF LEMON broke in at the start, settled on the
inside, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground while dropping back on the far turn, moved to the three path into the stretch and faltered.
