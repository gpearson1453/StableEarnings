FOR FLYING (BRZ) well placed tracking the leaders from a clear pocket down the backside, glided up to the leaders on the far turn, battled from four wide
down the lane and prevailed determinedly. YANKEE DOLLAR stalked the pace from the fence to the final bend, tipped out three wide nearing the quarter
pole, rallied in tandem with the winner and was denied in the final strides in a good effort. NEXT EPISODE unhurried to travel at the back of the field for
three-quarters, circled the field coming for home and rallied with a late gain to be along for the show. LOVED REIKO trailed to the top of the lane and
showed good late energy passing tiring rivals in the stretch. BOW DRAW set the pace under mild pressure for three-quarters, had no response when
challenged turning for home and weakened through the lane. DAMASO prompted the pace to the head of the lane and faded down the stretch.

READY FOR PEACE stalked the pace for a half mile, made an early bid down the backside splitting rivals to duel on the lead through the turn and pulled
clear in the lane. MEISTERSINGER tracked the leaders to midway on the final bend, rallied four wide nearing the quarter pole, angled inward in upper
stretch and chased the winner home as second best. LORDLY reserved off the pace racing mid-pack and mounted a mild rally in the lane to be along for the
show. AMERICAN CITY pressed the pace for a half mile, chased turn, and flattened out in the lane. CHADO set a pressured pace for a hlaf, responded
when the winner moved early, dueled through the far turn on the lead and weakened in the stretch. MR MILES was not a threat. PNUTBUTTER WHISKEY
missed the break giving the field a head start and was always outrun from there.

CUPIDS DREAM glided to the lead away from the gate, set a well rated pace on a clear lead down the backstretch, responded when challenged on the far
turn briefly surrendering the lead, dug-in turning for home and repelled all challengers. SANDPIPER MEMORIES tracked the leaders saving ground along
the rail and rallied through the lane to gain the place. SULLIVAN STREET prompted the pace for a half mile, rallied into the far turn to engage the leaders,
briefly took the lead on the bend and weakened coming home. LADY DOMINANCE reserved off the pace while well in hand along the fence near the rear of
the field and made a mild bid in the lane. FUNNY ENOUGH stalked the pace from three wide, made a threatening bid on the final turn and flattened out in
the lane. LOVE UNLIMITED went evenly never posing a threat. STARRY HOPE trailed down the backside, made an early rally entering the far turn and
failed to sustain the bid.

Footnotes
LAZIO set the pace on a clear lead, widened the advantage in upper stretch and remained unchallenged through the lane. WARHEART tracked the pace
from three wide to midway on the turn, drifted out a path while mounting a rally turning for home and finished well to be second best. EL TINMARIN
reserved off the early pace, saved ground along the fence in the turn while closing on the leaders, cut the corner turning for home and mounted a mild bid in
the lane. CITY OF OSCARS unhurried early, rallied on the turn circling four wide steadied off heels on the turn taking up to be well wide and rallied belatedly
in the lane to be gaining late. HASTEN trailed early and passed tiring rivals in the lane. PRINSIPITO prompted the pace to the quarter pole and finished
evenly lacking a closing kick. FANTASY FLYER well placed in striking distance along the fence in the turn and flattened out turning for home. PENEI hustled
early to keep pace and failed to menace at any time. GLOBAL PHENOM pushed along and was never a threat. THE RIDER OF CITY OF OSCARS
CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN BY WARHEART, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BORDER WAR unhurried for the first half mile, steadily gained ground on the far turn, found his best stride late splitting rivals in deep stretch to prevail late
in a game effort. FLYING HOUDINI stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied on the bend to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch, dueled inside the eighth pole
taking a brief lead late and was out-finished in the final fifty yards. WHITING FIELD set a pressured pace early, cleared off nearing the final turn, dug-in
when challenged in mid-stretch and failed to hold on in deep stretch. SWEET TRAVELS reserved of the pace while racing between rivals down the
backside, mounted a bid turning for home and failed to gain on the top three. ADIOS BUCCANEER tracked the leaders from three wide to the three-eighths
pole, rallied while circling five wide to be prominent turning for home and finished evenly. SENDERO rated in mid-pack saving ground along the fence, made
a rally to loom in upper stretch and failed to sustain the bid through the stretch. ELUSIVE passed tiring rivals coming home. MR SCATTER went one-paced
never posing a threat. BIG BIG STAR chased the pace for three-quarters and tired.

Footnotes
FATIMA'S BLESSING was unhurried early to trail, remained at the rear of the field under patient handling to the far turn, split rivals from four wide on the far
turn while steadily closing ground, engaged the pacesetter inside the eighth pole and pulled away convincingly in deep stretch. INDY LYON set a pressured
pace through the far turn, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and was run-down late in the lane. GRAND JOURNEY pressed the pace down the
backstretch, made a challenge on the final bend, was repelled by the winner and kept-on through the lane to hold the show. BAIL OUT reserved off the pace
while racing along the rail and rallied mildly in the lane without impact. COPAZO was well placed tracking the leaders down the backside, made a
threatening bid loom turning for home and flattened out in the stretch. VINTNER stalked for three-quarters and faded in the final half. TITRATE was caught
wide on the first turn, moved to contention down the backside and tired coming home.

Footnotes
STEEL LINK stalked the pace to the turn, advanced three wide to engage the pacesetter in upper stretch and pulled away in the stretch drive. AGENT
KELLY tracked the leaders from the rail in the turn, cut the corner turning for home, tipped out down the lane and finished well to be second best. VOY Y
VENGO set a pressured pace throughout, battled in upper stretch and weakened late in the lane. FLAT CAP rated in mid-pack into the turn, rallied on the
bend to be nine wide turning for home and mounted a mild bid in the stretch. DENISTON unhurried in the early going to be at the rear of the main body,
saved ground on the turn and showed some late interest in the lane. SWIFT DANCER raced in contention early and faded. FRONT DANCER pressed the
pace to midway on the turn from between rivals and gave way. WHISKEY KISS bumped and squeezed back at the start, dropped well out the back and was
always outrun from there.

Footnotes
ECHO LANE pressed the pace to the quarter pole from two wide, took command in mid-stretch and repelled all challengers in a very game effort.
POSSIBLEMENTE tracked the leaders to the far turn, rallied three wide to engage the winner inside the eighth pole, dueled to the wire and was denied.
SPACE LAUNCH rated in mid-pack while well placed in striking distance, rallied through the lane and failed to get passed the top pair late. HOT BLOODED
settled in hand the first time down the lane to stalk the pace from the fence and failed to mount a closing rally coming home. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD well
placed along the fence for the run down the backside to be in contention on the final bend and failed to rally. THE ADDISON POUR raced near the rear of
the field and passed weaker rivals in the lane. WICKED FINN set a pressured for three-quarters, battled turning for home and gave way late in the lane.
BATI KING was not a factor.

Footnotes
NO CENTS NON CENTS broke alertly to be first away, settled into a stalking position down the backstretch, rallied four wide turning for home to take
command and finished determinedly holding off the closers in a drive. OVERSPENT unhurried in the early going, rallied five wide through traffic on the turn,
altered course to the inside in upper stretch for clear running and was denied late in the lane in a good effort. LOCOMOTIVE tracked the leaders to midway
on the turn, angled out eight wide turning for home and steadily gained ground through the stretch. BEN'S HERO well placed while caught wide chasing the
leaders on the bend and mounted a mild bid in the lane from seven wide. PRETTY JIMMY pressed the pace from two wide through the turn, took command
in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. NONE THE WISER rated in mid-pack, commenced a rally turning for home angling in to split rivals and failed to
sustain the bid. ROARK lunged at the start to be at the rear of the field, remained the distant trailer to the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. GIFT
EXCHANGE tracked the leaders early, ranged up to be prominent on the turn and flattened out. SINGULARITY went one-paced lacking a closing bid.
MISTY RIVER broke a step tardy giving the field a couple lengths, rushed up the inside to set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and stopped in the
stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
