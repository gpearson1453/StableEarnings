Footnotes
EVIE'S PRINCE tracked the leader in closest aim three then two wide jumping well to maintain his position, cleared the final flight taking command inside
that juncture and drew clear once in the flat under a drive, dug in and held clear to the finish kept to task. HIDDEN PATH tracked the pace along the inside
from mid pack early on under restraint and flirting with leaving the course at several points when just keeping himself within the dogs, steadily made
progress to be just off the pace, jumped late at the final flight landing on his hind more impactful before running on under a drive to chase the winner home
well clear of the rest and along second best. WESTERLAND (GB) chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field making steady progress, came
under coaxing nearing the final jump, cleared that one and remained one paced through the flat to the finish to secure the show honors. RECOUP (GB) a bit
washy, traded bumps early on with LIGHTNING ROD nearing the first flight, tracked the front just off the inside from near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing nearing the final jump and improved position in the flat for the last major share. LIGHTNING ROD traded bumps early on nearing the first fence with
RECOUP, tracked the pace along the inside jumping late at fence four, came under urging once in the flat and weakened to the finish. HOLD HARD (IRE)
washy prior to the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside, struck fence four, tucked inside near jump eight, came under threat to the outside and
cleared the final flight and was collared once in the flat and faltered in the drive. LITTLE TRILBY (GB) three wide in pursuit, jumped well until jumping early
on fence eight and landed forward bobbling hard after the jump forcing the rider to regather, came under coaxing nearing the final flight, cleared that hurdle
but gave way once in the flat.

Footnotes
SEEKING UNITY was carried out at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure while asked
in the two path on the far turn, took a short lead coming to the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop
while battling inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and just held under strong urging. GENERAL BANKER toss his head while rank along the rail during
the opening quarter-mile, was rated off the pace, came under urging on the far turn, moved from the rail to the three path while chasing the leader, gained to
make an outside bid in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop while battling outside the winner in the final furlong and just missed while clear for
the place. RESERVE CURRENCY went four wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, dropped back in the
two then three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead while getting closer until outside the furlong marker then
swapped to the proper lead, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. FROMANOTHAMUTHA broke out then
was hustled, dropped from the two path to the inside on the first turn, showed the way on the inside of a rival, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the
lead approaching the quarter-pole and gave way. SUN THUNDER went around the first turn in the three path, settled at the rear, was urged along passing
the half-mile pole, traveled around the far turn in the three path and lacked the needed response. ELIMINATE veered out and was off a step slow before
being corrected by the rider, went five wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked late on the backstretch, came up empty in the three
then four path on the far turn and retreated.

GET A JOB away well and directly to the front, showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn and then along the inside down the
backstretch, briefly tipped to the two path half a mile from home before heading back to the rail, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. EXECUTIVE MOVE prompted the pace three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch shaken off, proved no match for the top one while along well
clear of the rest and second best. STORMY'S DREAMING broke in striking the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. CONCORDE SPIRIT stumbled at the start, chased four wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. BIG RICH coaxed from the start, chased along the
inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped to the two path three furlongs from home, went three wide into upper stretch and tired.
BARICCI coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
tired. ISOMARSHALL stumbled at the start, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, swung three wide for home and
gave way. BIG EGO chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, faltered in the drive.

SECRET RULES bumped with a rival at the start, was well spotted just off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, dropped to the two path at the
quarter-pole, altered out from behind horses while asked inside the three-sixteenths pole, gained to take the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best
under good handling. DANGEROUS RIDE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, stepped on a goose as that fowl was trying to fly off
the track at the seven-sixteenths pole, was asked in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled with multiple
foes under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the place. CEES GET DEGREES broke out and bumped with a foe then
went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the
final furlong then lost the advantage, battled into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
GIROOVIN was coaxed along off the pace, went around the turn in the two then three path, swung five wide into the stretch and improved with late energy
to just miss both the place and show. M B'S MUNNING was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked
near the quarter-pole then cut the corner into the stretch, chased the vanguard in the drive and lacked the needed kick. PAPA ROCKET bumped with a rival
at the start then was grabbed with the left-rein while in tight off heels, was urged along at the rear, angled from the two path to the five path on the turn,
turned into the stretch in the six path and failed to threaten. COLD AS HELL stumbled significantly at the start but broke towards the front then was bumped,
chased the pace on the outside, moved out to the five path to go around a goose on the track early on the turn then dropped to the four path, made a bid at
the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. KUNSHAN BRIDGE bumped with foes on both sides at the start, raced towards the
rear, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail nearing the quarter-pole and was no factor. POPPY'S PRIDE settled between horses, went four wide under
urging on the turn and failed to threaten. NATURAL HARBOR bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the inside of foes, dropped back late on the
backstretch, traveled around the turn in the three path and was no factor. KINGDOM broke out and bumped with an opponent, settled on the far outside,

before being set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge inside the final furlong, seized
command a sixteenth out and inched away to the finish kept to task. ENGLISH CASTLE established the front and showed the way in hand three then two

collared inside a sixteenth from home and ran on to preserve the place honors safely on the wire. KORU chased three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive but was ultimately rebuffed to the finish. CHECK CLEARED just off the

swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TEMPLE CREED just off the inside through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five then four wide into upper stretch and tired. JANSSEN tracked along the inside early on growing rank under
restraint through the first turn and was steadied midway, tipped out three wide at the seven-sixteenths, came under urging with five-sixteenths to run, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DISCO DANCER traded a bump with OUTTAWATERBURY and then lost his lane at the start
conceding four to five lengths to the front and coming under hustling, raced three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch

still in hand on the turn, bumped with a rival near the five-sixteenths pole, moved to the two path at the quarter-pole then shifted out a bit more while roused,
chased while gaining into the final furlong, dropped in nearing the sixteenth-pole and closed well to get up late. EPISODE angled in while going to the front,
showed the way in hand, went around the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch, battled on even terms with LINDA'S JEWEL into the final

bumped with a rival near the nine-sixteenths then steadied, went around the turn in the two path, swung out to the five path into upper stretch, rallied outside
into the final furlong and closed well but just missed while up for the show. LINDA'S JEWEL stalked the pace on the outside, moved in near the
nine-sixteenths, made a bid in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, fought with the runner-up into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished. HONOR HER dropped back then angled in, went around the turn in the two path, bumped with a rival near the five-sixteenths
pole, shifted four wide into the stretch, remained on her inside until just before the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed

and failed to rally. MY VANILLA drifted in at the start, bumped with a foe near the nine-sixteenths, was well placed while rated under a snug hold, saved
ground while let out on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
COUSIN KRISTI established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and dueled through the stretch to the wire coming out slightly and brushing his main danger a sixteenth out
and just outside the finish and gamely held on to prevail. ATHENA BEACH bobbled at the break, came under coaxing and raced three then two wide in
closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge dueling with the
aforementioned foe through to the finish getting on near even terms just inside the sixteenth pole when brushed, then got brushed just outside the finish line
fighting on gamely but was ultimately bested at the end. TRUE EMPRESS a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased four then three wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. SCORING CHANCE chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. BERNIETAKESCHARGE broke out a
the start bumping QUEENS MASTERPIECE, chased three wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide
for home and weakened. BANK ON ANNA chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, came under

Footnotes
JUSTHEART broke out at the start bumping MAJULU, then got brushed by DELL ARTE and lost her lane, chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch, rallied
to take narrow command a sixteenth out, dug in on near even terms to the finish briefly displaced from command and gamely just got a nostril in front at the
wire. SPLASHY coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive to get on near even terms for command just inside the sixteenth marker, took very narrow and brief command seventy yards from home and
just missed at the finish. GOOD MISSION pressed the pace of MAJULU three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide
into upper stretch, took narrow command a furlong out, got collared a sixteenth from home and fought on to the end. BETTER BE SMART coaxed from the
gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three then two wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
MAJULU got bumped at the start by JUSTHEART, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. ARTISTIC SUCCESS bobbled at the break, chased three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. LAURANA coaxed from the gate, chased three wide until
tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked to the
finish. SUPERSTARSUSAN chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, improved
position to the finish. BOSTON STRONG MAMA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside
route into upper stretch and offered no response. WAR TERMINATRIX chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four
wide into upper stretch, weakened in the stretch. REPEAT AFTER ME chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. DELL ARTE broke out at the start brushing JUSTHEART, chased four then
three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
