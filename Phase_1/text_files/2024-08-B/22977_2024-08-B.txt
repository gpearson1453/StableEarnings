Footnotes
EXECUTIVE ORDER stalked the dueling leaders on the outside while placed under a snug hold, engaged the runner-up in the three path on the turn, was
asked in the five path at the quarter-pole, took over in upper stretch, shook clear while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to the
proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and widened under a drive to prove much the best. FRIDAY SURPRISE dueled on the outside of a rival, led in the
two path while inside of an opponent on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, spun into the stretch in the four path, lost the advantage near the
three-sixteenths pole, drifted in under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the place. AMERICA'S HONOR
dropped back while urged along, went around most of the turn in the three path, angled to the five path outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch in
the eight path and improved to get the show. PRINTER'S ALLEY was urged along on the inside of a rival, climbed near the nine-sixteenths pole, moved
from the rail to the two path on the turn, came out to the six path into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MONTE AVI bumped with a rival at the
start, dropped well off the pace under coaxing, went around the turn in the two path, swung out to the seven path into upper stretch and failed to threaten.
TAPWRITS TEMPER was urged along off the pace, moved in near the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the four path, dropped to the three path
into the stretch and failed to respond. BERNIE GOES BOOM was last to commence while off a step behind the rest, quickly dropped well back under urging
while showing no speed, moved from the four path to the two path early on the turn and showed little. BURNING MUNNY was urged along off the pace,
rounded the turn in the two then three path and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. BUT NOW AM FOUND bumped with a rival at the
start then was hustled, dueled on the inside of the runner-up, dropped back along the rail leaving the backstretch and retreated then was also eased in the
final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
EARLY ADOPTER (GB) tracked the pace along the inside and then briefly just off the inside down the backstretch before heading back inside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths and quickly tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through
the final furlong, had the rider lose the handle on his crop when switching to the right hand inside the eighth pole and surged late being shown a hand to the
right side to get up in the final jumps and score. AUTHENTIC GALLOP established the front after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside,
slipped away into the far turn and remained patiently handled, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, dug in under
threat to the outside and was nailed in the final strides. EXECUTIVE lunged at the break getting away near the rear of the field and conceding four to five
lengths to the front, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three
wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish to secure the show honors. COMPLEX AGENDA coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the
inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish. BATTLE DRUM (FR) saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. CYCLONE
STATE just off the inside through the first turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then got out-finished in the late stages. STATESMAN just off the inside through the first turn, chased two to three wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. GOTTA GUY lunged at the break getting
away last and conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased three wide through the first turn and down the backstretch before tucking to the two path
through the far turn, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. GO LONG broke out a step and
bobbled at the break pawing the ground for two to three strides before getting upright, spun four wide into the first turn and steadily tucked three then two
wide into the backstretch to settle in closest aim of the leader, remained on hold off that rival and was shaken off as that one slipped away into the far turn
and came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch and backed away tiring to the finish.

KREESA moved in while rated off the pace, raced under a very tight hold leaving the backstretch, saved ground in hand on the turn, was asked after turning
into the stretch then chased while moving out, found a seam between foes near the furlong marker, gained to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, took a
short lead in the final sixteenth, battled with the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. TWISTED FILIGREE bumped with foes
on both sides at the start then bumped again with an outside rival, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked

five wide at the quarter-pole, chased outside into the final furlong, made a bid approaching the sixteenth-pole but was outfinished while just able to get the

CONNIVING got bumped at the start by YINGLE BELLS, who broke outwards, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, drifted out three to four paths as CONFABULATION did to his inside, seized command a
furlong out bumping that foe when leaning inwards, had that rival battle back and dueled through to the finish headed a sixteenth out when bumped by that
rival before digging in game to come again and get up for the victory. CONFABULATION coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide at the quarter pole and then drifted out three to four paths straightened away in tandem with the
aforementioned foe, had that rival go on by a furlong out and was bumped at that station, dug in dueling to the finish coming out and bumping that rival a
sixteenth out when taking narrow command back, fought on to the wire but was ultimately bested at the end. YINGLE BELLS broke out at the start bumping
CONNIVING, showed the way in hand along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, drifted out three paths straightened away and was displaced inside the three-sixteenths, then weakened through to the finish. SHAKIN THE BELLE
chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. FORCED ERRORS chased six
then five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went nine to ten paths into upper stretch, tired. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE chased two to three
wide until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FEDERAL JUDGE was hustled from the gate then went clear while moving in, was challenged briefly then strode clear again outside the nine-sixteenths,
dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, controlled the action through that bend, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, drew off
while put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker and proved much the best under strong urging.
ACCRETIVE broke out at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and proved no
match while able to hold the place. LIGHT MAN was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, dropped back in the two to three path on the turn, moved
out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. MARKET STREET was urged along off the pace, saved ground on
the turn and failed to rally. PRO OXIDANT was bumped at the start, raced on the outside while ridden along, angled in near the five-eighths pole, moved
from the two path to the four path on the turn and came up empty. OCEAN'S RESERVE broke out and bumped with a rival, settled outside under some
urging, moved from the three path to the five path under stronger encouragement on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MISS ENCHANTED settled on the far outside, was asked in the four then five path on the turn, floated into the seven path into the stretch, took the lead
near the three-sixteenths pole, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. ZADORSKY was urged along off the pace, moved
from the two path to the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the seven path and finished willingly to get the place. RELIABLE LADY broke out
then was hustled, chased the pace, went around the turn in the three then four path, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, pursued the winner into the
final furlong, drifted out late and weakened while clear for the show. CATCHING HEAT was hustled from the gate then bumped with a rival after the start,
raced off the pace under urging, traveled around the turn in the five then six path and lacked the needed response. CARA'S TIME was urged along off the
pace, moved from the three path to the five path on the turn and also lacked the needed response. THERESASILVERLININ was hustled to the front then
showed the way with a clear advantage, vied mostly in the two path while getting close to the rail briefly on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop,
dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BEST IMPRESSION moved up towards the inside midway down the backstretch, was urged inside to the two
path on the turn and came up empty. NIKITIS bumped with an opponent after the start, was urged along towards the rear, moved from the four path to the
six path on the turn, dropped back to the four path late on that bend and failed to threaten. CRUSHED ICE was last to commence then brushed with a foe,
settled at the rear, moved in late on the backstretch, went around most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the inside and was no factor.

DAPPER MOON vied briefly before settling four wide in aim of the top pair, tucked three wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths advancing on the front, swung four wide into upper stretch, seized command with three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive to
prevail. GUNS LOADED stumbled at the start recovering inwards into LUCAS'S MISCHIEF, advanced to vie briefly from the three path before prompting
that same rival from the outside, tucked to the two path and steadily advanced to duel midway on the turn, took over narrow command spinning just off the
inside at the quarter pole, straightened away to the rail in upper stretch and was collared at the three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top one while
running on to secure the place honors. TAP INTO THIS dwelt at the start, then brushed the near side stall when leaving well behind the rest of the field
conceding six to seven lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch beginning a steady advance
near the half mile pole, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and showed
good courage to secure the show honors. CAPRICIOUS OUTCOME got bumped at the start by RUN OF THE HOUSE, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. WELL SUITED coaxed from the start, chased along the
inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. LUCAS'S MISCHIEF got loose in the
post parade and ran off for a half mile interchanging between a jog and a run intermittently until collared behind the starting gate in the seven furlong chute,
got returned by outrider and was joined back with his rider, got bumped at the start by GUNS LOADED, who recovered in from a stumble, advanced on the
rail to vie briefly with a trio and then a pair before shaking to a clear lead under pressure from GUNS LOADED to the outside, had that rival steadily advance
through the turn and knocked heads midway, got displaced from the front taking the inside route into upper stretch and tired. CAPO LUCA chased four then
three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in and took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. OUR FAVORITE SON coaxed from
the start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six
wide into upper stretch and tired. RUN OF THE HOUSE broke out at the start bumping CAPRICIOUS OUTCOME, chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide at the head of the stretch backing
away and was eased home to the finish.

BRIGHTWORK chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, dug in gamely to prevail. TWO SHARP coaxed from
the start, tucked to the two path forcing in CARMELINA which in turn squeezed out TRICKY TEMPER against AUTUMN EVENING with five and a half
furlongs to run, tucked inside at the half mile pole, forcing CARMELINA to steady at that station, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, fought on inside to the finish. MIUCCIA chased along the
inside until tipped to the three path half a mile from home, chased three then two wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the wire. AUTUMN EVENING altered in with five and a half furlongs to go due to pressure from TWO
SHARP tucking in from the outside, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. CARMELINA bobbled and was bumped at the start by BELLE'S BLUE BELL, who broke outwards, got carried in two paths by TWO
SHARP after the break and forced TRICKY TEMPER to steady when pinched out and AUTUMN EVENING to alter in with five and a half furlongs to run,
chased along the inside and got steadied herself when TWO SHARP tucked directly in front into the turn half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TRICKY TEMPER chased briefly three to four wide and was steadied when pinched out
and leaned on five and a half furlongs from home due to pressure from TWO SHARP tucking inwards from the outside, chased two to three wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. LADY MOSCATO chased four wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, made no impact. BELLE'S BLUE BELL broke out at the start bumping CARMELINA and was steadied
conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased just off the inside and then along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch and tired.

quartet while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, spun into the stretch in the six path then came out some under a left-handed crop,
switched to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, drifted in while gaining on the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole and got up in the final thirty
yards or so to prevail. QUIETSIDE veered out at the start then was corrected by the rider, moved up on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied
outside of three foes on the turn, shook clear in the three path at the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for
the place. SHERBINI was urged along at the rear, raced inside to the two path for most of the turn then angled to the five path late on that bend, turned into
the stretch in the seven path and improved with late energy for the show. STRONG STATE settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn and
lacked the needed response. THE QUEENS M G raced up close to the pace, made a bid between horses near the half-mile pole, vied in the three path
between horses on the turn, moved to the four path while dropping back into upper stretch and tired. RELIABLE SOURCE showed early speed then
contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied inside three foes while along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and also tired. PONDERING

in the field, was urged in the two path on the turn, spun into the stretch in the four path and was no factor. TIZ PURPLE contested the pace on the outside
then between horses late on the backstretch, vied in the two path while urged between foes on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths pole and

Footnotes
IDEA GENERATION (IRE) coaxed lightly from the gate, spurted away in the two path through the first turn to a comfortable lead and then settled under
rating through the stretch the initial time, continued just off the inside through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch in the clear of the field, had the
field begin to take closer order into the far turn and remained patiently handled, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and was roused straightened
away, drew away once more now under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well and safe to the finish to prevail. WAR LIKE GODDESS saved ground
near the rear of the field patiently handled, attempted to tip out near the five-sixteenths and came together with the coaxed along MILLIE GIRL, got going
with five-sixteenths to go and began to tip out, angled out five wide into upper stretch and closed well through the final furlong but could not get to the winner
while clear for the place honors. MCKULICK (GB) settled tracking from the front from just off the inside among the front of the main flight, got coaxed along
three furlongs from home, tipped out three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. ETERNAL HOPE (IRE)
tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
VERBIER (IRE) brushed the off side stall at the start getting away last, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked to the finish. MILLIE GIRL settled just off the inside tracking from
mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths to the outside of WAR LIKE GODDESS and bumped with that rival when she attempted to tip out
nearing the five-sixteenths, angled four wide at the head of the stretch and offered no response. PARNAC (FR) coaxed lightly from the gate, tracked the
pace along the inside leading the main flight, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened through to
the finish.

Footnotes

bid at the three-sixteenths pole then took the advantage, shook clear under the crop outside the furlong marker, swapped back to his left lead inside the
furlong marker, widened under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. STRAPPED broke a bit slow, stayed out in the six
path on the first turn, settled on the outside, gained in the five path under urging on the far turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and
earned the place while no match for that rival. DEVILSGOTACAUSE raced in the four then three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside,
made a bid under urging in the three path on the far turn, led briefly at the three-sixteenths pole then lost the advantage to the winner, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. COLLECT FROM IKE was hustled to the front, showed the way while a bit off the rail, was asked on the
far turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. MIZTERTONIC went around both turns in the two path and lacked the needed response then
was transported off the track via equine ambulance. KAHALA broke out then was hustled, traveled around the first turn in the five then four path, was
forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the four path on the far turn and came up empty. KICK A BUCK lunged at the start and was off a bit slow, raced
in the four path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, dropped back in the four then three path on the far turn and faltered. MR. MENDELSSOHN
rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved off the pace, dropped back in the three path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the five path and
