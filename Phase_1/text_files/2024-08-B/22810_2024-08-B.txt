ROGUE DIAMOND bumped at the start, set the pace, drew off entering the stretch for a clear lead and held safely while ridden out. OMAHA STAMP broke
out, was never far back, went five wide entering the stretch, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. SHE STOPPED SHORT stalked the pace,
was in range, lacked a late response and held for show. NOTIPTONI stumbled and bumped at the start, stalked the pace along the inside and lacked the
needed late rally. REIMAGINE was outrun in an even effort. MARGARITA BLUEBIRD flashed speed in an inside trip, fell back and lacked a stretch
response.

Footnotes
SANITARIUM set a pressured pace, drew clear entering the stretch and held under steady urging. IRISH SPARK pressed the pace while racing between
horses, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back, continued willingly to the wire and narrowed the gap. THE LAST THRILL was never far back, rallied on
the turn, bid six wide and gained late to earn show. I DID THE MATH broke out and was off slowly, raced wide while far back early, bid eight wide leaving
the turn, closed fast and was gaining ground. LIONS LAW broke out and brushed at the start, advanced inside on the turn, bid and came up empty.
FEATURED POWER saved ground in an even effort and failed to menace. ISABELLA'S BEAUTY pressed the pace three wide to the turn, fell back and
gave way. JACQUEK raced outside, lacked a bid and was not urged late.

ALL CHOKED UP set the pace, widened in the drive and was kept to task. BOURBON LIFE was slow early, altered course late and surged to get up for
place while no threat to the winner. EVEN THE WIND dropped inside early, was unhurried, rallied four wide into the turn, went six wide entering the stretch,
bid willingly, hunng late and was caught for second. HAY MOON raced mid pack along the inside, angled out and rallied between horses into the turn, bid
willingly to get within range and came up empty late. BALADINE stalked the pace to the second turn, fell back and leveled off. HELIOCHROME raced close
to the pace along the inside, was steadied entering the second turn, dropped back and faded. LAWMAKER was checked leaving the gate to be off slowly,
trailed the field, went widest in the drive, lacked a bid and showed little.

HATCHET CREEK was never far back, raced inside, bid along the rail on the turn, closed steadily, wore down ALPINE GHOST and drew clear late. ALPINE
GHOST vied to the turn, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, was outclosed and finished second best. LAKE MILLS was reluctant to load, vied to the turn,
fell back, went evenly late and held for show. PERFECT WAGER was last away from the gate, lagged early and offered a mild bid to improve position. Z U
SOON got away well, was taken back early and angled to the outside, swung wide on the turn, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and lacked the
needed rally. MON AMI FUZZIE trailed the field.

MAQAMAT was steadied entering the turn, angled out, bid five wide into the stretch, closed steadily and got up late. CHARLIE LIGHTNING stalked the
pace, rallied into the stretch, dueled for the lead and was outfinished in a good effort. READTHETRANSCRIPT set the pace, responded when challenged to
duel, yielded grudgingly and held safely for show. RISKY BOY stalked the pace along the inside, bid on the rail leaving the turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole
and faltered. MEDAL OF FACT broke in the air, was taken outside, advanced to the turn, went six wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. IDEA MAN
saved ground and was outrun.

REALIGNMENT stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in a game effort. COWBOY JUSTICE (GB)
veered in at the start, was steadied into the first turn, was rated hard while saving ground to the second turn, awaited room on the turn and in the upper
stretch, split rivals, dueled for the lead and was outfinished in a game effort. SIMPLE LOGIC was unhurried early while never far off the pace, bid five wide
at the top of the stretch and finished well to earn show while no threat to the top two. PROFESSOR HIGGINS raced close to the pace, bid four wide to loom
a threat, hung late and lost position. NEW YEAR SURPRISE was unhurried early and trailed the field, finished well and didn't have enough late. ATKINS set
the pace to the second turn, responded when challenged to duel for the lead, was crowded and checked mid stretch and dropped back. GLUCKSTADT
failed to menace in an even effort. Following a stewards' inquiry, COWBOY JUSTICE was disqualified and place sixth for causing interference in the stretch
drive.

late. MISS RIVER RAT was crowded at the start, lagged early, advanced to the turn, bid inside, shifted out for the drive and finished well to get up for place.
WILD BOUT HILARY bumped at the start, settled off the pace while racing inside, awaited room on the turn, got through along the rail to contend, hung late
and settled for show. MOON RAY (FR) broke out, was steadied entering the first turn, settled off the pace, rallied into the second turn, challenged four wide,
swung out and dropped back. SALLY'S SUPRISE bumped at the start, trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. MY LADY SLEW vied inside to the second
turn, tired and stopped. CAT ATTACK vied two across to the second turn, tired and stopped. Pick 8: 2/5/7-1/4-4/7-2/6-4/6/7-5/8-5/7-1/5/6/9/10.
