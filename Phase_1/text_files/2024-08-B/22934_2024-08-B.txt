Footnotes
FLIRTING WITH TIME sped to the lead soon after the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside, set the uncontested pace through early stages saved
ground turning for home, pulled away and finished in hand late. TICKIN TIME BLONDE was antsy in the post-parade, raced in range near the inside, shifted
out three wide and given cue in upper stretch, roused forward into contention, was no late match for the clear winner but ran on and held place. EXINGTON
was allowed to settle through early stages, launched a four wide bid upper stretch, finished with good response and just missed place. RAMSEY POND
raced near midpack, hustled along three to four wide, came in a couple paths under pressure and had a mild improve. STARRY NIGHT raced off the early
pace, launched an outside bid and had a mild improve. GIGGLE GIGGLE raced in the back, hustled along three to four wide upper stretch and passed tiring
rivals. PRINCESS IRENE was forwardly placed along the inside, angled out two to three wide in upper stretch, sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave
way. SWEET MUSIC tracked the pace near the inside, cut the corner entering the upper stretch, sustained bid to the eighth pole then faded. TACO CAT
BACKWARDS raced just off midpack going into the far turn, came under a ride in upper stretch and failed to respond. CALCETINES failed to move into
contention. LUCKY MAMA raced in early contention then faded in the lane. RHAENYS raced midpack in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
TIZTASTIC was nicely rated near midpack, picked up the pace two wide leaving the far turn, angled to the inside, edged closer then tipped two wide and
kicked clear. SEXAGENARIAN sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and held clear near the inside into upper stretch, came under a drive, dug in and
held firm then got overtaken late. BLUE COAST raced in range through early stages, cut the corner entering upper stretch, angled two wide for the drive,
sustained a steady bid and secured a share. PURSE THIEF tracked in contention into the far turn, tipped out four wide in upper stretch then angled in to two
wide in the final furlong and lacked the needed response for serious impact. BAYTOWN BARACUS raced off the early pace, saved ground, hustled up near
the inside down the lane and lacked a needed rally. MO HAIR SAM was forwardly placed racing just behind the early leader, launched a three wide bid in
upper stretch, ran on to the eighth pole then gave way. HEAT raced off the early leaders, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and failed to kick on.
BRERETON'S BAYTOWN raced in the back and saved ground to no avail.

MECHAYA set a pressured early pace, confidently handled through the upper stretch and kicked clear to be well when asked under a steady hand ride.
THATSALRIGHTMAMA dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and narrowly rallied for the place position. BEACH
WEDDING was unhurried early on to race with the second flight, raced four wide into the upper stretch and rallied between rivals late to just miss the place
position. ONE HAPPY ISLAND was forced to check while in tight between rivals into the turn, made a good rail bid through the stretch run and moved up to
improve position. DREAMING OF LILIES stalked the pace from the outside of rivals, tipped out through the upper lane and weakened the final eighth of a
mile. SWEET BEBSI pressed the early going from the outside of MECHAYA and gave way through the drive. MAJESTIC BAY was off slowly, drafted off the
early going to race mid pack, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and never threatened. POWERWASHED rated under a snug hold down the
backstretch and faded through the drive. BIRKIN GIRL was bumped, bothered, and forced to steady by an outer rival soon after the start, raced well back,
swung wide into the lane and never was a factor. SWEET AMBITION raced far back while saving ground. PEPPER GIRL shifted in and bumped an inner
rival early on, lost ground in the aftermath to race far back, then was eased up on in the stretch.
