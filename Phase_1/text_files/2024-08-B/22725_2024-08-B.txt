HEARTFULLOFSTARS was allowed to settle, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth. JESTER'S SONG saved
ground while being close-up, slipped through nearing the quarter pole, gained a slight lead nearing the eighth pole then came out inside the sixteenth pole
and was unable to resist the winner late. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN vied with SUNSET TOWN for the lead from along the outside, was three-wide entering
the stretch, came in slightly nearing the sixteenth pole and held on well for third. SUNSET TOWN set the pressure pace racing slightly removed from the
rail, responded when headed at the eighth pole the was in tight and steadied nearing the sixteenth pole while weakening. PACO THE TACO MAN raced in
the middle of the field early while three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch then angled in during the drive and failed to seriously threaten. CHOCOLATE
SHAKE was prominent early while racing four-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and tired. STACKS OF SILVER was unhurried while racing four-wide on
the turn, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to be a factor. SEMPER FIDELIS saved ground while dropping back early and failed to menace. THE
JOCKEY OF SUNSET TOWN LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST JESTER'S SONG AND SAINTHOODFORBRIAN BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS

AYEARTOREMEMBER stalked BRAMBLE BUSH while racing two-wide, moved up to join that one nearing the quarter pole and prevailed narrowly in a stiff
drive. LOUISE BROOKS saved ground while being allowed to settle, lacked room from the three-eighths pole to near the eighth pole then slipped through
and finished strongly. BRAMBLE BUSH saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged and held on gamely to the wire. LIPLOCK saved
ground while being unhurried, angled out to be four-wide nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. VINGATIVA broke in to bump with GOLDEN HEART then
raced four-wide and went evenly. BUILT DIFFERENT was forwardly placed early, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. GOLDEN HEART was
bumped at the start by VINGATIVA then was allowed to settle while racing two-wide and failed to be a factor. WATER WITCH was prominent early while
racing two-wide and tired. PARTY MONSTER dropped back early and trailed.

Footnotes
BATTUTA D'ORO was off a step slow then settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide, split rivals nearing the stretch and was up in the final
sixteenth. COUNTRY CHARLIE saved ground setting the pace, settled into the stretch with a clear lead but was unable to resist the winner late. BOLD
LICORICE was reserved off the pace, came five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. ALOHA MAN was unhurried early, came three-wide into the
stretch then angled out for room to be six-wide nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. HENDRICKSON bobbled at the start then was allowed to settle,
came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. DIAMOND MESSA settled in the middle of the field early, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly
late. PHOTO COPY dropped back early, came seven-wide into the stretch and improved his position. SAN ANDRES was forwardly placed early while
saving ground, steadied in tight nearing the three-eighths pole and finished willingly when clear. CLEVER TIGER was forwardly placed early while racing
two-wide and weakened. CRAZY ODDS prompted the issue to near the stretch while three-wide and tired. DUKE OF DOOLY saved ground chasing
COUNTRY CHARLIE for six furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
HELMS DEEP took control of the tempo leaving the first turn, craved out solid fractions while unchallenged into the far turn, still clear when leaving the
furlong marker, heard footsteps late and lasted under a drive. SPECTRIER slow around the first turn, unhurried down the backside, under a drive leaving
the three eighths marker, split rivals through the stretch, and closed the gap very late. STEELE MONEY raced mid pack around the first turn, started a bid
leaving the quarter pole, five wide and chasing nearing the furlong marker, was one paced to the wire. BATON raced well back around the first turn and
down the backside, churned under a drive leaving the three eighths marker, improved position late, never a threat. ZIPPER ZAPPER stalked the pace
around the first turn, saved ground down the backside and around the far turn, no had late kick. OMERTA CODE was slow leaving the gate, race well off the
pace down the backside, never threatened through the lane. THE TWINS SNEAKERS raced well off the pace and well off the rail, five wide around the far
turn, fanned out seven wide in upper stretch, came up empty late. TWO THIRTY FIVE chased the speed around both turns, under a drive leaving the
quarter pole, weakened through the stretch.
