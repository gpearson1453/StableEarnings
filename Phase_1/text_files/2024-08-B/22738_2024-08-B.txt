Footnotes
SERENE SPIRIT broke out bumping a rival at the start, stalked the pacesetter, chased between rivals on the turn, rallied three wide into the lane, closed
steadily, drifted in slightly at the sixteenth marker, rallied to the front and edged away. ROCK HARD ROSE steadied early on, stalked close up three wide,
chased three wide on the far turn, rallied to the lead entering the stretch, drew clear, shifted in at the furlong marker, then dug in gamely on the rail to the
finish. FORWARD DEPLOYED raced off the pace with an inside trip, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied between horses in the stretch, was steadied at
the sixteenth pole lacking room, then continued willingly for third. SUBSIDY was off a bit slow, trailed the field, moved up three wide on the far turn and
rallied outside in the lane. STILLTHINKINGOFYOU raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up inside entering the stretch, angled out and rallied between
horses. LADY CATALINA raced off the pace with an inside trip, angled out in the stretch and rallied mildly between foes. PARADISE WINS tracked inside,
moved up three wide at the quarter pole and weakened. ROSIEONTHERIVER raced off the pace and did not factor. MYA WAY was bumped and steadied
at the start, raced three wide off the pace, went four wide past the quarter pole and faded. BOSS LADY BINGO was bumped at the start, raced off the pace
between rivals and failed to threaten. TINY TEARS set the pace on the inside, dueled past the quarter pole and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry and
Jockey Objection by the rider of FORWARD DEPLOYED against the winner, the race was declared official.
