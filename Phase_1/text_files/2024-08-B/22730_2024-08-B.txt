Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SOCIETY soon had a clear lead, stayed just off the rail through the bend, was roused leaving the turn, opened up in the lane under urging and
proved clearly best. CAT TALE BREEZE pressed from between rivals, was just outside MIDNIGHT SOCIETY taking the turn, no match for that one when
set down for the drive but pulled away for the place the final furlong. MISS MIA came off the rail for a clear path on the backstretch, followed MIDNIGHT
SOCIEY into the stretch and moved clear for third inside the last eighth. HALLIE'S RAINBOW helped prompt the early pace, retreated some along the rail
on the bend then leveled off the final furlong. BROOKE'S ALL IN a bit slow at the break, advanced from outside, was four wide taking the turn then gave
way through the lane.

Footnotes
SCRAPPY PATCH settled at the back, gradually progressed from outside on the backstretch to reach contention four wide on the second turn, gradually
angled in through the lane to vie for the lead just outside JUSTICEONEMORETIME after entering the last eighth and edged ahead nearing the wire.
JUSTICEONEMORETIME forced out into the first bend, lost ground four wide there, advanced to prompt the pace on the backstretch, went for the lead
three wide on the second turn, angled in some leaving that bend, moved clear upper stretch, gained the rail, was challenged inside the final furlong, fought
gamely but had to settle for second best. DRAGGING MAIN boxed in on the backstretch, was checked hard off BLEEDING BLUE'S heels into the second
turn, altered out, came into the stretch four wide and gained third between rivals in the waning yards. ANUNKA just off the rail through the early going,
angled out five wide to commence his bid on the second bend, stayed widest into the stretch and showed a willingness to run late. CHANEL POINT soon
had the lead from outside, was challenged from inside leaving the first turn, regained the lead from between horses into the second bend, gained the rail
midway on that turn, began to wear down into the stretch, angled out some with a furlong to go and continued to slowly yield. BLEEDING BLUE a step slow
at the start, moved up quickly between horses to vie for the lead leaving the first turn, moved ahead on the backstretch, stayed just off the inside then began
to fade with three furlongs left. TOWN CRIER steadily faded from inside once on the backstretch.

BERNIE LOMAX broke on top but soon shared the lead outside LORD GRANTHAM, moved clear leaving the bend, steadily opened up under urging in the
lane and was kept to task to the wire. ORBITAL STARR chased from just off the inside, angled out through the bend, rallied widest in the stretch and swept
past LITTLE MIGHTY MAN with a sixteenth to go to prove easily second best. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN raced closest to the early speed from outside, came
into the lane from path four, moved clear for second but flattened out the final furlong. LORD GRANTHAM was sent to dispute the pace from inside but gave
way the last quarter mile. LINDALOUIMAGE was a step slow at the break, soon well back while staying well off the inside, angled in into the turn and had no
stretch bid.

YOU'RE IN COREY was kept close from outside, three wide through the turn, drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path inside the last eighth and caught
FULL MAGAZINE at the wire. FULL MAGAZINE broke in stride, showed the way just off the inside, was roused on the bend, gained the rail upper stretch,
lengthened command, was challenged nearing the sixteenth marker, started drifting out under left-handed pressure inside the last sixteenth and lost by a
nod of the head at the finish. TONYS MORNING LINE left the gate a length behind the rest, progressed just off the inside, gained the rail on the turn, came
off the inside after FULL MAGAZINE took his path upper stretch and failed to have a significant late bid. D' YANK forwardly placed from inside on the
backstretch, did not keep up into the bend, angled out widest through the turn and also had to serious stretch bid.

SOLOMON VANDY in midpack early between horses, came into contention four wide on the bend, rallied the last eighth and edged ahead the final forty
yards. SPIN THE BOULEVARD jostled briefly with ZEE FIRE just after the break, recovered to gain the lead from inside, was challenged on the turn, fought
just off the rail through the lane but did not have enough left nearing the wire. ZEE FIRE was forced inward, jostled between rivals bumping soundly with
YOUNG MISCHIEF leaving the chute, settled toward the outside, commenced his bid two wide on the turn, continued his rally along the rail in the stretch,
was too late but caught YOUNG MISCHIEF for third. YOUNG MISCHIEF broke inward jostling with ZEE FIRE then bumping solidly with that one leaving the
chute, prompted the pace outside SPIN THE BOULEVARD, went for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch but slowly wore down in the waning
yards. GONE AGAIN unruly in the gate, broke in the air, was settled, moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, fanned out some for the stretch run
and showed a willingness to run late. PONTUS also unruly in the gate, progressed from outside to have a striking position five wide on the bend but
flattened out for the drive. MY SECRET prominent outside YOUNG MISCHIEF on the backstretch, gave way three wide on the turn.

Footnotes
TROY OUNCE in hand the first half mile, was allowed to go for the lead three wide on the second turn, drew off in the stretch and was wrapped up the final
seventy yards. HIGHLY PERFECT settled at the back, picked up his pace after four furlongs, advanced from inside on the second bend, swung out four
wide for a clear path at the head of the lane and drew away for second the final sixteenth. CHARM THE LADIES broke a bit inward, brushing with MAC
PANDOWDY, advanced from inside on the backstretch, angled out some on the second turn, threatened with two furlongs to go, came three wide into the
stretch, lacked a serious bid but pulled clear for third late. MAC PANDOWDY crowded briefly at the start, raced in the second flight just off the inside through
the early going, made his bid along the rail on the second turn, was no match for TROY OUNCE in the lane and gradually wore down the last furlong.
RHODIUMS PRIDE was taken to the outside early on and failed to menace. UH OH IT'S MAGIC a bit slow at the break, was hustled up between rivals to
gain a clear lead on the first turn, began to wear down just off the inside on the second bend, was headed from outside with a quarter mile left and gave way
for the drive.

COMMISSIONER GULCH broke outward, bumping HOT DAME'S rear, was kept close just outside the latter, took over on the second bend, moved clear
briefly, was challenged again by HOT DAME in the lane but dug in and shook free inside the last sixteenth. HOT DAME bumped from the rear at the start,
soon had a clear lead, showed the way just off the inside, was overtaken from outside on the second turn, did not relent while in a narrow path in the stretch,
lacked the extra needed in the late going and was angled outside COMMISSIONER GULCH nearing the wire. STYLE raced in contention running widest,
drifted out leaving the second bend then ran evenly through the lane. GHAALEB'S RANGER forwardly placed from inside, did not keep up along the rail on
the second turn, angled out some upper stretch for a clear path and gave way the final furlong.

LUNDBERG broke on top, shared the lead from inside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was put to hand urging upper stretch, drew away then was
allowed to coast nearing the wire. DENNIS'S PRIDE in the second flight early from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, edged ahead for second
inside the last furlong then could only just hold his position. GET THROUGH settled to the back, was along the inside taking the turn, lost ground swinging
out widest for the drive, surged the final eighth and got up in time for third. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS was sent to vie for the early lead outside
LUNDBERG, did not stay with that one on the bend and gradually wore down inside he last furlong. CARL G a bit hesitant and awkward at the start, was
taken outside early on, four then five wide through the turn and failed to have a stretch rally. JACK SPRAT chased while toward the outside on the
backstretch, was just off the inside on the bend, fanned four wide for the stretch run and had little to offer. LAYTON THE DAY helped prompt the early pace
from inside but began to fade before finishing a half mile. There was a minus win pool of $178.25.
