from the inside on the turn and was up for place. ACE DESTROYER was away alertly, set the pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top
of the stretch had nothing left. BOXER BRIEF was in range and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.
MOBILIZER was in touch early but chased on the turn and was no real threat.

Footnotes
COLLABORATIVE tracked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. GOLDEN WIND set the
pace and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS was in range,
saved ground on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. PERSEVERE was unhurried early and raced evenly on the turn
but needed more. MISS D'S PRIDE was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no rally. OPEECHEE
settled off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
MS SUEDOO was wall back, trailed the field on the turn, had a bid in mid stretch and was up in time. HEADING WEST set the pace and had a clear lead on
the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was caught late. ORBITING THE SKY was in range and moved up from the inside on the turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. SWEET FINALE settled off the early pace and was roused on the turn but from the six path at
the top of the stretch was no real threat. CREATIVPERFORMANCE stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch leveled off. MORE SAVVY was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.
SO BREANNA was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.

close and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. JOEYBONES was away alertly and hustled along on the turn
but needed more. JAVA POWER showed speed from the inside but chased on the turn and was empty. SEPTIMO was well back, showed nothing, was
outdistanced and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

SWEET SERENADE stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. GLITTER BAY
settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. TURF AND SURF was
well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch rallied late. ANTIGONE was in mid pack and hustled along on the
far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed more. EMERALD LAKE set the pace and had the lead on the far turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch gave way. PLUIE D'AVRIL was unhurried early and forced the pace on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch had nothing left. MIMI'S HOLIDAY was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor. DONNARUMMA was up close early but
trailed the field on the far turn and had no impact. T'PRING tracked the early leaders from the outside but chased on the far turn and dropped back through
the stretch.
