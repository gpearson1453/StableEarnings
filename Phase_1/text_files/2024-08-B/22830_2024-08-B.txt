Footnotes
KURUTU set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. HOT DREAM hit the starting gate, edged closer four wide
around the turn and finished strongly outside to gain the place. DEETZ pressed the pace outside of the winner in the three path, could not match strides with
that foe in upper stretch and lost second late. BUCCHINI raced off the pace three and four wide, lugged in while continuing on the left lead in the lane and
had a mild rally. MAMA MARITZA N broke in a tangle then bumped TAPIT'S SHADY LADY, raced well back three wide and passed tiring rivals.
ONEMORSILVERDOLLAR chased the pace inside and tired in the drive. TAPIT'S SHADY LADY was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never
threatened. TAPPUCCINO failed to menace while racing three wide. BRYN'S VICTORY prompted the pace three wide and faltered in the lane. MIND
SHIFT GAME was outrun inside. MOR DREAMS played no factor while racing two wide.

WOKE UP QUICK set the pace inside, received a pair of right handed cues along the rail midway around the turn, and kicked away down the lane under a
drive. IMAPEPPA stalked in the three path, lost ground under coaxing from the four path around the turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, and kept
on to get up for place. UNEQUIVOCALLY prompted the winning pacesetter from the two path and finished evenly in the three path down the lane for show.
VIVA VICTORY raced off the pace in the four path, came under while angling to the two path entering the turn, but never threatened. IM STILL BRAVE
bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path but never menaced. PAPEETE had an awkward start, rated in the two path but was done
early.

Footnotes
STORMY MITOLE set the pace in the two path, was cued from the rail midway around the turn, drew clear on her left lead in upper stretch, and had enough
late to hold off an outer foe. HERE'S THE KICKER prompted the pace in the four path, was driven in the two path around the turn, lost ground at the top of
the lane, but ran on for place. MAGICAL SONG chased in the five path, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, swung from the four path into
the lane, and finished evenly for show. TINTA ROJA tracked in the three path, was roused from the rail midway around the turn, but flattened. SMART
BEAUTY bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the from the three path and did not threaten in the four path down the lane. SISTER SERENDIPITY
bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed inside and never menaced. POSSESSION stalked in the six path but backed up around the turn.

eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. LADY MONIQUE saved ground off the early pace, dropped back under urging around the far turn, angled four
wide near the five-sixteenths pole, swung widest turning for home and rallied for the place. ANDIE ONE raced off the pace two wide, checked near the
half-mile pole, went three wide around the far turn and rallied between foes to gain the show late. PASAJERA settled off the pace while racing three wide,
advanced three wide around the far turn, angled five wide near the quarter pole, lacked a clear path in upper stretch, angled in nearing the eighth pole and
flattened out. NOBLE DREAMER set the pace in the three and four paths and tired in the final furlong. GRANDMA'S PUDDING chased the pace two wide
and faded. VELOCISSIMA led at the rail early, chased inside around the far turn and faltered in the drive. BELLESHAZZA chased the pace two and three

HONESTO set a rated pace off the rail and drew off under a drive. INITFORTHELOVE steadied entering the first turn and again late on that bend, saved
ground in range, tipped two wide turning for home and kept on well to be clearly second best. WICKED GENIUS chased the pace three and four wide,
lacked the needed rally but churned on for the show. ENGLISH PAINTER saved ground off the pace, went three and four wide around the far turn and
passed tiring rivals. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE prompted the winner two and three wide and faded through the lane. ARTEMUS BRIDGE was outrun while
racing two wide.

Footnotes
LOUIE THE SUN KING bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace inside, was roused midway around the turn, and inched away in the two path
down the lane. RICHY prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed along in the two path around the turn, floated out to the four path in upper stretch,
and chased on to hold place. ZIO LORENZO tracked in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, swung out to the six path turning into the
lane, and finished evenly for show. RHUM SAINT ESPRIT raced up close along the inside but flattened from the three path in the stretch. CATCH A TIGER
rated inside but made no impact. SMOKIN CLOUD bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the two path but did not factor from the four path in the
stretch. JIGSAW raced wellback in the four path and never threatened from the six path down the lane. SOUTH AMERICA popped the gate open during the
load delaying the start, then broke in, trailed along the inside early and never menaced.

Footnotes
TWIZZLE stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, took over in upper stretch, drew clear in midstretch and held safe under a drive. EMONA ROSSA
saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between foes. JUST MERCY raced in range in the four path and finished evenly to
maintain the show. LIGHTNING DUST set the pace the two path, was collared in upper stretch and weakened in the lane. BLACK BELT BARBIE had her
head turned at the start, raced off the pace tow wide and lacked a rally. BIGBOUQUETOFROSES chased the pace wide five and lacked a closing bid.
BONNIE SANDRA trailed in the two path.
