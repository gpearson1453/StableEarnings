DIVA DE KELA was just off the early leaders along the inside, angled five wide into the lane to bid upper stretch, rallied and was along in time. TIZ HOPPIN
forced the pace outside PRINCESSOFCHITOWN to bid in the turn, showed in front midstretch and could not contain the winner's late run.
PRINCESSOFCHITOWN made the pace about the three path on a short lead and came up empty the final furlong. BOURN stalked the pace four wide, was
caught six wide between rivals into the lane and moved up but could not reach the top ones. MAGIC IN A HAT bumped with a rival at the start, saved
ground and failed to mount a solid bid. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS moved four wide in the turn, fanned seven wide into the lane and weakened. QUEEN OF THE
ICE was not a threat four wide. HEY ROXY bumped with a rival at the start, stalked four wide, angled six wide into the lane and weakened.
