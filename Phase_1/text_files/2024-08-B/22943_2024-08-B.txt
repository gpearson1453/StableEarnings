Footnotes
CAMERON SLOUGH reserved in the beginning and taken to the inside, eased off the fence around the first turn, tracked three deep up the backstretch and
far turn, tipped four wide past the quarter pole, rallied to the front under hand urging and drew clear late. NANCI GRIFFITH stepped to the front and showed
the way on the inside, took pressure from outside in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch, drifted out and while being
confronted by CAMERON SLOUGH, yielded to that rival and held second. SWEET VENGEANCE stalked along the rail then started to pull on the clubhouse
turn, continued to tug up the backstretch, coaxed along the fence through the far turn, drifted out at the sixteenth pole and finished willingly for third.
MARINAS TINA (IRE) bumped with inner rival at the start, settled in the two path off the pace, crept closer between rivals, continued two wide to the lane,
tipped out and lacked room in traffic briefly before splitting foes in upper stretch, kept on through the final furlong but could not get by SWEET VENGEANCE
for third. DORIE MILLER bumped with outer rival at the start, stalked two the three wide in hand, roused three deep on the far turn and weakened in the late
stages. ONE ARROW raced up close in the two path early, applied pressure to the leader in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn and into the lane,
could not go on with the leader in upper stretch and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
EPIONE in range from outside then closest in pursuit outside rivals into the turn, took aim two to three wide around the bend, drew alongside the leader at
the eighth pole, kicked clear wit a sixteenth left to run and won going away. FLY AT KNIGHT coaxed from the gate, sped clear from inside, led along the rail
then a bit off the fence into the drive, set down in upper stretch, challenged by EPIONE at the eighth pole, yielded to that rival midstretch and finished a clear
second. PLAY MY SPEED tracked the speed from inside, came under a ride on the turn, driven a bit off the rail into the stretch and could not rally. THIRST
FOR PASSION dwelt at the start and lagged well behind the field in the early going, saved ground while passing a rival on the turn and finished full of run.
PRACTICAL DAZZLE coaxed from the gate, stalked off the rail then outside a rival into the turn, lost ground around the bend, spun three wide into the lane
and had little left for the stretch run. ANNIE FOX tracked the lone leader just out of range off the rail, dropped back two wide on the turn and tired. THE
STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF THIRST FOR PASSION AND RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEM AND IS CONSIDERED A

Footnotes
TEQUILAANDTHERAPY raced in range from inside, dropped to mid-pack on the backstretch, drew closer on the far turn, tipped two wide into the lane,
reeled in HOW ABOUT PAVEL past the sixteenth pole and drove past in the final thirty yards. HOW ABOUT PAVEL set the pace from inside, inched away
on the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, roused at the top of the stretch, asked left handed past the eighth pole, carried a diminishing lead still
clear into deep stretch but could not fend off the winner late. RENATUS got shuffled early then raced keenly along the inside, shifted to the two path on the
clubhouse turn, got boxed in from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, angled to the inside then steered back out past the quarter pole,
chased two wide into the lane, came back inside in the lane and finished well to gain third. ORANGE THUNDER rated from the rail position early, was
closest in pursuit through the far turn still on the fence, tipped out at the top of the lane, chased within striking distance down the stretch and could not
summon the needed late kick. CHILLY PHILLY hopped at the start, pulled when reserved along the inside early, coaxed along early on the far turn but had
to pause in traffic behind a rival, ridden along again into the stretch and could not rally. GRAZEN GATOR reserved two then three wide on the first turn,
trailed into the backstretch, angled in for the far turn, advanced from inside late on the bend but proved no menace in the late stages. WARM RECEPTION
raced in mid-pack two wide early on, lost positions on the far turn then got blocked at the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane and failed to make an
impact. AMELIA'S ECHO sat off the pace outside a pair of rivals, continued three wide into the far turn, eased out and came five wide into the stretch but
failed to get involved. ABBEY THEATRE tracked three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, moved out around the far turn and exited the bend in the
five path and came up empty. LONG LEGGED BABS stalked the lone speed two wide, weakened two then three wide on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
SOUL OF A WARRIOR showed the way early a bit off the rail then along the inside, padded the lead past the half-mile pole, opened up under coaxing on
the far tur, asked right handed in upper stretch, continued well clear under strong handling midstretch, asked again with the right hand at the sixteenth pole,
grew weary late but managed to hold off the late charge from DORINE'S WILD CAT in the closing moments. DORINE'S WILD CAT traveled outside a rival
at the back, raced off the rail still off the on the backstretch, tipped out and passed a pair of rivals around the far turn, moved back in to chase two wide into
the stretch, closed steadily through the lane, drew alongside the winner late but ran out of time. ALOHA KITTEN followed from off the pace two wide then
along the rail, ridden along at the three-eighths pole, entered the lane in the two path and weakened. SWEET HELLO raced up close two to three wide on
the first turn, was closest in pursuit off the rail to the far turn, weakened two, three, then four wide around that bend and tired down the lane. STEIN'S GIRL
stumbled leaving the gate, moved to the inside, trailed up the backstretch, moved out on the far turn and came five wide into the lane, eased in the stretch
and walked off.

Footnotes
CALI CAT bumped between rivals leaving the gate, reserved and moved inside, crept closer on the backstretch, moved into range on the far turn then
challenged from inside late on the bend, kicked clear at the top of the stretch, asked right handed midstretch and was kept busy under steady handling to
remain clear to the wire. CALL ME SIR veered in and bumped rival, raced up close four deep briefly then tucked to the two path in a stalking position, tipped
three then four wide on the far turn and launched a bid entering the lane, could not match the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second.
UNCLE EVCO got knocked into inner rival and lost his path at the start, traveled in the two path then advanced inside on the backstretch, saved ground
through the far turn, finished determinedly but could not get by CALL ME SIR for second. KING OF DRAGONS pulled and became rank early, was very
green along the inside on the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and could not threaten in the furlong grounds while earning a minor award. FAR OVER
LOADED fought for the lead from inside then took control around the clubhouse turn, cleared briefly then took pressure from outer rival, maintained
command around the far turn, drifted off the fence leaving the bend, lost command shortly after and weakened in the drive. VALENTINES CANDY trailed
from inside to the quarter pole, angled out leaving the far turn and improved position. CHASIN A DOLLAR sat off the pace and moved inside then shifted to
the two path, went three deep into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and could not make an impact. FAR WESTERN showed early speed outside
FAR OVER LOADED, ceded command then stalked two then three wide around the first turn, dropped off the pace in the middle stages, angled four wide
around the far turn and faded. GIANT LUTHER bumped at the start, stalked from inside, started to pull and had to take up when running on heels on the
clubhouse turn, went up to press the pace on the backstretch, coaxed along to keep up on the second bend, chased three wide into the drive and tired.
ESCAPE PLAN got knocked into rival leaving the gate, rushed up three deep and was a bit rank approaching the first turn and around the bend, dropped off
the pace on the backstretch, went two wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
CALL ME SIR FROM SECOND TO THIRD FOR DUCKING IN AT THE START AND CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION WHICH COST UNCLE EVCO A
CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

inside around the bend, drew away when roused in upper stretch, padded the lead under hand urging to the sixteenth pole and was in hand late.
DASHINGLY dueled inside SEISMIC BEAUTY early, could not keep up with that rival leaving the backstretch, chased on the inside then two wide into the
lane and kept on for a clear second. NAFISA hopped a bit at the start, coaxed along early chasing from outside, went five wide into the turn, eased over to
the three path around the bend, could not summon the needed rally in the final furlong and weakened while racing a clear third. GATE TO PARADISE

wide into the lane and faded. AFFAIR coaxed along chasing out of range, traveled three deep then moved to the four path briefly on the turn, came three
wide into the drive and weakened. RICH OF JOY stalked the pace outside a rival into the turn, moved to the inside leaving the far turn and tired. CRIMSON

Footnotes
RHYTHEM ON STAGE unhurried in the early going outside rivals then angled to the inside, went between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, swung four wide
into the stretch, closed well from outside and got up late. BELMONT BILL stalked three deep then two wide, chased within striking distance with a furlong
left to run, challenged outside the leader then between late and got outclosed by the winner. WESTERN GRIT sped clear and set the pace up the
backstretch, led along the rail through the turn, moved off the fence in upper stretch, remained clear under hand urging to the sixteenth pole, put to the crop
in the final forty yards but was overtaken by the top pair shortly after. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) got floated in and bumped leaving the gate, sat off the
pace outside a rival into the turn, raced in the three path turning for home and summoned mild late bid. SANGER came in to bother NEW YORK DREAMS
(GB) at the start, raced towards the rear off the inside then outside a rival at the back into the turn, angled out to the five path around the turn and improved
position. KING AND COUNTRY chased outside a rival then moved inside, lost ground on the turn, exited the bend in the two path and failed to rally. DEVIL
AMONG US stalked from off the rail then steered to the inside for the turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. DES DOIGTS tracked from inside,
got put in a bit tight past the three-eighths pole, dropped back around the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
JUST IS stalked from inside, took aim two wide on the turn, challenged from outside with a furlong remaining, seized command midstretch and kicked clear
in the final sixteenth. CLASS CLOWN coaxed to the front, controlled the pace from inside to the stretch, collared by the winner at the eighth pole,
relinquished the lead shortly after and held off R. RAY D. late for second. DR. RAY D. had to take small holds at various points behind PRINCESS MAGIC
up the backstretch, drifted out at the three-eighths pole, was quickly corrected and steered to the inside, angled back out leaving the bend, showed late
effort through the lane but could not get up for second. SOLID TUNE away alertly then was forwardly placed between rivals, fell back to last when climbing
along, ridden along the rail around the bend and kept on to round out the superfecta. BARBERA came out in the beginning, raced in range from the far
outside, took a bump from inner rival approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, entered the lane in the five path, moved in a bit then spun five wide into the
lane and weakened. SHES JUST FLUFFY drifted out leaving the gate, chased between foes then four wide into the turn, lost ground around the bend,
moved into the two path and had little left for the drive. PRINCESS MAGIC raced up close on the pace between rivals into the turn, fell out of range two then
three wide on the bend and faded out of contention. ANYBODY'S CHOICE drifted out shortly after the start, forwardly placed three deep leaving the
backstretch, lost ground through the turn, entered the lane in the four path and weakened.
