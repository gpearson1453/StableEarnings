MONGOLIAN SPRING was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, came four-wide into the stretch then took the
lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. JACOB YEN was forwardly placed, swung out to be three-wide entering the stretch then angled
further out nearing the eighth pole to be five-wide and finished strongly. COY ROY broke out slightly then saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted
out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held on well for third. SUN LA GOLD prompted COY ROY racing along the outside and weakened during the
drive. BOOGIE ON DOWN was in tight shortly after the start then saved ground racing close-up, had the rail open up entering the stretch but lacked a rally.
FURYS GIFT dropped back early while racing three-wide and trailed.

eighth pole and prevailed under strong handling. SURPRISE FASHION broke out to bump REGULATION DAZED then saved ground while being reserved
off the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished fast. REGULATION DAZED was bumped at the start by SURPRISE FASHION then was allowed
to settle while two-wide, rallied five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. DECIMATE tracked PRINCE OF LUCK while racing two-wide, moved up to
offer a bold bid to that one nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out late. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT settled in the middle of the field while racing four-wide
on the turn, angled to the inside entering the stretch and went evenly. ANNA'S IRON MAN was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, came five-wide into
the stretch and tired. TUMAC MOUNTAIN was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch but failed to be a factor.

PARCO broke in then was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, came four-wide into the stretch and was up in the final
strides. WARREN'S MEMORABLE was forwardly placed while racing along the inside, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and closed strongly to
just miss. LAKER JET vied with BLOWING BAYOU for the lead from along the inside, disposed of that one before going a half mile to open a clear lead and
then just failed to last in a game effort. SHES GOT THE POWER was reserved off the pace, rallied four-wide into the stretch, offered a bid nearing the
eighth pole and then hung. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV saved ground while being allowed to settle but lacked a late response. LUVAHAPPYENDING was
unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. BLOWING BAYOU vied for the lead from along the outside early and gave
way after five furlongs.

Footnotes
MIST OONA B was forwardly placed early, rallied five-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and proved best under strong handling.
INFINITE LOVE was unhurried early early, rallied three-wide into the stretch steadied and altered course further out nearing the eighth pole running up on
traffic and closed strongly when clear. METEOR SHOWER was reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
LIBBY'S GAMBIT vied wit FOREST ACCLAMATION from along the outside and weakened during the drive. FOREST ACCLAMATION vied for the lead
from along the inside to the eighth pole and tired late. CAMDEN HIGH prompted the early pace while racing three-wide and tired. CHAMP OF PAGNE was
close-up early racing along the inside, steadied in tight nearing the half mile pole and failed to threaten after that. THE TRAINER OF FOREST
ACCLAMATION LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST LIBBY'S GAMBIT BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS OF THE RACE THE STEWARDS MADE NO
CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH,
