Footnotes
FOR THE BISCUIT sprinted to the front to set the pace from a clear lead then kicked away in upper stretch to prove best. RIBALDRY (IRE) stalked the pace
from the inside to the final turn then angled out three wide, moved up around the final turn and was gaining late but was too late. AUNT RUTH was allowed
to settle near the back to the final turn then made a two to three wide mild bid while tipping out to four wide in upper stretch for a late rally to be up for the
show. SUM KINDA PRETTY prompted the pace from the two path to the final turn then tipped in to save ground but lacked the late response. KAIYAS
SONG raced in the middle of the pace and failed to menace. KING'S LEGACY raced in the middle of the pack from two wide but was never a factor. LUNAR
ICE was unhurried at the back of the field while racing widest down the backstretch and was never a threat.

couldn't fend the outside rival and was a clear second. PINK SHOELACES was away alertly to take a clear lead to the top of the stretch and tired. WHAT'S

WAY TOO FAST went to the lead under pressure down the backstretch then inched away on the turn, drew clear in the stretch and held on for the win.
KOLTEN'S PRIDE raced near the back then moved up from three wide on the turn, kept on to make the late gain on the leader but couldn't catch and was
second best. MAN WITH THE MOVES chased the leaders through the turn then made a mild late rail bid in the stretch. FAVORABLE RETURN raced off
the pace while going three wide on the turn for a mild bid but weakened late. TINO showed no speed and was not a factor. NOAH MY BABY was hustled
away from the gate to press the pace from the inside to the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
TEMPLE was well placed off the pace on the inside to the end of the bend then moved out to three wide into upper stretch and cruised home. KING ME
pressed the pace through the final turn then engaged the leader and battled to mid stretch with KID MARVELOUS but was no match for the winner. KID
MARVELOUS went to the early lead and held that position to the final turn then was headed near the top of the stretch, battled down the stretch with KING
ME and gave way grudgingly. NOBRAG JUSTFACT raced off the pace to the final turn then moved up around the turn, went four to five wide into the stretch
for the late run and missed the show. ATTA BOY ANTHONY was unhurried down the backstretch then made a mild inside bid on the final turn but failed to
menace. AZURE SKY raced near the back and was not a factor. JOHN'S ROCK stalked the pace to the final turn and when asked lacked the late response.
HARD RYE GUY was allowed to settle at or near the back but was never a threat.

Footnotes
MINT DRIVEN rushed up to cut the corner going into the first turn to take the clear lead, held that position to the top of the stretch and fended off the inside
and outside rivals to hold on for the win. GATHER THE FACTS raced near the back around the first turn then steadily advanced from the inside to the top of
the stretch, tipped out to three wide for a rally but was not enough. ORDERLY TRANSITION (GB) raced off the pace through the final turn then slipped up
the rail to challenge the leader but couldn't collar but fought gamely. KITTEN'S TEMPER raced in the middle of the pack through the final turn then made a
late two wide rally for a piece of the money. HALCYON DAYS was off slow and unhurried to the first turn, steadily advanced through the final turn then
fanned out to be five wide in upper stretch for a late bid to improve position. JOYFUL CROWN (IRE) saved ground but failed to menace. ISLE BE THERE
went to a pressured lead to the first turn then pressed the pace from two wide to the final turn and faded. CACHACEIRA pressed the pace to the first turn
then settled off the pace while racing three wide but lacked the late response. AUNTJOBUSINESS raced five wide into the first turn then settled near the
back while racing three or four wide and was not involved. GAMBI went five wide into the first turn then raced three or four wide throughout and was not a
threat. COURT STAR broke outward leaving the gate, then was forwardly placed to midway through the final turn and dropped back.
