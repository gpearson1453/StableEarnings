SLIME QUEEN prompted the pace three wide and then dueled for the lead two wide on the far turn, made a bid leaving the turn to kick clear and remained
clear to the wire to prove best under a drive. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN stalked the pace four wide, three wide on the far turn and made a four wide bid off
the bend but could not get to the winner while being clearly second best. HIGH VIBES tracked the pace three wide, came five wide off the bend and had a
mild late kick to gain the show award. BRAMBLE BUSH was throwing head and unprepared when the gates opened to be off slow, then moved up on the
inside on the backstretch to track the leaders, then cut the corner off the turn but had no kick in the drive. MERCY MERCY was settled on the outside,
advanced four wide on the outside on the far turn, came six wide off the bend and had no serious rally. TOMARIE was well placed on the inside to the two
path and weakened. HOP TO A DECISION was reserved early and lacked a rally. TRIXIE'S TIME set the pace on the inside and then dueled for command

KING TSUNAMI was well rated two wide, made a bid between rivals leaving the quarter pole, then came two wide into the land and kicked clear to prove
best with speed to spare in a sharp effort. WORK FROM HOME was reserved early, made a three wide move nearing the quarter pole, vied for command
off the turn with the winner but proved to be no match for the winner late while being clearly second best. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER was reserved three to
four wide, advanced on the far turn and came six wide into the lane and was along for the show award. SIREN was keen early two wide into the first turn
while setting the fast pace, moved to the inside by the five eighths marker, then relented the lead by the seven sixteenths and faded. THE MAN TO SEE
stalked the early pace and made a early bid two wide to be clear on the far turn, but weakened in the drive. IMPAZIBLE PRINCE was reserved early on the
outside and was not a threat. BRADY failed to menace. LETSGETLUCKYTONITE was settled on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
FIRE DOWN BELOW prompted the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then was kept to right handed crop to prove
best. HERE'S WALDO chased the pace on the inside, then moved out and was between rivals leaving the turn and ran on to the wire to be clearly second
best. INDIRECTLY chased the pace three wide and weakened while gaining the show award. SPOOKY ONE set the pace on the inside and was headed at
the five sixteenths and weakened. PETULANT DELIGHT was settled back early, very wide on the turn and was not a factor. AGAINST THE ODDS was
settled early, three wide on the turn and was not a threat. PER RULING 24111PN FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, FIRE DOWN
BELOW WAS DQ'D DUE TO A VIOLATION OF THE HISA RULE OF SIX STRIKES.
