Footnotes
SIR MICK , bumped by VERNOR'S JUNCTION when that one was forced in leaving the chuted, raced forwardly in the two path around the turn, closed in
the stretch and was up inside the sixteenth pole. NARIZON caused a chain reaction when bearing in leaving the chute, sped to the early lead, set the pace
along the inner rail and weakened late. LET'S HAVE A PARTY forced in VERNOR'S JUNCTION when forced in by NARIZON leaving the chute, stayed in
the two path around the turn and flattened out. BOBBY ROCKY JAKE , three deep around the turn, was no threat. VERNOR'S JUNCTION was checked in
tight quarters when bumping SIR MICK leaving the chute, saved ground around the turn and weakened. WHO SAYS SO broke slowly, steadied in close
quarters entering the turn and was no factor. CAPED CRUSADER , outrun, swung wide in upper stretch. ELUSIVE NOTION , outrun, steadied in close
quarters entering the turn. Following an objection by the rider of LET'S HAVE A PARTY, NARIZON was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
LA MACCHINA ROSSA , three then two wide prompting the early pace, bid between foes into the backstretch, dueled holding a slim lead between horses
into the far turn, emerged in a battle to the inside of NAMI entering the lane, briefly ceded the advantage nearing the sixteenth marker, battled back under
right handed asks and was edging away at the wire. NAMI was bumped soon after the start, raced in the clear stalking the embattled trio of leaders, dropped
in a path and bid three deep near the three sixteenths, sparred outside the winner into the lane, gained a slight lead approaching the sixteenth pole then
gave way grudgingly. BABY SOX broke slowly, trailed while saving ground into the first turn, angled out leaving the half and was put to a solid ride three
wide, gathered momentum leaving the far turn and churned on to gain the show. SEAFARER saved ground off the early pace, edged up under a ride and
towards the inner rail past the quarter pole, eased out into the stretch but lacked a closing kick. STYLISH ANNA sped clear early, set the pace towards the
inside, met outer bids soon into the backstretch, battled to the three sixteenths then weakened. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM exchanged a bump with NAMI soon
after the break, lagged inside, swung out nearing the lane and offered a mild kick. SWEET FACTOR , four wide tracking into the first turn, bid three deep
into the backstretch, vied to the quarter pole then weakened.

PURE REALIZATION saved ground on the turns stalking the duel, eased outside turning for home, closed steadily, led late and drove clear. SNACK , three
wide the first turn, moved to the two path entering the second turn, dueled outside TOUCHED UP and faded late. TOUCHED UP , sent soon after the break,
remained along the inner rail, disputed the pace to the sixteenth pole and weakened. CROWN THAT SAINT , steadied in traffic entering the first turn,
checked in tight quarters entering the second turn and lacked the needed rally. HOLLYWOOD HERO , never a factor, passed tired horses. BUKOVEL , four
wide the first turn, weakened on the final turn. DOWSING ROD , three wide on the turns, weakened. MINIMO , no factor, raced four wide the second and
final turns. KENOBI bobbled at the break, pulled up on the backstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
BOX N BEN was soundly bumped nearing the first turn, recovered and was forwardly placed three wide past the half, moved up outside EL DIVINO NINO
and engaged that one nearing the quarter pole, dueled on a slim lead into the stretch, responded to left handed asks and edged away. EL DIVINO NINO
sped clear early and dropped in to set a rated pace, dug in when joined into the far turn, battled inside the winner to the head of the stretch then gave way
grudgingly. RESTLESS bobbled inward at the break bumping RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE, corrected then was a bit keyed up when rated back off the leader
heading to the first turn, came out bumping a foe, corrected and stalked inside into the far turn, eased near the three sixteenths but came up empty in the
drive. I HAD ENOUGH , bumped at the start, chased three wide through the backstretch, angled in nearing the eighth pole but failed to generate a solid run.
RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE , bumped from both sides at the break then was squeezed back, dropped off the pace then failed to make an impact.

LAW OF THE JUNGLE rated towards the inner rail past the stands the first time, eased out with pursuit into the far turn, swung four wide entering the
stretch, closed steadily under pressure, switched over his correct lead in deep stretch and forged past PRINCE OF PORTLAND to prove best. PRINCE OF
PORTLAND prompted the pace two wide, moved to apply more pressure past the three eighths, drifted three wide battling outside HERE COMES RUSTY
into the stretch, took over a sixteenth out, failed to contain the winner's outer charge then gave way grudgingly while drifting in slightly near the wire. RUDY
RUDY RUDY , three wide in close attendance, was under a ride pursuing three wide past the quarter pole, dropped in a path soon into the stretch, churned
on and steadied near the wire. HERE COMES RUSTY cleared early then angled in towards the inner rail to set the pace, handled outer pressure from the
five sixteenths to the head of the lane, ceded command a sixteenth out and faded. EYES ELEVEN saved ground off the early pace, angled out for the
backstretch run, was under a hustling ride past the three sixteenths but could only muster up a slight run. ASCENDANCE hesitated at the break to be away
last, raced three wide past the half mile marker and failed to respond. An objection by the rider of RUDY RUDY RUDY against PRINCE OF PORTLAND
alleging interference nearing the wire was not allowed

SOUTHERN DISTRICT stalked the pace, was under urging near the three eighths pole, rallied outside, led late and drew clear. AMERICAN D'ORO
prompted the pace outside TWIXTER, took the lead approaching the final turn, was overtaken late and finished willingly to hold the place. TWIXTER
sprinted clear and was taken to the inner rail on the first turn, lost the lead leaving the backstretch, was checked in narrow quarters entering the final turn
and faded. ONLY GET'N BETTER was outrun. I AM THAT I AM stayed along the inner rail most of the race and was no factor. FORMAL ORDER chased
the pace in the two path and gave way.

HITTHEROADJAK vied inside under rating, poked a head in front after a half mile, remained locked in a tussle with an outer rival to the three eighths,
spurted clear into the far turn, moved away with authority and under a drive two wide into the stretch then continued to widen while kept to task. LITTLE
LANCE steadied back off foes near the seven eighths, regrouped and settled towards the inside, awaited room leaving the far turn, got through to the inside
of a rival past the three sixteenths then gave willing chase to the wire. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR stalked the pace three wide, was under pressure four
wide past the quarter pole, failed to kick on and faded in the drive. JARDANI lagged off the pace and off the inside, was under a hustling ride into the far
turn, saved ground into the stretch then lacked a serious run. BONDED drifted in a bit at the break, corrected and took over while two wide, was joined from
his inside leaving the five eighths, dueled with the winner past the three eighths, failed to keep pace past the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
LANDSLIDE IS HOME , quickly went clear, dropped in and set a rated pace, responded to solid handling in upper stretch and held tenaciously to deny
ARMY CADET. ARMY CADET , bumped at the break, edged up early and prompted the pace outside the winner, ranged up under pressure leaving the
furlong grounds, kept on willingly and saved the place. HE'S ON FIRE drafted in early, saved ground stalking the pace, eased out under pressure for the
drive and closed steadily. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD , bumped at the break, settled well off the pace while saving ground, gained towards the rail past the
three sixteenths, was briefly stalled near the eighth pole, shifted out and rallied. GREATANDGOOD , steadied along early, rated off the pace while saving
ground, worked outward near the quarter pole and churned on. CHICA CHUCK , shuffled back into the first turn, stalked between runners early, chased
outside a rival past the three eighths, remained in range to the head of the stretch then faded. TIME THE AVENGER lost ground three to four wide, chased
to about the far turn then faltered. An objection by the rider of CHICA CHUCK against HE'S ON FIRE for alleged interference entering the first turn was not
allowed.
