CLEARLY CREEPS was well rated while setting the pace throughout and drew off in the stretch to prove best. NIGHT TIZZY stalked the pace from two wide
then challenged leader near the half mile marker but was not match for the winner and held the place. REINA'S VISION was checked after leaving the
starting gate, settled around the first turn then made a four wide middle move, held position on the final turn then made a late four wide run in the stretch.
LEXI'S FURY raced off the pace down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and into the stretch but faltered late. DAT'S A GOODE ONE was
forwardly placed around the first turn, raced three wide down the backstretch but fell back on the turn and flattened out. STARTINI trailed the field around
the first turn then rushed to contention from five wide down the backstretch then three wide around the final turn and tired.

MO DIXIE DIVA raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then slipped through into the stretch and engaged the leader at the eighth pole and drew
clear. RUN AWAY SAMARI rushed to a pressured lead through the turn then was headed by inside rival at the eighth pole but couldn't fend off the
challenge but was a clear second. REAL DEAL RYAN tracked the leaders from four wide early then fell back off the pace into the turn, tipped out to five
wide in upper stretch and showed late interest to be up for the show. ALL AMERICAN PAT vied for the lead from two wide to the top of the stretch and
passed tiring rivals. STAND BY TIME was off a step slow and trailed the field through the turn then made a belated midtrack run to improve position. MISS
E. FU was off slow then hustled to contention from five wide then four wide around the turn and tired. DONTFORGETRDREAMS raced off the pace to the
turn and showed little. CAROLINA JACY rushed to contention from three wide through the turn and gave way.

GO BROTHER GO saved ground while racing off the pace through the final turn then angled out to three wide at the eighth pole and made a late surge
under determined handling for the win. ONE MORE SLEEP bumped with SPIRITUAL MIRAGE leaving the gate and rushed to the clear lead through the
final turn then was headed at the eighth pole and battled down the stretch inside of SAUCER EYES and GO BROTHER GO to the wire and lost the photo.
SAUCER EYES prompted the pace through the final turn then moved to engage the leader at the eighth pole and battled to the wire between GO
BROTHER GO and ONE MORE SLEEP to the wire but was outkicked. DOSS bumped with SPIRITUAL MIRAGE leaving the gate then was unhurried down
the backstretch, moved up from three wide around the final turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and made the late rally. ITS WILD AGAIN raced in
the middle of the pack while saving ground and made a belated kick in the stretch. KINGPRIN raced four wide into the first turn then steadily advanced from
four wide through the final turn and faltered. MINE YOUR BIZ raced near the back and passed tiring rivals. SPIRITUAL MIRAGE was unsettled in the gate
then was jostled at the start, then raced up to be forwardly placed through the final turn but lacked the late response. STRUTTIN APRIORITY raced in the
middle of the pack and had to steady slightly going into the backstretch while being in tight and failed to menace. GRAND ENCORE was allowed to settle
near the back, raced three wide at the half mile marker and flattened out.

FLAT OUT RUNNER showed no early speed then rushed up the rail on the turn, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch, shifted back inside at the eighth
pole and kicked clear and held on. VERO CAMPIONE was void of speed while racing three wide on the turn then tipped out to five wide in upper stretch to
make the late rally but was too late. C F HENRY rushed away to prompt the pace to the turn then weakened around the turn but made a late mild bid to
improve position. EL IT raced near the back to the turn then moved up from three wide on the turn, tipped to four wide in upper stretch and passed tiring
rivals. ZAPAWAY chased the leaders to the turn then moved up from two wide and drove past the leader at the quarter pole, drew clear in mid stretch but
tired late. FRIEND'S DO CARE showed good early speed to midway through the turn and retreated. OVER PAID sprinted to a clear lead to the quarter pole
where he was headed and gave way.

AUTISM COMMUNITY was unhurried around the first turn then steadily advanced from three wide to the top of the stretch and matched strides outside of
MARIAH'S CANDY to the wire and won the photo. MARIAH'S CANDY broke outward leaving the gate then rushed to a clear lead to the half mile marker
where she was engaged by START SINGING while matching strides to the top of the stretch then matched stride inside of AUTISM COMMUNITY to the
wire but was denied. MIDNIGHT BELLA stalked the pace to the top of the stretch then made a four wide late kick but was no match for the dueling duo.
START SINGING tracked the leader to the half mile marker where she matched strides outside of MARIAH'S CANDY to the top of the stretch and faded.
EVE'S DELIGHT raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then fell back early on down the backstretch and remained back. ALLIACEOUS raced
in the middle of the pack while saving ground but was outrun.

Footnotes
ONLY A DREAM rushed to the lead and was challenged on the turn then drew clear in the stretch. MALAKI EMPIRE raced off the pace from two wide then
engaged the leader around the turn but couldn't collar and was second best. YES JACK hopped outward at the start then moved up from three wide to the
turn then saved ground around the turn and made a late inside rally. CATCHEM IF YOU CAN vied for the early lead from the inside then raced off the pace
on the turn while making a mild bid into the stretch but was outfinished. VOYANT raced close up on the pace and moved between horses midway through
the turn and faltered. ALL SAINTS showed no early speed but moved between horses at the quarter pole to improve position. CADILLAC COWBOY raced
near the back and was not a factor. TROUBLE WITH SUGAR vied for the early lead from three wide and gave way. COUNTRY CAT JAKE was always
back.
