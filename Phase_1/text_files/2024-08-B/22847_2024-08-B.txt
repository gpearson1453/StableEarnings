Footnotes
EMERALD BAY vied inside several rivals into the first turn then dueled with DR RUBEN M around the bend, took a short lead around the far turn, shook free
in upper stretch, drew away when asked right handed and remained clear under steady handling late. DR RUBEN M vied between foes briefly then dueled
from outside to the far turn, asked to keep up with EMERALD BAY around the bend, lost touch with the winner at the top of the stretch and kept on to hold
second. CANO FOR THE WIN showed early speed while fanned five deep, dropped back around the clubhouse turn while remaining well off the rail, drew
closer into the far turn, rounded the bend four then three wide, then offered a mild rally to earn third while whittling the gap on the top pair. GAME WARRIOR
hit the gate and bumped inner rival at the start, fought four deep between rivals into the clubhouse turn then tracked in the four path around the bend, crept
closer in the middle stages, lost ground three then two wide on the far turn and weakened. CANYAHEARMEKNOCKIN stumbled badly in the beginning,
trailed on the inside then two wide, went two wide into the far turn, tired around the bend, moved out approaching the stretch then steered around the
outrider at the top of the lane, eased to the wire and walked off. AUTHENTIC SPIRIT bumped with GAME WARRIOR in the beginning, showed early speed
three deep then stalked the top pair from off the rail, dropped back on the far turn, pulled up early in the stretch, bled following the race and was transported
off the track via equine ambulance.

Footnotes
COURT SNORT settled outside a rival near the back, drew closer off the rail around the first turn, traveled two wide then between rivals on the backstretch,
angled four wide leaving the far turn, challenged four deep in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole and drove clear. DONTMESSWITHTESS toss her
head and broke slow, tucked inside at the back, went outside a rival on the clubhouse turn then pulled the rider forward, stalked in hand three deep at the
half-mile pole, challenged the top pair from outside with three furlongs left to run, fought three deep to the lane, put a head in front in upper stretch, lost
command past the eighth pole and stayed on for second. SMART MONIQUE bumped with inner rival at the start, had to steady off heels early on the first
turn, tracked two wide through the far turn, moved out and finished willingly to gain the show honors. JESSEBEAR had early speed between rivals leaving
the chute then dueled from outside, vied between rivals holding a short advantage on the second bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened
in deep stretch. SUSHI STICKS away quickly and led three deep leaving the chute, ceded command and moved inside, stalked the top pair in hand, saved
ground to the stretch and could not produce a bid. QUANTUM INNERGY bumped with SMART MONIQUE in the beginning, went up to duel from inside and
took a short lead, lost command on the backstretch, fought inside a pair of rivals through the far turn and into the lane, stayed on to the eighth pole then
weakened in late stages.

Footnotes
TARANTINO vied four deep between rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, fought inside REDLINE while in the four path turning for home, put a
head in front in upper stretch, dueled inside REDLINE through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. REDLINE vied six then five deep up the backstretch,
continued to battle five deep around the turn, carried a short lead over TARANTINO into the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch, fought back gamely
through the lane but had to settle for second best. TAHOE SUNRISE brushed inner rival leaving the gate, showed early speed fighting for command three
deep between rivals, continued to fight in the same path through the turn, lost touch with the top pair outside the eighth pole and kept on for a clear third.
BALADI stalked behind the early speed battle from off the rail, navigated the turn three then four wide and could not summon the needed rally in the lane.
READY TO POUNCE showed early speed five deep then chased after the leaders up the backstretch, rounded the bend in the four then five path while
outside BALADI and could not summon the needed response when called upon. CHASIN MUNNY vied inside rivals then between rivals up the backstretch,
fought on to the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane and faded. FORGIVING SPIRIT stumbled then brushed with TAHOE SUNRISE and had his
path taken at the start, moved inward and rushed up keenly from inside to vie for command, fought along the rail to the quarter pole, could not keep up with
the leaders into the stretch and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
BOTTLE ROCKET (FR) bobbled slightly then settled inside off the pace, drew closer on the backstretch, pushed whittling the gap on the leader around the
far turn, tipped out into the lane, drew alongside with a furlong remaining, gained the advantage midstretch and won going away. SHE'Z THE LAW dueled
for the lead from outside then inched ahead around the bend and clear into the backstretch, moved to the rail, led along the inside entering the drive,
confronted by BOTTLE ROCKET (FR) at the eighth pole, yielded to that rival and managed to save second. INTERPLAY stalked the speed from the two
path, coaxed along into the far turn, chased two to three wide turning for home, finished willingly and just missed second. HOLLY GOQUICKLY (FR) steered
to the rail racing at the back, went between foes on the backstretch, found the rail once more on the far turn and could not threaten while earning a minor
award. GOLDEN SKYLINE sat off the pace in the two path, traveled outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, went three then two wide on the far turn and
lacked a rally. SPANISH CARA (IRE) broke a step slow and inward, rushed up inside to duel for the lead then ceded command around around the
clubhouse turn, switched to the outside of the leader, applied some pressure at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased after the leader two wide through the far
turn and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
LOVE OUR FAMILY dueled for the lead from outside into the first turn then pressed the pace, took over at the nine-sixteenths pole, cleared inner rival
leaving the backstretch, opened up on the far turn and was kept to task maintaining a comfortable lead to the line. RUN FOR MY HONEY forwardly placed
four then three wide early, stayed off the rail to the far turn, was closest in pursuit around the bend and three wide into the lane, could not cut into the
winners margin despite trying and held second. ASIAN MATRIARCH fractious in the gate, bumped with outer rival at the start, went five wide into the first
turn then moved down to the three path around the bend, raced outside a rival then between in the middle stages, steadied behind a rival at the
three-eighths pole, tipped three wide into the clear, kept on down the lane but could not threaten. SLAM DIEGO settled two wide then along the rail, trailed
up the backstretch, passed a rival on the far turn, angled four wide leaving the bend and earned a minor award. UNA PALABRA coaxed along the inside
from the gate and chased from the fence, ridden along through the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and weakened. DORINE'S WILD CAT antsy in the
gate, sat off the pace three then two wide early, traveled near the back up the backstretch, trailed at the five-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into the lane
and failed to menace. DANZING CAT dueled inside a rival while in the two path entering the clubhouse turn, took over around the bend, lost command at
the nine-sixteenths pole, pressed to the half-mile pole, chased after the leader leaving the backstretch, dropped back between rivals on the far turn and tired
in the stretch. GRAY FROST bumped with inner rival then got put in a bit tight shortly after, chased five wide approaching the clubhouse turn then moved
into the three path around the bend, exited the backstretch in the three path, came five wide into the drive and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
MISSION BEACH reserved on the inside, took up early on the turn, remained inside then angled four wide leaving the bend, closed fast to get on even
terms with LITE RANCHIN KID at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. LITE RANCHIN KID raced up close then vied between rivals and took over at the
seven-sixteenths pole, inched ahead still pressured by RAMATHORN on the turn, resisted gamely into the final sixteenth but could not match the winner
late. PRINCE PRANCEALOT stalked four then three rivals deep in the early going, chased between rivals then two wide on the turn, drew alongside the
leader inside the eighth pole but lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch. ISLAND CRUISER bumped with inner rival and unhurried in the early going,
moved down to the two path, tipped three wide on the turn came back to the two quickly, summoned a mild rally in the drive and rounded out the superfecta.
LAST CALL LONDON trailed up the backstretch from inside, steadied early on the turn, cut the corner into the lane, stayed on the fence and improved
position. LAWLESS WORLD raced up close early then vied inside a pair of rivals to the turn, got put in tight early on the bend, hugged the rail to the stretch
and flattened out in the late stages. BEER MONEY bumped with ISLAND CRUISER early, coaxed along chasing five then four deep, rounded the bend
three deep then spun four wide into the drive and weakened. INVINCIBLE stalked between foes, got shuffled and had to check on the turn, floated five wide
leaving the bend and could not rally. REFOCUS coaxed early between rivals then got put in tight to lose ground, chased two wide leaving the backstretch,
had to alter around trouble rival early on the bend, came back in some then got carried six wide into the stretch and also lacked a rally. RAMATHORN broke
well and took control early, vied three deep while losing command at the seven-sixteenths pole, pressed the leader from outside around the bend, chased
three wide into the drive and faded.

Footnotes
CHASE'N KOTA hustled from the gate, ducked in early but was quickly corrected, went up to press the pace between rivals at the half-mile pole, fought
from outside through the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, dueled in deep stretch, cleared past the sixteenth pole and held safely. TIZ LISSETT coaxed
along while climbing out of striking distance of the leader, raced near the inside into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the drive, drifted out in
upper stretch and came with a late run but could not reach the winner. QUICK OMEN broke in and bumped with PERKINS, raced up close from outside,
chased the top pair three wide into the turn, raced four to five wide into the lane and finished willingly for third. PERKINS broke out and bumped QUICK
OMEN, took control early then set the pace under pressure, maintained a short lead on the inside the two wide into the lane, dueled to sixteenth pole and
weakened late. SAVEL hopped at the start and trailed early, passed a rival into the turn from inside, picked off more rivals around the bend, chased two
wide into the lane, kept trying but needed to find more to be considered a threat. WINTER SNOW traveled towards the rear off the rail, moved into the two
path early on the turn, eased out to the four path then angled back in a few paths around the bend and failed to menace. MEMORYSINTHEPARK bumped
leaving the gate then bumped again shortly after, raced well off the rail near the back, trailed five wide into the turn, angled in around the bend and chased
two wide into the lane but was never a factor. QUE BELLA LUNA broke in and bumped then bumped again with MEMORYSINTHEPARK early, tracked off
the rail, dropped back three, four, then five wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
JUST NAILS prompted the pace up the backstretch, kept the pressure on from outside through the turn, took over with a furlong left to run, held a short lead
over PUSHINESS into deep stretch and won the bob over PARTY ON GIRL (IRE) on the wire. PARTY ON GIRL (IRE) settled between rivals in the early
going, took hold when racing on heels at the three-eighths pole, bumped with outer rival early on the turn, saved ground to the stretch, steered off the fence
in the lane, closed well and split the top pair late but got outnodded on the line. PUSHINESS stepped to the front from inside, set a pressure pace up the
backstretch and around the turn, overtaken by JUST NAILS approaching the eighth pole, stayed on through the final furlong and finished a game third.
RAGTIME ROSE broke a step slow, raced in range on the inside, tipped out at the top of the stretch, put to left handed urging, switched to the right hand in
deep stretch and finished evenly late. PALEO'S PRINCESS tracked the top pair outside a rival, continued two wide to the stretch, moved out in the drive but
could not produce a bid. MS BRIGHTSIDE (IRE) unhurried in the early going, raced outside a rival at the back into and around the bend, tipped three wide
approaching the stretch, steered out further in the lane and improved position. MAKE IT SNOW broke a step slow, coaxed along and moved inside racing at
the back, saved ground to the stretch, came off the fence in the lane and could not make an impact, was unsaddled on the backstretch and transported off
the track via equine ambulance. IRRESISTIBLE FORCE settled three deep in the opening stages, bumped with inner rival two wide early on the turn and
could not find the needed response when asked in the lane. KANTHARA dropped back early then crept closer outside rivals, chased three deep around the
bend and weakened.

Footnotes
RAGING TORRENT away quickly to take control, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, headed by THE CHOSEN VRON at the five-sixteenths
pole, dueled inside that rival while in the three path leaving the turn, lost command into the stretch, fought back from inside under strong urging, regained
the advantage with a sixteenth remaining and held gamely under flagging from a right handed crop. THE CHOSEN VRON stalked from outside then moved
up to apply pressure to RAGING TORRENT, raced on even terms at past the five-sixteenths pole, took over in the four path entering the lane, held a narrow
lead over to midstretch, overtaken by RAGING TORRENT at the sixteenth pole and stayed on gamely to the wire. BIG CITY LIGHTS raced in range four
deep in the early going, moved into the three path around the bend, then chased four wide turning for home, could not make any headway on the top pair
late but finished a clear third. SENOR BUSCADOR lagged behind the field up the backstretch, came under a ride at the three-eighths pole, angled from the
three path to the five path around the bend and had one rival beat entering the stretch, kept on through the lane and earned a minor award. HAPPY JACK
tracked between rivals then altered in approaching the half-mile pole, lost ground while staying on the fence through the bend and could not rally. SEE
THROUGH IT forwardly placed three deep then steadied behind RAGING TORRENT at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased three then two wide around the
bend and faded down the lane. MOOSE MITCHELL fractious in the gate, broke a step slow, raced up close in the early going, ridden along two then three
wide on the turn and tired in the stretch. ARROWTHEGREAT chased wideset up the backstretch, went five deep into the turn, dropped back around the
bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY ACT stalked from inside, steadied briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, ran into traffic at the quarter pole then again in upper stretch, found an
opening between rivals, split foes and surged clear in deep stretch. BLAME THE CLASSIC raced up close five deep leaving the chute, moved into the two
path to stalk the pace, bid three deep leaving the backstretch, fought on even terms around the final turn, took over midstretch but got outkicked by the
winner in the late stages. WASTING ACES broke a bit slow, tracked two wide then along the rail, was on the move up the backstretch, altered out at the
five-sixteenths pole then ran into traffic, spun three wide into the lane, lacked a clear path behind the frontrunners and altered out to make contact with a
rival midstretch and finished willingly to earn the show honors. HIGHPLAINSDRIFTER bumped with outer rival leaving the chute, vied between foes then
inched ahead approaching the clubhouse turn, cleared inner rival around the bend, took pressure past the half-mile pole, vied inside a pair of rivals through
the far turn, lost command exiting the bend, stayed on to midstretch and weakened late. FIGHT BACK coaxed from the gate, bumped with inner rival then
pulled early, had to pause at the quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch, found traffic in upper stretch, kept on between rivals and improved position.
GLORIOUS LIFE vied three deep early then ceded command first time through the stretch, pulled two wide around the clubhouse turn and early on the
backstretch, applied pressure between rivals past the half-mile pole, fought head to head through the turn, carried a short lead into the stretch, lost
command midstretch and flattened out in the late stages. WHATS THE BUZZ unhurried and moved inside racing near the back, came off the rail and drew
closer in the middle stages, had to steady off heels at the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide late on the turn, got bumped by inner rival midstretch and
lacked a rally. SILVER N BLACK coaxed from the gate, tracked off the rail then moved into the two path, drew closer from outside on the backstretch, bid
four deep, could not keep up with the top trio around the bend, came five wide into the lane and weakened. MINING DISTRICT laid off the pace in the two
path, raced outside a rival then three deep on the backstretch, trailed into the far turn, continued off the back into the stretch and was lightly coaxed in the
final furlong.
