SHELBY GOLD raced off of the pace early, saved ground, raced on the fence through out, launched a bit at the half mile pole, improved position and gained
ground through the turn, was able to gain momentum leaving the turn and entering the stretch, was challenged after the eighth pole briefly, repelled that rival
easily and confidently moved half a length ahead taking the win. WILLING TO BURN stalked the early leader from the four path, was forwardly placed
through out, took over and led entering the upper stretch, was quickly joined by an inside rival, battled with that one down the stretch, but could not get the
advantage and finished second best today. ENGLISH MEADOW raced from the middle of the field, traveled in the three path, was on the move after the
half, gained ground near the three eighths pole, shifted out widest into the stretch, raced in the six path but had no late kick. GOLD COAST GIRL trailed,
early, moved up after the half, improved position through the turn but was never a threat. HEY BARMAID was keen, led by several lengths early, raced in
the two path, set the early fractions then tired in mid strretch. METAROSE raced mid pack in the two path, then faded.

CHUCKANUT BAY broke sharply, easily took the lead, comfortably set the fractions to his liking, showed the way into the stretch, drew off from there
proving to be much the best. MARCH ON LINCH was off slow but advanced into a stalking position quickly, raced in the two path with a rival to the outside,
chased the leader around the race track, battling with the same rival to the outside for second, out finished that one but was no match for the winner. CORN
POP raced in the middle of the field, was to the outside in the three path, raced in company with another contender into the stretch, battled briefly for second
but did not have enough finishing third. HANDR'SDREAM raced three wide, was never a threat. LIE AND DENY was fresh during the warm up, trailed early,
was up heels and steadied near the five eighths pole, then bored out through the turn.

lead entering the stretch, was given the cue and easily moved forward breaking out off the pack taking the lead, one rival went with him, these two battled
from the eighth pole until the sixteenth pole where HE'S NOT TALKING finally established his dominance taking the lead and the win. IMPASSABLE was off
mid pack, travelled in the four path, advanced at the three eighths pole, had the leader in his sights in the upper stretch, challenged at the eighth pole,
battled for a sixteenth of a mile, then struggled to sustain the bid finishing second. BIG BOWIE raced mid pack in the three path, raced in between rivals,
moved after the half, split rivals at the quarter pole but did not have enough late. TIZ GRAZEN raced on the rail, fell back early and showed little.
