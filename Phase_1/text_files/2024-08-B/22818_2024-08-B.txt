JEEPS STRIDE vied early, dropped back and settled off the pace while racing towards the outside, went widest in the drive, closed steadily, wore down his
rivals under steady urging and drew off late. PRAIRIE WARRIOR vied for the lead, challenged three across on the turn, dueled to late stretch, was
outclosed and finished second best. PLAYTHEMARKER set a pressured pace to the turn, dueled to late stretch and yielded grudgingly. MAXIMUM BULL
vied between horses to mid stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. JET SET WARRIOR saved ground, lacked a bid and failed to menace. THE LAST
FEAT was off slowly, fell far back early and trailed the field.

Footnotes
NOT TO FANCY raced close too the pace towards the outside, was in tight entering the turn, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and
inched clear late. HIGH DOLLAR HUSH pressed the pace, challenged for the lead leaving the turn, dueled, drifted out and was outfinished in a good effort.
RUN AWAY BAY stalked the pace while racing inside, put in a steady bid, didn't have enough late and held for show. KAYE raced close to the pace, was in
tight entering the turn, lacked the needed late response and was outfinished for third. CHAMA STORM was taken outside, went eight wide at the top of the
stretch, bid to get within range and hung late. IZE ON SAVANNAH raced in close between horses, dropped back on the turn and gave way. NO BULL
DARWIN bumped at the start, set the pace, responded when challenged to duel and stopped. AMASS MONEY broke out and bumped at the start, trailed
the field and showed little.

Footnotes
ANNA B set a pressured pace, drew off entering the stretch and widened under mild urging. BLUE COWGIRL pressed the pace while racing between
horses, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, was outclosed and no match for the winner. PAISLEY'S VISION pressed the pace, went seven wide at the
top of the stretch, fell back, came up empty late and held for show. I WIN LIKA GIRL pressed the pace towards the outside, went nine wide at the top of the
stretch, leveled off in the drive and was outfinished for third. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH lagged early, rallied on the turn, bid inside to get within range and
failed to rally. MISS LUCKY LADY was void of early speed, went widest in the drive and passed tiring rivals. TIME IS PRECIOUS raced close to the pace
along the inside, fell back on the turn and gave way. OUR SOARING ANGEL broke slowly and came out at the start and showed little in an even effort.
WINNING AT EASE was reluctant to load, showed brief speed only and was outrun.

Footnotes
BODIE GOT GOLD was never far back in a wide trip, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. I THINK I'M HERE set a pressured pace,
dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. MCTHANKS advanced to the turn, bid inside, dueled for the lead, was outfinished and just
missed for place. THRUTHESTORM pressed the pace three across, swung wide leaving the turn, fell back and hung late. ANCIENT LAND vied between
horses to the turn, fell back, weakened and faded from contention. BEACH RUNNER showed speed to the turn and gave way. SPINNING BLACK saved
ground, lacked a bid and was outrun.
