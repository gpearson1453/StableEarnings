Footnotes
ALWAYS ON CAY broke out, sped clear from outside and crossed over, led a bit off the rail through the turn while padding the margin, given his cue and
drew off in upper stretch and widened under left then right handed urging and steady handling late. MAXIMUM CAPACITY stumbled leaving the gate,
chased from off the rail then between rivals, went two wide then along the rail on the turn, could not cut into the winners' margin but kept on to best the rest.
HAYWOOD stalked four into the turn, traveled three deep around the bend then eased five wide into the stretch and got outkicked for second. EIGHT CLAP
broke a step slow, tracked five deep leaving the backstretch, chased outside a trio of rivals around the bend, raced in the six path turning for home and
could not rally. LETSHAVEONEMORE tossed his head then hopped to come away poorly, trailed early then was hustled to get within range from inside,
started to weaken on the turn and churned on to press tired rivals. MIDNIGHT LOVE broke well, chased the speed off the inside then between rivals, got
crowded a bit at the three-eighths pole, trailed six wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. WHEREVER YOU ARE forwardly placed in the early going while
drifting out a bit, was closest in pursuit two then three wide around the bend and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
MARGOT'S BOY had early speed outside BURNIN TURF then cleared that rival and moved inside, showed the way unchallenged to the quarter pole, met
the bid from BIG HAT WILLIE late on the bend, battled down the lane and held gamely to the wire. BIG HAT WILLIE tracked two wide into the first turn then
got forced out by BURNIN TURF near the three-quarter pole, guided back to the two path quickly, stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, crept closer
three deep on the far turn and challenged MARGOT'S BOY late on the bend, dueled outside the winner through the lane and lacked the needed late punch
to get by. CASTLE LEOCH settled in the two path, steadied off heels at the three-quarter pole, moved inside in the middle stages, chased between rivals
past the five-sixteenths marker, spun three wide into the lane and finished well outside the top pair for game third. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN got put in
tight along the fence and steadied early, rated along the fence in hand, coaxed along on the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and lacked a bid. BURNIN
TURF showed early speed inside the winner then became rank when ceding command and shifted out on the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit up the
backstretch, took aim in the two path around the far turn but weakened in the lane. MONGOLIAN ALTAI unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, trailed
up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch, then moved out and lacked further response. EVENING SUN (GB) traveled outside a rival at the back,
moved outside troubled rival and started to pull around the clubhouse turn, chased three then four wide to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
LOOKS LUCKY pressed from between rivals up the backstretch, chased after the leader two then three wide on the turn, latched onto I'M STILL IN IT again
midstretch, drifted in and bumped past the sixteenth pole while taking over and maintained a short lead to the wire. I'M STILL IN IT broke well and pressed
the pace from inside, overtook SMILING AMY then cleared outer pair around the bend, confronted by LOOKS LUCKY in midstretch and relinquished the
lead when taking a bump from that rival late. HIGH FLYING GRACIE bobbled shortly after the start, coaxed along chasing off the rail, angled out in the lane
and was along for the show honors. SMILING AMY away quickly and showed the way outside rivals in the early going, lost command and could not keep up
with the new leader past the five-sixteenths pole, chased in the four path turning for home, drifted out in the lane and weakened. BRUINS MASTERY
chased under coaxing outside a rival into the bend, moved to the rail then steered back out to enter the stretch five wide but weakened down the lane.
MAX'S MAXINE settled early, checked between rivals into the turn, went between foes again then two wide into the lane and failed to menace. NICELY
CURVED forwardly placed from outside, went five wide into the turn, moved into the four path then exited the bend six wide, came in some in upper stretch
and weakened. NOBLE RUNNER raced up close early from inside, dropped back around the turn and faded. MORGAN'S BLUFF stalked off the rail then
three deep into the turn, raced in the four path leaving the bend, came out into the stretch and had little left for the drive. ROSES N' CHROME climbed early
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KALE'S ANGEL was off a bit slow in the beginning, chased out of range up the backstretch, drew closer two then three wide on the turn, moved out and
rallied to the front approaching the sixteenth pole and drew away. CAJUN GOLD pressed the pace three deep then outside the leader up the backstretch,
chased two wide past the five-sixteenths pole, came back on and took over with a furlong remaining but yielded to the winner in deep stretch. COACH
CHUCK settled inside, patiently ridden through the bend, raced a bit off the rail into the lane, moved out and roused in upper stretch, put to right handed
urging and came with a mild rally late to earn the show honors. CULLEN J raced up close inside the top pair then chased past the half-mile pole, hugged the
rail to the stretch, stayed within striking distance to the sixteenth pole, then weakened late. HEPHEPCUTDOWNNETS broke in, lost his path shortly after,
reserved off the pace, went two to three wide around the turn and improved position. LORD DUNMORE set the pace between rivals then along the inside
past the half-mile pole, cleared under coaxing on the turn, relinquished the lead at the eighth pole and weakened. FARENHEIT O C was off a bit slow in the
beginning, got put in tight and checked along the fence early, saved ground to the stretch and was never a factor. GRINNELL raced outside a rival near the
back into the turn, remained in the two path to the stretch and failed to menace. SOLO GANO off slow to start, trailed on the inside and failed to get
involved.

Footnotes
RUTHLESS RUA stalked from inside, moved out on the turn, bid from the three path into the stretch, put a head in front at the eight pole and kicked clear in
the last sixteenth. A TOAST TO LANIE grabbed the early lead and crossed over, took some pressure from MISTY MUPPET before clearing again,
challenged by RUTHLESS RUA entering the lane, lost command at the eighth pole and stayed on for a clear second. MISTY MUPPET raced up close from
outside, put in a mild bid but could not keep up with the leader around the turn, chased two wide into the lane and held third. SIDE BY SIDE raced between
rivals off the pace then off the rail, took the turn two to three wide, drifted in at the eight pole and failed to threaten. SEPTEMBER MAGIC sat off the pace
inside a pair of rivals early, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. NANCI GRIFFITH broke a step slow, chased off the rail then three deep on
the backstretch, rounded the bend three then four wide and lacked the needed response. BEAUTY N THE BOLT climbed early and dropped back, saved
ground and cut the corner into the lane but could not make an impact. STRIKINGLY lacked early speed, took the turn three wide and never got involved.

OSCAR JOY traveled outside a rival near the back, altered six wide late on the turn, closed fast from outside under left handed urging and got up at the
wire. LAUGIER NIGHT (IRE) stalked the pacesetter three wide into the turn, remained in the three path to the lane, bid from outside in upper stretch, took
over with a sixteenth remaining but nailed on the line. RUNNING SPARTAN settled three deep in the early going, got forced out late on the bend and spun
five wide into the stretch, closed well between rivals and finished gamely for third. SANTARENA bumped leaving the gate, tracked from inside, drew closer
on the turn, tipped over to the two path, got boxed in behind the leader in upper stretch, moved out, looked to make a run late but ran into traffic halting all
momentum. HURRICANE WAY raced off the rail then moved inside raced towards the rear, found traffic along the fence on the turn, cut the corner into the
lane and finished willingly. CHIPPER ME TIMBERS sent for the lead from inside, cleared outer rival at the three-eighths pole, showed the way along the rail
to the stretch, challenged by outer rival in upper stretch, resisted to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. BALTHAZAR traveled in mid-pack between rivals,
drew closer on the turn but had to steady off heels around the bend, ridden along in the two path entering the lane and kept trying to the wire. OSAGE
CREEK away quickly then pressed the pace keenly in hand on the outside, chased the leader two wide then between rivals on the turn, got crowded and
lugged out at the quarter pole, then weakened in the lane. MR. MUSTACHE broke in, bumped rival and took up at the start, trailed on the inside into the
turn, angled out to the four path then had to alter eight wide late on the bend and never got involved.

Footnotes
BRAZENLY got crowded between rivals into the first turn, trailed two then three wide around the bend, ridden along into the far turn, made a four wide move
to take over past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared and moved down to the two path leaving the bend, drew away in upper stretch and was ridden out in the
late stages. SPEED GRAZY coaxed from the gate, stalked close up along the inside, had to wait through the far turn when boxed in, tipped three wide into
the lane, finished determinedly down the stretch but had to settle for second best. OUBABE stumbled leaving the gate, bumped with outer rival into the first
turn, stalked the leader from between rivals, applied pressure from outside on the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. DONNER
LAKE took a bump from BE PUNCTUAL at the start, cleared inner rivals and crossed over early on the clubhouse turn, took pressure from OUBABE up the
backstretch, lost command to the winner past the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the lane and faded. BE PUNCTUAL broke out and bumped
DONNER LAKE, bumped with inner rival while three deep into the clubhouse turn, pulled leaving the bend, went three wide into the far turn, got put in tight
briefly by the winner past the five-sixteenths pole, spun four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
SHE'S A JOKER settled along the fence, tipped two then three wide around the far turn, moved out further in upper stretch, unleashed a rally and inhaled
SAREEHA (IRE) in the final sixteenth. SAREEHA (IRE) vied with rivals on both sides leaving the chute, dueled inside INNER BEAUTY first time through the
stretch, took full control approaching the clubhouse turn, pressured early on the backstretch then cleared again, showed the way next to the rail through the
far turn, led clear into the final sixteenth but got run down by the winner. CHASINGSERENDIPITY raced between rivals near the back, drew closer in the
middle stages, ridden along in the two path on the second bend, chased within striking distance with a furlong remaining but finished evenly late. VRONSKY
FEINT hopped a bit to lose a step at the start, reserved two wide then trailed along the rail, raced in hand outside a rival on the backstretch, roused on the
far turn and angled out to the five path, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. BIG MAMA SUE saved ground near the back, trailed inside
a rival in the middle stages, continued at the back a bit off the rail into the lane, steered out in the drive and improved position. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) vied
outside a pair of rivals leaving the chute, dueled outside SAREEHA (IRE) first time through the stretch then stalked three wide into the clubhouse turn,
moved into the two path around the bend, tugged the rider forward and applied pressure early on the backstretch, lost touch with the leader and stalked to
the far turn, took aim two wide around the second bend, asked right handed at the top of the lane and weakened in deep stretch. SKY MAKER raced three
deep toward the rear in the early going, moved closer still off the inside, chased three then four wide on the second turn and failed to menace. ZEYARAAT
tracked three wide leaving the chute, shifted into the two path for the clubhouse turn, moved into range leaving the that bend, asked three wide on the far
turn but weakened under a drive. MADIHA rated next to the rail then started to pull around the first turn, coaxed along with three furlongs remaining, started
to weaken on the far turn and tired down the lane.
