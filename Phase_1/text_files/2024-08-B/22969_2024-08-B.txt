LEGS gave chase from three wide, followed the winner throughout and could not get to that in the lane while clearly best of the others. DAZZLE YOU MY
WAY stumbled at the break, chased from three to four wide and had no rally. CLARA SMILES saved ground and weakened steadily in the lane.

DO IT LIKE KEVIN tracked the early pace three wide outside PRINCESS VANELLOPE, bid through midstretch then held the narrow advantage to the wire.
PRINCESS VANELLOPE gained a short lead inside the winner early, continued on the lead into the lane, resisted that one but could not hold through the
final furlong. OXFORD OUTING tracked the top pair three and four wide in good position but could not produce the needed late effort. POND trailed while
four wide, moved in on the turn but continued to lose contact with the field.
