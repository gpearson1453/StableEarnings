BIKINILESS set the pace and drew off in the drive under steady urging. RIGHT FOR YOU was slow early, taken outside, went widest in the drive and
earned place under mild urging. PRETTY PEPPY pressed the pace, fell back entering the stretch, went evenly late and held for show. WHISPER'S MARK
broke out, dropped inside into turn, offered a mild bid only and did not threaten. SHELL GAME pressed the pace along the inside, fell back leaving the turn
and came up empty late. E BAR SCOUT raced close to the pace, bid between horses on the turn, fell back and gave way. CASUAL ENCOUNTER trailed
the field.

D D S EXPRESS pressed the pace, challenged two across on the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held safely while kept to task. SNAPP DADDY
was never far back, advanced to the turn, bid four wide, closed steadily, narrowed the gap and held for place. ZE'BUL broke slowly, dropped in to save
ground, rallied inside on the turn and finished well. READY TO STORM was slow early, advanced to the turn, bid seven wide and closed well. RAPID
EXPANSION stalked the pace, went five wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response. NO TROUBLE got away well, went eight wide
leaving the turn and improved position. BLUEGRASS RYDER raced mid pack, went ten wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. ANGEL'S SHADOWS
set the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. MY ADDICTION was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
EL CHUMELITO raced close to the pace towards the outside, rallied five wide on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly, inched clear and
held well. BLUEGRASS FAITH was taken back entering the turn, shifted out, bid between horses, angled in in the upper stretch, bid willingly to duel and
was outfinished in a good effort. BIG EVENT raced in close, rallied four wide on the turn, swung wide into the stretch, closed steadily, was gaining late and
got up for show. SIR FLATTER broke slowly, was void of early speed, went widest in the drive, finished well and was gaining late. DIABOLICAL FIRE
challenged between horses into the turn, dueled to late stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. IM STILL THIRSTY vied to the sixteenth pole, faltered and
lost position. WHERES BRAYDEN was outrun in an even effort. TEQUILA TIME pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and gave way.
