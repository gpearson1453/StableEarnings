TONY'S TAPIT fought his rider while saving ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn, found room to began a bid on the rail entering the stretch, kicked clear and held that margin to the wire. TONKA WARRIOR raced in the
two path early, stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path, drifted out in upper stretch and gained
ground late from there. SECRET POTION dueled on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far bend still in the two path
and continued to battle in upper stretch, giving way late. CALIBRATE saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued
to battle from the rail around the second turn and weakened in the lane. UNIFIED DREAMS raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader
between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. SLIM SLOW SLIDER raced in the four path early,
chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four path and tired from there.

and gained ground late to get up for the win. MAJESTIC CRAKEN stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the four path
coming around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught late. BIRDIE MACHINE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued
around the turn in the two path and chased on to the finish. MEET JOE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two
path and finished evenly. HEIR (FR) raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid
passing the quarter pole and made up some ground in the lane from there. STORMIN HONGKONG trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the four path and never threatened. FORSAKEN tracked the leaders on the inside through the early going, saved ground around the
bend and faded in the lane. HIDDEN PROFIT pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and tired in
the stretch. FERRARI ROAD raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and was empty from
