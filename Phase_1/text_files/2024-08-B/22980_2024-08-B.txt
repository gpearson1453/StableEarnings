Footnotes
LAPOCHKA tracked with rivals on both sides in the early going, patiently waited between horses in the second flight around the turn, had clear run in the
three-path straightening out for home and the veteran was tenacious running down the leader through the stretch to get up for the victory in the final few
jumps. SPEEDY HANS prompted the pace outside along the backstretch, put away the early speed foe to take command with a clear lead by the quarter
pole, opened up at the top of the stretch, was urged at the furlong marker trying to find more late clinging onto the lead, was caught by the winner in the final
few strides for the win but did hold on for the place share in a photo. PRICELESS WILL co-trailed on the outside at the half mile marker, rallied three wide
circling foes at the quarter pole, gathered more momentum shifting out to the six-path for clear run, was gaining down the stretch on the top two but just
missed getting there in time. SUNRISE DRIVE tracked three deep outside rival down the backstretch, closed the gap when asked for more three wide with
three furlongs left to run, angled to the four-path entering the stretch and was one paced down the lane for a minor role in the end. GOOD RAPPORT
co-trailed on the inside at the half, made little progression through the turn, shifted out four wide turning for home and passed a couple of weary foes in the
final furlong. U S ARMY CORPS had a tracking role, nestled on the fence down the backside, was nudged on the rail but was losing ground to others even
though taking the shortest route around the bend, angled just outside in the two path for the drive but could not get involved running to the finish line.
CANYOUHEARMERUNNIN assumed command on the fence along the backstretch, was collared outside at mid-turn, gave way up top by the quarter pole
and yielded on the fence in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
PENNYJET had a good position, watching the lead trio when entering the backstretch, quickly moved in from the three-furlong pole to go on by taking
control at the quarter pole and under a vigorous ride while drifting out through the stretch prevailed to the finish line. INDIANA ROAD was ahead of only one
runner into the first bend, began to pick up horses outside at the half mile marker, made a sharp move, splitting runners three wide nearing the quarter pole,
loomed the only threat in the four-path turning for home, chased the winner down the lane but could not go by. SIX FOR A NINE stalked near the rear
travelling two wide in the early going, began to mount a rally with four furlongs remaining, closed the gap on the leader with five sixteenths to run, continued
to try down the stretch but could only finish up a distant third at the wire. IRON PRINCESS travelled in mid-division in the two-path, took closer order outside
foes by the half, kept pace with runners while on the fence through the far turn, had a chance three wide for a piece of the prize straightening out for home
and finished up willingly to be a fringe player in the end. MOET MONET tracked between foes at the beginning, moved in entering the backside to poke her
head in front on the outside at the half, improved the advantage opening up at the three eighths marker, offered no resistance inside when the winner went
past at the quarter pole and faded in the two-path at the furlong marker. POWAQA stalking near the rear on the rail, made no progress down the back
straight, passed a rival when shifting just outside midway on the final bend and failed to menace on the fence in the stretch drive. PLAYFULLY FRAC'IN
hopped on the start, recovered to take this field into the first turn, was headed outside midway down the backstretch, was hard ridden but was backing away
on the rail with five sixteenths to go and retreated on the fence by upper stretch. LA GRIGIA tracked three deep into the first turn, sat alone watching the top
two down the backstretch, was roused three furlongs out but could not keep up with others making a move on the turn, emptied out at the quarter pole,
angled outside in the six-path for the drive and galloped to the finish line. TEXENSIS was off a step slow to trail into the first turn, still could see the field
down the back straight and could only pass a tired runner inside turning for home. SHE IS HOPEFUL followed the pacesetter, just a few lengths behind
through the first turn, settled in midfield down the backside and had nothing left to offer midway on the far turn. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 INDIANA

coaxed for more at the quarter pole, sharply moved to the lead with little urging four wide at the top of the lane and drew off convincingly by the sixteenth
pole to cruise home for the score. TALBOT HEIRLOOM settled on the rail in midfield, waited on the fence around the bend, shifted outside four wide at the
quarter pole gathering speed and had a solid late run in the lane but was just second best on this day. MOTOWN FUNK was away alertly to seize the lead
on the rail along the backside, continued to roll on, dictating terms up front through the turn, was headed outside in upper stretch, began to fade some at the
furlong marker but did stay on grudgingly to save third money at the wire. NATA TROUBLE broke in at the start, stalked near the rear on the rail with five
furlongs left to run, made an early move at the half, became headstrong under a snug hold right behind the frontrunner with three eighths to run, settled
through the turn on the fence waiting to move, shifted just outside in the two-path for the drive and finished mildly for a minor role. POCKET PAIR chased
outside down the backstretch, tracked between rivals in the second flight three wide at the quarter pole, was in range for a piece of the prize turning for
home, could not go on with others and weakened by the furlong marker. QUINTE GAL was scrubbed on the fence early on in the backstretch trying to get
better inside position, just started to pick up the bit when had to be reined in on the fence with seven sixteenths from home, was again asked for more on the
rail at the quarter pole but made little headway and under a busy ride in upper stretch had no finish to offer down the lane. SEVEN P R C was checked soon
after the break to trail outside down the back straight, continued outside, seeing the field a round the bend and could not reach contention running through
the stretch.

Footnotes
GLASWEIGIAN was forwardly-positioned forcing the pace from outside, sparred with a rival through the turn taking a narrow lead by the top of the stretch,
was bumped at the three-sixteenths, headed by an inside foe soon after, dug in under continued urging to take command and draw clear the final seventy
yards. FRACEN MACHO angled in early while outsprinted, chased under some encouragement three furlongs out, was guided out passing the quarter then
back in to cut the corner turning for home, bid at that point up the inside taking a narrow lead, was outfinished. BEE ME set a pressured pace from off the
rail, bumped a rival at the top of the stretch, drifted out in the stretch and had no extra but preserved show honors. HAPPY QUAD stalked the leading pair
from off the inside in about the four path, floated wider still in range turning for home, went one-paced and needed more. HELLO LADIES was outpaced
early bringing up the rear, swing wide for the drive, ran on with mild late interest but was never a threat.

Footnotes
OUR FLAG FLYING was unhurried near the rear in the two-path going into the first turn, continued to gallop along outside in the final flight down the
backstretch, began to extend her stride when roused with five sixteenths remaining, swung out six wide for clear run gathering momentum straightening out
for the drive and relentlessly wore down foes one by one down the lane to edge away for the win in the final seventy yards. NIKITA'S GEM was fanned out
six wide tracking the pacesetter into the first bend, settled outside in the second flight down the back straight, was roused, taking aim on the lead pair three
wide midway on the final turn, was in the thick of things in the five-path at the top of the lane, kept coming at the leader down the lane but was just outkicked
on the outside by the winner in deep stretch. BRAVO KATE broke sharp to seize command at the start, continued up top while hounded outside along the
backstretch, was nudged for more holding onto the lead with a rival prompting the issue outside through the far turn, stubbornly fought on down the stretch
clinging to the lead until the seventy-yard marker and just faded late still holding for the show money. GREAT KATE broke in at the start, prompted the pace
in the early stages outside, inched closer when urged for more around the far turn, posed a threat in the four-path at the top of the lane but stalled with a
furlong left to run. CINNAMON BITS stumbled badly on the start to trail this field in the early going, could not make up any ground down the backstretch,
caught up to runners to actually be inside the eventual winner at the quarter pole, had a chance for a small share behind foes two wide turning for home,
could not go on with the leaders by the furlong pole but did pass one rival late. HOLIDAY IN JAIL settled on the rail behind the frontrunner in the beginning,
tracked on the fence in the second tier along the backside, was roused inside midway through the final turn, offered no response and faltered on the fence
at the sixteenth pole.

ONE MORE BREW was prominent in the run to the first turn, ceded the lead content to track in behind, moved three to four wide from the five-sixteenths,
took command at the quarter pole, drew clear in the stretch. INFAMOUS COVERT stalked in behind from off the fence mid-pack in the two to three path,
raced in behind the leaders three to four wide on the far turn coming to the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but secured place from inside
contenders for the minor awards in late stretch. GREEN FLEET settled off the rail last but one, fanned six wide beginning to advance on the far turn, moved
out seven to eight deep in upper stretch to go around rivals, ran on to get show honors. H C HOLIDAY settled off the pace two to three wide, moved out six
wide on the far turn advancing, was outfinished for minor placings. GREAT FACES was forwardly-positioned stalking outside three to four wide, was in
range four to five deep through the far turn but outkicked in the lane. JUST START ME UP was forwardly-positioned outside three to four wide through the
first turn, stalked then pressed the leader up the backstretch taking a narrow lead at the three-eighths, lost the lead soon thereafter and faded in the stretch.
LIFE IS HARD trailed early, swung eight wide, was never near enough to threaten. SPRING MOUNTAIN was strongly urged from the break to vie for the
early lead, moved clear on the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, was overtaken on the far turn and came up empty. MISTER MESEEKS
angled in early and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BLIND SPOT had a good position, sitting all alone in third while watching the front duo fight each other on the front end down the backstretch, patiently
waited three wide on the turn for the cue to go around the bend, bid for the lead in the six-path at the top of the lane, was kept to the task at the eighth pole
closing in and got up outside in deep stretch to clear off for the win at the wire. CARA CARA battled on the rail up front in the beginning, edged away for a
clear lead with three furlongs to go, opened up mildly at the top of the stretch, dug in bravely holding the lead late but could not fend off the winner who had
an ideal trip. INDIAN MUSIC dueled outside for the front end down the backside, was relegated to the chasing role outside through the turn, shifted five wide
straightening out for home, kept on coming to the wire between foes, just could not get there in the end but did settle for a clear third in the end. VERDEJO
was allowed to settle at the rear down the backstretch, continued to see the field throughout the turn, closed to gap, starting to reach for more ground at the
quarter pole, angled out widest in the eight-path turning for home and finished up with good energy in the final furlong gaining late. I'M INTO MISCHIEF had
a stalking position on the fence near the rear in the early going, kept pace while roused on the rail, taking the shortest way around the bend, had a chance,
battling inside for a minor role two wide in the drive to the wire but levelled off late. CALLE AMADA was off a step slow, stalking with rivals in the third flight
down the backstretch, made a brief run three wide at the three eighths marker until the four-path turning for home, could not continue the sustained run and
stalled between foes at the sixteenth pole. SPEED TRAP stalked three deep on the outside in the third tier, made no impact three wide throughout the turn,
angled out seven wide for the drive but lacked a rally down the stretch.

CHROMEPLATED HEART vied between rivals at the half for the lead, was reined in on the rail under a good hold at the three eighths marker to track the
engaged front duo through the turn, shifted outside three wide by the quarter pole, was asked right handed with a furlong to go, found another gear, took
control with seventy yards remaining and held on with runners closing in late on both sides. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES was in a good spot, watching the lead
trio at the half, settled inside foes in the third flight through the turn, shifted out sharply in the six path, brushing the outside runner turning for home and had
a good late rally to get up at the wire for second money. SOCIETY'S KAT was brushed inside on the break, settled near the rear while in the two path along
the backside, was looking for room between foes three wide at the quarter pole, found a seam inside runners three wide at the top of the stretch and surged
late to just miss the runners up share at the wire. FOOLISH GAMES forced the pace three deep at the half mile marker, bid for the front outside with three
furlongs to go, poked her head in front by upper stretch, was valiantly trying to hold off the on comers through the stretch but faded inside in the final seventy
yards to settle on the fringes. SOUPER FLASHY was brushed outside to begin, watched the trio while on the rail at the half, made little headway under a
ride on the fence around the turn and did show some grit to finish up willingly on the rail down the stretch. SACRED DANCER trailed the field at the half,
made a brief turn of foot travelling three wide commencing at the three eighths marker, was floated out in the eight path turning for home and was one
paced in the stretch. STEALIN'TIME broke outwards on the break, travelled four deep outside foes in mid-pack in the early going, improved at the half to
track the lead pair in the second flight outside with three furlongs left to run, rallied four wide at the quarter pole, was on the wrong lead down the lane and
failed to menace in the final furlong. SOUPER PECAN had a slow start to begin, travelled on the rail close to the back of the pack in the early going, was
roused but was positioned to last on the fence midway on the turn, shifted out widest in the nine-path at the top at the lane and could not reach contention
through the stretch. CYMBAL COURT settled three wide between foes in midfield down the backstretch, stalked outside rivals in the third flight three wide
around the bend, was forced out, being brushed inside by a runner to be seven wide straightening out for the drive and could not get involved in the stretch
running. SHOOTIN' AMY seized command on the rail along the backstretch, battled up top on the fence throughout the turn, fought on the rail in upper
stretch, could not continue with others late and backed up abruptly in the last sixteenth of a mile.

PIPER'S FACTOR travelled in mid-division rating kindly three deep along the backstretch, moved in quickly around foes at the three eighths marker to lead
four wide by upper stretch, stayed on the wrong lead down the lane, drifted inwards to the rail at the furlong marker while keeping to the task and held safe,
never threatened in deep stretch. SWIFT DELIVERY was allowed to gather himself trailing the field at the half, stalked outside in the third flight around the
turn while moving comfortably, took closer order to loom five wide, posing the main threat at the top of the lane, chased the winner in vain the entire stretch
but could not close in late. DRESDEN ROW broke in at the start, tracked the lead duo while settling between foes along the backside, kept pace with rivals,
waiting on the fence throughout the turn, shifted outside in the three path off the tiring frontrunner with three sixteenths to go and ran on gamely to the end,
being a clear third at the finish line. BABBO pressed the issue on the rail at the start, inched away up front by the half, set the pace around the turn, was
collared outside by the winner with five-sixteenths remaining, fought inside briefly in upper stretch but flattened out on the fence at the furlong marker.
WESTERN WHIRL was away alertly to have the lead in the beginning, had a chasing role outside at the half, continued to prompt outside around the bend,
was roused between rivals with five sixteenths from the wire but could not keep up with others that were commencing a run and yielded three wide with
horses on both sides in mid-stretch. TUNECHI was brushed outside on the start to trail early on, stalked in the third and final group on the rail throughout the
turn, shifted outside four wide for the drive but could not get interested in the stretch running.

Footnotes
PLAY THE DOTS travelled three deep outside a runner in mid-pack in the beginning, began to pass rivals four deep outside at the half, circled around foes
three wide throughout the far turn to lead in the three-path entering the stretch and continued to be strong in the lane to open up going away in the final
furlong for the win. BIG SHOOTER prompted the pace outside in the first bend, shadowed the pacesetter outside down the backstretch, seized command
between foes momentarily midway around the far turn, dueled inside for the lead until the eighth pole but was no match for the winner late. MODDASSAH
was nestled on the rail behind the lead duo on the first turn, tracked the front pair but was now three deep on the outside through the back straight, kept up
to the leaders while the pace quickened around the final turn, shifted out, four wide turning for home and kept closing in late to just miss getting up to
capture second money. TRUE SHOT settled in midfield in the two path inside a challenger around the first turn, advanced between foes in the backstretch
at the half, was nudged on the fence, sitting just behind the leader on the far turn, battled three wide for the show award in the stretch run but had to settle
for a minor role in the end. WETIKO was a little erratic going six wide while tracking the leaders into the first turn, settled down to be three deep in mid-pack
along the backside, closed the gap when roused midway on the far turn, shifted outside five wide by the quarter pole, pushed a couple of rivals out bursting
through the seam in the seven path at the top of the lane and finished up willingly in the running to the finish line. SEATTLE STINGER hopped on the break
to be ahead of only the other poor starter into the first turn, stalked on the fence near the rear making little improvement along the backside, was shuffled
back to last with three furlongs to go, shifted out in the six path straightening for home but was one paced while not switching leads in the drive to the wire.
REDNECK REBEL broke inwards and was slow into stride to trail in the early stages, made a brief rally, circling four wide around foes with three furlongs to
go, was then bumped and floated out nine wide for the stretch drive and could not recoup to be a factor afterwards. BLUE MONTJEU bobbled on the break,
settled near the back in the early stages of this route race, started to rally three wide between rivals at the three furlong pole, was bumped inside by a runner
and was pushed out to the eight path between rivals turning for home and could not recover to be a presence in the drive to the wire. ASHUKA travelled on
the fence in midfield in the early parts of the race, was going the wrong way while urged on the rail throughout the final bend, shifted just outside in the
stretch run and came on late to pass the early frontrunner at the sixteenth pole. VINI VIDI VICI broke sharp to have command on the rail in the first turn, set
the pace while shadowed outside down the backstretch, relinquished the lead with no resistance on the fence midway on the final turn and folded on the
fence by mid-stretch.
