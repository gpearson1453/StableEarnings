Footnotes
INTO WISHING shared the command from the inside of KEYS INCLUDED to the half mile marker then inched away around the final turn and fended off the
challenge from HEZA PICKLE at the end of the bend and drew clear. HEZA PICKLE stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then launched a
bid at the three furlong marker and challenged the leader near the end of the bend while matching strides outside of KEYS INCLUDED to deep stretch and
fended that one to hold the place. KEYS INCLUDED shared the command from between horses to the half mile marker then matched strides inside of
HEZA PICKLE to deep stretch but was outfinished. UNANIMOUSLY settled in the middle of the pack while saving ground to be best of the rest. FEDERAL
HILL tracked the leaders from two wide and failed to menace. MR B QUIET trailed the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
CAJUN MISCHIEF was slightly fractious in the gate, was forwardly placed from three wide down the backstretch then moved to engage the leader near the
three furlong marker and took command midway through the turn and drew clear for the win. PRINCE PERFECTA raced off the pace on the inside through
the final turn then tipped out to two wide in upper stretch and shifted back inside at the three sixteenths and made a late rail bid to be second best. ARIES
HONOR raced in the middle of the pack from two or three wide down the backstretch then moved up for a late three wide rally but flattened out.
LEXINGTON RIVER tracked the leaders from three wide to the top of the stretch and made a mild bid but was outfinishe. BLUME raced in the middle of the
pack down the backstretch then moved up on the final turn and showed late interest in the stretch to improve his position. LOUISIANA BARGAIN was
allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn, tipped out to four or five wide in upper stretch and
passed tiring rivals. NATIVE REQUITE rushed up to a clear lead around the first turn then was pressured to the three furlong marker where he was headed
but kept on to the top of the stretch before weakening. PICASSO BABY raced near the back and was not involved. ASTRONEER was unhurried to the first
turn and remained back. NOW NOW MELVIN pressed the pace for a half and dropped back.

IZEONPOINT was off a step slow and broke inward leaving the gate, trailed the field to the turn then skimmed the rail into the stretch and drew off. TRIPLE
L'S CUTTER tracked the leaders from three or four wide through the turn then split horses entering the stretch and made a late three wide run at the leader
but was not enough. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW raced in the middle of the pack from four or five wide then moved up from three wide on the turn, tipped out
to five wide in upper stretch and showed late interest. TEXAS RED BEL prompted the pace from the inside to the half mile marker then settled off the pace
around the turn and passed tiring rival. TIZ SWEET CANDY went to the lead while being pressured from inside rival to the half mile marker, was headed
midway through the turn and fought gamely to mid stretch and tired. FASTED chased the leaders from the inside to the turn and dropped back. FRIED
ASPARAGUS had an awkward start then was hustled along to stalk the pace from three wide and engaged the leader midway through the turn then gave
way.

in upper stretch and ran down the leader in deep stretch and drew clear late. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE rushed to a clear lead but was collared in the final
yards to be second best. ALTERANA tracked the leaders while saving ground then fanned out to three wide in upper stretch to make the late run and was
up for the show. SHARP CHARLIE showed good early speed from three wide then made a mild bid into the stretch but was out finished. MOR BIG LEE
raced in the middle of the pack from three wide but failed to menace. FLOWER CAT chased the leaders to the top of the stretch and gave way. WISE
ANCHOR saved ground to no avail. ZONG TOUGH showed no early speed and was always back. LOUDTHUNDRHEVYRAIN stumbled at the start and
remained back. PINCH ME A PENNY trailed the field and was outrun.

wide on the final turn, shifted back inside in upper stretch to make the late inside run to miss the win. DARLING JOANNA was allowed to settle near or at
the back through the final turn then angled out to four wide near the eighth pole to make the late rally for show. MS. CAJUN QUEEN bumped with FOLLOW
THE SAINT leaving the gate and raced near the back around the first turn, steadily advanced down the backstretch and made a stretch bid from three wide
to gain late on the leaders. PAYTON'S INDIAN prompted the pace from two wide to the final turn then fought gamely to early stretch and gave way. OUR
AMEN broke inward leaving the gate, the raced in the middle of the pack and passed tiring rivals. MO CLASSY was forwardly placed to midway through the

OVERANALYTICAL went to the front to set the pace while leading throughout and was kept to task in the drive. READY SHOES was allowed to settle near
the back around the first turn, steadily advanced up the rail down the backstretch then angled out to three wide around the final turn to make the late run but
was not enough. MOSQUITO FLEET tracked the leaders down the backstretch then engaged the leader midway through the final turn and faltered. MORO
MAFIA maintained pace down the backstretch while racing in the middle of the pack, made a mild bid at the three furlong marker and improved position.
WARTIME HERO raced near the back to the final turn and passed tiring rivals. ALLIGATOR CRAWL trailed the field to the half mile marker then made a
mild bid but was not a threat. BAD SNEAKERS chased the leaders down the backstretch and weakened. DIRECT LINE raced in the middle of the pack from
three wide to the three furlong marker and dropped back.

Footnotes
LADY OF DEVON raced off the pace on the inside to the turn then moved up from three wide on the turn and tipped out to four wide at the quarter pole and
cruised home. KOKOMO STARLET went to an early pressured lead and inched clear near the three furlong marker but was collared near the eighth pole
and stayed on for the place. LADY DRILLER vied for the early lead from five wide to the turn then chased the leader to the top of the stretch and weakened.
RONA VISION showed no early speed then moved up from three wide around the turn to make the rally. SO THEY SAY raced near the back to the turn
then saved ground around the turn and showed late interest in the stretch. LA CANTAROS raced close up from two wide and lacked the late response.
MITOLE'S LADY vied for the lead from the inside to the turn and faded. DISCREET DEAL tracked the leaders from six wide on the backstretch then three
wide on the turn and retreated. LA LOMBRIZ chased the leaders and was not a threat. LAST WINE FOR ME pressed the pace from three wide to the turn
and dropped back. WHEELNDEALNSTEALN was tardy at the start and was distanced.
