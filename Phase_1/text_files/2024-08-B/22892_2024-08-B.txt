Footnotes
PUBLIUS settled off of the pace in the two path, moved between horses down the backstretch, launched a three wide rally nearing the lane, bid in the four
path and outside of an inner rival in upper stretch, gained an advantage reaching the final sixteenth and inched clear. TRAP LINE leaned out at the start,
laid off of the pace in teh four path, gained turning for home before tucking to the two path entering the lane, tipped back to bid in the three path along with
an outer rival in upper stretch, got outkicked by that one in the final furlong and lasted for place. STRADIVARIAN broke a step slow and steadied when put
to tight quarters at the start, lacked speed in the two path, gained ground in teh five path around the far turn, sustained a rally to reach show in the final
furlong but needed more for place. BALTIMORE HEART stalked in the three path, vied for place with an outer rival while tucking to the inside nearing the
lane, encountered traffic behind the faltering leader while getting outkicked by her outer counterpart in upper stretch, slipped through reaching the furlong
grounds and willingly chased the leaders home. ULTIMATE STRIKE pursued from midpack in the two path, then between horses down the backstretch, but
chased into the lane and lacked a bid. QUEBRANCHO laid off of the pace in the three to four path and between horses, swung out to the nine path in upper
stretch and lacked a rally. EGYPTIAN KING was fractious in the starting gate, broke a step slow before brushing an inner rival at the start, trailed along the
inside early on, improved position in the six path turning for home. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS pursued from midpack along the inside, got shuffled back
behind a stopping rival around the far turn to trail in the three path at the five sixteenths pole, then failed to factor. THEZELENSKYYFACTOR dueled for the
lead with an outer rival through quick fractions around teh first turn, opened up a wide margin down the backstretch, but tired nearing the lane, faltered
between bidders in upper stretch and stopped. WHERE'S JACK tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a stopping foe around the far turn
and failed to recover. SON OF A MAN dueled for the lead with an inner rival early on, chased that one down the backstretch, faltered along the inside
around the far turn and stopped.

UPSTRIKER prompted outside of the pace setter, vied in the three path around the far turn, led narrowly reaching the lane, inched clear passing the furlong
grounds, then lasted from an outer menacing bidder late. MAD ADAM tracked from the four path, came under urging within striking range outside of the
leading pair around the far turn, remained under a hard chase while lacking progress through upper stretch, yet ran on to close in on the clear leader in the
final sixteenth, ranged up to offer a late bid but came up short. LEGENDARY LORE tracked two wide and between horses, pursued the leaders while well in
hand in the three path around the far turn, but only offered an even kick through the lane. HOME RUN TRICK set the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied
with that one while taking the far turn in the two path, got headed nearing the lane then faded through the final furlong. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI stalked
along the inside, but was through nearing the three furlong pole.

JEWELED DESTINY stalked outside of the top pair, bid into the far turn, forged an advantage while still in hand reaching the five sixteenths pole, met her
stablemate's challenge shortly after, held an advantage while being set down entering the lane and drove clear. SUNDAY DISRUPTOR broke half a beat
slow, tracked along the inside, awaited racing room while pursuing with run at the three furlong pole, tipped four wide with five sixteenths remaining to offer
a bold bid outside of the new leader leaving that station, but was turned away leaving upper stretch and proved second best. LOW KEY pursued four wide,
got floated five wide turning for home, lacked a bid then caught a tired rival at the wire for show. GHOSTTAPPER set a pressured pace along the inside,
vied with a pair of outer rivals around the far turn, got headed while inside of a trio of foes passing the five sixteenths pole, faded through the lane and lost
show at the wire. JUST SHOWING OFF prompted two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, but yielded with five sixteenths to go and weakened
through the lane. AIRFORCE LIGHTNING broke a step slow while last away, trailed in the two path and got outrun.

Footnotes
DOUBLE NEAT stalked along the inside, then from the two path turning for home, took aim outside of the leader entering the lane, sustained gradual
progress to bid leaving the furlong grounds, wrestled an advantage at the sixteenth pole and held from an outer late bidder. ATLANTIC DANCER trailed
along the inside, moved forward in the three path and between horses around the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, rallied with a surge outside of rivals
in the final furlong and reached place while missing the leader at the wire. MR MCGREGOR prompted outside of the leader, vied approaching the far turn,
forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, led into the lane before meeting an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, got collared and headed by that
one at the sixteenth pole, then lost place to an outer bidder and saved show at the wire. GIOVANNINO pursued from midpack in the two path, rallied
between horses in upper stretch to take aim between the leaders in the final furlong, but needed more late. RANSOMWARE pursued from midpack in the
three to four path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, sustained grinding progress to be within striking range in the final sixteenth, but leveled off late
and got outkicked for a minor share. TWIRLING TROILLET broke a bit out at the start, stalked the top pair from the three path, chased in the four path and
among foes entering the lane, then ran on evenly between horses. SEASON FIGHTER saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path nearing the
lane, but failed to factor. GAMETIME GLADIATOR laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, then the five to six path around the far
turn and failed to factor. HAWKS CREEK leaned in subtly at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted to the five path around the
far turn before swinging to the eight path into upper stretch, and made little impact. FORGE IN FIRE set the pace inside of a prompting rival, lost the lead to
that one at the five sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
TOWN BRANCH pressed two wide, assumed command at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear, then lasted from an outer challenger late. GOLDEN BUCK
broke in a tangle while brushing with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the five path, gained turning for home to reach place entering the lane,
closed in on the clear leader late but needed more. LEFT POCKET MONEY chased from midpack in the three path and between horses, moved out to the
five path into the lane, shfited wider in the final furlong and stayed on. THIRD WATCH pursued in the five path into the turn, advanced tucking to the three
path around the bend, then chased one paced through the lane. TAP THE CANDY laid off of the pace along the inside, checked and got shuffled back
behind a rival at the five sixteenths pole, drifted out to the nine path entering teh lane and lacked a rally. TOOLPUSHER pursued form midpack in the four
path and between horses into the turn and gave way. TAMARA'S WAY stalked along the inside but faded around the turn. MOR JAZZ set the pace inside of
a prompting rival, proved no match for that one with five sixteenths to go and weakened. BYZANTINE exchanged light contact with an outer rival at the start,
then showed little.

Footnotes
MAY MAY STRONG stalked the leading pair from the two path around the turn, took aim outside of them in upper stretch, ranged whlie getting slightly
herded out in the final furlong, wrestled an advantage at the sixteenth pole and inched ahead. UNDERCOVER prompted two wide, vied around the turn, led
passing the quarter pole, inched ahead as an outer rival took aim coming to the final furlong, drifted out slightly meeting that one's challenge in the final
furlong, but was caught by that one at the sixteenth pole and held place. PERFORMABILITY pursued from midpack in the five path, then ran on willingly but
needed more for place. IMPRACTICAL DIVA broke a step slow, pursued from midpack along the inside shifted to the three path and between horses
entering the lane and stayed on. MOMBAYLA leaned out and broke a step slow at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, entered the lane in the five
path and moved up. FLIGHT ON RACE DAY tracked in the three path and between horses, chased entering the lane in the four path and lacked a punch.
ONDA BRAVA pursued from midpack two wide and between horses but failed to menace. GO PURPLE set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn,
got headed at the quarter pole and faded. KISS BLUE tracked in the four path but gave way between horses turning for home. A MUST SEE laid off of the
pace along the inside and failed to factor. SUPER DUPER NICE was taken in hand among foes with nine sixteenths to go, dropped back into the turn and
made little impact. RIVER MISCHIEF was reluctant to load, then hit the outer stall door while breaking slow, trailed in the four path, was eased through teh
final furlong and was taken off of the track in an equine ambulance.

Footnotes
STRUMMIN settled off of the pace in the five path, launched a rally entering teh lane in the six path, drove past the leaders at the sixteenth pole and drew
clear. MORLOCK tracked four wide down the backstretch, ranged up to offer a mild bid outside of the leader and from the three path turning for home, was
fended off through midstretch, rebid along with an outer rival in the final furlong, but got outkicked and re-edged place. HEAVENVILLE set the pace along
the inside, remained in hand around the far turn, met a mild outer challenge turning for home, held sway through midstretch, but gave in to an outer pair at
the sixteenth pole. STIGLETS tracked forwardly two wide and between horses, chased around the far turn and kept on. TICKLED QUIST pursued from
midpack, chased in the four to five path around the turn and failed to menace. WHISKEY SHOT stalked along the inside but faded turning for home.
RIGHTEOUS STAR lacked speed two wide, saved ground around the turn, but to no avail. WINNING SONG lagged behind while detached from the rest
entering the backstretch, rejoined the group entering the lane in the six path, shifted in and improved position. RAVE RUNNER stalked three wide but faded
between horses at the three furlong pole. ROYAL BRO lacked speed along the inside, took the far turn in the three path and failed to factor. GUNS pursued
from midpack along the inside, then two wide and between horses turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
QUALITY STAR stalked three wide, ranged up bid turning for home, got floated to the five path in upper stretch, dueled with inner rivals in the final sixteenth
and prevailed. CALLIE'S GRIT crossed over while establishing the front nearing the first turn, dictated terms via a soft pace, met a pair of outer challenges
turning for home, shifted out to the three path entering the lane, drifted wider entering the final furlong, yet straightened course while digging in between
horses in the final furlong, battled gamely but got nailed at the wire. TAKE A STAND tracked two wide and between horses, pursued the leading trio while in
hand turning for home, took aim inside of the drifting leader entering the final furlong, bid and vied in the final sixteenth but needed more late. PAINT ME
PERFECT was allowed to settle and trailed along the inside, took the far turn in the two to three path, rejoined the rest before swinging out to the eight path
in midstretch, then ran on willingly. BRU NA BOINNE steadied when an outer rival shifted down approaching the first turn, settled into stalking stride along
the inside shortly after, but came under urging to chase turning for home and lacked a bid. BEACH WALKN steadied passing the wire for the first time,
pressed outside of the leader, bid between horses turning for home, got floated to the four path entering upper stretch, then steadied when forced to tight
quarters and pinched by an inner drifting rival at the furlong grounds, and capitulated. THE RIDER OF BEACH WALKN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
CALLIE'S GRIT ALLEGING INTEREFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, BUT THE OJBECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

lane, edged clear near the sixteenth pole and held off rival in the final stages. SILENT SECRETARY (BRZ) raced in the four path along the first turn, tracked
the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, made a late bid down the lane but missed in the final stages. MO SASHAY raced in the three path
along the first turn while back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane while lugging in and was gaining in the late stages. CHARM
