GOVENOR HANK broke sharp and quickly took on the challenge of INSTANT KARMA, dueled inside of rival around the turn, shook free in upper stretch
and kept clear. FOOLS CONVERSATION raced off the clear top pair into the turn, launched a four wide bid past upper stretch and finished well. ODE TO
MY BRO BOB raced behind the clear embattled pair in early stages, hustled along three wide in the stretch, finished with response and cleared a share.
INSTANT KARMA moved up soon after the start and engaged GOVENOR HANK for the lead, dueled outside of rival around the turn, could not move on
with eventual winner past upper stretch and flattened out. WILL RUN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S RUN was allowed to settle out of the gate and rated off the early pace, let out a notch entering the far turn, quickly ranged up into contention
near the quarter pole, was sat down four wide for the drive, poked a head in front at the sixteenth pole and edged away. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY was
unhurried and raced in the back, picked up the pace entering the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, roused forward into strong contention but could
not reach the winner. CHARMING CHARLIE stalked the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued in close contention around the far turn,
tipped two wide entering upper stretch, lacked a clear path, shifted three wide a furlong out and just missed place. GRAND DESIGN tracked the pace up the
backstretch, moved up to engage AMERICAN POSSEE for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled into stretch run then got overtaken by the winner at the
sixteenth pole. AMERICAN POSSE hustled up to the lead out of the gate, set the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, took on the challenge of
GRAND DESIGN at the quarter pole, dueled into stretch run then weakened late. BIG PINES SANDY failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
TEE OFF TIME was nicely rated up the backstretch, tracked two wide around the turn, shifted four to five paths wide and given cue at the head of the lane,
responded willingly and pulled away. JUSTA STREAK raced three wide in the second flight, moved up three wide to engage rivals for the lead at the quarter
pole, dug in racing near the lead past the furlong marker then failed to be a match when the winner swept by. REDNECKERTHANYOU dueled for the lead
up the backstretch, continued to battle around the turn, held a slight edge a furlong out then got overtaken by the winner and weakened to show.
SPECIALSORTASTORM tracked the early pace, cut the corner, ran on along the rail into the lane and needed more for serious impact. CALL ME Q vied for
the lead up the backstretch and into upper stretch then tired in the final furlong. GOLD TAPPER raced off the pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and
lacked response. STAR OF MINE raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
AORAKI sped to the lead at the start and set the early pace, vied briefly past the quarter pole, shook free turning for home, sustained response along the
inside under steady encouragement and kept to task. BATTLESHIPPER stalked the pace in the opening quarter, edged closer late on the turn, given cue
two wide at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished second best. HOT GUNNER raced off the pace up the backstretch, urged along the rail
late on the turn, cut the corner entering the upper stretch, advanced into contention and cleared the rest. BAND'S FREE SPIRIT tracked the pace up the
backstretch, was ridden along four paths wide at the quarter pole, flattened off the leaders in upper stretch and ran on for a minor share. PATMO was
forwardly placed in early stages, vied briefly with the winner going by the quarter pole then faded in the lane. SENZAKI was ridden along off the early pace,
swung five wide into upper stretch and steadily weakened.
