Footnotes
JUS TOO FLY broke in then bumped with a foe, was coaxed along just off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn,
moved out while asked for his best inside the three-sixteenths pole, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted out while gaining on the leading duo,
swapped back to his inside lead just outside the sixteenth-pole and drove by the embattled duo with big strides to prevail. REPLEVIN bumped hard with a
rival shortly after the break while also making contact with another opponent, went to the front then showed the way, was asked while inside on the turn,
dueled with SKY MASTERSON under a drive in the stretch, gamely fended off that foe in the final sixteenth but was denied by the winner. SKY
MASTERSON was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the three path on the turn, was
asked outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, drifted out when put to a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths
pole then was switched to a right-handed crop, dueled outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and missed while clear for the show. MAX N FIFO
was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, drifted out early then was urged along while last but one, went around the turn in the four path, turned into
the stretch in the five path, remained on his inside lead until just outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and improved position without
seriously threatening. WRAP AND SEND broke in at the start, dropped back under urging then raced at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, shifted to
the four path at the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. RESISTANCE FUTILE moved in while settling off the pace, was roused in the three path on the turn
and lacked the needed response. PAPA'S NICO BOY leaned in then hit the gate at the start and was off slow, tracked the pace after being hustled up from
the outside, chased in the four path on the turn and tired. KY ANANSI was bumped hard after the start, showed some early speed then dropped back, saved
ground on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
GOLDCREST chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied coming under a right handed
crop and came in bumping MON PETIT CHOU just outside the sixteenth pole when seizing command for good measure and then inched away to the finish
kept to task. MON PETIT CHOU coaxed from the gate, raced two to three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch, took over command with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under threat and was bumped when displaced from the
front just outside the sixteenth marker, then ran on safe for the place honors. AWESOME ANNMARIE coaxed from the start, established the front five and a
half furlongs from home and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
got collared with three-sixteenths to go and weakened in the late stages. RIBOT'S VALENTINE chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. MY FIRST LOVE chased three then two wide coaxed along from the
three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, weakened. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole,
tucked inside briefly before heading back to the two path midway on the turn, continued in the two path into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CRUISE TO CATALINA broke out then was coaxed to show speed, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead outside
the five-sixteenths pole, shook clear in the four path into the stretch, extended the advantage under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, was given a
final pop of the crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up some while placed under a hand-ride to the finish. NOLITA broke out at the start, chased
the pace from third, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, chased in the five path into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and was
second best. DUCKPHAT was off a step slow then drifted out, angled in under urging at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail into the stretch,
moved out in the drive and lacked the needed response while able to safely secure the show. SWEET ANNIVERSARY stumbled at the start then veered out
and was off a bit slow, raced on the outside under urging, went around the turn in the four then five path, turned into the stretch in the six path and failed to
respond. EVALUATION came outward while hustled from the gate, set the pace under pressure to her outside while well off the inside, vied in the two path
under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, lost the advantage outside the five-sixteenths pole and faded.

MALIBU MOONSHINE bumped with a rival after the start while brushing with another foe, dropped back then angled in at the rear, was urged along at the
back, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner while rallying into upper stretch, closed well under a right-handed crop to make a bid at the furlong marker,
gained the advantage under a strong hand-ride outside the sixteenth-pole, moved clear while given one pop of a left-handed crop shortly thereafter and
drew away under a hand-ride from that point to the finish. HAZARDOUS HUMOR was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the backstretch, vied in
the two path while inside of a foe on the turn, came out some under a right-handed crop while battling with GOLDEN MOONLIGHT in upper stretch, moved
in to get closer to the winner near the furlong marker, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match while able to get the place.
GOLDEN MOONLIGHT was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside, drifted out some near the five-eighths pole, vied in the three path on
the turn, was asked late on that bend, turned into the stretch in the four path, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the
show. IT TAKES HEART broke out and hit the gate then was hustled, chased the pace from third, went around the turn in the four path, turned into the
stretch in the six path while under the crop, pursued the leaders into the final furlong and tired. BACKED BY GOLD was urged along off the pace, traveled
around the turn in the two path, swung out to the seven path into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TOSCONOVA BEAUTY had a shoe repaired
in the paddock, bumped with an opponent after the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the three then four path, spun into the
stretch in the six path, moved in while remaining on her inside lead into the final furlong and failed to rally. SHESALITTLE EDGY brushed with a rival after
the start, was urged along off the pace, moved from the three path to the five path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the eight path and came up empty.
JACKSON'S DIXIE was coaxed along on the outside, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn and faltered.

FILOSO got taken hold of briefly seven furlongs out when DISCREET DANCER appeared wanting to tuck in front, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, surged clear under a drive to the sixteenth
pole, then got geared down in the late stages while clear to the finish. SPURGEON bobbled at the break, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. AMERICAN PROMISE brushed the near side stall at
the start, came under coaxing and led early on before being engaged in head to head combat by T KRAFT to the outside, dueled from the two path down
the backstretch, got shaken off steadily through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to
come again and secure the show honors. T KRAFT broke out at the start, raced five then four wide through the first dog legged turn advancing four then
three wide into the backstretch to duel with the aforementioned foe to his inside, steadily shook off that rival and tucked to the two path through the far turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch under threat, got displaced straightened away and weakened in the final
furlong. NOBLE CONFESSOR a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, got bumped at the start by CONTRABANDIST, raced four wide through the first turn
and then five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn coming under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
to five wide for home, weakened in the drive. FIDDLING FELIX chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued two to three
wide into upper stretch and tired. CONTRABANDIST broke out at the start bumping NOBLE CONFESSOR, raced four then three wide through the first turn
before chasing two to three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. THARHOM broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased three wide through the first turn and down the
backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. DISCREET
DANCER hustled from the gate, went to tuck to the two path and saw a rival there and thought better of it when that rival steadied and decided to remain
three wide seven furlongs from home, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
RIGHT TO VOTE was asked leaving the gate then taken under a hold early, saved ground while rated in third position, moved from the rail to the three path
while asked on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, chased the leading duo on the outside, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole
and proved best under good handling. VINTAGE VINO brushed with a rival after the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled on the outside but
with cover, was roused in the three then four path on the far turn, came into the stretch in the six path and finished with good energy but was too late while
up for the place. CIAO CHUCK went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked inside the
seven-sixteenths pole, vied inside to the two path under urging on the far turn, lost the advantage in the three path into the stretch, dueled with INHERENT
PROMISE into the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the show. INHERENT PROMISE established a forward position early, raced in the
three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside without cover, was asked in the two then three path on the far turn, took a short lead in the four
path into the stretch, dueled with CIAO CHUCK into the final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the show. PRIMED TO GO brushed with a foe just
after the start, raced under a tight hold into the first turn, saved ground while reserved at the back then was roused on the far turn, was taken in hand briefly
while off heels nearing the quarter-pole, shifted to the three path into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ACT OF MUTINY was fractious in the
gate, went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside but with the benefit of cover, was asked in the two then three path on the far turn,
turned into the stretch in the four path and came up empty. WHEELHOUSE saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused while inside
on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHARGING AERO got bumped at the start in a chain of bumping begun by DADDY KNOWS breaking outwards and conceded two lengths to the front,
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home
and edged away to the finish to prevail. HATCH chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch,
offered up a mild kick to rally up the rail and secure the place honors. BOURBON'S HOPE broke in at the start bumping NOTTOWAY, chased three then
two wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on through to the finish. CHATEAU coaxed
from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch
already having shaken clear, dug in clear to the eighth pole but under growing threat from flanking challengers, got collared a sixteenth from home and
weakened in the late stages. AFTERNOON HEAT got bumped at the start by DADDY KNOWS and in turn bumped EMERALD FOREST in a chain of
bumps out through BUSTIN SHOUT and conceded five lengths to the front, raced five paths off the inside briefly before being carried out two additional
paths by DADDY KNOWS midway down the backstretch, had that rival clear and tucked back inwards reaching the three path into the far turn and making
his way to the rail with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at that station, angled out to swing seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly
to the finish. NOTTOWAY got bumped at the start by BOURBON'S HOPE and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. EMERALD FOREST got bumped at the
start by AFTERNOON HEAT and in turn bumped CHARGING AERO and conceded two lengths to the front, tucked inwards carrying in DADDY KNOWS to
the three path before clearing that rival, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and came up empty. BUSTIN SHOUT got bumped at the start by CHARGING AERO in a
chain of bumps begun by the pressure of DADDY KNOWS breaking outwards and conceded only a length or two to the front, chased five then four wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. DADDY KNOWS broke out at the start bumping
AFTERNOON HEAT and beginning a chain of bumps out through BUSTIN SHOUT, got carried in two to three paths by EMERALD FOREST soon after
before that rival cleared and was tipped out to the six path carrying out AFTERNOON HEAT two paths when settling six paths off the rail, tucked five wide
through the turn and came under urging with seven-sixteenths to go, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
TWO'S A CROWD was hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the rail on the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail
while in dead-aim of the leader on the turn, was asked late on that bend, made a rail bid into upper stretch then took over inside the three-sixteenths pole,
shook clear while off the inside coming to the furlong marker and held under steady urging. SKYLER'S STARSHIP bumped with foes on both sides at the
start then was hustled, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two path
under threat on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished while drifting out some but just held the place.
PROVISION bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, was taken in hand early, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved
from the rail to the four path while gaining under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, pursued the top two in the drive and finished
willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. MERLIN'S MOMENT bobbled ever so slightly after the start, tugged on the bit in the two path on the
first turn then tossed his head while keen under restraint, settled more kindly on the backstretch, moved in outside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the
far turn and lacked the needed response. NOONZIO broke in then was hustled, dropped from the six path to the four path on the first turn, prompted the
pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. DOLLY'S
BANK bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, climbed into kickback outside the five-eighths pole, dropped back late on the
backstretch, went around the far turn in the three path and came up empty. BAD LARRY dropped from the eight path to the five path on the first turn, was
urged along on the outside, dropped back in the four path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the six path and had nothing left. BOB JOHN RAY bobbled
slightly the start, dropped from the eighth path to the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, went around the far turn in the four then three path, turned
into the stretch in the four path and showed little. BOYS CODE saved ground on the first turn, moved off the rail while well back on the backstretch, shifted
from the three path to the six path under urging on the far turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
ZULU KINGDOM (IRE) broke in at the start bumping TEST SCORE in tandem with WITHOUT CAUTION, settled tracking the front along the inside, came
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and was set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, angled inside to the rail and rallied scraping the
paint inside of NUDGE at the eighth pole to take command just inside that station, inched away briefly and then dug in gamely as the runner up surged in
the late stages to the wire. TENACIOUS LEADER settled tracking his barn and stable mate from the two path in closest aim, advanced on that one with
seven-sixteenths to go latching on to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow and
brief command a furlong out, got headed inside that station, dug in under a drive surging late to come again and miss by a neck at the finish while clear of
the rest for the place honors. CAVALLO BAY (GB) raced just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide coming under light coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths and advanced from the three eighths three wide through the far turn to stack outside the top pair five-sixteenths from home, swung four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to secure the show honors while unable to match the top pair inside the final eighth. NUDGE broke
out at the start establishing the front from the get go, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from flanking challengers and was displaced just outside the eighth pole, kept on under a drive but was
ultimately just bested for the show honors on the line. TEST SCORE got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way and conceded three
lengths to the front, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced
through to the finish. WITHOUT CAUTION buckled at the start losing his hind footing and then recovered outwards into TEST SCORE, chased just off the
inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
CREDITWORTHY was rated off the fast pace, angled from the inside to the three path on the turn, rallied in the four path into the stretch, closed well to get
the lead into the final furlong, moved clear outside the sixteenth-pole and just held under strong urging. PROTON SPIRIT settled off the pace, moved out
near the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the three path, shifted out in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, swapped leads back and forth
multiple times, drifted in while gaining around the sixteenth-pole then made a bid, was grabbed some with the right-rein while lugging in just off the winners
flank late and just missed while losing momentum in the end. SUMMER IN ERIN settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path, chased the leader into the final furlong and narrowly earned the show while no match for the top two. SPEED FIGURES was hustled
to the front then showed the way through quick fractions, vied inside on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner
into the final furlong and weakened. REVEREND MOON stalked the pace on the outside, chased in three path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive
into the final furlong and also weakened. INK LIES broke in at the start, was urged along near the back, went around the turn in the two path, spun into the
stretch in the four path and failed to threaten. ZECA DIABO settled on the outside, was roused in the three then four path on the turn, turned into the stretch
in the five path and lacked the needed response. CALL BOB tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, dropped to the
inside into upper stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and tired. LIBERTE DE BAYEUX broke a bit slow, angled in at the rear,
saved ground on the turn, lost action badly and stumbled severely in the hindquarters multiple times outside the quarter-pole and was no factor.
