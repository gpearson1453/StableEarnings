Footnotes
SASSE'S CLASS rated along early under a hold, ridden along through the far turn to challenge, cleared off near the three sixteenths pole and held well to
remain clear under steady handling. TONY'S MO stalked the top trio early on, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire.
MERGING TRAFFIC was allowed to settle early, moved up from the inside near the quarter pole, shifted out four wide through the drive and closed in
mildly. BENGAL CAT showed good early speed to set the pace, confronted to duel through the far turn and weakened through the drive. RESTRIKE
forwardly placed early on, raced four deep into the upper stretch and needed more. LUCKY DOUBLE ZERO was unhurried early, saved ground through the
far turn into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. SPEEDZILLA raced mid pack early on, lost ground and failed to sustain a bid. Internal fractional times were
unavailable due to timer malfunction. Official race time was hand timed.

ASHLEE'S RING vied two deep and held gamely through the drive to be clear under strong handling. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN vied for the early lead near
the rail and kept on gamely to the wire. DEL REY DOLLY stalked the pace, raced three deep near the quarter pole and made a late gain to close in on the
top pair. EARLY FROST chased the pace from the inside and tired through the drive. LANALIKESCHOOCHOOS broke awkwardly, raced four to five wide
around the far turn and lacked a bid.

OVER AND THUNDER showed good early speed to set the early pace, cleared off to a clear lead into the far turn and held that margin under steady
handling. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS tracked the early leader two deep, kept on but was no match for the winner. LORD WINSALOT broke awkward, lost
ground at the break, hard ridden two deep near quarter pole and moved up to improve position. SOUPER ROYAL MOON settled early on, made a strong
two wide move near the five sixteenths pole and flattened out in the drive. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER was off slowly, lost ground at the start, raced with the
second flight early, raced five deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. COPPERHEAD CREEK stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper
stretch and failed to sustain a bid. OMERTA CODE lag early on to trail, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. CAJUN OCCASION
stalked the pace early three deep and tired readily. ALBERTANO raced far back and was eased up on through the stretch.

Footnotes
SASSY LAD showed sharp early speed, dueled through the far turn and finished well to draw clear under strong handling. FORCE OF JUSTICE urged early
on, dueled with the winner through the far turn two deep and kept on to be second best. BRONX BOYS raced three to four wide around the far turn and had
not enough for the top pair. EASTER BET tracked the pace from the inside and tired. FILTHY RICH failed to respond.
