Footnotes
EQUISTAR prompt the early leader from the outside, cleared near the eighth pole and prevailed late under all out pressure. ATTACHED was under a hard
chase early from the outside of foes, raced three wide through the far turn and just missed in a game effort. MY MASTERPIECE raced two deep around the
far turn, tipped out five wide into the upper lane and finished willingly to the wire. ARROGANTE dropped back near the rear early, swung seven wide into the
upper stretch and showed good late interest. SECRET WISPER vied for the early lead near the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. NO MORE
DIAMONDS was forced to check sharply between rivals early on, had a two to three wide trip and no late response. PYROTECHNICS urged early near the
rail and faded in the drive. TAPESTRY COLORS saved ground and lacked a bid.

pressured early pace along the inside raced off the inside in the drive, dug in late and missed in a game effort. TIME TESTED pressed the early leader from
the outside down the backstretch, dueled through far turn and weakened the final eighth of a mile. LOVE SHAQ was unhurried early on, ridden along into
the far turn, advanced four to five between to split rivals into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. EAST AURORA dropped back to race mid
pack early, raced three to four wide into the upper stretch and needed more. UPTOWNJACOB BROWN void of early speed to trail, saved ground and never
was a serious threat. RUMORS TO BLAME stalked the pace near the inside and faded in the drive. BOTTOMLESS REFILL stalked the pace, raced three
wide around both turns and tired.

THATAWAY pressed the early leader two deep from the outside of Pretorian Gold, took a clear lead near the eighth pole and remained safe under steady
handling. HOMETOWN HERO was unhurried early, hard ridden five wide around the far turn and rallied gamely late for the place position racing from the far
outside. PRETORIAN GOLD was bumped at the start, set the early pace along the inside, pressured midway down the backstretch through the far turn and
gave way grudgingly. MIDNIGHT AWARD dropped back early on, raced four wide around both turns and had not enough in the drive to overtake the top
trio. MORNING MARCH stalked the pace along the inside and weakened through the stretch run. OLIVIA DEE settld off the early going under a firm hold,
raced four wide into the upper stretch and needed more. LUCKY RUNNING CAT raced four wide around the first turn, stalked the early going from the
outside of rivals, raced three wide around the far turn and weakened in the drive. KISSTHEMOON was bumped at the start, stalked the pace near the inside
and was empty nearing the three sixteenths pole.

MARTINI'S BANK was forwardly placed early on, raced two deep near the quarter pole and finished well to prove best under strong handling. CARSONS
COOL WOMEN was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, advanced from the outside through the far turn, raced six wide into the
upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. TRECHMO GIRL dropped back to race mid pack, had an inside bid around the far turn through the stretch
and finished willingly to the wire. FACE IT ALONE sprinted clear early on and faded. FORCEZILLA stalked the pace from the inside and weakened. LET'S
GO MO trailed early on, lost ground to race far back and never threatened.
