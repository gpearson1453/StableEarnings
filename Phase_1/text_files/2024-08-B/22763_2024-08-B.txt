Footnotes
DADDY'S HONEY broke alertly, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn, set a decent pace while well handled into the backstretch run,
showed the way into the far turn, was set down into the stretch and drew clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and held sway
in deep stretch. MISS PERU settled outside of rivals into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run and went widest nearing the half-mile
marker, roused three wide into the far turn, made a sustained bid into the stretch, could not impact the winner in the final sixteenth and held well for second
in deep stretch. LOOKOUT PASS bobbled at the start then made contact with a neighboring rival and was off a bit slowly, settled in the second flight to
begin, saved ground through the backstretch run, angled four wide into the stretch, closed into the final sixteenth and just missed for second. MAMARANDO
settled off of the early pace, unhurried while not far back through the backstretch run, three wide into the far turn, could not muster the needed late response
and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. R MARILYN LONHRO was bumped by an inner rival at the start and was away a bit slowly, unhurried in the early
stages, trailed through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and lacked a late response. BEVERLY T away in good order, stalked the early
pace outside of DADDY'S HONEY into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, chased into the far turn, was outkicked into
upper stretch and faded in the final stages. ADDY PEARL was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the decent pace into the backstretch run, could not
keep pace into the second turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LEADING THE PACE settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, advanced into the turn and chased two to three wide nearing the quarter
marker, angled four wide into the stretch and continued his rally at the furlong marker, loomed past mid-stretch, took command into the final sixteenth and
kicked clear in the late stages. BOLD ENCOUNTER chased the decent early pace from between rivals, tracked the pacesetter approaching the turn then
advanced to press the pace three wide nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead into the stretch, took a narrow advantage at the furlong marker, was
overtaken by LEADING THE PACE into the final sixteenth and held for second at the finish. DRIVE BY hustled away from the start, assumed early
command and sprinted to a clear lead nearing the half-mile marker, set the pace off of the rail into the turn, came under pressure at the quarter pole and
battled BOLD ENCOUNTER into the stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while holding
safely for third. AUTISM INCLUSION bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, unhurried in the early going, improved position two wide into the turn,
finished evenly in the stretch drive and passed tiring rivals in the late stages. CONEJO MALO tracked the moderate pace from the inside, gained ground into
the turn and was well placed at the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch and did not offer a late response. DR. ONE broke alertly and vied for the
early lead while inside of rivals, took back and stalked the pace approaching the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn, lost position at the quarter
marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and faded. HOT CAKE allowed to settle away from the start, raced three to four wide along the turn and did not
factor in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LEEDSTHESKY showed speed away from the start, vied for the early lead then engaged with ZIPPIDY DU DAD and disputed a decent pace outside of that
rival heading to the half-mile marker, dueled through solid fractions along the turn, shook free into the stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, drew off
into the final sixteenth and was geared down in the late stages to prevail as much the best. C HER BEAUTY hustled to be forwardly placed away from the
start, took back and tracked from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and chased the dueling pacesetters nearing the
quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch then angled out past the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in deep stretch but finished well
in the late stages and was second best. STARLIT HARBOR lacked early speed and trailed heading to the half-mile marker, raced two to three wide along
the turn and trailed nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not impact the top pair in deep
stretch and was clear for third. ZIPPIDY DU DAD broke alertly, engaged with LEEDSTHESKY in the early stages and dueled inside of that rival heading to
the half-mile marker, contested solid fractions into the turn, lost ground to LEEDSTHESKY into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, lacked a
response past mid-stretch and gave way in the late stages. MAGGIE'S FAYE tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, was guided three to four
wide along the turn, lost position into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. RICKELLE close up to the decent early pace, took back to track the leading
pair heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed approaching the turn, chased two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, lost position into the
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. WINNING LUCK chased the decent early pace while widest nearing the half-mile marker, lost position four to five
wide into the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RICH GOLD took a position just behind the leaders, bided time down the backstretch, had to wait for some racing room on the far turn, swung five wide into
the stretch and finished well under steady handling and intermittent urging and proved best. SEA DOG was pushed to get forward position early but was
hung four to five wide on the clubhouse turn, settled in a tracking position a few lengths back but stayed to the four or five path down the backstretch,
advanced through the turn and loomed four wide passing the quarter pole, was kept to ask under a stiff drive and steady urging but was outfinished for the
win. BROTHER O' BRIEN lagged early, chased the field down the backstretch, started to run on when asked near the seven-sixteenths pole, swung about
six wide into the stretch, rallied, had to alter course to the outside in upper stretch, continued to finish well under steady handling to gain third. IT AINT
OVER lacked any speed from the break and lagged well behind the field through the first half of the race, started to run on when put into drive passing the
half-mile marker, looked to go inside for the run through the far turn but changed course and went to the three path, continued to rally through the stretch
overcame some traffic in the stretch to rally into fourth. AMANOFMYSTATURE went three wide into the first bend and emerged from the turn in a stalking
position just behind IT'S THIEVERY and BLUE SILVER, backed off a bit and let those two fight out the early pace, went to challenge those two passing the
three furlong pole still racing in the three path, pulled even before the quarter pole the flattened out in the stretch. ITS THIEVERY outsprinted the rest and
won the race into the first turn, took a slight lead onto the backstretch racing along the rail with BLUE SILVER a constant shadow, held sway through the
turn as AMANOFMY STATURE and SEA DOG joined the fray, kept fighting on as the four of them fanned out across the track at the top of the stretch but
weakened before the furlong pole and was outfnished. BLUE SILVER broke well and bid for the lead going into the first turn, was pulling hard through that
turn with the rider opting to take a stalking/pressing position just to the outside, kept on between horses as two others bid for the lead near the quarter pole,
kept on into the stretch then weakened. LET THETRUTHBETOLD lacked speed from the start and raced between horses near the rear of the field into the
first turn, advanced down the backstretch and was right behind the leaders heading into the far turn, became boxed in approaching the seven-sixteenths
pole, tried to re-rally but did not respond and was not a factor from that point. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology
to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
KRISTIN LEE settled off of the early pace while not far back, tracked the decent pace between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, was guided to the
outside and loomed three to four wide at the quarter marker, roused five wide into the stretch, took command nearing the furlong marker and kicked clear
past mid-stretch, kept to task into the final sixteenth, was hand urged in deep stretch and maintained a clear lead to the wire. BROADWAY TIGER raced
close up to the early pace, took back and tracked CONQUEST SECRET approaching the half-mile marker, stalked the pace from the outside entering the
turn, advanced and pressed the pace two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, took command into the stretch and was overtaken by KRISTIN LEE
heading to the furlong grounds, could not match strides with the winner past mid-stretch and held well for second in the late stages. LUSMA took back off of
the early pace, was well placed approaching the turn, saved ground and tracked the moderate pace nearing the quarter marker, shifted two wide into upper
stretch and chased to the furlong marker, could not muster a final response and just missed for second, while holding for third at the finish. POKER ALICE
settled off of the moderate early pace, chased two then three wide along the turn, shifted four wide for the stretch drive, offered a mild late rally and was
outfinished for the minor awards. WHY LOOKY HERE bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide into the
turn and advanced at the quarter marker, continued her run into the stretch, could not sustain her bid into the final sixteenth and finished evenly.
CONQUEST SECRET showed good speed away from the start and assumed early command, sped to a clear lead and set a decent pace heading to the
half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn, came under pressure at the quarter marker and was overtaken into the stretch, could not keep pace in the
stretch drive and faded. OUTER SUNSET was a step slow away from the start, settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn, trailed to the
quarter pole and did not factor. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
PRINCESS HEKAWI broke well, dueled with BACALAR to the half mile pole then backed off, steadied at the quarter pole as that foe drifted out on the turn,
went inside of the trouble and started to rally, had trouble handling the surface near the furlong marker, ducked in and bothered SHOUT IT OUT,
straightened out and surged ahead to win the photo in a blanket finish. JULIET'S KITCHEN was allowed to settle into stride, raced mid-pack while four to
five wide in the early stages, was launching a bid to the outside of BACALAR when that one drifted very wide on the turn got carried out and was forced into
the stretch in the six path, ran on willingly but was on the wrong lead, lugging in but still finished well to gain second. SWEET LAYLA RAE secured the rail
and tracked just behind the dueling leaders, responded when asked to go on after passing the three furlong marker, got clear run along the rail into the lane
then dueled with MORO FIRST CLASS the length of the stretch, got the best of that rival yards from the wire but could not outkick the top pair in the final
jumps. MORO FIRST CLASS broke well and settled into a tracking position behind the leading pair, went together with SWEET LAYLA RAE through the
turn, dueled with that foe for the length of the stretch and was outfinished in the final yards in a solid effort. SHOUT IT OUT was outrun down the backstretch
then started to rally while saving ground through the turn, loomed a threat nearing the furlong pole when bothered by PRINCESS HEKAWI, steadied, lost
momentum and finished evenly. BACALAR was hustled from the gate, dueled inside then pulled clear after passing the half-mile pole, led the field through
the turn then drifted out about three paths near the quarter pole, tried to battle back then steadied near the sixteenth pole and could not recover. BLUE
BREEZE lacked any speed from the break, dropped back after the break and chased the field throughout. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WRONG DIRECTION forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace two to three wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch
run, roused three wide into the far turn, loomed into upper stretch and confronted BIG STICK, drew to even terms with that rival at mid-stretch and dueled
into the final sixteenth, fought gamely into deep stretch and got up at the wire for a determined win. BIG STICK broke alertly, cleared the field and set the
pace into the first turn, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, showed the way into the far turn, drifted to the two path into
upper stretch, met the bid of WRONG DIRECTION at the furlong marker and battled that runner into the final sixteenth, dueled gamely into deep stretch and
just missed for the win, while holding safely for second. RULER OF ANGELS settled in the second flight to begin, saved ground into the first turn, tracked
the moderate pace from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, maintained an inside path into the far turn and advanced at the quarter pole, tipped three
wide for the stretch drive, responded to urging and made a sustained rally into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair at the finish and was clear for
third. BIG DIFFERENCE prominent away from the start, ceded the early lead to BIG STICK and stalked that rival through moderate fractions into the
backstretch run, attended to the pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased BIG STICK two wide into the far turn, shifted to the rail and ran in pursuit into
upper stretch, could not find the needed late response and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY took back off of the early
pace, raced between rivals into the first turn, was keen and got caught a bit in tight into the backstretch run, settled and tracked the moderate pace
approaching the half-mile pole, gained ground two to three wide into the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and
lacked a final response. STAY LIT settled outside of rivals into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace while widest nearing the half-mile pole, chased four
to five wide into the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and lost position at the furlong pole, was able to mount a mild late rally but needed more in the
final sixteenth. CROSS EXAMINE allowed to settle in the early stages, was content to trail into the backstretch run, swung four wide into the stretch and
improved position at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the late stages and flattened out. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY away in good order,
settled off of the early pace while not far back and went three to four wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace approaching the half-mile marker,
chased three to four wide into the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, lacked a response at the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BEACHLEY was sent hard from the break and went clear early, was allowed to dictate the pace, held sway through the turn and into the stretch, responded
when set down, extended the lead and won going away. A CLEAR BEHEST broke well but was outrun to the front by BEACHLEY, tracked a length or two
behind that rival with PLAY MISTY CAT a constant shadow to the outside, was unable to go on with BEACHLEY as they turned for home but kept to task
and outfinished PLAY MISTY CAT for the place. PLAY MISTY CAT tracked behind the pacesetter and to the outside of A CLEAR BEHEST, chased
BEACHLEY through the turn then could not match strides in the stretch, kept on well but was bested for second by A CLEAR BEHEST while well clear of
the next horse. DIALINGFORDIAMONDS broke well but was outrun through the initial furlong, made a mid-race move under a ride to move into contention
approaching the quarter pole, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but drifted out to the middle of the course under left handed urging and flattened out.
THIRSTY NIC lacked speed, chased the field while racing three to five wide throughout, was never a threat but managed to pass a pair of tired ones in the
late stages. SURF STAR threw his head up and lunged outward at the break, losing all chance, dropped far behind the field in the early going, was
protected while hopelessly behind the rest but managed to pass one late. JAGER ANGEL was steadied and bumped into by SURF STAR from the adjacent
stall, spotted the field a head start, angled over to the rail, saved ground through the turn but had little to offer in the stretch and faded to last. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
