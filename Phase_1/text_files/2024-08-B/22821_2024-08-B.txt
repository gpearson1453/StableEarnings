DON'T STOP DREAMIN was under a strong hold leaving the opening turn, tracked the pacesetters from the four path, drove five wide in the final turn to
challenge the front, took over at the head of the stretch, and held. MOHAMAD sat just off the pace while three wide, rallied between foes into the lane, was
unable to stall the eventual winner and finished up clearly second best. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR trailed the field and bid belatedly. VILLA NOVA passed
tiring rival. H K MELODY showed the way into the opening turn under a snug hold, and faltered in the stretch.

TAKE CHARGE CURLY quickly went to the lead, remained unchallenged into the stretch, responded to pressure from MENDELJOHN and held safely.
MENDELJOHN (IRE) sat in striking position, loomed boldly at the head of the stretch but was no match and held for second. SILVERFOOT chased inside,
and lacked the kick needed. TRAPEZE rated off the pace while four wide and lacked bid. AMEER tracked three to four wide and faded.

FIRECRACKER STAND took command at once, held good margins in the far turn while saving ground, and was kept to task under handling. PERDITION
raced in closest pursuit while four wide, was no match for the winner and just held for place. EXAMINER rated off the early pace, rallied inside and just
missed. BRODY'S PAL saved ground early, raced four to five wide leaving the final turn, and closed gradually. SMARTY RIVER PANTS offered a mild late
bid. SPEEDING STYLE chased outside, and tired early. MOB BOSS chased inside, was eased in the stretch then escorted off the track in the equine

NO REJOYCE bumped leaving, tracked the early pacesetters, waited inside on the rail nearing the quarter pole, readily took advantage of the opening when
it appeared and won driving. NO MORE LIES challenged the early pace, took the lead exiting the backstretch, was passed in the stretch, and maintained a
steady effort to the finish. KITTY HOUSE reserved early, swung out four to five wide, and closed gradually. NASAS PRINCESS bumped away, vied hard
outside, chased four wide in the final turn, and had little in reserve for the stretch. DAZZLE ME DAWN broke in, chased four to five wide in the far turn,
offered a mild bid inside into the stretch, and yielded. POCKETFULOFDREAMS bumped away from the gate, and was outrun. THEY CALL ME TOM

Footnotes
CHATTY GAL broke alertly, saved ground while showing the way, was under pressure late in the stretch and just held. OUT FRONT was brushed in the
backstretch, stalked the pace while three wide, surged deep stretch and just missed. STOLEN JEWEL saved ground inside, drove four wide in the final turn,
and finished evenly. ADDYDIDIT stalked four wide, and lacked a closing response. NO PEOPLE offered little. DAZZLING CHIC outrun throughout.
