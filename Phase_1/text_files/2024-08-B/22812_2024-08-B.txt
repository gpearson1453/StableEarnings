MERLIN'S MAGIC was off awkwardly, led inside, was clear and then lasted under steady urging while drifting out late. READY TO REIGN raced five wide
and rallied late, closing sharply. ACCONA was unrushed in the four path and rallied strongly. CADE'S GOAL saved ground and rallied late inside. D DAY
REUNION stalked the pace, bid and was bumped late. HYPERBOLIZE pressed the pace outside of the winner before yielding. JACKS R WILD went to the
rail early and passed tired foes. THREE POINT STRUT was squeezed back early, saved ground and faded on the far turn. SPLENDID DRAMA stalked the
early pace in the three path and gave way on the far turn.
