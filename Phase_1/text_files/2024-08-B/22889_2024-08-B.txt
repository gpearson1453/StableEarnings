Footnotes
MISSION ARTEMIS hopped slightly at the break, disputed the pace between foes heading towards the first turn, shifted out after the leader cleared leaving
the half, chased outside and was under a hearty ride from the quarter pole, ranged up to engage into the stretch, kept grinding to gain a slim lead leaving
the sixteenth marker the held sway. CASEY N PAP drafted back off the pace while saving ground, came under a ride leaving the far turn, remained inside
and advanced inside foes past the sixteenth marker, finished gamely and just ran out of ground. SUMMERINTHECOUNTRY vied three wide then cleared
past the half, set the pace towards the inside, wandered outward when confronted by the winner in mid stretch, dueled and gave way grudgingly. LIL
SEBASTIAN showed sharp speed to lead early along the rail, was firmly rated back off outer foes leaving the half, remained inside and regrouped to stalk,
took closer order leaving the far turn, eased out a path for the drive and kept on with effort between runners. TOP BLOOD , three deep past the three
eighths, advanced under a hustling ride in upper stretch then flattened out late. BRIGHT CHARGER broke a step slow, steadied when drifting in soon after,
dropped well off the early pace, came three wide for the drive and offered a mild run. GOLDEN LEGACY chased off the rail, steadied back from between
foes near the five sixteenths and faded.

WATCH OUT WORLD was bumped when hustled up between foes leaving the chute, took over then cleared into the turn, dropped in and set a rated pace,
spurted away a bit in upper stretch then held firm under a steady hand ride. WHITE SERIES lugged in after an alert break, corrected and forced the pace
three wide, continued three wide for the drive and held well to save the place. MILE HIGH MIRACLE , jostled soon after the break, regrouped to pursue off
the inside, circled four wide into the stretch, moved up past the sixteenth pole but was out finished for the place. BEACH COWBOY came out soon after the
break bumping a rival and then steadied leaving the chute, was pushed along chasing two wide then churned on through the final sixteenth. GALACTIC
GLORY , fractious in the gate, was backed out then re loaded, hustled up inside and vied early, tracked along the rail around the turn, failed to kick on under
pressure past mid stretch and faded. JASIEL broke a step slow, lagged back off the pace, swung four to five wide for the drive and offered a belated
response. REGGIESSCOTCHNSODA , forced out some early, failed to menace. The rider of BEACH COWBOY lodged a claim of foul against the winner
and WHITE SERIES alleging interference leaving the chute. No action was taken.

Footnotes
KISSLING eased back off foes leaving the three eighths, angled out three wide leaving the far turn, closed stoutly to take command outside NIGHT
PREACHER with a sixteenth to go and eagerly drew off while given one ask with the crop. NIGHT PREACHER , brushed at the break, corrected and edged
up three wide nearing the turn, engaged the leader leaving the quarter pole, sparred on a slim lead into the lane, ceded the lead a sixteenth out, gave way
grudgingly and narrowly saved the place. EMPRESS JULIA had speed to the inside of a rival, rated back off that one near the half, tracked mid turn, shifted
out for the drive and finished well. BLESSEDNOTLUCKY broke sharply and took command outside EMPRESS JULIA, edged clear after a quarter mile,
dropped in and met an outside bid soon after, dueled into the stretch then faded late. ARTIST MARK broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, came
three wide for the drive, shifted out near mid stretch and finished with interest. BUILT BY KHOZAN saved ground off the pace and under some coaxing,
eased out in deep stretch and churned on. GALA STAR , brushed at the break, raced off the pace while under a ride, came three wide into the stretch but
failed to generate a serious response. POSSUM , brushed and in a bit tight at the break, was under rating while well wide into the turn then failed to
menace.
