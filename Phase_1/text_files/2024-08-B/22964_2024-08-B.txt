PUBLIC APPEARANCE saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. DRIVE TRAIN was forwardly placed while racing two-wide and
finished strongly. CALORESE saved ground tracking PUBLIC APPEARENCE, could not reach that one but finished well for third. KLINKERBRICK was
reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out during the drive. GRAZED BY LOVE was
allowed to settle, swung out to be five-wide entering the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. DEKUDYLAN dropped back early while racing two-wide and
failed to menace. KNOCKOUT GUY saved ground while racing in the middle of the field but failed to be a factor.

FAYRUZ TRIBUTE set the pace while racing slightly off the rail, responded when challenged by OUTOFQUEMADO nearing the quarter pole and proved
best under strong handling. OUTOFQUEMADO was reserved early while saving ground, moved up along the inside to offer a bold bid nearing the quarter
pole but was unable to match strides with FAYRUZ TRIBUTE during the late stages in a game effort. CHARLIE'S MAN was unhurried early while saved
ground, slipped through during the drive and rallied late. THE GOLDEN EGG saved ground tracking FAYRUZ TRIBUTE, angled out nearing the quarter
pole, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. SUBITO SLEW saved ground while being allowed to settle but failed to seriously thraten. SUPER
CREATIVE dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. MIDNIGHT DADDY was forwardly early while racing three-wide and
tired.

SORORITY PARTY broke out to bump with GOIN SEVENTY FIVE, then was prominently placed while two-wide, rallied three-wide into the stretch and
finished fast to be up in the final strides. SOLO UN BESO bumped with GOIN SEVENTY FIVE at the start then dueled for the lead with DANCING IN CABO
from along the outside, disposed of that one after a half mile to open a clear lead and then just failed to last in a game effort. SAVITA was allowed to settle
early, came four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. MONEY IS TIME was reserved off the early pace while saved ground, slipped through during the
drive and finished well in a steady effort. MANY MEMORIES settled in the middle of the field early, came five-wide into the stretch and then went evenly
late. GORMLEY GAL settled early while racing three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. GOIN SEVENTY FIVE was
bumped from both side at the start then dropped back and failed to menace. DANCING IN CABO dueled for the lead for a half mile from along the inside
and then gave way.
