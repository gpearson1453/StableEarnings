PRINS FIRE rated the pace on the inside, briefly lost the lead midway on the far turn, regained command turning for home, edged away, drew clear under
urging and drifted out a bit while clear in deep stretch. IMAGINIZED stalked close up two wide, pulled his way along entering the backside, bid two wide on
the far turn, put a head in front, then dug in gamely through the stretch run but second best. GROUP TICKET broke in the air and was off slowly, then pulled
and steadied on the clubhouse turn, tracked inside, chased on the far turn and lacked a bid. BALANTYNE raced three wide early, stalked three wide, was
asked on the far turn and failed to respond.

CHANTICO vied three wide for command, dueled three wide on the turn, led into the stretch, responded when roused, pulled away, was ridden out and
coasted home late. PRINCESS OF OMAHA stalked two wide, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside, race a bit greenly passing
the furlong marker, then finished well to earn the place spot. MO COMPLEX vied inside for the lead, briefly shook free, dueled midway on the turn and dug
in gamely inside in the stretch run. LADY COLLECTED was off a bit slow and steadied, tracked on the inside, dropped back a bit, then rallied mildly on the
rail in the final furlong. SHADYSIDE was outrun early and did not factor. I'MWISHINGONASTAR vied between rivals for command, dueled on the turn and
tired.

Footnotes
COCO SHELL set the early pace on the inside, vied inside on the backside, dueled inside on the far turn, responded when asked, turned back a bid from
PORCH SWING, edged away, then held well under urging and drifted out a bit late. HOME SCHOOL raced off the pace on the inside, rallied on the rail in
the stretch run and finished well inside. PORCH SWING pulled in the early stages, then tracked between rivals, chased on the turn, rallied three wide at the
quarter pole, bid, was outkicked, then lost second. OLYMPIC ROMP vied three wide, then two wide on the backside, dueled between rivals on the far turn
and weakened. FINALIST stalked the leaders racing near the inside, then chased three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
THE BEARRISH ONE raced four wide early, settled off the pace between rivals, then stalked three wide, chased and tired. TEPEU raced five wide early,
stalked three or four wide, chased three wide on the far turn and faded.
