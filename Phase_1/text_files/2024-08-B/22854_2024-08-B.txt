Footnotes
MONSIEUR broke well, led across the finish line for the first time, was challenged by GALLOPING MAJOR heading into the clubhouse turn but rebuffed that
effort and assumed the lead turning down the backstretch, opened up with three of the rest in pursuit, held sway through the turn then responded to steady
handling in the stretch to win clear. SIX HOT GRANDS hopped at the break then lugged in, did not get into stride immediately as the rider tried to straighten
out, trailed early then made a forward move into contention down the backstretch, was three wide of the trio tracking behind MONSIEUR, moved to the
inside through the far turn, started to rally from the three-sixteenths pole and was gaining on the winner but could not get there in time. GALLOPING MAJOR
husted from the start, rushed up to join MONSIEUR on the lead through the first turn, ceded the lead and tracked a length or two behind that foe, was joined
on the inside by IM GUNNA and to the outside by SIX HOT GRANDS, raced between horses chasing MONSIEUR through the turn, swing to the three path
for the stretch run but was outfinished by the top pair. IM GUNNA was a bit keen from the start and into the first turn, advanced along the rail into contention
down the backstretch, kept to the inside on the last turn but was outkicked in the final furlong. WESTERN SIERRA hopped at the start, nearly losing the
rider, became hard to place, fought the rider and bolted through the first turn, dropped far behind the rest and was never a factor from that point..

OUTRAGEOUS broke well then tracked STEEL NERVES to the three furlong marker, went into a drive to put pressure on that foe through the last turn,
surged ahead at the top of the stretch and won going away as much the best in this one. STEEL NERVES was hustled for the lead and won the race to the
first bend, opened up on the field down the backstretch, got some pressure from OUTRAGEOUS on the last turn, was overtaken at the eighth pole but kept
on to hold the place. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT broke well but was caught three wide through the first turn, remained close to the quarter pole then struggled
to keep pace to the top two and did not menace late. PINEAPPLE CRUISE was close up for the first furlong, bolted on the clubhouse turn and dropped far
behind but kept to task and closed the margin in the late stages.

Footnotes
CASILLALATER broke in and made light contact with DADDYS NINA then was hustled forward, got the rail position and had BOBBY'S GENIE to contend
with through the first turn, went a length clear turning down the backstretch, held the rest at bay through the turn then responded when set down for the
stretch run and won clear under steady handling. DADDYS NINA got squeezed at the start, then was hard to place heading into the first turn, settled
mid-pack through the middle part of the race, then started a forward move with a quarter mile to run, finished with a strong rally but was unable to catch the
winner. BOBBY'S GENIE veered outward at the start, then was hustled to vie for the early lead, made the front to the outside of CASILLALATER, but went
very wide through the first turn, came back to settle into a stalking position just behind that foe down the backstretch, tried to go on when that rival opened
up in the stretch but was unable to match strides, finished evenly and held third. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA broke outward and made light contact with DADDYS
NINA, was mid-pack through the first turn then was ridden to get up with the leaders, struggled to keep up approaching the furlong marker and was
outkicked to the wire. BANDON BRIDGE was not asked for speed from the break and brought up the rear of the field into the clubhouse turn, was far behind
then lost more ground on the last turn, came on a bit late to get a head in front of ELECTRIC ELIZABETA and avoid finishing last. ELECTRIC ELIZABETA
raced three wide through the initial bend, dropped far behind the field and was never a threat.

Footnotes
EFFECTIVE GIG broke well and showed good early speed without being asked, chased LYING GHOST through the initial stages then pressed that rival in
tandem with BREXTON through the middle part of the trip, had that foe get first run passing the quarter pole, pulled even racing three wide at the top of the
stretch, dueled, then gained the advantage in the final yards under strong handling and held that stubborn foe at bay to the wire. BREXTON broke well and
was up with the early leaders racing between horses, was sent to press LYING GHOST in the stretch for the first time racing two wide with EFFECTIVE GIG
also pressing the issue to the inside, launched a bid from the quarter mile pole and took the lead before the stretch, met the challenge of that rival in the
stretch, dueled gamely to deep stretch but came up short. JERRY JEFF WALKER took a bump from COUNT ASHER at the break but otherwise broke well
and responded to urging by the rider to go forward, pulled towards the front then was taken under some restraint before going a furlong, tracked behind the
trio contesting the early pace, tipped out for the stretch run, finished well but was unable to catch the top pair. LYING GHOST veered out at the start but was
sent hard from the break and grabbed the early lead, set a pressured pace with BREXTON and EFFECTIVE GIG always close, drifted wide on the far turn
the first time around but got back on track without losing position, held on well to the furlong pole then weakened a bit in deep stretch. WALKING BOSS was
not asked for speed from the break and allowed to settle, raced near the back of the pack in tandem with COUNT ASHER, outfinished that rival but was well
beaten by the rest. COUNT ASHER broke inward and bumped JERRY JEFF WALKER after the break, lacked early speed but was under no pressure to do
so, raced near the rear of the field together with WALKING BOSS, let that one get away with three furlongs to run and trailed the rest of the way.

ROSES R BLUE was allowed to settle from the break, steadied behind MAGIC CHROME when that one jumped shadows and raced erratically on the far
turn the first time around, bided time then moved forward into contention down the backstretch the second time, responded when set down from the
five-sixteenths pole, finished well under a strong hand ride and was along in time. VULIN steadied after the start and was last away from the gate, chased
through the early going, got bothered by MAGIC CHROME passing the finish line the first time around, dropped back to last on the clubhouse turn, bided
time there for the next circuit of the course, launched a rally from the five-sixteenths marker kept to the inside through the last turn and made a bold rally in
the stretch to get up for the place. XTRAFINE XTINA broke sharply and went straight to the front, opened a clear lead then was restrained some going into
the far turn the first time, emerged with BETHEL RIDGE pressing to the outside, slipped away from that rival passing the five-sixteenths marker, put a little
distance on the field going through the far turn for the last time, weakened a bit passing the eighth pole and was outfinished in the final furlong. BETHEL
RIDGE chased XTRAFINE XTINA early, moved to press the issue a quarter mile in, ceded the pacesetting duties to that one while remaining a constant
close presence then dropped off the pace heading into the backstretch for the last time, re-bid on the far turn three wide and flattened out. MAGIC CHROME
veered out after the break forcing that one to steady, was pushed to forward position while lugging out down the backstretch, bobbled heading into the far
turn for the first time and was checked hard, losing momentum, continued to lug out passing the stands for the first time while alternating leads and ran
evenly the rest of the way still having trouble keeping a straight course.

Footnotes
PARK ROAD COWBOY got sandwiched at the start yet managed to seize the early lead, kept all foes at bay through all three turns and had something left
for the stretch run and held sway under steady handling. BIG STICK broke in and took the path of BUZZED BY TIGER forcing that one to take up and then
making contact with PARK ROAD COWBOY, chased the later for six furlongs then bid for the lead at the top of the stretch, battled gamely but could not get
by and just held on for the place. BUZZED BY A TIGER took up after the start as three other contestants came together after the break, tracked the
pacesetters up close from the inside, finished with some interest to gain the third spot. BESKAR chased three wide through three turn, made a run in the
final furlong but came up short. CORAZON DE LUCIA lacked any early speed, raced near the rear of the field and only beat one to the wire. FOYT broke
awkwardly to the outside and slammed into PARK ROAD COWBOY at the start, trailed well behind for most of running, made a brief bid on the far turn the
last time around but could not sustain the run.
