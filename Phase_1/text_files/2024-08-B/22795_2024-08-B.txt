Footnotes
COUSIN VICKIE was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch then made a rail bid around the final turn, split horses and bumped with MY
IDEA near the eighth pole but kept on and drew clear. MY IDEA was a little fractious in the gate prior to the start, tracked leaders to the final turn then
gained ground on the leader and was bumped by COUSIN VICKIE near the eighth pole but kept on to be second best. AURORA AUSTRALIS was hustled
between horses shortly after the start to take a clear lead to the top of the stretch and tired. SUGAR CANE GAL was unhurried around the first turn the
moved up from two wide down the backstretch but had traffic midway through the final turn and made a mild rebid in the stretch to improve her position.
GIGI'S LUV raced in the middle of the pack from three or four wide but failed to menace. DADDY'S CINDERELLA was a little fractious in the gate prior to
the start then raced off the pace from the inside to the final turn and gave way. GRAEME'S DEAL raced in the middle of the pack, pulled up near the eighth
pole and transported in the equine ambulance.

CLASSIC WARRIOR stalked the pace down the backstretch then made a rail bid around the final turn to drive past the leader at the three sixteenths pole
and won going away. BIG TAP BABY tracked the leader to midway down the backstretch then fell back to angle out to three wide at the half mile marker
and made a bid around the final turn but was no match for the winner. ST PIERRE was forwardly placed from two wide down the backstretch then fell back
on the final turn but made a rebid and was along for the show. BAD BRAD sprinted away to a clear lead through the final turn then was collared and tired.
DEE'S LEGS reared leaving the starting gate and trailed the field around the first turn then moved between horses to the five furlong marker and gave way
past the half mile marker.

HE GOTS TO GO saved ground around the first turn then raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, angled out to three wide at the three furlong
marker and circled the leaders, drove past to prevail. FREEDOM LASS raced off the pace from two wide to the top of the stretch then slipped up the rail in
the stretch drive to be a game second. CANDY FOR CARMEL raced in the middle of the pack from three wide through the final turn then angled out to five
wide for the late rally to be up for the show. NOW NOW MAN was allowed to settled near or at the back to the final turn then made a mild bid to the top of
the stretch and made a late bid going between horses at the sixteenth pole but was too late. PEPPER JACK was unhurried to the first turn then advanced
up the rail into the stretch but failed to menace. EZMOSH hopped at the start, roused to a pressured lead to the quarter pole then inched away but was
eclipsed at the eighth pole and weakened. BIG BROTHER raced near the back down the backstretch then made a looming four wide bid on the final turn to
be in contention near the eighth pole but failed to sustain the bid. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN pressed the pace from two wide to the quarter pole and
dropped back. GUITARTUITION PLZZ stalked the pace from three wide to midway through the final turn and retreated.

CAZADERO was forwardly placed on the inside, inherited the lead going into the stretch and drew clear while drifting out. BIG SCULLY reared as the gates
opened, saved ground through the turn and made a late run to be best of the rest. PUDDING showed no early speed to mid turn then moved up the rail to
make the late inside bid to be up for the show. UNBOWED sprinted away to a clear lead to the turn then lugged out and was outfinished. ROBO raced close
up to the pace from three wide in the early going, then fell back through the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. CLEAT raced off the pace to mid turn
and faded. CHI TOWN HUSTLER vied for the early lead then was forced out on the turn, shifted back to the four path in the stretch but was no a factor late.

in upper stretch to make a late run and won the nod for the place. HONDURAS PASSION rushed up to prompt the pace from the inside then split horses
near the eighth pole but was outfinished by outside closer. SHORT STACK broke well and went to the front to co-lead outside of UNO PEA to the eighth

was overtaken by the late closing rival and gave way. SHELLEY'S ROSE raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then dropped back on the
