upper stretch and gained ground in the lane while drifting mildly to get up for the win late. KIND KISMET pressed the pace on the outside early, came
around the bend in the three path and dueled while drifting out to the wire to narrowly miss. MIDNIGHT JOY dueled between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two path and chased on in late stretch. AUNT GWEN'S dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around
the turn and was outkicked in the lane. MOLLYS MIA raced off the pace up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the turn and made no
bid. UCANTGETWHATUWANT was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and was empty
in the lane. HOLY DAWN tracked the leaders between horses early, dropped back entering the turn, raced in the four path from there and continued to tire
in the stretch.

Footnotes
WITHHERBOOTSON bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to kick clear. ANA raced in the two path
early, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and kept on to the wire. YODA GLITZ saved ground
around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and
improved position late. STARLET COLE saved ground around the first bend, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second
turn and was caught in the final furlong but chased the winner home from there. DELUSIONAL DREAM raced at the back of the pack in the three path
through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the three path and made up some ground in the lane while never threatening. MISS GOLD
bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced in the two path early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
far turn and weakened in the stretch. LAUGHINTOTHEBANK saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the second bend and made no bid. NOBLE TESS stumbled leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace
on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
ELEGANCE N TONIC was away from the gate slowly, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to get up for the win. KOOKYBERRY saved
ground early, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the second turn and into the lane and was caught late.
FACTOR THAT dueled on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and continued to battle in the
stretch, giving way late. MIGHTY MADI raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and improved position in the stretch. ON SPEED DIAL raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and finished evenly. DROPPED COLD saved
ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and tired in the lane.
STRABELLA raced in the two path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and
faded in the stretch. BLUES CROSS raced in the two path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, dropped back further while racing in the two path
around the far turn and was never a factor.
