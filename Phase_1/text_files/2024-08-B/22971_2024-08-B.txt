Footnotes
DESTINO D'ORO leaned in at the start, laid off of the pace in the five path around the turn, launched a rally entering the lane, swept past the leaders in
upper stretch, opened up leaving the furlong grounds hook and was geared down through the final fifty yards. GOLDEN SUNSHINE was slow into stride and
allowed to settle well back, moved two wide and between horses nearing the turn, rated behind foes nearing the lane, tipped out to the six path at the
quarter pole, rallied to gain place at the furlong grounds after the leader kicked away, then closed in on that wrapped-up foe late while second best. INDIGO
STUNNER tracked two wide, chased three wide and between horses while getting outkicked by an outer rival at the quarter pole, ran on after getting
outkicked again at the furlong grounds and edged show late. NO MO COOKIES pressed the leader from the three path, led briefly at the quarter pole before
offering no resistance to an outer challenge in upper stretch, gave way and lost show late. GROVE CITY SUNSET broke a beat slow, took closer order
between horses approaching the turn, tracked from midpack along the inside, chased two wide and between horses into upper stretch but lacked a bid.
UNMERITED FAVOR veered in at the start and spotted the rest multiple lengths in the aftermath, lagged behind in the three path around the turn, then
moved up between horses leaving the furlong grounds. BELLE MIA lacked speed while hung in the five to six path around the turn, drifted out to the nine
path entering the lane, then improved position without menacing. GO TOWN stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, but faded between
horses in upper stretch. REIGN CHAMPAGNE pursued from midpack in the four to six path and tired. WILL THEN stalked along the inside, but yielded
between horses entering the lane and weakened. WONDERLAND took very light contact from an outer rival upon leaving the gate, showed the way a path
off of the inside, got headed by an outer presser at the quarter pole and stopped. FUN TO RUN leaned in subtly at the start, lost position to outer rivals
approaching the turn, gave way along the inside around the bend and was outrun.

Footnotes
GO CAPTAIN strongly fought rider's restraint while opening up a clear advantage early on, widened his margin around the bend, then tired while hanging on
his left lead through the final furlong, but lasted. BEER RUN stalked along the inside, shifted outside of a counterpart and to the three path turning for home,
rebid for place along with an outer rival in midstretch, vied for place with that foe while closing in on the tiring leader late, and held place while running out of
ground. ROCKY JOY tracked two wide, shifted to the three, then four, path around the turn, bid for place along with an inner rival in midstretch, closed in on
the tiring leader while sparring for that position through the late stages but was denied place late. IT'S MY LIFE pursued from midpack in the three to four
path, ran on in the five path to bid for fourth along with an outer rival in the shadow of the wire, and prevailed. TRUST ISSUES laid off of the pace in the four
to five path, tipped to the six path entering the lane, ran on to bid for fourth along with an inner rival late, but missed. CAPE MAELSTROM stalked two wide,
gained place with a half mile to go, chased the clear leader into the lane, lost place to an outer pair at the furlong grounds and weakened late. ROCK N
ROLL BOLT broke a step slow while last away, trailed in the six path into the turn, shifted to the seven path into the lane and improved position.
TAPIT'STALEOFVERVE broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, tugged to advance two wide and between horses leaving the half mile pole,
but failed to sustain a bid and played no factor. PETCOFF lacked speed four to three wide into the turn, took light contact from an inner rival at the half mile
pole, then made little impact. SWEET AS SIN chased from midpack along the inside and faded. MOUNT KISCO broke a beat slow, lacked speed two wide
and between horses while getting rank into the turn, brushed an outer foe at the half mile pole before settling into stride, but was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
ARREST ME RED was lightly brushed by rivals on both sides at the start, led early on before bearing out to the five path into the turn, showed the way
tucking to the inside shortly after, braced for an outer pressing rival's challenge entering the lane, battled gamely through the final furlong and narrowly
prevailed. ONE TIMER brushed an inner foe upon leaving the gate, stalked outside of the top pair early on, got floated to the six path into the turn, sustained
pressure tucking to the four path around the bend, bid in the three path entering the lane, sparred through the final furlong but hung late and missed. LET
MY PEOPLE GO brushed an inner rival at the start, prompted outside of the pace setter before the rider was forced to take hold among foes when the
leader shifted across his path into the turn,, continued stalking pursuit from the two path turning for home, chased the dueling pair while bracing for a pair of
outer challenges for show in upper stretch, then gamely clung to that position through the late stages. SOSUA SUMMER brushed with an outer foe at the
off, tracked in the four to five path into the turn, pursued in the three path turning for home, bid for show along with an outer rival entering the lane, vied for
that position through the final furlong but was denied and saved fourth. MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE was brushed by an outer rival at the start, pursued from
midpack in the five to six path, turned for home in the four path, bid for show entering the lane, vied for that position but was denied late and missed fourth.
CALL ME FAST broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, bore out to the five path nearing the half mile pole, then lacked a bid. STILLETO
BOY tracked along the inside and gave way turning for home. FRONT RUN THE FED exchanged light contact with an outer foe leaving the gates, lacked
speed in the four to six path and made little impact. BOURBON HEIST traded a brush with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the five to seven path entering
the lane and got outrun.

Footnotes
LINZER showed the way in the four path into the turn, tucked to the inside showing the way turning for home, built a clear margin nearing the lane and held
sway thereafter. DANCING RINCA laid off of the pace in the six path around the turn, gained place from inner rivals in upper stretch, then chased the leader
home and held position. NORWICH laid off of the pace in the five path and between horses, vied for show between rivals through the final furlong and
prevailed. COMMITTEE OF ONE vied along the inside early on before backing off to track into the turn, lost position to outer rivals turning for home, altered
out to the seven path in midstretch, ran on willingly to vie for show, but missed. THOUGHTTHATCOUNTS raced forwardly along the inside, got subtly keen
two wide and between horses with nine sixteenths to go, offered a rail bid for show in midstretch, vied for that position late but missed. ELEGANT TRIP
broke slowly, lacked speed in the four path, shifted out to the eight path in upper stretch and improved position at the furlong grounds. MR. MELO vied
outside of the leader and in the five path into the turn, chased tucking behind that one nearing the lane and faded. ACCIDENT broke poorly, trailed along the
inside, then improved between horses late. NEWS AT NINE tracked in the eight path into the turn, applied mild pressure turning for home in the five path,
got outkicked for place in upper stretch and faded between horses. KING JULIEN raced forwardly in the seven path and between horses, bumped an inner
rival while prominent at the half mile pole, tracked from the four path turning for home and caved between horses. ROI SOLEIL chased in the three path and
between horses before fading. BAIE LONGUE raced forwardly in the six path and among foes into the turn, took contact from an outer rival at the half mile
pole, faded between foes entering the lane, then checked behind a rival in the late stages.

Footnotes
FLOODLITES prompted outside of the top pair and from the four path, vied leaving the quarter pole, gained an advantage in midstretch, drove clear and
held sway. HIT THAT REVIEW (IRE) stalked behind the leading trio and from the four to three path around the turn, tipped to the five path to take aim
entering the lane, gained place at the furlong grounds as the eventual winner kicked clear, then chased that one home to prove second best. ESMARK
lacked speed in the five to seven path around the turn, traded blows with an inner rival entering the lane, yet rallied willingly through midstretch, sustained a
late bid for show and reached that position at the wire. RESTORE (FR) showed the way inside of a pair of prompters around the turn, got headed by her
widest counterpart in midstretch, yielded and lost show late. ART FAIR stalked behind the leaders and from the three to two path around the turn, cut the
corner entering the lane, ran on two wide and between horses into the final furlong, bid for show along with an outer rival late, but missed between horses.
CROOKED BULLET laid off of the pace two wide, altered course outwardly in midstretch and improved position between horses. BEACH INVASION
pursued from midpack in the four path, shifted to the six path turning for home, exchanged bumps with an outer rival entering the lane and failed to factor.
KY DO DECLARE broke slowly, trailed in the three path into the turn and made little impact. PERFECT MAGIC vied for the lead in the three path and
between a pair of foes around the turn, but faded at the quarter pole and weakened. TURF CAT saved ground well back, but to no avail. GOLD FACTOR
tracked along the inside, saved ground and faded. FIRST NAVY JACK (IRE) pursued from midpack along the inside while held up behind a foe into the turn,
shifted to the three path turning for home and tired.

Footnotes
AGRA allowed to settle from the break, got good position and saved ground through the turn, angled out five wide into the stretch, rallied under strong
handling, wore down a pair of rivals to the inside and was up in the last jump. TOP GUN GIRL hustled to the front, got over to the rail when clear, saved
ground through the turn, finished well under steady handling and was just nailed at the wire. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES reserved mid-pack through the initial
stages, found room along the inside in the stretch, loomed a danger to the final bend but was outfinished in the late stages. OFF RAMP broke well but was
not asked to contend the early pace, tracked several lengths back while keeping to an inside path, bobbled repeatedly through the turn then responded
when set down in the stretch, finished willingly but was outkicked in the late stages. MAKEUP settled mid-pack through the early going, bided time three
wide through the turn, then finished well under strong handling but was not quite good enough. EXCELLENT QUESTION was slow to begin, spotting the
field a few lengths head start, got over to the rail, rushed up to join the field within a furlong, bided time to the stretch then finished well to split the field.
KENDAL GRACE hustled from the break and got good position then ceded the lead, stalked the pacesetter through the turn then tipped out to the two path
for the stretch run, had a mild response when set down but was outfinished in the final furlong. CURRENT CLIMATE lacked speed and raced at the rear of
the pack four wide, made a mild mid-race move to the stretch but did not sustain the run and was never a threat. FRANGO ELECTRICO broke with the
pack, raced near the rear through the early stages, dropped out of contention on the turn, fell well behind but kept to task and passed a couple of rivals late.
HYPERSPORT broke sharply and was pushed to vie for the early lead, raced close up two to three wide, loomed boldly under pressure at the top of the
stretch then tired. ALTERED SHOT broke well then raced with a quartet of stragglers at the back of the back, began to lose contact with the field on the turn
and was not a factor from that point. FIELD LASS raced forwardly four wide while under a steady drive from the start, bid for the lead at the top of the stretch
four wide, bobbled two or three times during the stretch run, was losing position and was eased in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PENNY'S SMILE was forwardly-positioned early stalking from outside and up close, raced mostly three to four wide edging a bit nearer midway through, bid
in upper stretch taking a narrow lead in mid-stretch, dueled through the lane before inching away late under steady handling. HI'IAKA quickly made the lead,
set the tempo near but just off the fence and shadowed by the eventual winner, was headed by that one in mid-stretch, dueled till late then yielded
grudgingly. LAURISTON (IRE) switched out off the rail early racing two to three wide, made a steady early advance to be within range stalking the leaders,
moved out five wide coming to the quarter pole, kept on to get the nod for show. SCARLET POPPY (IRE) broke awkwardly and in a bit tight, steadying at
the start, settled toward the rear about three to four wide, shifted in nearing the eighth pole, ran on but lost the nod for third. VINO FRIZZANTE was
well-positioned stalking from just off the leader and outside runners, was mostly six wide throughout, kept on evenly. ONE FRONT WAR settled outside at
the back, was four to six wide in the early going, swung out nine wide for the drive, ran on but needed more. BELLOFTHEBLUEGRASS was within range
stalking five wide and up close in the early going, weakened in the stretch. SANG broke a step slowly, lacked early speed unhurriedly bringing up the rear
off the inside, came eight wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit and passed tired rivals. FIFTH OF MAY tracked in behind the leaders not too far off in the
second flight and in the two to three path, weakened through the stretch. STAGE PRESENCE settled toward the back off the inside four to five wide early,
failed to rally. SEMANTICS angled in after the opening sixteenth, saved some ground early, came out in the stretch, was never near enough to threaten.
FAITHFUL STEPS was mid-pack early tracking inside, saved ground to no avail, dropped back and tired.

BELLUM JUSTUM (IRE) held up through the first turn, quickly moved into contention down the backstretch eager but well in hand, was up with the leaders
going into the last turn and raced in cover in the three path, took advantage of an opening to the inside at the head of the stretch, surged ahead when set
down then finished strong under a stiff drive and intermittent urging to prevail. CARSON'S RUN allowed to settle and was content to race near the rear
through the early going, kept to the inside going into the last turn, idled behind horses through that turn while full of run, got an opening along the rail in
upper stretch, rallied under steady handling but was unable to reel in the winner in a solid effort. ROTHSCHILD broke well and was always up close, stayed
with NAVY SEAL (IRE) when that foe tried to slip away on the last turn then got floated about six wide for the stretch run, was on the wrong lead for a while,
then dove to the inside for the final eighth, finished well under a drive and just missed the place. ABRUMAR broke well and dueled briefly with NAVY SEAL
(IRE) for the lead before dropping back to a stalking position, pressed that foe into quickening the a couple of times but was otherwise content with that spot
to the stretch, got first run on the field and took the lead in upper stretch but was unable to hold the top three at bay in the late stages. NAVY SEAL (IRE)
broke well and was intent in dictating the pace, got away with moderate fractions to the half while behind hounded by a pair of stalkers, quickened on the
downhill portion of the backstretch then went about four wide through the turn, responded when set down in upper stretch, battled gamely but weakened a
bit in the last sixteenth. STROMBERG (GB) was content to settle well behind the pace through the early running, followed the eventual winner into
contention from the downhill portion to the last turn, had to wait for room through the whole of the turn, was beaten to an opening at the top of the stretch,
found some room in mid-stretch, finished well but was not quite good enough. LAGYNOS broke well and settled mid-pack, lost a little ground with about six
furlongs to run but rallied back into contention coming out of the last turn, finished willingly but did not have the needed late kick. CAMEO PERFORMANCE
settled inside mid-pack after the break then moved a bit closer going to the uphill portion of the backstretch, became boxed in through the last turn then
came under a ride to keep pace, was unable to get clear at any point down the stretch and finished evenly. NOMOS lacked any speed and was last through
the early stages, swung about seven wide for the stretch run and was able to improve while never a threat. EL MATADOR raced mid-pack and about three
wide in the rear half of the field, tried to launch a rally going into the last turn but had the path blocked, opted not to go to the outside as the field turned into
the stretch, continued to race behind a wall of horses down the late and was unable to find a clear path. SEA THE THUNDER (GB) lagged at the rear of the
field through the early going, saved ground to no avail and was outrun in the late stages. CUGINO raced forwardly but four to five wide throughout, was
prominent to the last turn, came under a ride, struggled to keep up in the stretch and was not persevered with late when hopelessly beaten.

Footnotes
AG BULLET quickly made the front, set the pace inside on or just off the rail shadowed by a foe, drew off when asked then held safe late when taken in
hand nearing the wire. DONTLOOKBACKATALL tracked from inside in behind the eventual winner, came out a bit in upper stretch, was no match for the
winner but secured the place. OCEAN CLUB was in tight between at the start and shuffled back, unhurriedly brought up the rear from off the inside, shifted
in from three or four wide at the five-sixteenths to the rail at about the quarter pole, gained show honors rallying inside. BLING settled inside runners but off
the rail through the early stages, saved some ground near but just off the fence, came out four wide in the stretch, kicked on mildly and held the super while
no threat to the top ones. SECRET MONEY was in tight and squeezed back at the start, settled at the rear off the inside, moved out nine wide in the stretch,
was gaining well but too late. AUSSIE GIRL (IRE) broke a step slowly, moved forward a bit outside rivals early then advanced further while being guided out
five to eight wide late on the turn, evened out in the stretch. AWESOME TREAT pursued from outside four to five wide through the turn and wider in the
stretch, failed to rally. DANSE MACABRE chased from between runners three to four wide early, came out five to six wide at the top of the stretch, needed
more and made no bids. RUBY NELL was in tight and shuffled back early, switched out off the fence but racing inside a foe, was in tight and steadied near
the eighth pole, failed to rally. KAUFYMAKER broke outwardly, was forwardly-placed stalking just outside and off the eventual winner, faltered and faded in
the stretch. RED CARPET READY was up close stalking three to four wide in range, moved out seven deep leaving the turn, came up empty. ELM DRIVE
chased just briefly inside, dropped back abruptly after about the opening furlong, was eased up through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
WALKATHON broke well, vied with several for the early lead, then pulled ahead and dueled with EVVIE JETS through the turn, came into the stretch
confidently ridden, pulled ahead still under wraps the drew away when set down and easily held all at bay to the wire. SACRED WISH was hustled from the
break and vied inside for the early lead, backed off the pace on the downhill portion of the backstretch, tracked the dueling leaders through the turn while
holding the rail, had to wait for room while in hand, tipped out to the three path for the stretch run, responded when asked to go on, proved no match for the
winner but ran on well under strong handling to win the race for second. EVVIE JETS broke well, dueled to the outside of WALKATHON to mid-stretch then
weakened and was passed for second when unable to keep up with that one late. SPARKLE BLUE tracked mid-pack, made a mid-race move to save
ground and get into a contending position through the turn, waited for room, then got a clear run up the rail and finished well under steady handling. FLUFFY
SOCKS broke behind the field then was pushed on some to regain contact with the rest, saved ground through the turn, was put into a three wide drive late
but was unable to make an impact. NADETTE (FR) was last away from the gate and allowed to settle, trailed the field up the hill, was still last turning for
home, was kept to task and managed to improve position late. TURNERLOOSE lagged at the back of the field, swung six wide into the stretch, finished well
under strong handling, got floated out another two paths late in the stretch run but did improve some in the end. SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) tracked a few
lengths behind the pace racing in the three path, maintained position through the turn then tipped out to the four path for the stretch run, raced on the left
lead, lost position and was not a factor late. MOUFFY tracked inside while racing in the middle of the pack, responded when set down at the head of the
stretch but lacked a winning rally and finished evenly. MISSION OF JOY caught four wide, made a mild bid into the stretch but weakened before the furlong
grounds. IMPLICATED tracked the pace from close up in the two path, had every chance turning for home but had nothing to offer in the stretch. REGAL
REALM raced close up but three to four wide, launched a bid on the turn, loomed a threat to mid-stretch, then stopped and was galloped across the finish
line.

Footnotes
FOR LOVE AND HONOR settled outside a foe off the pace, moved out five wide in the early going, swept past outside rivals to take the lead in the vicinity
of the quarter pole, drifted in while drawing clear, held safe. BIRDWATCHING tracked inside mid-pack saving ground, came out near the eighth pole, was
gaining but too late. ON COMMAND was quick to lead, set the pace inside, had no extra for the stretch run. SILVER MOONLIGHT stalked in behind up
close two to three wide, moved out five wide near the three-eighths, drifted out a bit in the lane, needed more. SCENIC BEAUTY exchanged a very light
bump at the start, settled at the back, saved some ground, angled nine wide coming into upper stretch then shifted in a bit through the stretch while passing
rivals, ran on. RASHMI exchanged minor contact at the start, chased from mid-pack three to four wide, was ridden along three furlongs out, moved out
seven wide for the stretch run, went evenly and made no bid. BAH HUMBUG made a swift early advance three to four wide shadowing the pacesetter,
flattened out in the lane. PLOY tracked up close from inside saving ground, came off the rail about the five-sixteenths, faded in the stretch. TIME FOR
MAGIC saved ground but failed to menace. OUR FINEST HOUR (FR) lacked early speed racing off the inside, was never near enough to threaten.
WHAPPEN was always toward the rear and never a factor. ESTUARY chased four to five wide early, tired.
