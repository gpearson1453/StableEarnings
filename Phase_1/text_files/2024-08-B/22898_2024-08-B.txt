Footnotes
SWEET BABY RAY tracked the pace while saving ground to upper stretch surging late in the two path getting up abreast rival. TEAM FEISTY away alertly
set a clear pace widening on the far turn digging in near the rail down the lane being grabbed from the outside on the wire. RIBBONS AND LACE lost irons
entering the first turn regaining into the backside chasing to upper stretch angling to the three path late. MS HAYLEY raced evenly well off a trio of foes to
upper stretch holding the others at bay there. WHATS GOIN ON slow early would play no factor. CARIBBEAN NIGHT was never involved. FIRST
IMPRESSION was always outrun. JEFF'S ANGEL showed little. UNMATCHED leapt in the air as the gate opened.
