RED LINE OVERDRIVE with leader to the half, drew off when ready, much the best. CENTAURO good position to far turn, rallied on while no match for
winner. MO BETTA no speed throughout, rallied on from far turn for show spot. FORT LOWELL never factored throughout and only improved position late.
ROYAL DECADENCE unhurried early and passed tired ones in the stretch run. POGOERIACH good position outside to the stretch, weakened in the late
going. MONJE SOLAIA tried to keep up to the half with nothing left and faded back. MYTHOMANIA never factored throughout. FIRE WIRE never a factor.
JEST ABOVE failed to menace throughout. RAMBLIN CHROME inside speed to the half, gave in readily and folded readily. LET IT RIDE CLYDE never
menaced while far back at a poles.
