SEXY DEXY set a pressured pace to the turn, drew clear and held safely while kept to task. SILVERBULLITBADGER pressed the pace along the inside,
was taken back and angled out on the turn, bid willingly, couldn't gain ground and finished second best. ANOTHERFORBROOKS rallied inside on the turn,
swung wide in the upper stretch, bid and came up empty. MY DAD IS THIRSTY stalked the pace towards the outside to the turn and flattened out.
CLAVICHORD broke slowly, angled out into the turn, swung wide into the stretch, angled in and lacked a rally. LET THERE BE PEACE put in an even effort
in an inside trip and failed to threaten. BAROSSA showed speed to the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) raced close to the pace towards the outside, went ten wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and inched clear late. STORMY
DAME stalked the pace, challenged four across on the turn, dueled to deep stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. HALEY WHO raced close to the
pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, bid nine wide and got up for show under strong handling. I GET STORMED pressed the pace, challenged
three wide between horses on the turn, dueled to late stretch and was outclosed. LITTLE PINCH lagged early, raced wide, went eleven wide at the top of
the stretch and finished well. MAUI SUNRISE broke out, pressed the pace while racing in hand, challenged into the turn, bid, came up empty and was
transported off the track via an equine ambulance. WHAT A MEMORY was never far back, saved ground and failed to rally. HAUTE LADY was checked
hard at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. MIDNIGHT SUSI was not a factor. STAY BY THE BEACH was crowded at the start, set a pressured
pace to the turn and stopped. HOT LIL MESS showed little in a wide trip.
