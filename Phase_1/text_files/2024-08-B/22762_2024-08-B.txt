KAYLA stalked the pace around the first turn and continued to track the top pair up the backstretch, edged a bit closer three wide late on the turn, given cue
four paths wide in upper stretch, responded willingly and kicked clear. SASSY AIN'T I settled around the first turn and continued unhurried while saving
ground up the backstretch, came under a ride late on the final turn, tipped two to three wide for the drive and gained place. BAYLEYWICK dueled inside of
BYE LOVE GOTTA GO around the first turn and battled on around the far turn, shook free at the head of the lane, continued to put in a good effort then got
overtaken by the winner in late stretch and gave way grundgingly. REBEL RISING rated off the top trio racing three wide up the backstretch, rode the rail
around the far turn, given cue along the inside at the head of the lane, moved up in striking distance near the furlong marker then flattened out. BYE LOVE
GOTTA GO vied outside of BAYLEYWICK around the first turn and continued to battle around the final turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane

MORE THAN A DIVA sprinted to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch,
remained clear a furlong out then held late over fast gaining runner up. CHIP SHORTAGE tracked the pace up the backstretch and around the turn,
launched a three wide bid in upper stretch and closed gamely on the winner. MY CAJUN LADY was forwardly placed racing just off the leader in the
opening quarter, made a move for MORE THAN A DIVA around the turn, could not reach rival but sustained a steady bid in the lane then evened out late.
CAN'T WANT THAT tracked the top trio through early stages, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and needed more for late impact. MOR FOXY
raced in the back and saved ground, failed to respond when called upon entering the lane and never threatened.

MISCHIEVOUS BRIA was away in good order and was forwardly placed sitting just off the top pair, let out a notch and moved up into striking range late on
the turn, took over the lead in upper stretch, shook the reins and few times and pulled away in hand. FINLOND broke on top and crossed over to race two
wide, quickly became engaged by inside running ANNIETIME, continued to duel for the lead holding a slight edge, shook off rival upper stretch then got
overtaken by the winner, ran on and finished clearly second best. ANNIETIME moved up the inside and engaged FINLOND for the early lead, continued to
duel around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane, weakened off the top pair and just lasted for show. FOXTON raced off the early pace,
hustled up three wide around the turn, ran on into the lane and just missed capturing a share. LIL FRIEND chased the clear top trio in opening stages, raced
two wide around the turn and never threatened. PROMISED OATH raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and never menaced. MISS
MARY raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
LONG MAY SHE RUN dueled for the lead up the backstretch, took on the challenge of BREAKFASTRUN entering the turn, battled past the quarter pole
then shook free at the head of the lane and pulled away. BREAKFASTRUN pressed the top pair racing three wide, vied with LONG MAY SHE RUN around
the turn, was no match for rival at the head of the lane but ran on and secured second best. I GOT A NAME rated off the compact top flight in early stages,
hustled along two wide into upper stretch and gained show. COMFORTS JAZEL raced off the early pace, hustled up into the lane, gained position but
needed more for late impact. MRS. SPEAKER raced off the embattled top flight, swung four wide into upper stretch and never menaced. CAN'T MAKE ME
was forwardly placed racing just off the early leaders, raced in striking distance around the turn then tired in the drive. HIGH CALIBER CATCH vied for the
lead up the backstretch, could not sustain bid past the midway point around the turn and steadily faded. BLAME NELLIE raced in the back and had no
response when called upon.

Footnotes
SEVENTEEN BLACK was forwardly placed around the first turn and sat in striking distance of the top pair up the backstretch, vied for the lead then shook
clear approaching the quarter pole, came two wide into upper stretch, took on the challenge of outside running ZATARA, held aa slim lead, dug in gamely
under firm right handed pressure and refused to let rival reach equal terms. ZATARA was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried in early
stages, steadily picked up the pace midway up the backstretch and moved into close contention late on the final turn, raced three wide into upper stretch,
dug in racing in striking distance of SEVENTEEN BLACK, dug in gamely but could not reach the winner and settled for clearly second best. IRISH RANSOM
rated off the top flight up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and secured a share. FIRE BRYAN vied for the lead
around the first turn, continued to battle up the backstretch and into the far turn, could not match with the winner nearing the quarter pole, ran on into upper
stretch then gave way in the final furlong. I'M AN OAK raced in the back, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and never threatened. WICKED
PRINCE dueled for the lead around the first turn and up the backstretch then came up empty in the final turn.
