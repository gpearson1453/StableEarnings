Footnotes
CAJUN HOPE stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and kicked clear in the stretch. MAGNET AND
STEEL chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and kept on to the finish. DIVE DEEP raced off the pace
early, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid entering the stretch and improved position from there. ASTRONAUT OSCAR raced in the middle of
the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly. HIT THE SEAM tracked the leaders between horses through the
opening quarter, came around the bend in the four path and weakened in the stretch. HEAD FOR BUSINESS dueled on the outside through the early going,
continued around the turn in the two path and faded in the lane. SERENDIP RULER dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend
and tired in the stretch. BOSS NINE stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and was
never a factor.
