Footnotes
LITTLE MO broke a step slow, pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped off the rail into the turn, swung four wide to launch a rally at the quarter pole,
ranged up to the leader at the furlong grounds and drove clear. OKLAHOMA LOGIC led from an outer prompter early on, built a clear margin into the turn,
but was collared by an outer bidder in midstretch and was second best. MISS TIFEYE tracked three wide, chased the clear leader around the turn, got
outkicked by an outer rival for place entering upper stretch then saved show late. TEGWAR steadied at the start, lacked speed in the four to five path before
shifting to the six path nearing the lane, then ran on willingly outside of rivals to miss reaching show at the wire. VERY UNLIKELY pursued from off of the
pace four wide into the turn, tucked down the two path around the turn, moved out to the five path in the final furlong and moved up. LITTLE BIT O STORM
broke a beat slow, lacked speed in the two to three path into the turn, advanced turning for home, claimed fourth passing the furlong grounds but flattened
out. ARE YOU A SPY snagged the inner stall door whlie spotting the rest multiple lengths at the start, trailed along the inside, came into the lane in the three
path and improved position. MELITTLEFROSTGIRL stalked two wide and between horses, came under urging to chase the clear leader at the three furlong
pole, but failed to sustain a bid and faltered in upper stretch. MY CHERRY PIE tracked along the inside, chased nearing the lane and weakened. MERCY
OTIS lacked speed along the inside and tired. HONEYBEEBOBBIE vied two wide early on, but bore out into the turn, continued to lug while bolting to the
outer fence nearing the lane, and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
MO RUM leaned out at the start, tracked four wide and outside of rivals, ranged up to bid outside of the leader and in the three path at the three furlong
pole, led narrowly as an outer bidder joined the fray turning for home, inched away from that one at the furlong grounds and drove clear. MO EL GRANDE
was brushed by an outer rival at the start, stalked forwardly three wide and between horses, got outmoved by an outer counterpart into the turn before
chasing the top pair under steady urging around the bend, yet sustained stride to stay on between horses in the final furlong and claimed place from an
outer rival in the closing stages. DU MONDE pursued from midpack early on, advanced four wide and outside of rivals into the turn, bid outside of the top
pair and from the four path at the five sixteenths pole, vied into the turn, but was turned away at the furlong grounds, yielded and lost place late.
ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT broke a step slow and brushed an inner rival at the start, rushed forward between horse to reach the front shortly after, set a
pressured pace into the turn, got headed by a pair of outer rivals at the quarter pole and gradually gave way. WICKED MELODY trailed along the inside and
moved up. MACHO VILLA laid off of the pace in the five to three path into the turn, shfited out to the five path in upper stretch but lacked a rally. GOOD
NEWS ROCKET tracked two wide, but faded four wide turning for home. CRABTREE stalked along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
REGAL REY set the pace inside of a prompting rival into the turn, drew clear entering the lane and held sway. GOOD LIKE MAGIC was brushed and floated
outwardly by an inner foe at the start, prompted two wide and outside of the eventual winner around the turn, failed to sustain pressure entering the lane, yet
firmly held place from pursuers on either side. EL QUESO GRANDE stalked along the inside, shifted out to the five path entering upper stretch, leaned into
an outer rival while running on into the final furlong, vied for show with an inner foe while chasing place in the final sixteenth and held that position.
DAZZLEMESILVER broke a step slow, trailed in the two path, sustained pursuit along the rail to vie for show through the final furlong, but was denied. JOE
THE TAILOR tracked two wide and between horses, got floated to the six path by an inner rival in upper stretch, took light contact from that foe while vying
for show into the final furlong, but yielded. TRUE JEDI broke out multiple paths, brushed an outer rival while carrying that foe wider in the process, tracked
three wide, but faded in the five path with a quarter mile to go and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
PRETTY SURE laid off of the pace in the four path, ranged up in the five path and outside of the leading trio turning for home, bid entering the lane and
drove clear. NANA GRACE brushed an outer rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, chased behind the leaders nearing the lane, then
stayed on to edge place from an outer rival leaving the sixteenth pole. SHIRLEY ANN prompted two wide, vied in the three path and between horses around
the turn, led narrowly at the quarter pole before meeting an outer challenge entering the lane, proved no match for that one in upper stretch, lost place
passing the sixteenth pole and lasted for show late. ANNA'S PROMISE broke a step slow, lacked speed in teh four path into the turn, advanced turning for
home, tucked to two path entering the lane before shifting back out leaving the furlong grounds and ran on willingly to miss show late. CONTEMPLATE set a
pressured pace along the inside, led narrowly from a pair of outer prompters around the turn, got headed at the quarter pole and faded. TEMPERS FLY
stalked forwardly placed three wide and among foes, but faded. GEEZ ELOISE broke a step slow, lacked speed two wide, shifted out to the six path into
upper stretch and moved up. FORMAGGIO stalked four wide, moved to press the top pair from the four path into the turn, but gave way between horses
reaching the lane. SWEET SIB took back when an outer rival shifted across her path soon after the start, trailed along the inside into the turn and made little
impact. MELLY'S BIRKIN took light contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. SECURED broke a
beat slow, tracked along the inside and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
FLASHY LASS tracked along the inside, advanced two wide and between horses nearing the lane, took aim outside of the leader and from the four path in
upper stretch, ranged up to bid along with an outer rival in the final furlong, drifted out vying between horses at the sixteenth pole, bumped her outer
counterpart through the closing stages and narrowly prevailed. BOW DRAW showed the way two wide, shook clear with a quarter mile to go, drifted out
while getting collared by an outer pair of bidders in the final furlong, sparred with them through the closing stages but missed. EVERLAND laid off of the
pace in the two path, advanced swinging five to six wide into the lane, sustained grinding progress to bid along with an inner rival in the final furlong, but was
herded out by that foe while vying into the final sixteenth, took contact through the late stages and hung. CAT'S CAVE pressed three wide before stalking
down the backstretch, got outkicked between horses entering upper stretch and yielded. PENS STREET trailed along the inside, moved out of last before
entering the lane in the four path, shifted wider in midstretch and improved position. SULTRY LASS tracked two wide and between horses, chased into the
far turn and faded at the quarter pole. PEACOCK LASS prompted inside of the leader, sustained pressure around the far turn, but gave way at the quarter
pole. HONEY DIJON laid off of the pace four wide but was through reaching the quarter pole. THE RIDER OF EVERLAND CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
FLASHY LASS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE OBJECTION AND DISQUALIFED FLASHY LASS

Footnotes
LADY KATHRYN showed the way in the two path, built a clear margin at the quarter pole and held sway safely under a drive. CANDY MINE broke a step
slow at the start, laid well back along the inside early on, gained ground in the six path turning for home, then sustained her rally to reach place in the
shadow of the wire. MY LIL PUNKY pursued from midpack five wide, advanced turning for home to gain place entering the lane, took aim outside of the
leader in upper stretch, but was fended off before flattening out in the final sixteenth and lost place at the wire. GIRL MATH was forwardly placed two wide
and between horses, chased after tucking to the inside with five sixteenths to go, then ran on evenly for a minor share. ALEDEAN tracked three wide and
between horses, chased into the lane and lacked a bid. ELECTRIFYING LADY stalked four wide, crept closer to bid for place along with an outer foe at the
quarter pole, but got outkicked by that one entering the lane and yielded between horses. JOYFUL JOSEPHINE bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued
while hung in the six path around the turn and failed to menace. MO ICE FORTHE LADY brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear in the
three path, swung to the eight path into the lane and improved position. DON'T WORRY broke a step slow before subtly shying from an inner rival at the
start, trailed along the inside into the lane, then surpassed tired rivals. BABY LADY took contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from off of the pace
in the three path and failed to factor. SCRIBBLE laid close up along the inside, but gave way leaving the seven sixteenths pole and faltered. CITY OF
SECRETS brushed with an outer rival at the start, pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, but faltered between horses at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING MYQUEEN stalked the clear leader from the three path, gradually closed in to bid at the sixteenth pole, inched ahead leaving that station and
held from a late outer bidder. CRANK IT UP pursued from midpack in the three path, shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied while hanging on her left lead
in hopes of bidding approaching the wire, but was fended off. PROUD DIVI bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, ran on willingly into
the final furlong, regained show while getting outkicked at the sixteenth pole and held that position. MONTEGO BAY bumped an outer rival at the start, laid
off of the pace three wide, then ran on willingly but needed more to reach show. MATERIAL WITNESS quickly sped clear early on, showed the way in the
two path around the turn, but was caught by an outer challenger at the sixteenth pole and weakened between horses. ELHUBOOB tracked in the two path
and gave way. QUEEN CLANCY took contact from an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the four to five path and moved up. VIBE CHECK broke a step
slow before being put to subtly tight quarters between horses at the start, lacked speed in the three to four path and failed to factor between horses.
WATERSEEKER broke a step slow, trailed in the three path and made little impact. STARCOURT broke a step slow, laid off of the pace two wide and
among rivals and never got involved. SHORE WAR saved ground off of the pace, got shuffled behind a tiring rival nearing the lane, remained blocked while
steadying behind that one through upper stretch and failed to recover. SAME OLD FEARS was bumped by an outer rival at the start, saved ground pursuing
in midpack, but gave way turning for home and faltered.

Footnotes
AK SAR BEN DERBY tracked two wide and between horses, bid four deep nearing the lane, dueled with an inner rival in the final furlong and prevailed.
HALF DOME (IRE) pressed two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, sparred with an outer bidder through the final furlong but was bested. WARP
NINE showed the way along the inside, vied with an outer pair around the far turn, got headed as a wider rival bid at the quarter pole, yet kept on tor a minor
share. OSCARWORTHY stalked three wide, bid into the far turn, vied turning for home before an outer rival joined the fray at the quarter pole, and yielded in
upper stretch. TENNESSEE LAMB pursued from the three path, then between horses into the lane and lacked a bid. MONEY MEMOLO broke a step slow,
lacked speed in the two to four path and failed to factor. SWEET FREEDOM stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded. MARK UR
WAY saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. RETURNED broke a step slow, tugged forward four wide around the first turn to track outside of foes
down the backstretch, but drifted to the six path pursuing around the far turn, weakened turning for home and was eased through the lane. D'ORO LEMON
trailed along the inside and got outrun.
