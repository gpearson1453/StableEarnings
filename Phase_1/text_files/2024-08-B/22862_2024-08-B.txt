RISADITA vied inside for the lead, took charge at the quarter pole, drew clear and held well under urging. ALAS DORADAS stalked outside a rival, chased
on the turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied outside and closed the gap late. LIPOCHROME raced off the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch and
rallied mildly in the two path. ALANI raced off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and closed belatedly. PARK AVENUE BETTY tracked on the inside,
chased inside on the turn, lacked a bid and weakened. NICKYS NOTION vied between rivals for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. MY DREAM COME
TRUE was shuffled back a bit at the start, raced off the pace and did not factor. EXPECTATIONS MET vied three wide for the lead, dueled on the turn,
drifted a bid wide in upper stretch and faded.
