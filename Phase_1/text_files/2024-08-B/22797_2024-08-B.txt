FAST MOTION vied briefly outside, shook loose into the far turn then stayed safe to the finish under moderate urging. AMY MULE lagged far behind, moved
very wide into the stretch rallying to gain place. ONE OF THE ONES vied with winner inside opening quarter then weakened. SUNDRIA broke sluggishly,
rushed to contention, came out stretch in the stretch crowding rival. WILDCAT GIRL flashed speed outside to the far turn and faltered. BROOKLYN
HEIGHTS dropped back on the turn, was crowded and steadied while tiring in the stretch. Following a stewards inquiry and objection by the sixth finisher
against the fourth finisher for interference in the stretch, SUNDRIA was disqualified and placed last.

JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA broke a step slowly, rushed up outside, bid on the turn then drew off through the final furlong. MISS ALEX lacked speed then
finished well to be clearly second best. GORMLEY GIRL dropped off the pace, faded on the turn then offered some late energy. BOHEMIA BABE prompted
the pace inside to the quarter pole and faltered. CLOUDY TIMES earned a narrow lead in the opening half, lost her action in the final sixteenth, was eased
and bobbled late. BELLA MARIA dropped far behind and trailed throughout.

MELODY'S KISS outrun early, advanced wide, split foes at the top of the stretch, bid clear in the final furlong. LIL' LATE LUCK rated off the pace, rallied on
the turn, led in midstretch and finished willingly. KHOZY COLBY raced in closest pursuit of the leader, tried to bear out in the stretch. BRUNO BARBER
GIRL chased within striking range for half a mile and faltered. FANCY SCEPTER broke alertly then was outrun, angled inside and was never a factor.
ONTHISHARVESTMOON sprinted clear for half a mile then gave way readily. SWEETEST MOMENT lacked speed and weakened steadily.

CARNIVORE rated close up outside, bid to the front midway on the turn then pulled away while kept to his task. FAST PAYDAY settled well behind, made a
strong wide bid on the final turn then proved no match for the winner. MAJOR CAM moved close up between rivals in hand, angled out on the final turn then
back in advancing in the stretch. I'M NOT A BABY reserved close up inside, moved wide into the stretch then flattened out. MISTER MOORE alternated for
the lead inside for five furlongs and gave way. STAFF SERGEANT hustled to narrow advantage in the two path then stopped in the stretch. STARSHIP
GOTHAM dropped back early and faded badly.

MUST BE LOVE outrun early, advanced into the stretch, swept past the pacesetters and pulled away. CAPITAL CONQUEST settled off the pace then
rallied inside to be second best. BARTLETT engaged in a heated duel inside to midstretch and weakened. TALKIN PHAROAH vied outside in rapid
fractions, led briefly in midstretch then tired. ONLYGODCANJUDGEME dropped far behind and was never in contention. MY DEVILS CHILD trailed for half
mile then caught pair of rivals while no menace. MASK PATROL raced three wide off the leaders and gave way.

MR. HUSTLE moved close up between rivals, bid into the stretch and drew away under mild drive. LAYTOWN prompted the pace outside, battled
throughout then came again for the place. TIME TO CRUISE bid outside on the final turn then flattened out late. ELOQUIST broke slowest, rallied into the
stretch then lacked closing kick. TUSKEGEE AIRMEN settled close up inside for five furlongs and faded. RICH'S WAY trailed for half mile, moved very wide
on the final turn and was no factor. ROCK ON LUKE set the pace for half mile then stopped abruptly losing contact with his field and was eased.

ROCKIN FREEBEE took over after opening quarter, drew clear, widened and remained safe driving. SECRET ALLIANCE rated close up, went after the
winner on the final turn and made a gradual late gain. DUDLEY DICKERSON forced the pace then rated back, saved ground and finished willingly. DIXIE'S
TWO STENTS settled off the leaders in the two path and lacked solid bid. UNCLE WATER FLOW dropped back early, raced wide throughout and was no
factor. RUNYONESQUE broke poorly, moved extremely wide into the stretch. JEEPER lacked speed between rivals and was never in contention.
WHISKEY PRIZE flashed speed initial quarter then faltered. WYNN GIANT moved closer before half a mile then retreated. FOREVER WICKED dropped
back early and was always outrun.
