on with the eventual winner and was rundown late. BIG AL'S VISION reserved off the early pacesetters, and lacked a closing response. BOSS MAN CAN
saved ground and failed to threaten. BRATTON chased outside and was outrun.

WHEN U KNOW U KNOW quickly went to the front, dueled inside CASSANO, continued to match strides nearing the stretch, and edged away late.
CASSANO pressured the early pace, dueled outside of WHEN U KNOW U KNO then gave way grudgingly late stretch. DESTIN TO BE GREAT rated well
off the early pacesetters, gained closer order and rallied late for show. MOON MULLINS some interest late. TIMMY DANCER trailed throughout. *The
Official Veterinarian reported MOON MULLINS as having bled.

PRANCE prompted the early pace while three wide, gained a slim advantage over JOY IN GRACE at the quarter pole, dug in midstretch, refusing to give up
the lead and held firm under a drive. JOY IN GRACE set the pace under a firm grip, dueled inside of PRANCE in the final turn, lost the advantage into the
lane, continued to battle between foes through the stretch, and just held on for second. MACHINA settled three to four wide, roused along the rail at the
quarter pole, rallied inside and was outfinished. JELLI trailed, and rallied belatedly. ARUNDEL CASTLE late mild bid. ORANGE THEORY stalked the early
pacesetters, swung four wide at the head of the lane, and failed to threaten in the drive.

LAST OF WAR attended the pace from between foes, shuffled back in the far turn, angled out four wide at the head of the stretch, moved up alongside
LAHUN and drew clear. LAHUN tracked the pacesetters five to six wide, fanned four-wide leaving the backstretch, gained the lead approaching the quarter
pole, and lacked the rally needed late. KISS ME HELLO attended the pace while four to five wide, lacked a response to a challenge from LAHUN and
flattened out. REMARKABLE ELI contested the early pace from the rail, and lacked a closing response. SAMURAI CHALLENGE chased and tired.
SPEEDY PIEDY showed little. SUNNY WAY outrun throughout.

WRIT IN STONE broke outward into IT'S A GOLD AFFAIR, chased three wide, swung four wide at the head of the lane, and won driving. ZIP IT WRIT
broke out leaving, pressed the pace while four to five wide, dueled outside of SEATTLE STING, and dug in late for place. SEATTLE STING set a pressured
pace while three wide, rallied inside and weakened late stretch. TANGO FOR THE SOUL jostled in traffic early, was four wide into the opening turn, and
rallied belatedly. BIZNESS ACCOUNT squeezed out leaving, chased three wide leaving the backstretch, and closed gradually late in the stretch. IT'S A
GOLD AFFAIR bothered away from the gate, and chased to no avail. ITALIAN GRIZ bumped leaving, showed early speed inside and gave way.
ASDEVOTED broke out into ITALIAN GRIZ, and was outrun. MAKALEI BEACH broke alertly, and lacked a bid. BUCK SPRINGS sat just off the pace while
three wide, was unable to keep pace with the field and retreated.

Footnotes
BLAZING SUN hurried away, stalked the pace while four wide, dueled outside of BURNING UP, and prevailed under a drive. MISS MCBRIDE was wide
leaving the chute, fanned five wide leaving the backstretch, launched an all-out bid outside in the stretch, and missed after a determined effort. DRAMATIC
FLAIR raced wide early, drove inside at the head of the lane, closed well and was along in time for show honours. BURNING UP set a pressured pace from
the two path, gained an advantage then showed signs of tiring at the head of the stretch, and gave way deep stretch. TENDER LOVE rallied belatedly.
STARMA pressed the early pace while three wide, and yielded in the stretch. MIAMI SOUVENIRS lacked a serious bid. SPOT ON JOLEE saved inside and
came up empty in the drive. MILITARY SASS broke alertly, tracked the pacesetters five wide, and wilted in the stretch. WICKED WIZZY showed little. ANN
was distanced.
