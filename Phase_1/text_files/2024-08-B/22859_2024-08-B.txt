Footnotes
SHES STEEL DREAMIN contested the lead between rivals throughout, held well in the drive and kept safe through the final furlong. GOLDIES CLAIM
dueled four and five wide outside rivals and could not get by the winner. P R COMIN IN HOT dueled from inside rivals while about the two or three path and
lacked a final closing run. MAY B BETTER saved ground through the turn, had her rider lose whip turning for home then was angled out in the drive to close
the gap but could not reach the top ones. DIAMONDSFORAYBRIE failed to mount a rally four wide.

moved clear under mild urging. ALWAYS A TIZ showed the move early speed to make the running about the two or three path, continued to upper stretch
then could not handle the winner the final furlong. RIGHT OF REFUSAL saved ground in the turn and moved up in the lane to best the others only.
FOOLISH INTENT stalked the leaders outside and failed to mount a rally. MAHOMEBRED followed the pace three or four wide and weakened through the

ITS A DEAL was on a disputed lead inside rivals through the opening half, edged clear in upper stretch and held safe through the lane under steady
handling. RANDOM AFFAIR settled back off the pace three wide, angled out nearing the lane to rally six wide, closed late and was up for the place in the
closing jump. CASH EXPRESS saved ground off the early pace, moved clear while angling three wide into the lane and rallied but missed the place. SHIP
BOSS contested the early lead about three wide then lacked a final closing run in the lane to lose position. MY BOAZ showed speed between foes early but
took back off the pace, remained three or four wide and lacked a final closing run. ROBERT WHO contested the early lead four wide and weakened in the
drive.
