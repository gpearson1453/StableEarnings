Footnotes
KNOW HOW (GB) settled in midfield between horses in the beginning, stalked outside in the third flight when starting to close the gap at the quarter pole,
loomed the main threat six wide at the top of the lane and wore down the leaders through the lane to take control in deep stretch. SWIRLING DANCER
prompted the pace three deep in the backstretch, seized control outside with five sixteenths from the finish line, dueled stubbornly between foes four wide
straightening out for home, ran on the wrong lead to the wire and gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards. HOT OMELET had a good position,
tracking the lead trio while in the four path down the backstretch, saved ground watching the front three on the rail in the turn, moved in to burst between the
front pair at the quarter pole, dueled inside runners while in the three path in the stretch drive, was outfinished in deep stretch and held for the show money
at the wire. CHROME'S ANGEL was unhurried at the start, seeing the field along the backside, started to mount a rally two wide by midturn, angled out
widest in the six path for the drive to the wire and found her best stride late to close in for a minor reward at the finish line. REMEMBERING RHODA
travelled on the rail ahead of only one rival down the backstretch in the early going, improved to be in mid-division on the fence by the half, kept pace with
the leaders through the bend and ran on willingly down the stretch in the two path. CASTLETON had a stalking role, five deep near the rear in the early
going, could not keep up with rivals on the turn to trail the field at the quarter pole and finished up mildly in the lane passing tired rivals. LOADED VIXEN had
a narrow margin lead on the rail down the backside, relinquished the top spot on the fence by midturn and had no more to offer, retreating on the fence in
upper stretch. RIFLING settled for wide near the rear down the back straight, made little impression travelling on the rail throughout the turn and could not
be a presence on the fence in the stretch running. DIAMOND CRUSH vied between runners along the backside, began to fade battling with the leaders on
both sides midway around the bend and emptied out in the four path turning for home.

Footnotes
FOXY DIVA had a rail trip ahead of only a couple of runners in the beginning, was shuffled back some on the fence at the half mile marker, improved
smartly, moving well inside at the three-eighths pole, shifted outside, three wide with to bid for the lead at the top of the lane and drew off when set down at
the furlong marker. TWO SIP SALLY had a stalking position in the third flight, kept pace, while waiting behind and between rivals on the final bend, finally
had clear run, four wide by mid-stretch and chased the winner in vain to the wire to easily best the rest. DREAMS AND SCHEMES settled four wide near the
back in the first turn, improved on the outside, three deep by the half, travelled five wide going around foes in the far turn and continued a good, sustained
rally in the seven path outside foes, full of run to the finish line to close in to be a clear third in the end. TAKE CHANCES trailed in the early stages, began to
pick up foes while nestled on the rail with four furlongs left to run, followed the winner on the fence in the final turn, was in range inside turning for home but
was caught late, losing the show money. BRAQUET stalked three wide close to the rear between rivals, made no headway down the backstretch, trailed the
field by the three furlong pole and rallied through the stretch in the four path, finishing up with good intent. LA PRINCESSA POLLY had a slim lead on the
rail into the first turn, tracked on the fence down the back straight, chased three wide with five sixteenths to go, angled out five wide for the drive but was
one paced to the wire. MOMUNNYFOR RO was in the mix three wide in the beginning, tracked outside along the backside, could not gain on the leaders
while four wide midway around the final bend and yielded when fanned six wide in upper stretch. VICTORIA ELIZABETH pressed in the two path between
runners, was loose on the lead into the back straight, gave way to a rival who made an early move for the lead at the half, regained a clear command on the
fence by the quarter pole but was engulfed by horses when weakening at the sixteenth pole. SUPER SICILY reared at the start, tossing her head just as the
gates opened up, trailed after the break, was rank while rushing up six wide around foes into the first turn, continued to be headstrong passing horses
outside in the backstretch to lead at the half, battled up front in the final bend but had nothing left by the time they straightening out for home and emptied
out in the four path by mid-stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE START OF #5 SUPER SICILY WAS DEEMED TO HAVE RECEIVED A FAIR
START AND THEREFORE NO CHANGE

Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD had an ideal trip, all alone watching the contesting pair when entering the back straight, started to reel in the duo that was battling up top
at the seven sixteenths pole, moved in menacingly by the quarter pole, was carried out by the leader in the ten path turning for home, brushed inside as well
in upper stretch, went on by easily by the furlong marker and was going away convincingly when crossing the finish line. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY had a
stalking role on the outside in the third flight for most of the race, began to go past foes on the inside in the two path straightening out for the drive and found
another gear when asked for more at the eighth pole to close in smartly late to get up at the wire for second place. FAST BOAT TO SKYE broke inwards at
the start, prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, put away the early speed foe to assume control at the quarter pole, was allowed to drift out,
angling nine wide at the top of the stretch, brushed the outside rival in upper stretch when giving away up front, then drifted in while urged left handed down
the lane and was caught in the final strides losing the place share at the wire. ANSELMO travelled in mid-pack with the field strung out down the
backstretch, could not match strides when beside the eventual winner on the inside at the seven sixteenths pole but did finish up determinedly between foes
battling for the place share in the lane but had to settle on the fringes in the end. MIGHTY SEA stalked in the third flight inside a rival in the early going,
made little progress when under a ride at the three furlong marker, shifted out to the three path for the stretch running but could not get involved.
ARGENTIUM was allowed to settle, trailing on the rail in the early stages, could not get into contention running around the final turn and passed a weary
early leader who was out of gas on the rail with a sixteenth left from home. CONFUSING was brushed when an outside foe was angling inwards on the
start, freewheeled on the front end into the first turn, continued to roll along with company outside down the backstretch, was hard used early and had
nothing left in the tank giving way up top by the quarter pole and cantered home on the fence in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ENCOURAGEACHOTHER broke just a bit awkwardly, settled at the back steadily advancing while gradually shifting in up the backstretch, saved ground
near the rail on the turn, bid inside foes but off the fence in late stretch taking the lead about a sixteenth out, moved clear and held. FRIENDS FOR LIFE
soon led, set the pace from off the rail, was challenged by the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in the stretch, fended off the outside rival but was outkicked by
the winner inside and just held place from a late-closing SECRET LOAD, who unhurriedly brought up the rear, raced near the rail into the turn, was given
mild encouragement while shifting out from the five-sixteenths, fanned ten wide into the stretch, gained steadily while widest but needed more. NEVER
SILENT was bumped lightly at the start, raced off the pace between foes in the second flight into the turn, moved out a bit late on that bend, altered outside
runners in upper stretch, kept on late. PRIMA settled outside off the leader, advanced outside four to five wide on the turn, evened out in deep stretch.
SHAMELESS AFFAIR was bumped into a rival then checked at the start, settled inside toward the rear, shifted seven wide turning into upper stretch, was in
a bit tight avoiding a rival soon after, ran on evenly. MIRAMICHI broke outwardly bumping a rival, was prominent stalking from outside, raced about three to
four wide on the turn making a bid coming to the quarter pole, could not put a head in front and faltered in the lane. TWISTED ROMANCE came in a bit at
the start, moved forward inside gaining position tracking the pace from inside, moved out off the rail leaving the turn, flattened out in the drive. WILDFIRE
was lightly bumped into a foe at the start, chased from between runners into the turn, ridden three furlongs out, faded. PEGGY raced off the pace and off the
inside part of the track, made no impact.

Footnotes
IRON PYRITE stalked in the third flight on the outside, started to make a move four wide midpoint around the bend getting into gear, shifted inwards to the
rail at the furlong pole, closing in with every stride and was going away for the victory in the final sixteenth of a mile. UNHEARD flanked the pacesetter
outside early on, moved in to seize control outside at the quarter pole, had no resistance for the winner in the final sixteenth and just held on to save the
place share at the finish line. SILENT PATSY settled between horses in mid-division along the backside, began to extend her stride three wide with two
furlongs from the prize, angled out with momentum in the eight path for the run to the wire and was reaching for more ground late to almost get up for the
runners up share at the finish line. NO LAYUPS assumed control inside runners down the backside, opened up mildly with seven sixteenths remaining, was
collared outside by the quarter pole, battled on until the furlong marker, began to shorten stride while not switching leads and held on for a minor role in the
end. SAVE THE DATE stalked outside a rival near the rear, began to commence a run five wide with a quarter mile to go, angled to be seven wide turning
for home and had good late energy in deep stretch. MADAM GWEN was situated four deep on the outside in mid-pack, offered a mild run four wide by
midturn, angled out widest in the ten path for the drive and finished up evenly down the lane to the wire. LAUGHING OUT LOUD was inside rivals, close to
the back of the pack down the backstretch, made no headway when between foes in the two path through the bend and could not reach contention in the
stretch run. LEGALLY CHARITABLE was bumped slightly on the outside to begin, settled on the fence near the rear, saved ground but had no movement
around the turn and had little to offer in the drive to the finish line. STORMY OCEAN leapt up at the start to trail down the back straight, was on hold behind
runners at the three-furlong marker, shifted out to the four path at the quarter pole but lacked a finish in the stretch running. PRINCESS O DENMARK
tracked while three deep along the backside, chased the front pair around the turn but to no avail and wilted in the four path in upper stretch. J M R SWEET
ESME broke in at the start, was quickly straightened out, coaxed for more to get a better position on the rail watching the top two by the half, could not
continue on while under a ride with three furlongs to go and backed away through the field midway on the turn.

Footnotes
FLORIBUNDA settled inside a foe well back, was off the fence up the backstretch, bided time into the far turn, fanned seven wide leaving that bend, rallied
furiously while drifting in a bit, struck the lead a sixteenth out and drove past under steady urging. GATHER settled about mid-pack two to three wide, came
out a bit turning for home while taking closer order, split foes in mid-stretch taking a narrow and brief lead, was no match for the winner. POETIC AMY was
taken back and shifted in settling outside the eventual winner toward the rear, began to advance on the far turn moving out from four to six wide on that
bend, kept on evenly in the stretch to secure show honors. I HAVE AN IDEA eased back off rivals moving in from five to three or four wide entering the first
turn and racing mid-pack, advanced on the far turn moving out from three to five wide, bid near the eighth pole but lacked the needed late kick. LOOKS
LUCKY TO ME stalked mostly three to four wide, was encouraged from the five-sixteenths, made the lead briefly at the top of the stretch but soon
weakened. SPIRIT BEAR broke a step slowly, tucked in at the rear racing unhurriedly, was off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. VILLI
OLENTO saved ground to no avail. KIKITSA quickly moved clear, set the pace near but just off the fence, was challenged late on the far turn, faltered and
faded. SOUPER COP was well-placed early stalking two to three wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
ANAM CARA stalked inside horses in the third flight early on, shifted to the three path at the three eighths marker to be in mid-pack, moved in closer four
wide by the quarter pole, gathered more speed in the seven path for the stretch drive and was full of run on the outside of rivals in the final furlong to edge
clear for the win at the finish line. ADDENDUM brushed the inside part of the gate to begin, recouped quickly to lead on the rail down the backstretch,
opened up midway through the turn, continue to fight on while clinging to the lead with many runners closing in on the outside at the top of the lane, dug in
but could not fend off the winner late but did show heart to stay on gamely to best the rest for the place share in the end. CRUMLIN BEAST was nestled on
the fence, tracking the lead duo, was ridden for more, edging closer on the rail with five sixteenths to go, shifted out to loom four wide entering the
straightaway but needed more late to pose a threat to the top two finishers at the line. HAY HAY PAULA had position on the rail, ahead of only one runner in
the backside, narrowed the margin on the leader taking the shortest way around on the turn, shifted just outside in the two path for the run to the wire and
finished up mildly to stay on for a minor share. KAVALA was outside foes near the rear in a stalking position, circled four wide around horses at the three
eighths marker, was floated out, widest in the ten path straightening for home, never gave in though and was running on end smartly at the finish line.
CRAFTY OAKS chased outside in the early stages of the race, was urged on but was losing ground to the frontrunner midpoint on the turn, was in the five
path battling for a piece of the prize turning for home and finished up willingly in the stretch. HELLO FRIENDS tracked the front duo three wide along the
backstretch, kept pace with the leaders still three wide through the turn, took closer order to be in range six wide at the top of the lane, having the eventual
winner on her outside in upper stretch, was checked mildly when losing her path and momentum at the sixteenth pole and could not recover to pose a threat
when crossing the finish line. LADY MOONSHINE travelled in mid-pack three deep down the backstretch, rallied between foes four wide midway around the
bend, was fanned out to be nine wide for the stretch run, switched back to the wrong lead at the sixteenth pole behind runners and was wrapped up late.
BRIDGE TO NOWHERE trailed in the early stages, rallied on the fence offering a mild spurt inside rivals in upper stretch, could not sustain the run through
the lane and stalled in the final sixteenth. GIZMO'S B F F settled in midfield between horses, could not quicken with others making a move three furlongs
out, retreated through the turn and could not be a factor in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
MAGIC MODIE pressed the pace on the rail in the beginning, poked her head in front on the fence with three furlongs to go, battled on the inside in upper
stretch and down the lane fought on gamely to prevail at the finish line in a hard fought victory. SHES A DARLING had a slim advantage on the outside at
the start, forced the issue, still outside throughout the turn, dueled outside the winner the entire stretch, never giving in but was denied at the wire.
BEAUMONT DRIVE was allowed to settle down the backstretch, ahead of only one runner, started to go past rivals three wide with five sixteenths to go,
moved smartly around foes five wide at the quarter and in the eight path closed in well down the lane late to be a clear third at the wire. BRIT tracked the
contesting pair of leaders while outside a rival in the early stages, battled for the show award in the four path turning for home, determinedly kept on coming
between horses late, surging in deep stretch to get up and be a fringe player in the end. DISGRUNTLEDPELICAN watched the engaged while on the rail
down the backstretch, continued to keep pace with the front two while inside in the turn, edged away for the third money in upper stretch, could not continue
the run late and weakened in the final seventy yards to lose a couple of placings in deep stretch. LADIES RUM was outside a rival in a stalking role in the
third flight down the backstretch and through the turn, shifted out to the seven path for the stretch running but failed to fire in the final furlong.
LOOKHOWPRETTY travelled on the fence in midfield in the back straight, could not make any headway while still on the rail around the turn, angled out to
the four path but continued to run one paced in the stretch. SLOANS SKY stalked on the rail in the third flight, under a vigorous ride kept even with the
leaders in the turn, had a chance in the two path for a small share at the top of the lane but levelled off in the last sixteenth. ANNIA CORNIFICIA F travelled
in the middle of the pack three deep in the backstretch, was situated inside a runner near the rear in the turn, shifted outside to the five path for the stretch
run and lacked a kick in the last furlong while on the rail. LANEY GRACE stalked outside a rival close the back of the pack, shifted out five wide at the
quarter pole, continued to go widest in the eight path turning for home but could not get involved while shifting back inwards in the stretch drive. CLASSIC
GLORY settled in the third group three deep along the backside, was scrubbed on, but was going the wrong way around the turn, angled out in the seven
path behind foes at the top of the stretch but could not offer a rally in the lane. SILVER LASSO trailed the field in the early stages and passed a tired runner
while travelling inside on the fence at the furlong pole. TIPSY'S EMPIRE broke a step slow, settled in mid-division in the two path between foes, made little
impression around the turn and gave way two wide at the furlong marker.
