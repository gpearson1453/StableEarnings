Footnotes
IT'S A FACTOR broke out, stepped to the front and showed the way early inside a pair of rivals, maintained command over CARDINAL SPIRIT through the
turn, shook free from that rival in upper stretch when asked right handed, then drew away under another tap of right handed encouragement and steady
handling. CARDINAL SPIRIT coaxed along to press the pace between rivals, dueled into the turn, kept the pressure on around the bend, fought in the four
path turning for home, could not kick on with the leader in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. TERRY'S SERVICE was off slow to begin, tracked
from off the rail, went five wide into the turn, gained while angling to the three path then came back out past the quarter pole, chased within range to the
furlong grounds but could not summon the needed late kick and got denied for second. GOODBYE NOW broke in a bit, chased from inside under coaxing,
lost ground on the turn, moved off the fence with a quarter mile remaining and faded in the lane. DADDYGAVEITTOME broke out, attended the pace
outside the top pair, dropped back on the turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
TIGERHON (FR) bobbled sharply at the start, moved to the inside trailing early, tipped out and split rivals approaching the quarter pole, chased two wide
into the lane, rallied while splitting the leaders midstretch and drew clear under hand urging. PLEASE FOCUS showed the way early with company
alongside, maintained command from the fence through the turn, led clear into the lane, challenged by the winner in midstretch and yielded late. SIGILOSO
saved ground near the back, stayed on the inside in the stretch run and rallied to edge REXFORD for third. REXFORD chased from inside, angled out into
the stretch and missed third. CANE CREEK ROAD popped the gate open, was backed out to be examined then reloaded, brushed with COULTHARD (IRE)
early, pressed the pace from between rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, chased after the leader two wide into the stretch, remained close into
the final furlong but weakened in the late stages. HARRY'S ONTHEFLY raced up close three deep, chased in the three path turning for home and
weakened. COULTHARD (IRE) brushed with inner rival and got crowded shortly after the start, raced outside a rival at the rear, moved out around the bend
and spun four wide into the stretch but failed to be a factor. STANDING O in range of the top trio from off the rail or outside a rival, took the turn two then
three wide, got floated out to the five path exiting the bend and lacked a response when called upon.

Footnotes
CANADA GATE raced up close three then two wide on the first turn, flanked the leader from outside in the middle stages, dueled past the five-sixteenths
pole, led three wide into the stretch, cleared with a furlong left to run and was kept busy to the line. MAGNIFY climbed early and moved inside trailing the
field, ridden along up the backstretch, entered the far turn in the two path, angled out and came five wide into the drive, finished well in the late stages and
passed ABITMISCHIEVOUS for second. ABITMISCHIEVOUS sent from the gate and took control early, moved to the inside, showed the way up the
backstretch feeling slight pressure from CANADA GATE, headed by that rival past the five-sixteenths pole, lost command entering the stretch, could not kick
on with the winner crossing the eighth pole and weakened in deep stretch. SEMPER INVICTUS stalked two then three wide on the first turn, remained off
the rail in the middle stages, pushed on three then four wide on the far turn and weakened down the lane. CONCORD BRIDGE had to steady off the heels
of the leader early on the clubhouse turn, stalked along the rail, lost ground under asking on the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SOPHISTRY away quickly to take control, set the pace along the rail into the turn, challenged by TIGER OF THE SEA at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled
into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, battled back and dug in the last sixteenth to edge ahead from the runner-up. TIGER OF THE SEA rub the gate
and broke a bit slow, ran up on heels of TEQUILAANDTHERAPY early then chased between past the half-mile pole, bid from outside at the five-sixteenths
pole and dueled to the stretch, put a head in front with a furlong remaining but got outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. TEQUILAANDTHERAPY gave
chase from off the rail then three deep early, moved into the two path around the bend, could not summon the needed rally but kept on for a clear third.
TWIRLING LIGHT off slow from outside, angled to the inside trailing early, got put in tight early on the bend, rounded the bend from the rail then in the two
path, found traffic in upper stretch, altered out into the clear and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. KITTY MARREN bumped with outer rival
early and dropped back off the pace, took the turn two then three wide and improved position. FLAMENGO'S QUEEN (IRE) broke a step slow, raced on the
inside out of range, cut the corner into the lane and lacked a rally. GIGI'S GIRL raced in range from inside early, was pushed on while saving ground around
the bend, cornered nicely into the lane and waekened. CELTICA traveled in mid-pack in the early stages, navigated the turn in the two path and prove no
menace. LUCKY NEA came in and bumped a rival early, raced off the rail towards the rear, drifted out early on the turn, trailed three wide into the drive and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
GYPSY LYNN showed good early speed along the inside to set the tone up the backstretch, patiently handled through the bend, given her cue entering the
lane, kicked away in upper stretch and was ridden out to the wire. CHOLLIMA bobbled in the beginning, chased off the pace off the inside, ran in to traffic a
quarter mile out, spun four wide into the lane, split foes entering deep stretch and gained second. DANCE KID lacked early speed, trailed to the turn,
hugged the rail to the stretch, offered a mild rally and edged MORNING ADDICTION for third. MORNING ADDICTION laid off the pace up the backstretch,
advanced four wide through the turn, could not find more in the final furlong and got edged for third. WHY BEHAVE forwardly placed between rivals then two
wide into the turn, was closest in pursuit through the bend and weakened down the lane. AWESOME TAYLOR traveled near the back on the inside, looked
to be on the move but lacked room on the turn and had to check at the quarter pole, tipped two wide late on the bend, steered out in upper stretch and kept
trying to the wire. SUGAR SUGAR chased out of striking distance to the turn, raced along the rail then in the two path before swinging out late on the bend
and failed to rally. REAL ME raced in range three deep, chased three wide to the stretch and weakened. SWEET TEMPEST broke well then stalked the
leader from between rivals, cut to the inside early on the turn, lost ground around the bend and tired.

DIVIN PROPOS (FR) stalked from inside then in the two path, raced keenly in hand early first time through the stretch, bid three deep at the quarter pole,
grabbed the lead entering the lane, cleared quickly at the top of the stretch and held well over the runner-up. OFFLEE NAUGHTY unhurried at the back and
moved inside, drew closer while easing out to the three path on the far turn, took aim at the winner with a furlong remaining but could not find the needed
late kick in deep stretch. OLD PAL tracked from inside then in the two path, remained a bit off the rail on the clubhouse turn, went three deep into the
second bend, gained while tipping outside the top trio on the far turn, had the rider lose his crop in upper stretch and flattened under hand urging. DEAN
MARTINI was off alertly and showed the way around the first turn from inside, relinquished the lead in the stretch first time around and stalked from inside,
brushed the rail past past the five-sixteenths pole, trailed the field at the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and passed tired rivals. MALTESE FALCON
(IRE) settled in the two path then moved inside, drew closer between rivals leaving the backstretch, ran into traffic past the quarter pole and lacked room at
the top of the lane, angled out into the clear and failed to menace. CALM SEA raced up close two then three wide early, bid outside the leader with three
furlongs remaining, fought between past the quarter pole, weakened in upper stretch and faded out of contention. FEARLESS SOLDIER broke out, rushed
up before being taken in hand, rounded the first turn three then four wide, was keen to go on and was allowed to go up and take the front first time through
the stretch, moved inside, challenged from outside at the three-eighths pole, fought inside rivals around that bend, lost command entering the lane and
weakened.

SHOT OF COURAGE dueled outside TELOS to the five-sixteenths pole, inched ahead a quarter mile out, cleared leaving the bend and held well under a
drive to the wire. MISCHELOF (CHI) settled three then two wide in the opening stages, moved closer in hand between rivals on the backstretch, got boxed
in on the far turn, finished willingly through the final furlong but could not reach the winner. HONDO CROUCH stalked the top pair four then three wide
around the clubhouse turn, traveled in the three path entering the far turn, spun four wide into the lane, followed within striking distance in the final furlong
but finished evenly late. DEMOTIVATE coaxed from the gate, tracked along the rail, pushed on around the far turn, moved out and went two to three wide
into the drive but could not rally. TELOS underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, dueled inside a rival in the two path then along the rail on the clubhouse
turn, lost command on the backstretch, fought back from the fence to the quarter pole, the weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
JACK KEROUAC stalked three deep around the clubhouse turn, raced outside a rival into the second bend, tipped out into the lane, challenged from outside
with a furlong left to run, fought alongside CIRCLEOFHCHAMPIONS and eventually wore down the runner-up to put a nose in front on the line.
CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS showed early speed between rivals into the first turn then prompted the pace from outside, headed the leader at the five-sixteenths
pole, took over and put RHINO away in upper stretch but was immediately confronted by JACK KEROUAC, resisted into the closing moments but got nailed
on the wire. FOXTROT HARRY brushed outer rival in the beginning, took a stalking position on the fence, coaxed along past the quarter pole, tipped off the
rail at the top of the lane, chased after the top pair through the final furlong but finished evenly late. BERT'S PROSPECT settled between while three deep
early then got crowded and lost positions approaching the clubhouse turn, angled to the rail, drew closer in the middle stages, cut the corner into the lane
and finished willingly to round out the superfecta. BEAR HUNT tracked three deep in the early going, remained three wide into the far turn, chased two wide
at the quarter pole, moved out in the drive and lacked a bid. JIMMY'S WILD BOY unhurried outside rivals then steered to the two path around the clubhouse
turn, moved inside on the far turn, ran into mild traffic near the quarter pole, angled out into the lane and failed to menace. OOBUBBAKAKAYO reared up
inside the gate, traveled next to the rail from off the pace, angled four wide on the far turn, drifted inward midstretch and failed to menace. RHINO set the
pace from inside with company alongside, headed by outer rival at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled to the top of the stretch, yielded outside the eighth pole
and faded in deep stretch. GET KRAKEN antsy in the gate, got brushed from inside at the start, pulled between rivals early then tracked in the two path,
raced out of range between rivals in the middle stages, got put in tight at the quarter pole and weakened. HARBOR THUNDER bobbled at the start, steered
to the inside racing at the back, saved ground through the far turn, was a bit rank in upper stretch and never got involved.
