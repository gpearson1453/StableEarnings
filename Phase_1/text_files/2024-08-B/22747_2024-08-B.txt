HOLDWHATYOUGOT set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and held under steady urging. HOLY HANK was crowded at the start, stalked
the pace, was in tight and exchanged bumps into the turn, went six wide entering the stretch, went willingly to the wire and couldn't get by the winner.
WANING CRECENT stalked the pace along the inside, was taken back on the turn, came again, finished well inside and gained late to earn show.
RUNAWAY VICTORY raced close to the pace towards the outside, went eight wide leaving the turn, fell back, angled in and closed well late. GIMME A
WHO broke in, stalked the pace, was in tight and exchanged bumps entering the turn, went seven wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late rally.
BE A PRO was slow early and improved position in a steady effort. AMERICAN KNIGHT broke in, saved ground, bid off the rail and lacked a response.
LIME CHILTON broke in and was steadied at the start, advanced inside to the turn, bid between horses and came up empty in the drive. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
