contention and closed well for the place. PRETTY LILY raced in closest pursuit of the winner and weakened in the stretch. JESS'S MOMENT lacked speed,
faded on the turn then showed some late energy. MISS DIZ broke sluggishly, raced far behind then passed rivals late. NORHO'S GAMBLE chased off the
leaders wide and faltered. MISSUPTOWNTOODELOU lacked speed and was never a factor. ORB'S PARTY GIRL chased in midpack and faded. BE MY

the late yards and was nailed from his inside. OMAHA EIGHT pursued the leader throughout and flattened out in the stretch. YOUBETTERBEJOKING
stumbled badly at the start, raced far back then showed some late energy. BIRTHDAY BOND ROB raced within striking range then continued willingly.

MERIDIUS angled inside early, bid on the turn, altered course in the stretch and proved no match for the winner. SUNNY BREEZE prompted the pace three
wide and began fading after half a mile. PRACTICALLY DARK broke slowest and trailed early, swung wide on the turn and continued willingly. LONESOME
BOY dropped back early outside and lacked a response. BERNIE'S MITTS flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly.

settled close up inside then continued willingly to the finish. COLD FEET flashed speed, bid on the turn then gave way in the stretch. CAUSES TROUBLE

CORINNA led under pressure early, shook loose after quarter mile and held off stretch challengers in steady drive. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK angled inside
close up, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. LULLABY LAND settled off the pace in two path, angled out in the stretch and rallied.
CENTER STAGE reserved three wide, bid wider on the final turn then flattened out. AMATERASU lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing.
MEXICAN SUGAR was urged close up outside to the stretch and weakened. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE saved ground, was taken up into the far turn and
faded. NEON CITY trailed early then caught fading rival. ROAD TO DREAMS pressed winner for five furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
GUN SONG drifted out into the first turn, quickly moved clear, repelled challengers at quarter pole then edged away through the final eighth driving. IMPEL
rated off the pace outside, made a strong wide bid on the final turn, loomed a threat but flattened out late. WONDER RIDE broke sluggishly, prompted the
pace, angled inside in the stretch rallying and just missed the place. JUST BE QUIET eased back into the first turn, moved very wide into the stretch but was
no threat. BAND OF GOLD saved ground just off the leaders then faded on the final turn. COURBE was pinched back at the start and trailed early, bid
strongly wide on the final turn then gave way in the stretch.

GOULD'S GOLD pressed the pacesetter opening half mile, bid on the final turn, collared that rival then edged ahead in the stretch after a long drive against
a determined runner-up.. JUST STEP ON IT hustled to the front, was collared midway on the final turn, battled in the stretch but was outfinished. UNCLE
HEAVY prompted the pace along the inside, angled out in the lane then back in through the stretch and went evenly late. MUGATU was rated inside off the
leaders then weakened steadily after half a mile. ATROCIOUS chased three wide off the pace and stopped in the stretch.
