GOLD SEARCH was keen and tugged while being rated under a snug hold heading into the first turn, continued to rate in range near the inside up the
backstretch, angled out late on the far turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch, steadily edged up closer under pressure and drew clear. NELLIE
THURSDAY was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, edged up and vied three deep past the quarter pole, shook free in upper
stretch then got overtaken approaching the final sixteenth. RIDING DOUBLE vied along the inside around the first turn, continued with a slight edge over
UNAUDITED up the backstretch and into the far turn, could not move on with NELLIE THURSDAY past upper stretch, weakened but held clear for show.
MAX'S MAP tugged a bit while being rated just off the leaders heading into the first turn then settled nicely in range up the backstretch, came under a ride
four wide around the far turn, failed to respond and faded in the lane. UNAUDITED vied for the lead around the first turn and continued near equal terms up
the backstretch, could not keep pace leaving the final turn and steadily retreated.

COLONEL KLINK was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, dueled for the lead with CHSAMPION BY DESIGN around the turn, battled on to the furlong
marker then shook free and finished clear. CHAMPION BY DESIGN led the way up the backstretch, dueled with COLONEL KLINK around the turn, battled
on to the eighth pole, then failed to match strides, weakened and just lasted for place. MO'S MOJO tracked in contention through early stages, hustled along
three wide late on the turn, sustained bid into the stretch and just missed place. SNAP'N TAP raced in range along inside up the backstretch, failed to
advance when called upon around the turn and gave way in the lane. ONCE UPON A DREAM raced in the back, saved ground into stretch run and failed to

the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, roused for more, responded willingly and pulled away. F B I BOB tracked the top pair into the turn, hustled along
three wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and finished clearly second best. EXCELLENT EMPIRE vied with the eventual winner to the half mile
marker then failed to match strides, chased two wide in contention around the turn then faded in the final furlong. DAWN STRATEGY raced off the early
pace, was ridden three to four wide into upper stretch and lacked a rally. STEAM POWERED chased the early pace in a spread out field, came two to three
wide into upper stretch and never threatened. TEN BUCKS A GLASS saved ground and raced in back throughout.

AMERICAIN JOEY was forwardly placed around the first turn and tracked the top pair up the backstretch, was confidently handled and tracked patiently
around the far turn, then cut the corner and given cue at the top of the lane, responded gamely, roused forward to the lead and kept clear. PIZZA CHARLIE
raced just off the leader around the first turn and stalked rival up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid entering the head of the lane, could not kick on
with eventual winner but sustained a steady bid and secured second best. RECORDER raced off the clear top trio through early stages, saved ground then
shifted to the four path in upper stretch, responded under pressure and captured show. DISCREET INVASION raced off the early pace, hustled along four
wide into upper stretch and just missed show. AMERICAN POSSE led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, continued on top
around the far turn, got collared at the head of the lane and gave way. HEZA WILD RIDE failed to move into contention. ONE TIME GEM trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SINCERELY MINE raced three wide into the first turn then moved up to challenge RAZOR WIRE for the lead in the early backstretch, dueled outside of rival
up the backstretch, shook clear entering the far turn, got headed by DAY MONEY at the quarter pole, fought back gamely, regained a slight edge, refused to
be denied and held firm. DAY MONEY was away in good order and forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, let out and
poked a head in front of SINCERLY MINE at the quarter pole, then aforementioned rival came back on and regained a slight edge, fought gamely through
the lane but had to settle for second best. MIDNIGHT RULES settled through early stages near the inside, was ridden two wide around the far turn, hustled
along three wide into upper stretch and got a nose up for show. RAZOR WIRE led the way around the first turn then dueled inside of SINCERLY MINE up
the backstretch, could not move on with eventual winner three furlongs from home, ran on, saved ground then tipped out a path and got nipped for show.
WICKLOW LADDIE was unhurried and raced in the back, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. LETS ROCK N STROLL
raced in range along the inside up the backstretch, flattened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
TOMMY'S CRUE tracked the leader in early stages, chased two wide around the turn, continued in pursuit into the lane, poked a head in front at the
sixteenth pole and edged away. CAN'T MAKE ME sped to the lead soon after the start, set the uncontested pace, held clear into the lane, got collared by
the winner at the sixteenth pole and just lasted for place. AMERICAN SUE raced off the early leaders, saved ground around the turn, hustled up along the
rail into upper stretch, gained then tipped three wide and just missed place. ANCHORS AND SPURS raced in range, hustled along two wide around the
turn, came three wide into the lane and evened out. BIT A BAD NEWS raced off the early pace, urged two wide into the lane and improved position without
threatening. BETH'SWICKEDSMACK hustled along three wide through early stages, came three wide into upper stretch and failed to kick on. SKYLAR'S
FIRE raced in range along the inside in the early going, flattened around the turn and continued to weaken in the lane. CATALE raced in the back along the
outside and failed to move into close contention.
