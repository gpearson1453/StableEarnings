Footnotes
GIANNO stalked the pace along the inside, angled out into the turn, challenged for the lead three across, dueled briefly and drew off under mild urging.
ROYAL MENDE got away well to set a pressured pace to the turn, responded to duel, was no match late and finished second best. FRISSON pressed the
pace two wide, challenged between horses on the turn, dueled for the lead, altered course in the upper stretch, fell back and leveled off. J J'S SOLUTION
was void of early speed, saved ground, lacked a bid and passed tiring rivals. PONCHO ATTACK was outrun in an even effort. BRUCE ATTACK raced
evenly in an outside trip and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WE MISS ARLINGTON pressed the pace two wide, challenged for the lead on the turn, closed willingly, drew off and was ridden out. CHAMPAGNE MIKE
settled off the pace, angled out on the turn, bid five wide, bore in in the upper stretch, angled back out and got up for place while no threat to the winner.
SENDEMDOWNTHEROAD set the pace while racing in hand to the turn, weakened in the drive and held for show. STOLICH was slow early, saved ground
to the stretch and offered a mild bid to improve position. SECRET HONOR dropped inside into the turn, bid along the rail entering the stretch to get within
range and came up empty late. THE GEEK lagged early while racing outside, bid six wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
RUSSIAN TO WIN held a good position, rallied four wide on the turn, assumed command into the stretch and drew off under mild urging. TONYS
MORNING LINE was never far back, raced outside, closed, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. PADDY'S HOUSE saved ground to the
stretch, angled out and offered a mild bid to get up for show. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER was pushed out at the start, slow early, angled out for the drive
and lacked a rally. HURTS SO BAD vied inside to the upper stretch and gave way. CAN MAN DO vied three across to the upper stretch and gave way.
RACARINO vied between horses to the upper stretch and gave way. Pick 8: 2/3/5/6/8-3/4/5-7/9-2/5/7-2/5-4/5-3/5/6/7/8-1/6.

Footnotes
MANDALORIAN moved up outside on the backstretch, rallied three wide on the turn, assumed command, drew off and extended the lead while kept to task.
ANGER RISING set the pace to the second turn, dropped back and was no match for the winner. AZOI was fractious in the gate, void of early speed, went
widest in the drive and was along for show. YOUNG MISCHIEF stalked inside early, fell back, continued to save ground, lacked a bid and was outrun.
MIDTERM pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, stopped to a walk, was eased and walked off. FLYING CRICKET was through
early, eased and walked off.
