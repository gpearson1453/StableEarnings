pace while racing well off the rail, swung wide entering the stretch, was outclosed and no match late. MY DAD IS THIRSTY broke in, pressed the pace to
the turn, fell back, finished evenly and held for show. RIG RIDER settled off the pace, bid inside leaving the turn and lacked a late response despite steady
urging. BIG MAC DADDY was outrun in an even effort. FARMER FRED R F trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. MENTIROSA was crowded at the
start, lacked a bid and showed little.

Footnotes
TAP ROCK moved up to vie two across to mid stretch and drew off under mild urging. G G HENNESSY led early, responded when challenged to vie to mid
stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and finished second best. MICKEYS TRAIL was unhurried early, saved ground to the turn, angled out, swung wide
and offered a mild bid to get up for show. MISTER WU pressed the pace to the turn, fell back, finished evenly and was outfinished for third. BLOOMING
RESOURCE raced close to the pace along the inside, was steadied along the rail entering the turn, stayed close, bid inside to get within range and came up
empty late. BENDICION veered out at the start, raced wide in an even effort and failed to menace. CHARLIE THYME was void of early speed, went widest
in the drive and lacked a bid. EVERYBODY KNOWS pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. LITTLE ROGUE was hard to load, veered
in and was steadied early, trailed the field and showed little.
