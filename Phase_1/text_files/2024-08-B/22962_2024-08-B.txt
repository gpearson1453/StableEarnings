Footnotes
THENAME OF THEGAME raced from off of the pace, was given time to find his stride, raced four wide, shifted to the inside into the three path passing
rivals through the turn after launching a bid at the three eighths pole, was asked for more in the upper stretch, responded well, dropping onto the rail, gained
ground, was encouraged through a hole on the rail near the sixteenth pole, was guided through and popped out on the lead, was kept on point and
continued to pull ahead for the win. BAD HENRY was racing in the middle of the field in the two path, was surrounded and racing in between foes nearing
the three eighths pole, launched a bid and gained ground, improving position through the turn, challenged for the lead in the upper stretch, angled out into
the three path, went stride for stride with the early leader down the stretch, was collared by a fast closing inside rival just getting beat and finishing second.
DUKE OF DOOLY broke sharp, happily took control setting the pace for the majority of the fractions, was joined by a challenging rival in the upper stretch,
battled with this rival down the stretch, racing stride for stride, was passed up by an inside avenger, lost momentum finishing with a third after doing all of the
early work. SIDNEY'S BID was off mid pack, raced in the four path while traveling on the outside of another competitor, raced down the backside with this
one, launched a bid at the half mile pole, circling the field through the turn, then had no late kick. BAD HOMBRE stalked from the two path but made no
significant impact. SETTE STELLE raced off of the pace, traveled in the three path and showed little. SOMETIMES I DO vied for the lead from the four path,
stalked the leader, raced in between foes then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
MAT MATTERS raced in the three path, led by half a length with horses closely stalking to either side, launched a bid a the three eighths pole, and
improved position putting more ground in between himself and his stalking rivals, was asked at the top of the lane and responded well drawing off and
winning convincingly. CARRY GRANT had an awkward start, was off slow, settled, trailed, bid at the half, circled rivals through the turn, travelled four wide,
shifted out into the six path in the upper stretch, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and closing in on the eventual winner but could not get there
today and finished a nice second.. JOHNNY FROM BOSTON stalked the leader from the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, could not gain
any ground on the leader, chased but did not have enough. TOADY HOPPER raced from off of the pace in the four path, moved at the half mile marker,
slightly gained ground and improved position but had no finish and faded in the stretch. SOUTHERN PASS TIME stalked from the two path, saved ground
and gave way. CAPITAN GEORGE was unsettled in the gates, raced mid pack, showed little.

NOMORETANLINES vied for the lead, then stalked the early leader while racing in the four path, was encouraged into the upper stretch, stayed with the
early leader as they pulled away from the rest of the field, was driven every stride, pushed to gain ground and get closer to the leader, finally was able to
draw next to and then go past the early leader in the last sixteenth of a mile with determination as she held sway for the win. READY TO ROCKNROLL vied
for the lead, raced in the two path, set the pace, was collared in the last sixteenth of a mile finishing second. HOLD ON broke a step slow, raced off the pace
into the turn, bid between runners leaving the three eighths marker, was stopped cold in traffic nearing the quarter pole, regrouped while shifting out five
wide in upper stretch, and rallied with good energy to the wire. BACKSEAT ROMANCE was off mid pack, fell back a bit and raced off of the pace, traveled
four wide, moved at the three eighths, gained ground, improved position in the upper stretch, ran a bit green bumping into another competitor in the stretch
run, struggled for forward momentum finishing a dull fourth. VIVY was off mid pack, raced four wide,, improved slightly in the upper stretch then finished
evenly. SANDY GIRL stalked the early pace from the five path, launched a bid near the quarter pole and faltered. A SHAWTOWN GIRL was off a touch
slow, saved ground through out racing on the rail, was asked at the quarter pole and responded well closing late but it was not enough today. NOHAI broke
mid pack, steadied two times into the turn, bumped hard and clipped heels nearing the furlong marker, had nothing left after a brutal trip. RISK AND
REGRET was off a bit slow, trailed early, raced four wide and showed little. MARIA MOON was forwardly placed, stalked three wide, then tired.

the tempo nearing the quarter pole, split rivals in upper stretch, and held sway driving. MISS DIZ chased the pace from along the rail, ground saving trip into
the far turn, under a drive in upper stretch, was out kicked to the wire. BIG BOLT chased the pace from the two path around the first turn and down the back
stretch, came under urging leaving the three eighths marker, was unable to sustain bid through the stretch. LADY GABRIELLE sprinted to the front leaving
the gate, set the tempo down the backside and into the far turn, came under pressure in upper stretch, and weakened to the wire. WOKE UP A DIVA trailed
