Footnotes
JONATHAN'S WAY bumped with a rival after the start then was taken up while pinched back between horses, raced well off the pace while into the bit,
powered through the kickback while getting closer late on the backstretch, circled the field in the four then five path on the turn, swept to the lead into upper
stretch, moved clear into the final furlong then drifted in before being corrected by the rider and drew away while much the best in a sparkling debut.
MOMENT'S NOTICE chased the pace on the outside of the leader then in the three path on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch, lost touch with the winner
near the furlong marker and proved no match while well clear for the place. SOCIAL HOUR bobbled a bit shortly after the start then bumped lightly with a
rival, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner into the final furlong and tired while able to hold the show.
PERFECT FORCE was ridden along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened. MCHALE
showed speed and went to the front, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way.
TIZ FREEDOM came in a bit after the break, was urged along on the outside, raced in the five then four path on the turn, dropped to the two path into upper
stretch and failed to respond. BAYTOWN GUVNAH was taken in and early then moved out, established a good position just off the pace, chased inside on
the turn and retreated. FLAT TO DA MAT was coaxed along on the inside, dropped back while climbing greenly into the kickback late on the backstretch,
raced inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor. SANSONE dropped back while showing no speed, went around the turn in the two then three
path, came into the stretch in the four path and showed little then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
CONCORD GREEN got away to an awkward start when breaking a step out and getting away slow conceding three to four lengths to the front before
settling into stride, tracked the front from along the inside settled near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the
quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, tipped out and had DAVY CROCKETT drift in a furlong out gaining a clear
lane, rallied on through to take command from that rival just inside the sixteenth pole and inched away to the finish to prevail. DAVY CROCKETT saved
ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied shying in under a right
handed crop and seized command inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught just inside the sixteenth marker, fought on to the finish to
preserve the place honors. DRAGONEER got away to a hesitant start standing a bit longer than the rest of the field when the latch was sprung and
conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside from the rear of the field, tucked inside through the far turn and came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out three to four paths near the eighth pole and followed the aforementioned foe
through clearance before kicking on belatedly to secure the show honors in a good effort. VALUATION METRIC coaxed from the gate, raced just off the
inside through the first turn and then three to four wide down the backstretch, went four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ASBURY PARK (GB) saved ground through the first turn settling in mid pack,
tracked the front two to three wide patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, showed late interest getting on track near the final
sixteenth, tipped out and bumped HAMMERHEAD in the shadow of the wire to prevent running on the heels of rivals near the finish. HAMMERHEAD got
away to a hesitant beginning getting away slow when standing the sprung gate for a few seconds after the field and conceded three to four lengths to the
front, raced just off the inside through the first turn and then chased three to four wide down the backstretch before going five wide through the far turn under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish and was bumped just prior to the wire by
ASBURY PARK needing some clearance late. SAM'S ROCKET coaxed from the gate, got joined by JOHNY'S RENDEZVOUS early on and shook off that
rival just off the inside midway on the turn before spurting away into the backstretch to a commanding lead, remained on hold tucked to the inside and had
the field take closer order half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. JOHNY'S RENDEZVOUS coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly
placed three then two wide through the first turn growing a bit rank when eased off the aforementioned foe to concede the front, chased just off the inside in
closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. POLICY
CHANGE tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, bid a furlong from
home, then weakened through to the finish. JERRY'S OUT just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
NIC'S STYLE came in after the start while going to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside on the turn, was roused near the
quarter-pole then turned into the stretch in the two path, battled inside of the runner-up under a drive, shook clear into the final furlong, drew off under a
strong hand-ride into the final seventy yards then was put to lighter encouragement while much the best. GIRLS WEEKEND broke out and bumped hard
with a rival, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, battled with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and
proved no match while just able to hold the place. BENEDETTA was rated just off the pace under restraint, came under urging in the two path on the turn,
chased the top two in the stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show. STOP GIGGLING settled nicely on the outside, was roused while
tracking the leaders in the four path on the turn, chased in the five path into upper stretch and came up empty. BANDITA was last to commence, raced near
the back under urging, was taken in hand outside the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path while roused and failed to rally. KILLY START was
bumped hard at the start, raced on the outside near the back under some restraint, was asked in the five path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the six
path and lacked the needed response. BELLE OF THE BALL was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in
the five path and was no factor.

Footnotes
CRUSADING raced inside for most of the first turn then shifted to the two path, was well placed off the pace down the backstretch, rallied in the three then
four path on the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch then shook clear, responded well while drifting out some in the final furlong and held under steady
urging. HOURS IN A DAY raced in the six then five path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths pole, went
around most of the far turn in the four path then dropped to the two path, gained under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly to just get the place.
RAMESSES dropped from the six path to the three path on the first turn, was urged along on the backstretch, shifted from the two path to the four path on
the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, moved in near the furlong marker and finished with good courage to just miss the place while narrowly up
for the show. BOUNTEOUS was hustled from the gate, dropped from the five path to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along with
five furlongs to run, went around the far turn in the four then five path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner to the finish and just
missed the trifecta. SALACIOUS was restless in the gate, dropped from the three path to the rail on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, saved ground
while asked on the far turn, shifted to the three path late on that bend, pursued the winner in the stretch and was outfinished. REMEMBER THE CHIEF went
four then three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, made a bid in the two path on the far turn,
took a short lead inside the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the final fulrong and weakened.
COWBOY LUKE dropped from the two path to the rail while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked under threat while inside
on the far turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole and tired. MACAW went five then four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, faltered late
on the backstretch and was pulled up on the far turn then transported off the track via equine ambulance.

Footnotes
CALL ME HARRY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and held safe to prevail. LOCKE AND KEY got
bumped at the start by SELL SOMETHING, who broke outwards, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, closed well to just latch on the aforementioned foe as he hit the wire. BETTRLUCKYTHANGOOD fractious in the gate prior to the start,
got backed out and reloaded, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered up
a mild kick. LET'S GO BIG BLUE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside initially just off the leader early on, steadily lost position through to the
five-sixteenths when placed to coaxing, swung four wide into upper stretch, was attempting to tip out at the three-sixteenths and refused to do so, then got
brushed by AGENT CREED a furlong from home and kept on to the finish. AGENT CREED three then two wide through the first turn, chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MAXWELL ESQUIRE four then three
wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened
in the late going. ROUGH DRAFT grew fractious in the gate prior to the start and had the rider briefly dismount before climbing back aboard, chased just off
the inside through the first turn and then three to four wide thereafter coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the drive. LAUREL VALLEY grew fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. SELL SOMETHING broke out at the start bumping LOCKE AND KEY, chased along
the inside and grew detached at the tail of the field when sluggish in the early stages, continued to lose ground and went three wide through the far turn and
was guided outside to swing eight wide into upper stretch and was eased home through to the finish well behind the rest of the field, then walked off under
his own power.

Footnotes
RECKONING FORCE moved in early, went around the first turn in the two path, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two then three path on the far
turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, turned into the stretch in the four path, dueled with MONDEGO until near the sixteenth-pole, disposed of that
foe at that juncture and just held under strong urging. RED RUN moved in early then bumped with a foe, tucked into the two path for the run around the
opening bend, was reserved near the middle of the field, saved ground on the far turn, was shuffled back behind FREEDOM TRAIL when that foe dropped
back outside the quarter-pole, slipped inside that rival then cut the corner into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, moved out
outside the sixteenth-pole and closed well but was too late while able to get the place. DAUNT moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, stalked
the pace on the outside, chased in the three then four path on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the five path, pursued the winner in the drive and
finished with good courage to get the show. MONDEGO (GB) angled in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked while coming off
the rail on the far turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, turned into the stretch in the three path, battled with the winner until near the sixteenth-pole
then was outfinished. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) brushed with a rival at the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused
while moving from the two path to the four path on the final turn, turned into the stretch in the six path and improved position. DRIPPING GOLD was
bumped from the outside early then jostled with foes, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while two then three wide on
the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and gained late but failed to impact. MENDELSSOHNS MARCH jostled with a rival while in hand early, saved
ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path while roused on the far turn and lacked the needed response.
CYBER NINJA saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two then three path on the far turn, came into the stretch in the
four path and failed to rally. FREEDOM TRAIL brushed with an opponent at the start, was rated just off the pace on the inside, moved off the rail on the far
turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
GAME WARDEN coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside into
the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and taking closer order on the once clear leader, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
rallied in tandem with TIMEOUT and seized command a sixteenth from home, then dug in and held that runner up at bay to the finish. TIMEOUT four then
three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied in concert with GAME WARDEN to over throw the leader a sixteenth out, ran on to secure
the place honors. ROCKETEER forwardly placed from the gate, pulled on the bit eagerly through the first turn taking his rider to the front, spurted away into
the backstretch before settling with five furlongs to go already half a dozen lengths clear of the field, remained on hold as the field took closer order through
the far turn and was set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and got collared a sixteenth from home,
weakened in the late stages but just preserved the show honors on the wire. DIGITAL OPS led early on until overthrown by the eager aforementioned rival
in the first turn, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
JACKSON HEIGHTS grew detached at the tail of the field early on, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six to
seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. CARTUCHO along the inside through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and made no impact. D DAY SKY chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
GRAYOSH was rated towards the front on the inside, shifted to the two path while asked at the quarter-pole, made a bid outside furlong marker, brushed
twice with the runner-up while between foes shortly thereafter, battled with two opponents into the final sixteenth, fought gamely with the runner-up to the
finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. SHE FEELS PRETTY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on
the far turn, gained four wide into the stretch then came inward, made a bid outside the furlong marker, brushed twice with the winner near that marker,
battled outside of two foes to the sixteenth-pole, fought with the winner to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. DYNAMIC PRICING (IRE)
broke in and brushed the hindquarters of a foe, moved in while taken under a tight hold early, raced just behind horses under stout restraint nearing the first
turn, was reserved in the two path, came under urging outside the five-sixteenths then moved to the three path, shifted to the five path into the stretch, found
her best stride in the final furlong and finished with good energy to get the show. SPALIDAY was last away then angled to the inside early, was reserved
along the hedge, came under encouragement around the five-sixteenths pole, moved out in upper stretch, found her best stride while inside her stablemate
in the final furlong and also finished with good energy but missed the trifecta. ORI was brushed by a foe at the start then moved in while hustled to the lead,
rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn, came under the crop in upper stretch,
lost the lead just inside the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. BEAUTIFUL LOVE (IRE) went three wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was urged in the three then four path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the six path, drifted in outside the furlong marker and
failed to rally. GALA BRAND was taken under restraint early, went around the first turn in the two then three path, was reserved towards the rear, rounded
the far turn in the two then three path, was roused late on that bend and failed to rally. DE REGRESO established a forward position early, traveled around
the first turn in the two path, was well placed down the backstretch, came under urging outside the three-eighths pole, chased in the two path on the far turn,
spun three wide into the stretch then was taken up while dropping back around the three-sixteenths pole and faltered then was eased in the final furlong
before being transported off the course via equine ambulance.

POWER SQUEEZE coaxed from the gate, got coaxed along early on past the stand and then raced just off the inside through the first turn, tipped out five
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the far turn and coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths following the bid
by CANDIED directly in front of her, angled out eight wide into upper stretch and bumped with JUST BASKING before straightening away, dug in under a
drive issuing a challenge inside the final furlong, had CANDIED get directed out to look her in the eye and knocked heads gamely through the final sixteenth
to the finish and just got the nod on the wire. CANDIED three wide through the first turn, chased four wide down the backstretch and into the far turn
advancing on the front near the three-eighths marker, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung six wide into upper stretch and was bumped
by MISS JUSTIFY in the hind end and spun out a bit due to pressure from CHATALAS, dug in under a drive seizing command nearing the eighth pole, got
directed out inside that station to look her main danger in the eye in the form of the aforementioned foe, battled head to head through the final sixteenth and
just lost the bob on the line. JUST BASKING settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing two to three wide at the five-sixteenths,
angled out nine paths off the inside into upper stretch and was bumped by POWER SQUEEZE to the ten path before straightened away, dug in under a
drive running on with good energy through to the finish and chased the top pair home while well clear of the rest for the show honors. MISS JUSTIFY lost
her rear footing at the start but conceded only two lengths to the front, raced three wide through the first turn before chasing three wide down the
backstretch, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths continuing three wide, angled out four wide and was bumped five wide into upper stretch by
CHATALAS shying outwards and in turn made contact with the hind end of CANDIED, dug in prominent and fighting on to the eighth pole, then weakened
through to the finish. INTRICATE broke out a step at the start and was corrected before making contact with CHATALAS, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened through to the finish. CHATALAS coaxed from the
gate, established the front and showed the way in hand tucking to the rail, shied out just past the wire the first time two paths and was taken hold of and kept
in the two path thereafter through the first turn and down the backstretch showing the way settled into a comfortable rhythm, took briefly to the rail from the
nine-sixteenths to the half mile pole before tipping back to be just off the inside through the far turn, came under coaxing coming under pressure to the
outside just inside five-sixteenths remaining, angled three wide into upper stretch and drifted out four wide bumping MISS JUSTIFY to the five path and into
CANDIED when under an active left rein, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and weakened through to the end. NEON ICON four wide through the
first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch and came in slightly on
AMERICA'S VOW placing that foe in tight against INTRICATE straightened away, then tired through the stretch. AMERICA'S VOW coaxed from the gate,
chased just off the inside through the first turn before chasing three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path with half a mile to go making mild
headway, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and paused in tight between rivals when NEON ICON drifted in
from the outside, then tired through to the finish.

YO DADDY broke out at the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, was taken back between foes just inside the three-quarter pole then moved out
while settling off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, gained in the three path early on the far turn, took the lead outside the three-eighths
pole, moved clear outside the quarter-pole, spun into the stretch in the four path and drew away under steady urging. UNSTABLE PRINCE saved ground on
the first turn, settled off the pace, angled from the two path to the four path while behind horses on the turn, dropped to the three path under a drive at the
quarter-pole and safely secured the place. HAVE YOU HEARD went four then three wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, gained three
then four wide on the far turn, chased in the five path into the stretch under the crop and came up empty while just able to get the show. PURSUIT OF
POWER bumped with a rival at the start then bumped with that same foe early, went five wide on the first turn, settled outside at the rear, moved in outside
the half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn, came out to the four path into the stretch, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and improved position to just
miss the show. STORMING CHROME was bumped hard at the start and forced out into another rival, bumped again with a foe early while also making
contact with another foe then moved in, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, angled from the three path to the six path on the far turn,
turned into the stretch in the seven path and lacked the needed response. SPECIAL DISPATCH moved his head at the start then broke awkwardly and was
off slow, angled in fast early, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, angled from the inside to the five path while getting closer on the far
turn, was driven into the stretch in the six path and faltered. WHO'S THE KING went around the first turn in the three path, tossed his head late on that
bend, tossed his head again while between foes near the three-quarter pole, moved out while just off the pace with five furlongs to run, chased in the two
path early on the far turn, made a bid around the three-eighths pole, dropped back into the stretch and tired. UNLIMITEDPOTENTIAL veered out and
bumped hard with a foe then bumped lightly again with that opponent early, went five wide on the first turn, moved to the lead coming to the three-quarter
pole then showed the way, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead nearing the three-eighths pole and faded. SMILE MON broke out then was hustled to the
front, raced inside on the first turn, lost the lead before the three-quarter pole then raced just off the pace, came up empty while inside to the two path on the
far turn and retreated.
