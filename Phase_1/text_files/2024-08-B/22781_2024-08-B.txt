TANGERINE TWIST was away alertly and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure in mid stretch drew off. PEACE IN PARADISE
stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. ALWAY'S ROSIE was
unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. MISS SCHILLER was in touch and roused from
the inside on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. ASHCAR NELLIE was in range and raced evenly on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.

Footnotes
PALACE PRINCE was unhurried early, hustled along on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. STRONG ENDING was away
alertly, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. BRADY O'BRADY was off the pace, had a mild
gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied late. ONE MORE RING was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch needed more. BOCELLI was well back, saved ground on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. EXECUTIVE
CHAIRMAN was in range but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch faded. LION OF THE SEA showed speed from the inside and
had a clear lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch.

but was headed on the far turn and gave way. INITTOWINIT was well back, moved up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up
for a share. AMONG THE ROSES was off the pace and roused on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response.

VINCENZINO was up close, forced the pace on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch refused to lose. DOT'S VISION was bumped at
the start, a factor on the far turn and had the lead from the five path in mid stretch but was outgunned. PARTY OF NO showed speed from the inside and
had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way. JADE'S DREAM was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but was no real threat. HALF LIT stalked
the early leader and dueled on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. THY KINGDOM was well back, showed little and
was not a factor. OCTOBER FROST broke poorly and saved ground on the far turn but had no impact.
