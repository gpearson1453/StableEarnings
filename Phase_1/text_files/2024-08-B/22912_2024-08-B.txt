STRIKE APPEAL was hustled along, set all the pace under pressure while getting quick fractions and maintained his advantage under strong handling.
ONE TEN allowed to settle, split horses two wide on the far turn, bid along the rail in upper stretch and finished second best. HUNTER SCOTT with the
second flight three then four wide, went evenly. CARILLO allowed to settle, swung wide and closed ground late in the middle of the racetrack. GOING IN
STYLE hopped at the start, offered a mild bid three wide on the far turn then came up empty. KADESH was in tight along the rail, checked past the seven
eighths pole, remained inside, checked behind the tiring CREDIT RIVER near the quarter pole and dropped back. CREDIT RIVER pressured the winner two
wide into the far turn then gave way. CYCLONE was outrun. DOCTOR NASH stumbled at the start and was never close. THE RIDER OF KADESH
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN. AFTER REVIEW THE
STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

NAMBITI allowed to settle, closed willingly four wide under right then left handed urging to make the lead in deep stretch and proved best under brisk
handling. EAGLE NEST stalked the early pace, rallied three wide into the stretch making the lead before the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner.
CHOCOLATE RABBIT dueled for the lead two wide until deep stretch then was outfinished. DASH OF FIRE drifted out at the start, was allowed to settle
then found his best stride late in the six path. LITTLE RONS ROCKET failed to menace. NO MAS CERVEZA was in tight between horses at the start and
failed to reach contention. NEBULOSA dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then was used up. RED HOT POWER had brief speed.

handed urging. EL BANDIDO had good early speed four wide, dropped back before the turn, swung wide and came on again late five wide to just miss.
GRAND DEAL broke inward bumping VOORHEES at the start, trailed far back into the stretch then closed with a rushed through the final furlong in the
middle of the racetrack. ARMOR PIERCING never far back, finished determinedly along the rail. VOORHEES was bumped at the start, chased the winner
two wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ON HIS TOES chased the winner three wide into the stretch and faded late. THE EQUINEST
chased the winner five then four wide into the turn and weakened in the stretch.

make the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged clear under a strong hand ride. CLASS ACTOR was hustled to the lead soon after the start, set a
pressured pace into the stretch, drifted to the seven path then couldn't handle the winner in the final stages. SAHM TEQUILA never far back, swung wide
and found his best stride late in the middle of the racetrack. PRACTICAL MAN stalked the pace three wide into the stretch and faded late. LAZARUS
PROJECT unhurried, passed tiring rivals through the stretch along the rail. MONTAUK COVE well placed, failed to respond. FIRST CITIZEN failed to

Footnotes
LIONISTIC pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, drifted to the four path entering the stretch, set the balance of the pace and drew off
late under a strong hand ride. CANDLELIGHT HOURS stalked the pace, shifted to the five path at the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner.
SHE'S CRAFTY was in tight at the start, trailed into the stretch and found her best stride late three wide. SONNET sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, set the pace along the inside into the far turn, kept on into the stretch then faded. MOBIL CHIC close from the start, moved up along the rail after a half
then came up empty. MOBIL LADY well placed, failed to respond.
