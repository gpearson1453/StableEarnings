Footnotes
WITH THE ANGELS broke out a step at the start albeit directly to the front, showed the way in hand three to four paths off the rail down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path through the turn, remained on hold and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused near the three-sixteenths
receiving a tap of the crop to the right shoulder and placed to a vigorous hand ride and went clear to the finish ridden out to the wire. STONE SMUGGLER
coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top
one, ran on clear for the place honors. PRINCESS MISCHIEF chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued along the inside
route into upper stretch, improved position through the stretch to secure the show honors. FRANKIE HICCUPS coaxed from the gate, chased along the
inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. WILLFUL MAMA coaxed from
the start, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired. VEHEMENTE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired. FIVE G coaxed from
the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three then two wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun
two to three wide into upper stretch and faltered. PRETTY MAGICAL coaxed from the gate, raced briefly just off the pace and in the clear, had a rival tuck in
front with nine-sixteenths to go and began taking kickback, grew rank striding green and climbing and had the rider apply right handed taps to the shoulder
with the crop to settle and remain in the four path, lost ground into the turn and backed away slowing down momentarily seemingly losing interest before
coming under light coaxing by the rider with seven-sixteenths to go now tucked three wide through the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and was
placed to a drive and finished with renewed interest getting some education while trailing to the finish.

Footnotes
BEAUTE CACHEE (FR) broke in and bumped with a foe then was hustled to the lead, dropped to the inside entering the first turn, was well rated while
setting the pace in hand, came under some encouragement inside the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner with left-rein guidance into upper stretch, was put
to a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths pole, responded well under heavy threat in the final furlong and held under strong urging. GINA
ROMANTICA moved forward in the gate just as the latch sprung and broke in front, dropped off the pace, raced in the three path for most of the first turn
then tucked into the two path, settled at the rear while given cover, was removed from cover leaving the backstretch, ranged up three wide on the far turn,
was asked coming to the quarter-pole, chased outside in the stretch, gained gradually on the winner late but missed while able to get the place. DELAHAYE
was bumped at the start, stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, passed the five-sixteenths pole within a head of the lead, was given her cue at the
quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, fought outside of the winner into the final sixteenth then was out-kicked while clear for third.
SURPRISINGLY was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, saved ground while rated just off the pace, was asked inside the five-sixteenths pole,
turned into the stretch in the two path, chased the top three in the drive then moved out late and lacked the needed kick.

Footnotes
IN TIME (FR) settled tracking the leader along the inside from the pocket patiently handled until roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch into
daylight and to a clear two path, rallied to split foes and take command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. JUSTDENY just off the
inside tracking the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch opening the lane for the
eventual winner, took over brief and narrow command at the three-sixteenths before being displaced by that same rival, ran on to chase IN TIME home
while clear for the place honors. SY B tracked the front along the inside from mid pack early on through the first two turns before tipping to the two path into
the backstretch, remained just off the inside through the far and final turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out five to six wide into upper
stretch and kept on through to the finish to secure the show honors. POWER AND GLORY saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. GLITTERING LIGHTS (GB) tracked just off the inside from
just off the pace, came under coaxing tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive.
PRETTY PROVOCATIVE settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, tipped three wide when SY B tipped to the two path into the backstretch to her
inside, came under coaxing tucked back to the two path at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. A NEW PEACE coaxed
from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits on hold until placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch under threat to the outside, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened through to the finish.

while asked at the top of the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong, made a bid while drifting out near the sixteenth-pole then took the advantage,
swapped back to his inside lead late and prevailed under strong urging. BRITERDAYZAHEAD pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the
turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to get the place. MISTER J T was urged along well
off the pace, went around the turn in the four path, turned into the stretch in the six path and finished with late energy to get up for the show. SCARAMANGA
was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed
the show. JOKING WAY was urged along towards the back, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the needed
response. SAFFA'S DAY was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the runner-up
in upper stretch and gave way. COMMERCE COMET was urged along on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five

on HEADLINE NUMBERS as WHOCOULDASKFORMO came up the inside, came in straightened away and forced WHOCOULDASKFORMO to steady off
her heels and was headed for command when coming in just outside the three-sixteenths marker, dug in under a drive and shied in a furlong out when
HEADLINE NUMBERS came in to look her in the eye, knocked heads through to the final seventy yards and took back command at that juncture placed to
a vigorous hand drive and inched away coming outwards to the finish. HEADLINE NUMBERS broke in at the start bumping SWEET MYSTERY, raced
forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn before tipping three wide down the backstretch and advancing to latch on the leader from the
outside, applied some pressure prompting that foe down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down
spinning three wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, dug in under a drive coming in slightly forcing CAMERA to shy in a furlong
out, fought head to head through to the final seventy yards when displaced from the lead, then got shaken off in the final strides when slightly carried out.
WHOCOULDASKFORMO got bumped at the start by CENTRAL AVENUE and in turn bumped STANDOUTSENSATION, tracked the pace along the inside
with an open rail directly in front down the backstretch and advanced into the seam to be briefly inside the top pair into the far turn, got shaken off a bit and
came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under urging and was forced to steady off the heels of CAMERA
when that foe came inwards impeding her at the three-sixteenths as that rival's rider focused solely on HEADLINE NUMBERS, tipped out nearing the eighth
pole two paths into the clear and offered up a mild kick. CENTRAL AVENUE broke out at the start and bumped WHOCOULDASKFORMO into
STANDOUTSENSATION, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.
STANDOUTSENSATION got bumped at the start by WHOCOULDASKFORMO due to pressure from CENTRAL AVENUE coming outwards just after the
start, chased three then two wide through the first turn and then three to four wide thereafter, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and tired. SWEET MYSTERY got bumped at the start by HEADLINE NUMBERS, who broke inwards, raced four then three wide through the
first turn and came under brief coaxing six and a half furlongs from home to advance outside rivals into the backstretch, chased four to five wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into upper stretch as well as a
claim of foul by the rider of WHOCOULDASKFORMO alleging interference against CAMERA in upper stretch. After review, it was deemed that CAMERA
had indeed interfered with WHOCOULDASKFORMO and CAMERA was disqualified from first and placed third before that result was declared official.

Footnotes
DISCO BALL was hustled to the front then went clear, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was set
down into upper stretch, responded well under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and held under steady urging. KAVOD was urged along near the
back, went around most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the inside, shifted three wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner to the finish and
willingly secured the place. LITTLE VIC was loaded riderless by being backed into the gate, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the
turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. RUNNINSONOFAGUN was urged along on the
outside, went around the turn in the five path and tired. GUN IT was urged along off the pace, traveled around most of the turn in the four path then dropped
to the three path, drifted in near the three-sixteenths pole and had nothing left.

Footnotes
LA SALVADORENA was rated off the pace while between foes, went three wide on the turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, disposed of PRECISELY
near the sixteenth-pole and moved clear under strong urging. OUT TOO LATE (GB) settled towards the rear on the outside, went around the turn in the
three to four path while still in hand, was roused between horses outside the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch, bumped hard with a rival inside
the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good courage to just get the place. SHOP LIFTING was hustled from the gate then settled towards the rear,
came under brief urging near the half-mile pole then was taken under restraint, became rank behind horses in the two then three path on the turn, shifted
four wide into the stretch, was bumped hard inside the three-sixteenths pole then forced out into another rival and finished willingly to just miss the place.
CHARDAN was brushed by a rival at the start and carried out, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole, angled
out in upper stretch, moved further out near the furlong marker and improved position while reaching her best stride too late. PRECISELY went to the front,
showed the way with company to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper
stretch, battled with that foe until near the sixteenth-pole and weakened. UNHIDDEN GEM (IRE) was rated just off the pace, departed the backstretch under
vigorous restraint while behind a foe, drafted inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, raced behind horses under some urging in upper stretch
and lacked the needed kick. ARRASOU was hard held while rated off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, tossed her head while keen behind
horses outside the five-sixteenths pole, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved out while put to a drive, bumped hard with a rival inside the
three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed response. BLACKFOOT DAISY was fractious while loading in the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied
in the three then two path on the turn, battled under a drive into the furlong and tired. SEINE raced just off the pace on the outside, dropped back in the four
then five path on the turn, moved back to the four path into the stretch and faltered.
