Footnotes
LITTLE ROCKY raced in the middle of the pack from two wide through the final turn then tipped out to four wide in upper stretch to run down the leaders and
drew clear late. MOKINGS stalked the pace down the backstretch then moved up from three wide at the three furlong marker to engage the leader and the
quarter pole to take the lead into the stretch but was overtaken late but kept on to be second best. ROCKALL was reluctant to load into the starting gate
then tracked the leaders through the final turn, made a rail bid in the stretch to finish strong. RAUL'S ENCANTO prompted the pace from the two path to
midway down the backstretch then moved up to engage the leader at the half mile marker and matched strides to midway through the final turn and
weakened. INSIGNIS was pinballed at the start and unhurried around the first turn, steadily advanced through the final turn and made a mid track rally. BAY
BE GONE raced near the back around the first turn then trailed the field through the final turn and showed late interest to improve position. CREME DE
BALI hopped at the start, raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn but faltered. SUMMER LOVER
remained near the back. TEXAS TURBINE saved ground to no avail. SHAWN'S SOLVING rushed to a clear lead to the half mile marker where he was
headed but fough gamely to mid stretch and tired.

LAND SPEED sprinted away to pressed the leader but drifted in and impeded foe near the half mile marker but kept on to take the lead at the quarter pole
and drew clear. CABO MISCHIEF was off a step slow then rushed to the lead to the quarter pole and kept on to hold the place. KEENO broke inward at the
start then raced in the middle of the pack through the turn and made a late stretch run to be up for the show. BLONDATE prompted the pace early from the
inside then had to steady when he was impeded by rival near the half mile marker and had to shift out to three wide around the turn and was out finished.
KEEP UP THE PACE raced in the middle of the pace from three wide and was not a threat. BUTCHY BOY hopped slightly at the start and was not a factor.
JOCKEY OBJECTION, THE JOCKEY OF BLONDATE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF LAND SPEED FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE

wide in upper stretch and moved between horses at the sixteenth pole to improve. LOOKIN FOR LOKI raced off the pace between rivals in the second tier
but lacked the late response. CAMPISI raced near the back and passed tiring rivals. UPTOWN SOCIAL roused to the front to co-lead from the inside to the

RECKLESS RANSOM pressed the pace from two wide to the quarter pole then inched away and drew clear in the stretch. HEZA PRIORITY chased the
leaders from five wide to the turn the four wide while circling the field and kept on to be second best. THE THIMBLE was void of the early speed to the turn
then moved up from two wide and tipped out to four wide in the stretch to make the late rally for show. WAR SONG raced close up on the pace from four
wide then shifted in to three wide in upper stretch but was outfinished. SAMURAI'S GRANDSON rushed up to a pressured lead from the inside to quarter
pole and was empty in the drive. CARLOS PUNCH vied for the lead from three wide to midway through the turn and gave way. ROCK SOLID WORDS was
away alertly but faded quickly and raced near the back then appeared to take a bad step near the quarter pole, lost the rider and transported via the equine
ambulance.

HARD TO COME BY saved ground while being forwardly placed to the final turn, angled out to three wide in upper stretch and drew clear willingly.
GOROSTIETA'S LOVE shared the command from two wide, inched away near the top of the stretch to take a brief narrow lead and fought gamely for
second. EL SMOOCH shared the command from the inside to near the top of the stretch and gave way grudgingly. CHARLIE'S GAL raced in the middle of
the pack down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn, tipping out to four wide in upper stretch to make a rally and missed the show. HEXCEL
stalked the pace from three wide to down the backstretch fell back slightly on the turn and flattened out. LITTLE JONY raced off the pace on the inside but
failed to menace. COUNTRY CUT raced near the back from four or five wide and was not a threat. PARTYINTHESTREETS was unhurried around the first
turn then made a mild bid from three wide on the final turn but faltered. DABOOGEYMAN raced in the middle of the pack from three or four wide to midway
through the final turn and dropped back. HELLO MR COPELAND had traffic on the first turn, trailed the field, remained back and was transported via the

CALI DREAMIN hustled to the front to match strides outside of GEM BUOY to the quarter pole and drew clear, but was challenged by STAR STAR STAR
who was closing late but fended off that one and drew clear again to hold on for the win. STAR STAR STAR chased the leaders from three wide around the
turn then showed late interest in the stretch drive but couldn't collar the winner but was a clear second. MYSTIC HOPE raced in the middle of the pace while
saving ground tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but was erratic in the stretch and was along for the show. ISLAND CABANA raced near the back and
passed tiring rivals. GEM BUOY rushed up the rail to the front to match strides inside of CALI DREAMIN to the quarter pole and tired. DR SPECK was
forwardly placed to the half mile marker then steadily faded. TOMS LUCKY MO rubbed the gate while breaking outward and was outrun.

Footnotes
SHOW ME THE CANDY went to the front to a pressured lead and fended off outside rivals but drifted late and brushed with BROADWAY PEARL in the final
yards and held on. BROADWAY PEARL raced off the pace from between horses to the top of the stretch, tipped out to four wide to make the late kick while
shifting in and brushed with SHOW ME THE CANDY but couldn't collare and was second best. LITTLE Z raced near the back while saving ground through
the final turn then moved out to two wide in the stretch to make the late rally and was just up for the show. TAKE MY PICTURE was unsettled in the gate,
raced in the middle of the pace from two wide through the final turn then made a four wide late run and missed the show. SWIZZLECITY tracked the leaders
from the inside through the final turn then made a rail bid in the stretch but was outkicked by outside rivals. AND CHANGE pressed the pace from two wide
to the top of the stretch then took a brief lead but was eclipsed and quickly and was empty. MIZ JAMESON was unhurried to the first turn then moved up
from three wide through the final turn and made a late kick but was not enough. BOLD EXAGGERATION stalked the pace from three wide to the top of the
stretch and lacked the late response to be out finished. KAPPA HILL saved ground from the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up from four
wide and made a mild bid on the final turn but faltered. THE RAGE OF ART trailed throughout. JOCKEY OBJECTION, THE JOCKEY OF BROADWAY
PEARL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF SHOW ME THE CANDY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER A
STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
