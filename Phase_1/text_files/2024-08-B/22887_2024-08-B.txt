Footnotes
ACCELERATING got bumped at the start by CARMEN'S CANDY JAR and bobbled but broke on top despite it, showed the way in hand just off the inside
under some pressure to the inside from CENTRAL TO SUCCESS until shaking off that rival with nine-sixteenths remaining, continued in the two path
through the turn patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive shying out late under a left handed
crop with the outcome in no doubt. CARMEN'S CANDY JAR stumbled at the start recovering inwards and crashing into ACCELERATING bobbling that rival,
chased three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild kick to secure the place honors. CENTRAL TO SUCCESS broke out a step brushing the off
side stall before brushing TRAIL OF GOLD, prompted the leader along the inside until shaken off at the nine-sixteenths, tipped out three wide near the half
mile pole and gave chase three wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late stages, then got attended to after returning from the gallop out for a heat related issue and was subsequently transported off the course via equine
ambulance. TRAIL OF GOLD got brushed at the start by CENTRAL TO SUCCESS, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the
inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
EPITAPH showed speed and went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his inside, moved clear while dropping from the two path to the hedge early
on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, responded well under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and held under strong urging.
ANNEXPERIENCE was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, rallied inside while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch, gained into the
final sixteenth then swapped to the proper lead and finished with good courage to get the place. MORE THERAPY broke out then hit the gate and was off a
step slow, settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, was put to a drive into upper stretch, rallied alongside the runner-up into the final furlong
and also finished with good courage but missed the place while up for the show. BLAMEITONTHESTONES ran off with the rider during the post parade,
was urged along off the pace, moved from the hedge to the two path late on the turn, came out five wide and bumped with DOOMED into the stretch, was
fanned out near the three-sixteenths pole then drifted out and finished willingly while outside the center of the course. CALLING CARD showed some early
speed, dropped back when crowded outside the half-pole, navigated the turn in the two to three path, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved out
behind a drifting rival around the three-sixteenths pole, pursued the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. SWIFT MAGIC chased the
pace from third, raced inside on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and also lacked the needed kick. DOOMED
settled off the pace, was roused in the three path on the turn then bumped into the six path at the quarter-pole, steadied off heels while fanned out near the
three-sixteenths pole and failed to threaten. BRIMSLEY was ridden along on the outside, went five wide for most of the turn then dropped to the three path
and lacked the needed response. JOEVIA'S FIRST was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to rally. KILLYBEGS KID was
urged along while pressing the pace on the inside of the leader, moved from the inside to the two path while chasing on the turn, turned into the stretch in
the three path under a left-handed crop then drifted out before being switched to a right-handed crop and tired.

Footnotes
SILVER SATIN broke out at the start brushing POMPOUS PRINCE, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand three then two
wide under some pressure inside early on, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and drifted out five wide into upper stretch carrying BOURBON
CHASE out slightly, dug in under threat from that rival and held sway to the finish kept to task. BOURBON CHASE got bumped at the start by DR. KRAFT
when under coaxing and brushed that rival back coming outwards, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got floated out
six wide into upper stretch by the aforementioned foe when that one drifted out, dug in under a drive and shied out under a left handed crop in the late
stages while along clear of the rest and second best. DR. KRAFT had his cocked to the inside when the latch was sprung, stumbled at the start bumping
BOURBON CHASE and then got brushed by that rival before conceding two lengths to the front, chased five to six wide early on before tucking four then
three wide, remained patiently handled until let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, improved a furlong out, then kept on to the finish to procure the
show honors. ELYSIAN MEADOWS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the late stages. POMPOUS PRINCE got brushed at the break by SILVER SATIN, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, went seven wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BARESE a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, prompted the pace just off the
inside and then along the inside, came under coaxing being shaken off with three furlongs to run, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

came under light coaxing leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then put to a right-handed crop in

encouragement in the two then three path on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the five path, pursued the top two into the final furlong and lacked
the needed kick while able to get the show. CALL HER BLUFF was caught in the five path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused late on the
backstretch, chased in the four path on the far turn, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. CALDWELL LUVS GOLD bumped soundly with a

failed to rally. SWEET BROWN SUGAR hit the outside of gate and bobbled then bumped soundly with a foe, made some contact again with that rival then
was pinched back, was hard held while dropping from the six path to the four path on the first turn, settled at the back, came under urging near the

Footnotes
MOONAGE DAYDREAM established a forward position early, raced in the two path early on the first turn, lugged out to the three to four path later on that
bend then dropped back to the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, took the lead when asked at the
quarter-pole, kicked clear under a right-handed crop in upper stretch and held under strong urging. MARVELOUS MAUDE dropped from the three path to
the two path early on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, angled out on the far turn, reached the four path near the five-sixteenths pole, was driven
five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to get up for the place. WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE bobbled slightly at the start then bumped with a
foe, raced between horses in the three path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and finished willingly to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. STONEWALL STAR saved ground while well placed just off
the pace, was roused in the two path outside the quarter-pole, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the trifecta. SILVER
SKILLET bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide early on the first turn, was carried to the five path later on the bend then dropped back to the four
path, settled on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. VENTI VALENTINE was hustled to the front, dropped from the two path to the hedge on the first turn, showed the way while well rated, was
asked along the hedge on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner at the quarter-pole and gave way. LISA'S VISION brushed with a rival after the start,
tossed her head while rank twice early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, angled from the two path to the five path on the far turn, was driven
into the stretch in the six path and lacked the needed response. SPINNING COLORS was keen under restraint into the first turn, moved from the hedge to
the two path on that bend, was rated off the pace, came up empty in the two path on the far turn and faltered.

NORTH END LADY coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch,
rallied and engaged BOBBY M'S GIRL a furlong out and dueled through to the finish gamely with that rival and just got a whisker on the line first. BOBBY
M'S GIRL broke out at the start bumping TOP OF THE TABLE, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in dueling through to the finish in game fashion and just got bested on the wire.
GALLANT GRETA got bumped and jostled near the seven furlong marker before entering the first turn, tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. AUTUMN forwardly placed just off the
inside through the first turn, advanced to take command six and a half furlongs out and showed the way tucked to the inside spurting safely clear, remained
on hold until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, then
weakened in the late stages. TOP OF THE TABLE got bumped at the start by BOBBY M'S GIRL, raced three wide through the first turn, chased three then
two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LUNA PATINA got bumped at the
start by ADDAGIRL ADDIE, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out eight to nine wide into upper stretch and
improved position to the finish. CAPITAL SPENDING chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the drive. SAINTE CHAPELLE broke in at the start bumping LUNA PATINA, then got pinched back between foes and conceded five
lengths to the front, raced along the inside through the first turn and then three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. IN ALL MY DREAMS just off the inside through the first turn, chased two to three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. SINEAD broke out at the start, raced three wide through the first turn, chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. ADDAGIRL ADDIE broke a half a beat slow
and was pinched out at the start conceding four to five lengths before settling into stride, chased just off the inside through the first turn and then three wide
thereafter coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. STARSINTHECITY showed the way early on
before being displaced from command with six and a half furlongs to go, chased along the inside, faded through the far turn along the rail, cornered just off
the inside into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.
