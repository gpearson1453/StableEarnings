win easily. SWEET TOOTH SUE Close up along the rail, angled out and finished well. GEORGE'S VICE In hand four wide, lodged a bid and then drifted out
leaving furlong marker to the wire. RULER OF THE NIGHT Tracked along the three path and weakened. WINE TRAIL Lagged far back, three path midway
around and failed to threaten. SHE LOVES TO MOVE Tracked along the two path to the lane and tired. MADDIE'S SURPRISE Broke sluggishly, four wide,
two path around, was outrun. SWEET SUGAR BABY Hopped at the start, saved ground and tired. NECESSARYANDPROPER Five wide on the turn and
finished wide.
