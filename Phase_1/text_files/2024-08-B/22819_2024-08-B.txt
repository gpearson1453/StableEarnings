ABOVE THE SKY quick to the front, well handled throughout while geared down in the late stages. SHORT ON THE SUGAR no speed to the turn, rallied
along in earnest to close the gap. MIRO MOGO saved ground throughout, kept on in the stretch for show spot. SYLLABUS tried to keep up for a half, gave
in readily in the stretch. LANDY had an awkward beginning from the gate, rushed outside and chased winner to the stretch off rail with nothing left and faded
in deep stretch. PATRIETTIC raced along evenly to the turn, backed up in the stretch run.
