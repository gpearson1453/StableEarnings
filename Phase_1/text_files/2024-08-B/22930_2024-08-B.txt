inside of BOOTSY'S MERLOT when challenged by that rival at the furlong marker, dueled heads apart to the wire and narrowly prevailed. BOOTSY'S
MERLOT raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, moved up alongside of the winner to challenge, dueled to the
wire and just missed. FABULOUS CANDY stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, weakened and held for third. ELEVENMONTHSLATER raced
four wide early, then rated the pace racing two wide, dueled on the far turn and tired. MY JO JO was off slowly, raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn,
then lacked a rally on the rail in the stretch. NO MORE DIAMONDS raced three wide early, stalked between rivals, chased inside on the far turn and faded.
KILLARGUE'S GIRL raced three wide off the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
SKIPPERINI raced two wide off the pace, then stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled between rivals in the final furlong and narrowly
prevailed at the wire. THE PENINSULA raced three wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied farthest outside in the stretch, closed
gamely late ad just missed. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL raced off the pace inside, angled out at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, rallied between
horses and dug in gamely to the finish. AMERICAN UNITY stalked between rivals, continued between foes on the far turn, was steadied in tight lacking
room from the three sixteenths to the eighth pole, then rallied between horses. VON HOFF vied inside for the lead, dueled inside on the far turn, dug in
gamely in the stretch run and was outkicked late. PETIT FILS (FR) tracked inside, chased inside on the far turn, made a rail bid at the furlong marker and
weakened late. BATTALION leapt in the air for an awkward and slow break, raced far back early, moved up three wide on the far turn, then lacked a rally.
THE LAST SCIP raced off the pace inside, then two wide, between rivals on the far turn and faded. MT SURIBACHI raced three wide on the first turn, then
vied two wide for the lead, dueled between rivals on the far turn, was in tight at the eighth pole while tiring.

Footnotes
FLAT LUCKY set the tempo around the first turn, vied inside down the back stretch, felt the pressure from outside rival around the far turn, battelled with that
rival in upper stretch, and kicked away late driving. ZIPPER ZAPPER vied three wide around the first turn and down the backside, put to a drive rounding
the far turn, inched into range in upper stretch, but was out kicked by inside rival to the wire. STEELE MONEY tracked the pace from the inside, bid leaving
the quarter pole, gained ground but was never a threat to the top pair. JARLIAN vied between runners into the far turn, under a very vigorous ride bid
between runners nearing the quarter pole, gave way in upper stretch. WELLING was very slow away from the gate, lagged behind the field for the run down
the back stretch, never threatened.
