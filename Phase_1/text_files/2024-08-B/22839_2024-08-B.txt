FLINNY TIN TIN set the pace along the inner rail, opened up leaving the far turn and held sway under pressure. FUNZALO lacked speed, raced in the two
path between horses around all turns, remained on her left lead in the drive and rallied. SEARCH , three wide on the turns, was never far back and finished
willingly. SKIP THRU DA FIRE , unhurried, angled out entering the second turn, swung four wide leaving the final furlong and showed a late move. JUST
THE THING remained along the inner rail stalked the pace and gave way on the final furlong. GANBATTE prompted the winner and faltered the final
furlong.

Footnotes
JOHN'S PROMISE took command early and set a pressured pace towards the inside, maintained a slim advantage inside a pair of rivals into the lane,
emerged in a nose to nose battle with STRUGAR a sixteenth out, got the better of that one under left handed asks and drew clear. STRUGAR , three wide
tracking a contested pace, moved up under urging and bid three deep past the three sixteenths, sparred on near even terms in mid stretch then was
outkicked from there. BARON'S LEGACY rated forwardly while saving ground, was under pressure pursuing the embattled leaders approaching mid stretch
then lacked a serious finish. LUV YA BYE BYE , sent from the gate, disputed the pace outside the winner, fought on between foes into the lane, lacked a
punch heading to the sixteenth pole and faded. I AM THAT I AM , three to four wide around both turns, chased under a ride nearing the lane but came up
empty. GREAT DAYS AHEAD broke a step slow, raced off the pace and to the inside of a rival, failed to kick on under a ride leaving the quarter pole and
faded.

COASTALNESS angled in mid way down the backstretch, dueled outside RILEY'S CRY BABY, bumped with that one entering the turn and leaving the turn,
drifted to the inner rail when going clear near the sixteenth pole and lasted. CAMPAIGN PROMISES broke slowly, was hard ridden between horses on the
turn, angled out for the drive and closed. RILEY'S CRY BABY hugged the inner rail disputing the pace with the winner and weakened late. OVERNIGHT
EXPRESS , three deep, chased the pace and lacked the needed rally. NEED A MIRACLE , checked in tight quarters mid way down the backstretch,
weakened. MAP TO THE MOON , no factor, raced wide around the turn and checked late on the heels of a rival. GOOD MORNING MERCY , checked in
tight quarters mid way down the backstretch, steadied in traffic into the turn and weakened. An objection by the rider of NEED A MIRACLE against the
winner for alleged soon after leaving the chute was not allowed. An objection by the rider of RILEY'S CRY BABY against the winner for alleged interference
entering the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
EXCELLORATOR settled three wide in range of the leading pair, took closer order under asking into the final turn, was floated out five wide while
threatening into the stretch, straightened and kept on doggedly under stout left handed encouragement and got the better of BOSS LOGIC in the final yards.
BOSS LOGIC was hard sent along the inside and took over into the first turn, cleared and set a rated pace towards the inner rail, was coaxed along as
pursuers gained approaching the quarter pole, began to wander outward under left handed asks past the three sixteenths, corrected soon into the lane,
clung to a slim lead dueling past the sixteenth marker, kept on valiantly but just failed to resist the winner. SEVEN'S ELEVEN broke sharp then ceded to
BOSS LOGIC into the first turn, prompted that one under some rating, was put to pressure and gained into the final turn, lightly steadied as BOSS LOGIC
drifted past the three sixteenths, shifted in with pursuit then faded. CURLIN'S MALIBU lagged off the pace while saving ground early on, angled out nearing
the half, chased two wide into the stretch and offered a belated response. AIN'T DA BEER COLD broke a step slow, was urged along while saving ground
past the half, failed to kick on soon after, faltered and was eased through the lane. An objection by the rider of SEVEN'S ELEVEN against BOSS LOGIC
alleging interference nearing the stretch was not allowed.

MALIBU HOOCH sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and pulled away under a hand ride. GEM RUNNER outside the winner down the
backstretch and around the turn, chased him throughout and held the place. ITSAMONSTAMASH bumped with SEVEN'S MAGIC leaving the chute, stayed
along the inner rail around the turn and failed to menace in an even effort. CURL N ROD broke slowly, circled the turn three wide and passed tired horses.
READY FOR MAGIC raced in the two path around the turn and lacked a rally. SEVEN'S MAGIC , jostled on both sides leaving the chute, remained along
the inner rail on the turn and was no factor. MY GREY HUMOR bumped with SEVEN'S MAGIC then was steadied in tight quarters soon after leaving the
chute.

INEVTABL CONECTION broke sharply and sped to the early lead, was joined from his inside then headed by IRISH HERO entering the turn, stayed on to
duel outside that one around the turn, regained command into the stretch then held firm under a mild drive. IRISH HERO rushed up soon after the start,
advanced to gain a slim lead inside the winner near the half, dueled around the turn, ceded the lead into the lane, fought on past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE , away in good order, chased the duelers three wide, came four wide for the drive and steadily gained through the final
seventy yards. NIELSON chased inside and finished evenly. HE'S ORIENTATE , sluggish at the break, saved ground off the pace and failed to respond.

PHANTOM SPEED , well off the duel, moved up in the three path leaving the far turn, angled to the inner rail in mid stretch, closed and was up near the
finish. HEAD OF THE CLASS bumped with SAME DAY AS L J soon after the break, disputed the pace inside that one, went clear in the two path on the far
turn, drifted out entering the stretch, drifted wide late and gave way grudgingly. SPEIGHTSTER'S STAR , along the inner rail down the backstretch stalking
the duel, eased off the rail leaving the far turn, moved back inside HEAD OF THE CLASS in upper stretch and flattened out. VILALUZ raced near the inner
rail throughout while off the duel and gave way through the stretch. SAME DAY AS L J bumped with HEAD OF THE CLASS soon after the break, dueled
outside that one and faltered. An objection by the rider of SPEIGHTSTER'S STAR against HEAD OF THE CLASS for alleged interference in upper stretch
was not allowed.

GOODBYE NOTE rated off the pace while saving some ground, eased out leaving the far turn then worked between foes, shifted three wide into the lane,
closed furiously under solid handling and nipped PARKERNESS at the wire. PARKERNESS prompted the pace two wide, was asked to go after the leader
entering the far turn, engaged that one soon after and dueled, gained a slim advantage into the stretch, battled head to head past sixteenth pole, kept on
gamely but was edged on the line. GUARDIAN PRINCE took over early, secured the inside then cleared into the first turn, set a rated pace towards the
inner rail, dug in when confronted around the far turn, dueled under coaxing around the turn and through the lane, continued with good effort but wasn't
quite good enough. BANDITSGOLDENCHILD saved ground while under some early rating, dropped back a bit while urged along past the half, altered out in
upper stretch and churned on between foes. WAR MASTER , three wide early, was under a ride around the final turn, altered out to be four wide in upper
stretch and offered a mild response. DIVINE CHILD bore out at the start, corrected and edged up, chased the leaders three wide to upper stretch then
faded.

Footnotes
DREAM RIVER sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, raced in the two path on the far turn and dug in tenaciously late. BIGDADDYSBOY ,
three wide leaving the first turn, advanced four deep entering the far turn, had aim on the leader in mid stretch and hung. LOST WEEKEND raced along the
inner rail on both turns, moved to the two path mid stretch and rallied. DISCREET DEVIL , a forward factor along the inner rail, stalked the pace, advanced
in upper stretch and weakened late. MOONSET raced three wide entering the backstretch, was forwardly placed in the three path between horses into the
far turn and flattened out. BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH stumbled at the start, chased outside the winner and weakened. BATTLE OF BASTOGNE , four wide
the first turn, was outrun. GOLDEN ARM raced along the inner rail was done entering the backstretch.
