NOTION lacked speed, stayed along the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, altered course to the five path in mid stretch and closed on his left
lead. MONCRIEF raced in mid pack around the turn, swung to the four path turning for home and rallied mildly. JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH , in tight quarters
leaving the starting gate, swung to the five path entering the stretch and rallied outside foes. BOSS MAN J J worked between horses in the stretch and
passed tired ones. TALL ORDER , three deep around the turn, chased the pace to the eighth pole and weakened. ONE WAY TRAFFIC bobbled soon after
the start, sped to the early lead, raced along the inner rail and weakened. SIR LANCE , steadied in close quarters about a furlong after the break, raced
along the inner rail and gave way.

Footnotes
CORA'S CHOICE showed speed between foes then was deftly rated back off the contested early pace, moved off the inside around the turn then gained
steam circling four wide into the stretch, sustained a grinding run under pressure, forged past STORM RATE in deep stretch then edged clear nearing the
wire. STORM RATE prompted the pace outside the leader, moved to apply more pressure past the five sixteenths, was guided out to about the three path
when taking command in upper stretch, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, could not fend off the outside charge of the winner but kept on willingly to
be well clear of the rest. SKIP THRU DA FIRE , off the pace while saving some ground, was under asking mid turn, swung out five wide and offered a slight
run to nab the show. BLUE TRILLION broke a step slow, regrouped and moved up between rivals to reach a forward spot, tracked two wide behind the
leaders mid turn, failed to kick on near mid stretch and fade. GOOD STORY , off slow, dropped in around the turn, remained inside to mid stretch, angled
out but lacked a serious finish. FROSTY MAYA set a pressured pace towards the inner rail, ceded command into the lane then weakened in mid stretch.

SHE IS INVINCIBLE (GB) saved ground around both turns while stalking the pace, swung three wide entering the stretch, closed outside DEAD SEXY,
overtook that one near the sixteenth pole and drew off. DEAD SEXY , a forward factor in the two path on both turns and down the backstretch, gained the
lead in upper stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and weakened. KAKE'S TAP DANCER , taken in hand leaving the starting gate, was snugly rated three wide
around the first turn and down the backstretch, remained well off the rail on the far turn, responded when asked near the eighth pole and rallied belatedly.
BELLA ESTRELA assumed the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong.

ENERGY EFFICIENT rated three wide stalking the early pace, edged up to take closer order mid turn, stayed on under a hustling ride pursuing the leader
into the lane, wrested command leaving mid stretch then drove clear. PENNY LOAFER lagged off the pace while saving ground, was put a ride leaving the
far turn, remained inside into the stretch and closed willingly. DUNPHY broke outward and bumped with a rival, corrected and sped to a clear advantage, set
a solid pace towards the inner rail, came out a bit with control into the lane, ceded command leaving mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final
yards. DANCE FOR GREEN prompted the pace two wide to the turn, dropped in to chase around the turn, swung out under a hustling ride into the lane and
faded. TUBTIMSIAM , bumped at the break, was pushed along saving ground past the five eighths, failed to keep pace leaving the three eighths, angled out
and dropped back.

MOLLIE TAPPER , off last, was well back down the backstretch, swung to the five path in upper stretch, rushed up outside horses in mid stretch, led near
the sixteenth pole and lasted. FLOWER MOUND , forwardly placed three wide around the turn, chased the pace through the stretch and finished gamely
between horses. RYE SMILE , unhurried outside horses to the stretch, was behind rivals in upper stretch, altered course to the six path near the eighth pole
and rallied late. EUPHIMA (ARG) saved ground on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and gained late inside the top three finishers. DIVINA DULCE chased
the pace in the two path around the turn, gained a short lead in mid stretch and weakened late. PRINCESS LUCIA saved ground around the turn and lacked
a rally. SHARED AUTHORITY accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. POLICE WOMAN was not a
factor. MIDSUMMERS EVE was outrun.

Footnotes
FAITH AND LIBERTY vied to the inside of REMEMBER ME through the opening three sixteenths, steadied back off that one soon after then angled off the
rail, rated kindly mid turn while stalking, ramped up her run when given a serious cue in upper stretch, leveled off under right handed asks past the furlong
grounds, reeled in REMEMBER ME in deep stretch then edged clear under steady handling. REMEMBER ME vied outside the winner then eagerly cleared
approaching the half, dropped in and widened under some rating mid turn, remained well in front while under a drive past mid stretch, failed to contain the
winner's outside charge but kept on with effort to the wire. CLOSERTOTHEHEART , urged along chasing three to four wide, lacked a serious kick through
the final furlong but did manage to preserve the show. BABY SOX , brushed at the break and was away last, regrouped while off the inside, circled four to
five wide into the stretch but came up empty through the final eighth. DESTINED TO DANCE broke inward brushing with BABY SOX, dropped off the pace
while under coaxing then lacked a stretch response. GORMLEY'S GABRIELA gave pursuit towards the inner rail and weakened.

Footnotes
LADDIE DANCE , sent to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, was still clear in mid stretch and dug in tenaciously late. MILE HIGH MIRACLE ,
bumped and forced in by CONTRIVANCE leaving the starting gate, steadied in traffic near the four and a half furlongs pole, checked in tight quarters
entering the turn, hugged the rail around the turn, angled out in mid stretch and rallied gamely outside the winenr. CONTRIVANCE bumped MILE HIGH
MIRACLE when bearing in at the break, raced along the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and flattened out. ZINGALES KING , four wide
into the turn, moved in entering the stretch, worked between horses and lacked the needed rally. HOLONUI raced in mid pack around the turn, swung wide
entering the stretch and failed to rally. BAND TOUR lacked speed, raced well off the rail around the turn, swung very wide in mid stretch and passed tired
foes. RESTRIKE , bumped by MILE HIGH MIRACLE leaving the starting gate, steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path inside horses
on the turn and weakened. CATEGORY CINCO , wide entering the turn, was no factor. GALACTIC GLORY chased the pace around the turn and gave way.
BLUE REGALIA , steadied behind horses leaving the starting gate, was outrun. SKYLAR'S BROTHER was outrun. ALL FRUITS RIPE , a forward factor
between horses around the turn, gave way.

JUST A FAIR SHAKE broke a step slow, quickly recovered and moved up to contention leaving the chute, relaxed prompting the pace outside LOU'S
BIRTHDAY, engaged that one under a ride soon into the stretch, wrested command under left handed asks in mid stretch, spurted clear then held firm while
kept to steady hand encouragement the final sixteenth. LOU'S BIRTHDAY cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was guided out a path once taken
on near the quarter pole, ceded the lead nearing the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. UNION THUNDER , off
slow, lagged back while saving ground then could only muster a mild response getting past a fading rival. KITTY'S SON , three wide stalking the leaders,
was under a hearty ride past the three eighths, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and weakened.

THE PADDOCK PASTOR , slow to begin, steadied behind horses entering the first turn, circled the turn four wide, advanced four wide on the far turn, swept
to command in upper stretch and drew away under pressure. HANKSDIVININGROD , swung outside leaving the first turn, advanced three wide leaving the
far turn to reach contention and continued willingly. GATTO BE PROUD , steadied in traffic entering the first turn, was unhurried down the backstretch,
worked between horses in the stretch and showed a late move. MICKEY SHILLELAGH , unhurried, raced along the inner rail to mid stretch, angled out and
passed tired rivals. THUNDER LAD assumed the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. SNEAKING SUSPICION ,
steadied in close quarters entering the first turn, was steadied along the down the backstretch while inside horses, was in contention leaving the far turn
then came up empty in the drive. BREAKWATER broke slowly, was caught in traffic through much of the stretch and failed to be a factor. FORMAL AFFAIR
, three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four wide and lacked a rally. K'S STORM READY chased the pace outside THUNDER LAD and gave way in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
MISS NEW YORK broke a step slow, quickly recovered and was afforded an inside path soon into the first turn, took closer order of the clear leader leaving
the five eighths, eased out under a hustling ride leaving the five sixteenths and went on the attack, forged clear under a couple of right handed asks leaving
mid stretch then steadily widened under solid hand pressure. CONTINENTALCONGRES , keyed up when clearing three wide around the first turn, dropped
down towards the rail and took to some rating through the backstretch run, could not resist the winner's charge leaving the three sixteenths but continued on
willingly to be well clear of the rest. MAJESTIC CREED hopped at the break and was away last, regrouped to save ground, was under pressure chasing
past the five sixteenths then went evenly through the final furlong. I'M GITTIN THERE angled off the inside near the seven eighths, prompted two wide
through the backstretch run, was scrubbed upon trying to keep pace leaving the five sixteenths, lacked a response leaving the three sixteenths and
weakened. DOCTOR ABBIE , three to four wide, was urged along into the stretch and faded. CATS INTHE TIMBER , three to four wide while off the pace,
failed to respond around the final turn, dropped back and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SHRUG lacked speed, raced four deep around the far turn, closed outside, overtook AMERICAN MEMORIES near the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
AMERICAN MEMORIES assumed the early lead, set a slow pace along the inner rail and weakened late. STARLIFTER , four wide the first turn, advanced
three wide on the far turn and weakened through the stretch. CHEVY MAN , fractious in the starting gate, chased the pace outside AMERICAN MEMORIES
weakened through the stretch and lugged in near the eighth pole. RAPTOR RAZZLE , rank and steadied on a rival's heels entering the first turn, raced
along the inner rail to the stretch and gave way. BRIGHTY bore out leaving the starting gate, raced forwardly in the three path on the first turn and down the
backstretch and weakened on the far turn.
