MOON FALL settled off the pace about the three path on the opening turn, started his bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path on the
far turn, dug in under steady encouragement from the head of the lane and took over the final yards. VALHALLA'S PALACE raced with the early pace then
took the lead two deep past the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in under
steady handling, but was caught in later yards while able to hold second. LOVE IS WICKED rated close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase past
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished well at the outside withers of the runner-up. REVEREND JACK saved ground
on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then weakened. GREATANDGOOD raced in the five path the first
turn, left the turn outside and closed the gap to the five sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn. HARPERSGONEFISHING rounded the first turn about the
four path and showed little response through the backstretch. RAISE A RUCKUS set the early pace inside, was met past the nine sixteenths pole, faded
readily from that point and was eventually eased.

UNISON set a pressured pace through the backstretch, contested the rail through the turn and held on under steady stretch handling. FIBER STRONG
gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn, dug in to take second later yards and finished well. MR. BUSTA chased through the backstretch, rounded the
turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. CARIBBEAN PLEASURE pressured the pace, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the lane and
flattened stride with a sixteenth to go. EL LUCERITO gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. MARSHALL PEANUT became
fractious in the gate, was never a factor and raced in the four path on the turn. Racing without front shoes, GOLDEN ARM saved ground.

Footnotes
WHERE IS MIKE pressured the pace and took the lead two deep midway on the turn, then dug in under determined handling to last. MONTAUK DADDY
had a brief lead then gave close chase through the backstretch, entered the turn about the four path, drifted through the turn and entered the stretch wide,
but dug in leaving the turn and finished well. CLAW set a pressured pace inside, was met at the rail midway on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. INSIDE
RISK chased outside, entered the turn about the six path, was carried out leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. E J'S REVENGE chased, raced at the
rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. GRAND FIBER chased through the backstretch, entered the turn off the rail, eased outward approaching the head
of the lane then flattened later yards. HEY CONGRATS chased through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn, drifted into the stretch and weakened a
sixteenth away. DAN THE MAN CAN gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn, was carried out toward the head of the lane and weakened.
SHAMELESS APPEAL gave chase while saving ground.
