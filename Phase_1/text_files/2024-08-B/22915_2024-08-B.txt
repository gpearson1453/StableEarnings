Footnotes
BROOKMESA rallied three across on the turn, assumed command, drew off and was ridden out. BOLD BOSS stalked the pace, bid four wide on the turn,
couldn't gain ground in the drive and was no match for the winner. NIGHT QUEST lagged early, advanced inside to the turn, shifted out for the drive and
offered a mild bid to earn show. MUDSLIDE was hustled along to set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back and came up empty in the drive. SOPHIE'S
CRUISER was slow early, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. JET SPIN flashed speed, quickly dropped back and was outrun in an
even effort. JESS'S BREW trailed the field, passed a tiring rival and was not a factor. SIPPIN' TIME vied two across to the turn and stopped.

EXCHANGE moved up along the backstretch, advanced into the turn to challenge for the lead, led briefly, weakened in the drive and settled for show.
HELEONORTIZ got away well, vied inside around the first turn, was checked hard entering the backstretch, fell back, saved ground and had no further
response. OUT OF LUCK went three across on the first turn, vied to the second turn, dropped back and gave way. FLASHNDYNAMITE raced between
horses around the first turn, vied to the second turn, stopped and was not urged late.

Footnotes
BELLA MAMA veered out at the start, was unhurried early and raced outside, made a quick move on the turn, bid nine wide at the top of the stretch,
assumed command near the eighth pole and drew clear under urging. ERA raced mid pack, advanced to the turn, bid four wide, closed steadily and got up
late for place. LADY RAVEN saved ground to the second turn, angled out, bid willingly to threaten, didn't have enough late and was caught for second. VAI
GATTINA lagged early, went widest in the drive, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. COACH CALEY (IRE) broke slowly, dropped inside to
save ground, bid along the rail entering the stretch to get within range, veered in at the gap and hung late. SMOKIN SISTER sprinted clear to set the pace
with a long lead, tired in the drive and faded from contention. SPIN THE MOON settled off the pace in a good position, had nothing left for the drive and
dropped back. BOUNTY KILLAH was never far back, showed speed to the second turn and flattened out.

MISSION MIKE was never far off the pace, raced outside, rallied four wide on the second turn, was carried out entering the stretch, closed steadily and drew
clear late. LUCA IL CAVALLO broke out, pressed the pace to the second turn, assumed command, swung wide entering the stretch, responded to duel,
yielded late and held for place. HIGHWAYMAN saved ground while racing close to the pace, angled out on the turn to get around a tiring rival, bid off the rail
and finished well. THIRTY WEST broke slowly, dropped inside to save ground, rallied on the turn, went eight wide entering the stretch and closed well.
ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE bumped at the start, raced close to the pace along the inside, bid three wide leaving the turn and didn't have enough late.
DOWNPATRICK was never far back, advanced to the turn, went seven wide entering the stretch and hung late. UNAFFECTED was outrun in an even
effort. BALI RIDDIM was not a factor. BIG ANDY MORT broke in and bumped at the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. LATIN JET was hustled

Footnotes
SPECTRIER unhurried and off the early pace, tracked the field from the four path, upped the tempo into the far turn, from an outside position took aim on
the front, engaged the leader in upper stretch, and wore down that rival in the final fifty yards. MINEOLA MIKE vied inside around the first turn and down the
backside, lost a little ground around the far turn, regrouped along the inside in upper stretch, and stayed on well to the wire. DAREDAVITE tracked the pace
from the three path, under urging around the far turn, angled inside nearing the furlong marker and closed the gap willingly to the wire. SECRETARY AT
WAR vied in the two path through the open half mile, poked a head in front around the far turn, under pressure from the outside flattened out through the
stretch run. SAMYAZA vied between runners just off the early pace, set down leaving the three eighths marker, faded through the stretch. HOLLYWOOD
CLOSEUP was very slow away from the gate, trailed the field through out. RUNNIN JOKE tracked the pace from along the inside, lost contact with the field
around the far turn, and weakened through the stretch.
