Footnotes
LITE IT UP LOUIE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming around the turn and gained ground late to
kick clear. ALWAYS SMILING dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend, kicked clear entering the
stretch and was caught in the final furlong but chased that rival onto the wire. TWELVE STARS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early,
navigated the turn from the four path and kept on to the finish. LADY ASTRID bobbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the bend and never threatened. HOTASAPISTOL tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, continued around the
turn in the three path and faded in the lane. SAVONA dueled on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and tired in the
stretch.

Footnotes
OUTOFTHEDARK bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the three path, dueled in upper stretch and kicked clear. CAUGHT OFF GUARD raced in the two path early, led
the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far bend and into the stretch and could not go with the winner in the final furlong, chasing
that rival home from there. DA GHOST raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, continued around the second bend in
the three path and kept on to the wire. MR INSENSITIVE raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the second turn and flattened out in the lane. WHATSYOUROBJECTIVE saved ground early,
settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch.
HAT TRICK JACK raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid. CATRICK
saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and tired from
there. THINKN BOUT DRINKN bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far bend in the two path and was empty in the lane.

BEBOP BABY led the way between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path, dueled in upper stretch, kicked clear while drifting
out in the final furlong and held off a closer to the wire. BREWHOUSE raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, swung out to the five path coming
around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole, switched to the inside in upper stretch and gained ground late from there. MIGHTY GIN GIN chased
the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, dueled in upper stretch while being forced out by BEBOP BABY and
kept on in the final furlong. FOLK HERO raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the two path and passed tiring
horses in the stretch while never threatening. INVINCIBELLA (GB) pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four
