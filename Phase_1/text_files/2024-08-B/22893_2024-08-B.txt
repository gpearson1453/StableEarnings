Forced the issue from between, chased and finished with interest. FIND YOUR JOY Forced the issue, between three deep at the top of the lane and faded.

IDYLL GOSSIP Ducked in causing a chain reaction of bumping at the start, vied for the lead inside appearing to be getting out up the backstretch, made it
around the bend without incident, kicked clear in the lane and under pressure proved best. PASSAGE EAST Close up along the three path, challenged,
chased and finished well. SLOW READY Forced in at the start by the winner, checked, bumped with REMEMBER YOUR WHY, four wide on the turn and
weakened. REMEMBER YOUR WHY Jostled at the start, took up after that, lagged back along the rail, eased out and failed to overcome the poor
beginning. HARD TO LOVE Jostled after that start, checked inside, three path into the turn, four wide around and tired. SADIE WAR LADY Forced the issue
along the two path early and gave way.

late bid. JERSEY GREGG Forced the issue, tracked along the two path into the lane and weakened. ONE WITHEVERYTHING Saved ground and
weakened. KING OF FRANCE Close up along the three path, took the rail into the last turn and tired. REBEL JACKSON Unhurried four wide, five wide into
