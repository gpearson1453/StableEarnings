Footnotes
BRILAND showed speed then moved out behind the leader inside the five-eighths pole, chased that foe from the outside then in the three path on the turn,
gained to make a bid then take the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging. CLAIRE'S CHARM
bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then was pinched back, moved out early then was urged near the rear, moved up around the nine-sixteenths
pole, was taken in hand behind horses coming to the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, was roused at the five-sixteenths pole, turned into
the stretch in the four path, pursued the winner on the outside into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, drew alongside the winner in the
final sixteenth and just missed while well clear for the place. COMPLEX GAL bumped with a rival at the start, established a good position just off the pace,
saved ground while asked on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed response
while clear for the show. RATIONAL THEORY sped clear from the outside post, was coaxed along in the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths pole and gave way. BURIANA broke in and bumped with a foe, moved out under urging
near the five-eighths pole, was ridden along in the four path on the turn then turned into the stretch in the five path and tired. VANILLA SUNDAE veered in at
the start, drifted out early, dropped back while urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the three path and was no factor.

Footnotes
MISS HEBRIDES broke out at the start and was corrected, led briefly before being overtaken for command by the runner up, tracked that rival three wide
through the first turn, chased three to four wide in closest aim down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took over command just outside the quarter pole and swung two to three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth
pole, had some of that margin cut into late and prevailed safely in front at the wire. THE TACO LADY shied out at the start, advanced to establish the front
after the break and showed the way under a rating hold while just off the inside, remained on hold until placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the
front just outside the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the three path straightened away and ran on to cut into the
aforementioned foe's margin late while well clear of the rest for the place honors. JITTERBUG chased along the inside through the first turn and then three
wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the nine-sixteenths, continued three wide through the far turn, angled out six wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild and belated bid to secure the show honors. PAST TENSE shied out at the start, raced three wide through the first turn, chased five then
four wide down the backstretch before continuing four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and was in the midst of weakening when the rider lost the handle on the crop to the left side nearing the sixteenth pole.
MALIBU'S DYNAMITE coaxed from the gate, got lightly coaxed along the inside from the get go, came under a drive half a mile from home, continued along
the inside into upper stretch and tired. APPELLATE stumbled at the start and conceded three lengths to the front before settling into stride, went three wide
through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing tucked to the two path half a mile from home, tipped three
wide into upper stretch, faltered, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
BANK FRENZY was taken up while pinched back between horses after the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled while last but one, dropped
from the four path to the three path early on the far turn, moved to the two path under urging near the three-eighths pole, gained while remaining inside the
leading trio into upper stretch, rallied under a right-handed crop, closed well to make a bid inside the furlong marker, gained the advantage into the final
sixteenth and proved best under good handling. MAKER'S CANDY went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked under threat nearing the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the three path, fought on well
into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while just able to get the place. SHERIFF BIANCO was rated inside on the first turn then well placed down the
backstretch, angled from the rail to the three path early on the far turn then was roused inside the three-eighths pole, made a bid between horses near the
five-sixteenths pole, turned into upper stretch in the four path while still between opponents, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was also
outfinished then just missed the place while able to get the show. CICCIOBELLO went around most of the first turn in the two path then shifted to the three
path, settled on the outside, was roused at the seven-sixteenths pole, gained in the four path on the far turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole,
turned into the stretch in the five path while outside two foes, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then missed the show.
WHITTINGTON PARK was last away then angled in at the rear, saved ground at the rear of the field, came outward in upper stretch and was no factor.
DONEGAL SURGES raced in the three then two path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, came up
empty in the three path on the far turn then retreated, spun into the stretch in the four path and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
TOMMY TWO SOCKS coaxed from the gate, raced four wide in pursuit coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the stretch to issue a challenge threatening for it all inside the final sixteenth and was just up in the shadow of
the wire. RAGING coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with INFLATION NATION to his inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
two to three wide into upper stretch, shook off his main pace rival and dug in under growing threat to the outside and was nailed in the final jumps to the
finish. FORWARD MOVE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch,
closed well to secure the show honors. INFLATION NATION (IRE) coaxed from the start, dueled from the three path with RAGING to his inside, got set
down spinning four wide into upper stretch, got shaken off inside the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. SOLO'S FURY coaxed from the gate,
chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, tipped out an additional
two paths three-sixteenths from home and offered up a mild bid. BUCKORTWO coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PATRIARCHAL broke a half a beat slow and lost his lane at the start, tipped out to
chased five wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped six to seven wide at the head of the stretch
and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
NELSON AVENUE tracked the pace, made a bid in the three path outside the three-eighths pole, took the lead in upper stretch, responded well in the final
furlong and prevailed under steady urging. FLOKI'S FLIGHT brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled, steadied briefly while in tight along the rail at
the three-quarter pole, dropped back and settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path for most of the turn then shifted to the three path, came four
wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner to the finish and willingly earned the place. DIDINGER went to the front, set the pace under pressure from his
inside, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, was urged along passing the three-eighths pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper
stretch, remained on his inside lead under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead inside that marker and was outfinished while
clear for the show. TRIDENT HIT was urged along near the back, saved ground on the turn, angled out into upper stretch then was straightened by the rider
and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. I GOT NO MUNNY was in tight near the three-quarter pole then dropped back and moved out,
settled off the pace, was urged along in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the five path and came up empty. SQUIRE CREEK pressed
the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the turn and tired. SYNTHESIS brushed with a foe while last
away, raced towards the rear, moved from the two path to the four path early on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the five path and was no factor then
eased in the final furlong but walked off. MILTON THE MONSTER bobbled at the start then came outward, was ridden along on the outside, traveled around
the turn in the three path and faltered.

SPIRIT OF ESTHER established the front and was rated on the pace just off the inside and then along the inside, remained under a hold as CORRI FELICE
got on near even terms a half a mile from home and continued very patiently handled as that rival continued on near even terms through the turn and was
even called upon, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, got given a nudge at the three-sixteenths and then was roused nearing the eighth pole
when coming under threat from a pair of rivals to the outside, dug in under a drive and just held on to prevail on the wire. LU'S REDEMPTION three then
two wide through the first turn, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the far turn, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive the outermost of a trio latched on through the final eighth and just missed
at the end. CORRI FELICE four then three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced on the leader to get
on near even terms half a mile from home and tucked to the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive and fought on between foes through the final furlong but missed at the wire. LUCKY AND GORGEOUS chased three then four wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to the finish. WATCH OVER ME four then three
wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
HAYES BAY broke out at the start and was corrected, chased along the inside and then just off the inside, came under coaxing tipped three to four wide at
the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. SAVANNAH DANCER broke out at the start, chased along the inside, got
taken hold of when LIL' HAYADOIN backed away in front just inside the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside
route into upper stretch and tired. LIL' HAYADOIN chased along the inside and then just off the inside forwardly placed through the opening half mile, faded
two to three wide through the far turn and continued two to three wide into upper stretch, faltered in the drive when never extended while flashed the crop to
the right side intermittently to the wire.

Footnotes
KIMCHI CAT tracked the pace on the outside while traveling comfortably, ranged up in the four path on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, took the
lead while set down in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. ICONA MAMA settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, was
guided out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. VIGGIEDAL brushed with a rival while breaking in front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but held the show. ME GOVERNOR brushed with an
opponent at the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, made a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, battled under a drive in
upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. FORTUNA MIA dropped back between horses after the start, was urged along at the rear,
rounded the turn in the three path, moved out in the final furlong and lacked the needed response. OBLIGING was urged along on the outside, went around
the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the five path and failed to rally. ABIENTOT dropped back after the start then angled in at the rear, was
ridden along towards the back, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.

BARRON'S BOUNCE coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, took over when ready near the quarter pole and spun
just off the inside into upper stretch nudging WAFLR back inside, drifted out at the three-sixteenths and then drew clear under a drive to prevail. TIZ THE
PRINCE stumbled at the start and was pinched back conceding five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two to three wide detached at the
tail of the field, came under coaxing at the half mile pole and raced just off the inside through the far turn making ground, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and had to pause off heels of SENEGAL straightened away, then altered out when that foe was herded and bumped by ALBEDO and in turn
bumped BERNING BEAUTY into NEPTUNE BEACH in a chain of bumps at the three-sixteenths, got engaged by his rider and offered up a mild kick
showing good courage after a rough journey to procure the place honors. ALBEDO brushed the off side stall at the start, was along the rail when NEPTUNE
BEACH tucked directly in front and was forced to check with seven and a half furlongs remaining, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out to the six path bumping SENEGAL and commencing a string of bumps and alters out
through NEPTUNE BEACH, then kept on to secure the show honors. WAFLR coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole, yielded the front just outside that station and went to spin into upper stretch from the two path but was nudged back inside
by BARRON'S BOUNCE, dug in fighting on to the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. BERNING BEAUTY broke out at the start and was
corrected, went three wide through the first turn before chasing along the inside down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the far turn coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, got bumped by TIZ THE PRINCE at the three-sixteenths when ALBEDO tipped out
bumping SENEGAL to their inside forcing the alter out of a quartet and in turn bumped NEPTUNE BEACH, then weakened through to the finish. SENEGAL
coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn before chasing three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside at the half mile pole,
came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, had ALBEDO tip out to his inside with three-sixteenths to go and
was bumped by that foe, then altered out carrying out a trio of rivals out as ALBEDO made his way from the inside to the six path before straightening away,
lost the handle on the crop to the right side nearing the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. SLOW DOWN BIG ANDY struck the off side stall at
the start, chased just off the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch, tipped four wide placed to coaxing at the half mile
pole, went five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. KILKERRAN coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. NEPTUNE BEACH coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, got bumped by BERNING BEAUTY and altered out at the three-sixteenths when caught in a
chain of bumping begun by ALBEDO tipping out, then tired through to the finish. ROUGH GUY got bumped at the start by TIZ THE PRINCE, who recovered
outwards from a stumble, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch hand faltered
in the drive. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole. After review, the result was allowed to stand prior
to the race being declared official.
