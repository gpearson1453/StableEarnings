Footnotes
MISS TENA MARIE rated between horses, picked up her pace on the bend, swung out widest for the stretch run, took over with a sixteenth left and was
drawing away from the rest. HAPPY WORLD bumped shortly after the break, shared the lead outside BIG SALLY, moved ahead two wide on the turn,
began to drift out under left-handed pressure nearing the sixteenth marker and did not have enough left to hold back MISS TENA MARIE. HER NAME WAS
LOLA rated off the early speed while inside, closed the gap through the turn, came into the lane behind HAPPY WORLD, gained a clear path inside the final
furlong but could only make up minor ground late. MISS DUTTON was checked when her path was taken leaving the chute, settled, commenced her bid
three wide on the turn, reached contention in the lane, altered out abruptly when HAPPY WORLD took her path just inside the sixteenth marker, was
checked off MISS TENA MARIE'S heels, her rider lost his crop with seventy yards left and finished evenly. BIG SALLY bumped HAPPY WORLD shortly
after the break, disputed the pace from inside but gave way through the stretch. The rider of MISS DUTTON lodged an objection claiming interference from
HAPPY WORLD deep stretch. After their review, the stewards disqualified HAPPY WORLD for coming out with being clear of MISS DUTTON and placed
HAPPY WORLD fourth.

Footnotes
TENSE set the pace off the rail, was let out as she angled in entering the turn, moved clear, lengthened command under urging upper stretch and was
allowed to coast nearing the wire. VASARIAH'S IMAGE prominent from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, drifted out some under left-handed
urging upper stretch, was straightened, took over second nearing the sixteenth marker, closed the gap in the late going but was too late. WILDWOOD
TRIPLE boxed in between rivals early, angled out widest on the turn, was forced out further by VASARIAH'S IMAGE upper stretch and also was closing in
on the easing-up leader in the waning yards. TOO MUCH TUESDAY moved to the inside early on, continued to save ground through the bend, angled out
some near the sixteenth pole and made up minor ground late. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY pressed TENSE from outside on the backstretch, was two wide taking
the turn, yielded from between horses upper stretch and was steadied when TOO MUCH TUESDAY narrowed her path with a sixteenth left.

SHORT STRAW bumped with CAT TALE BREEZE at the start, soon sprinted away from the rest, was roused with two furlongs to go, floated out some
under urging in the lane but maintained full control. CAT TALE BREEZE bumped with SHORT STRAW at the break, was altered out some, raced in the
second flight between rivals, moved clear for second three wide on the turn, stayed outside the drifting SHORT STRAW and closed the gap on that one
through the waning yards. SCRAPPY PATCH moved to the inside after two furlongs, began her bid, dueled for second from inside the final sixteenth but did
not have enough left nearing the wire. SCAPITURE in the second flight from inside on the backstretch, angled out some on the bend, came into the lane just
outside CAT TALE BREEZE and had no late bid. TU ROYAL chased from outside, improved position four wide on the turn, came widest into the stretch and
began to fade.

SEMINOLE BEACH broke on top, was rated off the early speed from outside, asked into the turn, took the bend four wide, bumped with VIOLENT GIGI into
the lane, dueled outside that one, edged ahead inside the last eighth and narrowly held on from between horses. SWISS GUARD vied for the lead between
rivals in the early going, did not keep up two wide into the turn, angled outside SEMINOLE BEACH at the top of the stretch, was all out, came up sort but
caught VIOLENT GIGI for second nearing the wire. VIOLENT GIGI prominent between horses, was in tight quarters between SWISS GUARD and
SEMINOLE BEACH into the bend, edged ahead three wide on the turn, bumped with the latter entering the stretch, fought gamely but slowly yielded inside
the final furlong. DUST DANCER displayed early speed from inside but began to yield after three furlongs.

Footnotes
AIR GERRI shared the lead from inside, moved clear and came off the rail some on the bend, floated to path three into the lane, lengthened command and
maintained complete control under a late drive. HARPER BRIANA settled inside, swung out widest on the turn, lost further ground coming into the stretch
from path six, took over second inside the last eighth and drew off for the place as she closed the gap on the leader the final sixteenth. MURPHY'S COMBO
broke on top, was hustled along to dispute the pace outside rivals, did not stay with AIR GEM as she lost ground four then five wide through the bend, and
weakened the last furlong. SNOW GLO soon trailed, stayed well off the inside throughout and passed tired ones deep stretch. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE
vied for the lead between horses, did not keep up three wide on the turn, moved to the inside upper stretch and steadily faded. PASSING PASSION
displayed early speed between horses, began to fade two wide before finishing three furlongs and returned bleeding from her nostrils. QUEEN GITA
hesitated then altered in for a clear path at the break and showed little thereafter.

DANZA TAXI forced in some after the break, bumped with SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY, advanced between horses to vie for the lead two wide on the turn,
floated out some entering the stretch, battled outside WILDWOOD SICILIAN, slowly edged ahead inside the last furlong and shook free the final seventy
yards. WILDWOOD SICILIAN angled in some while being hustled away from the gate, quickly moved clear and took the inside, was challenged after a
quarter mile, fought gamely through the lane but did not have enough left in he late going. ARROW STRIKE forwardly placed between horses, was three
wide on the turn, angled out widest at the top of the lane, was forced out by SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY upper stretch, made up minor ground inside the last
eighth and caught BUREAU for third. BUREAU prominent two wide, found himself boxed in behind DANZA TAXI on the bend, angled outside that one when
a path opened upper stretch, moved clear for third but began to wear down in the waning yards. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY was bumped and shuffled back
shortly after the break, advanced outside, came into the lane four wide, retreated as he drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path the last eighth but
continued to fade.

Footnotes
RUNNING WATER soon vied for the early lead, drew clear after the first furlong, showed the way in hand, was roused at the top of the stretch, began to
wear down nearing the final sixteenth but kept REDFIELD at bay. REDFIELD chased in midpack toward the outside, altered in nearing the turn, fanned out
to path three into the stretch, moved clear for second from between horses inside the last eighth, drifted out some nearing the sixteenth marker, was
straightened but too late for the win. NATIONS DREAM chased from inside, picked up his pace leaving the bend, rallied belatedly along the rail the final
furlong but got up for third in time. TIZWOW chased from between horses, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn, battled for second upper stretch
but gradually yielded inside the last eighth. WICKED GUS without speed while between horses, was boxed in behind REDFIELD early in the turn, got
through three wide with a quarter mile left, fanned outside the latter entering the stretch, lost his path REDFIELD with a sixteenth left and had to alter inside
shortly after that. SOMNUS broke alertly, was overtaken after the first sixteenth, chased RUNNING WATER from outside, was three to five wide taking the
turn, fought to hold second between rivals but began to slowly wear down in the late going. MR. CHIVAS chased from outside, retreated three wide on the
bend, swung out behind SOMNUS for the stretch run and had little to offer. GUN IT AND RUN IT soon trailed, angled to the outside into the turn, was widest
through the bend and came up empty for the drive.
