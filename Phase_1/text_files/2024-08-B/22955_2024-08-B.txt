MONIKER pressed the pace inside, angled out entering the turn, swung wide, closed willingly and drew off under urging. POOF HE'S GONE was off a step
slowly and crowded at the start, moved up outside to challenge three across, vied to mid stretch, was outclosed and all out for place. HOT CHARLIE broke
out, vied to the turn, was taken back from between horses, swung wide into the stretch, came again and got up for show in a good effort. STORMIN FAST
was slow early, saved ground, angled out into the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and finished well. AWESOME STORM broke out, vied for the lead
early, was taken back and dropped in, got boxed in to the turn, bid along the rail and failed to rally. GO FOR THE LAUGH broke out, set a pressured pace
while racing well off the rail and stopped mid stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TRUTH SEEKER was unhurried early, raced outside, went widest in the drive, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides.
LIBERTY FOREVER broke slowly, advanced inside on the turn, bid willingly, got a head in front near the sixteenth pole and was caught near the wire.
FASTTRAINTOTEXAS set a pressured pace, drew clear on the turn, swung wide into the stretch, led to late stretch and was outclosed. BYE BYE BOBBY
raced close to the pace, angled out on the turn, angled in in the upper stretch, angled back out near the sixteenth pole and lacked the needed rally. KING
BARON pressed the pace three across, fell back on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and faded from contention. BRADY BOY pressed the pace,
fell back on the turn and gave way. MIDNIGHT SPLIT was rated back at the start, dropped inside to save ground, was not urged and trailed the field.
