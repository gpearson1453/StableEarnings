Footnotes
GET RIPPED pressed the pace from two wide to midway through the final turn where he took the lead, inched away into the stretch and drew off. CATHY'S
BOY was off a step slow then moved up to stalk the pace from three wide down the backstretch and fell back slightly on the turn but made a late run in the
stretch to be up for the place. SWEET PRESENT was unhurried down the backstretch then made a three wide bid to move up around the turn and made the
late rally and missed the place. STATLER sprinted to the front to take the pressured lead to midway through the final turn, kept on but yielded late. MUCHO
MACHO CAM tracked the leaders from the inside but was not a factor. LEONARDO CREED saved ground around the first turn while racing in the middle of
the pack but was not a threat. RODE BOSS trailed the field and was not involved.

Footnotes
PNEUMA shared the command from the two path to the five sixteenths pole then inched away and shifted in near the quarter pole and drew off in the
stretch. MEGANS MILLIONS tracked the leaders from the two path through the final turn then shifted out to three wide in upper stretch and gave the late
kick to be second best. ANGEL AND ME trailed the field to the half mile marker then made a three wide bid around the final turn for a rally and had her best
strides late. NUNOFTHISNUNOFTHAT shared the command from the inside to the five sixteenths pole, kept on but had to check near the quarter pole and
gave way. SHEZA CAT hesitated at the start to spot the field several lengths then rushed to contention from three wide to the turn and flattened out.
THURSDAY MORNING was rank leaving the gate then chased the leaders to the quarter pole but failed to menace. LASSAROCK raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside to the turn then dropped back.

AMERICAN DOLLARS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside while matching strides with J B GRAY to the quarter pole then cut the corner into the
stretch and battled inside of MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT and inched away late to prevail. MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT was allowed to settle at the back down the
backstretch then made a four wide bid at the three furlong marker and engaged AMERICAN DOLLARS in upper stretch and fought gamely but was
outkicked. J B GRAY raced in the middle of the pack outside of AMERICAN DOLLARS while matching strides with that one to near the quarter pole where
he ran into traffic but kept on to make a rebid to be along for show. LE MONSTRE RAPIDE was hustled along to prompt the pace around the first turn then
took the lead near the five furlong marker and pulled away to upper stretch and tired. STAR READY rushed to the clear lead around the first turn then was
collared at the five furlong marker and kept on to the three furlong marker before giving way.

CRYPTOZONIC tracked the leader down the backstretch then launched a bid midway through the turn to run down the leader at the eighth pole and drew
clear. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE went to and unchallenged lead for five furlongs then tired but was able to hold on for the place. HELAIRE raced in the middle
of the pack from two or three wide then moved up from three wide around the turn and was gaining late on the place. JOHNNYSJOURNEY was void of
speed down the backstretch then moved between horses near the five sixteenths pole and passed tired ones in the stretch. JUJU NINETEEN raced near
the back down the backstretch then made a mild three wide bid on the turn and tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but faltered. LIL WOADIE raced in
the middle of the pack on the inside through the turn but lacked the late response. HAIL THE CAT chased the leader to the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CALLIN FOR DOLLARS was unhurried around the firs turn then steadily advanced from three wide down the backstretch, moved between horses at the
three furlong marker, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and cruised home. TAKE IT TO COURT was bumped by HONEY PAT leaving the gate then
settled in the middle of the pack, moved between horses at the half mile marker and kept moving up from three wide around the final turn to make the rally
and held the place. BALITRIX raced off the pace on the inside down the backstretch then fell back on the turn but made a rebid to be up for the show.
CHARMING LEAH prompted the pace from the two path around the first turn then engaged the leader near the half mile marker and took the lead at the
three furlong marker but was eclipsed at the three sixteenth pole and was outfinished. DEES LITTLE GIRL was allowed to settle near the back while saving
ground down the backstretch then made a bid on the final turn to improve position. POWER OF PRAYERS was off slow and raced near the back down the
backstretch then made a bid on the final turn to pass tired rivals. HONEY PAT broke inward leaving the gate and bumped with TAKE IT TO COURT then
rushed to a clear lead to the half mile marker, kept on the the three furlong marker before giving way. KOLLYNS JULIE was forwardly placed from three
wide around the first turn then raced four wide down the backstretch and faded. UTSIRA stalked the pace from two wide to the half mile marker and

Footnotes
EUROSTORM was forwardly placed from the two path then drove past the leader at the quarter pole and drew off to prove best. TWO JET rushed up to be
off the pace and continued to move up from three wide around the turn but was no match for the winner. COMMUNICATIONISKEY chased the leaders
around the turn then floated out slightly into the stretch but gave a late kick to be up for the show. DREAM TOWN popped the stall gate open prior to the
start then raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground and showed the late interest in the stretch to improve her position. SCRAPBOOK raced in the
middle of the pack from three wide and failed to menace. SUMITUP hustled to a clear lead and set the pace for the first half then was headed near the
quarter pole and tired. MILA'S KAT trailed the field and was outrun.

BERLAINE settled off the pace to the final turn then moved up making a rail bid in the early stretch run then shifted out to two wide in the final sixteenth and
made a late surge to prevail. KENTUCKY CAJUN sprinted to a clear lead to set the pace to deep stretch and fought gamely in the final sixteenth but was
denied. RUN DREAMING raced near the back through the final turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch to make the late bid to be up for the show.
CORA'S LEGACY prompted the pace from two wide but lacked the late response. BLUSHING BELLE raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground
down the backstretch then made a mild bid in the stretch but was empty. C. C. HARBOR tracked the leaders down the backstretch then fell back on the turn
and finished evenly. XTRA SPICY trailed the field and was not a threat.
