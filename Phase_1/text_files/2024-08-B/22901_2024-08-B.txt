Footnotes
HAZARD PAY set the pace while bearing out, drifted out slightly through the turn, maintaining the advantage, then straightened in the lane, turned back a
bid and drew off. BOUJIE BETZ tracked the pace, steadied on the leader heels into the turn, waited, came through inside of that one into the stretch, then
made a steady gain inside, was no match the final furlong, while clearly best of the rest. HER LUCKY DIAMOND never far back, saved ground through the
turn, angled widest in the stretch, then closed well for the show. VALIANT KEEVA well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the
turn, then faded into the stretch. GIGIL was never involved.

Footnotes
UNCLE CAESAR tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drew
off late. STRATEGYFORYOU sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the late going then weakened and held the place.
BROMISTA mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. HARBOUR BRIDGE
unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled widest, then drifted in slightly and got up for a
share. SEMINARIAN mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong.
MICHAELSHATRICK stalked the pace outside and faded through the second turn. EL CHAPIADOR was no factor. MY DUDE BILLY steadied and lost his
path at the start, then was no factor. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
ELM STREET sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, shook clear again through the second turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
SIGMUND stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then
was no match for that one and held the place. NEW BERN mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch,
made a steady gain and edged up for the show. BALLINDINE mid pack, angled in through the second turn, steadied from a fallen rival through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and was outfinished for the show. TRAVELLER well placed and outside, held position three wide through the
second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, then evened the final furlong. DUKE SKYWALKER unhurried, angled out through the
second turn avoiding a fallen rival, then passed tiring in the lane. RAPA NUI was never involved. SNIP THE ROSES was no factor. DIABLO DADDY tracked
the pace, clipped heels through the turn, falling and loosing the rider, then was taken off in the horse ambulance. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
RUNNING OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
