under a long drive and gave in during the late stages. SWEET STAR was three wide along the first turn, chased the pace down the backstretch two wide,
was in the two path into the lane while making a bid, was bothered a bit in the upper stretch and flattened out late in the drive. TRIUMPHANT SPIRIT was

into the first turn and was never a factor. IBUKI tracked the pace early along the inside, was steadied nearing the lane from the rail and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
WHAT'S CRACKIN set the pace from the outset, raced in the two path into the lane and drew clear late in the stretch under a steady drive. CALLAS trailed
the field early on, raced in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was up for place in the final stages. SHE'S MAGIC raced three wide along
the first turn and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late and prevailed for show at the wire.
YZZY'S BOLT raced between horses along the first turn, tracked the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch
but weakened and missed show at the wire. MISSY BEE was unhurried early on, raced in the four path into the lane with a belated gain late in the stretch
run. FLORIS was on the inside along the first turn, raced in the three path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. PERCEPTIVE raced three
wide along the first turn, stalked the pace early on, was in the two path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. GRACE GIVEN was four wide along the
first turn and tracked the pace early on, raced in the three path into the lane and faded late. LUBU raced between horses along the first turn, was in the two
path into the lane and lacked a bid.
