Footnotes
NORTHVALE ROAD bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked outside, bid in the four path passing the quarter, took the lead at the top of the lane, and
gamely held off an inner foe. ABSOLUTE CHAOS bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the outer leader from the three path, bid from the rail
entering the stretch, dug in to sustain that bid into the final furlong, but was edged out by an outer foe to place. COLONEL BARTON tracked inside, angled
out to the five path turning into the stretch, and ran on for show. SHADOW MATTER broke out and bumped an outer foe, rated in the four path, was driven
around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly. MYSTERIOUS TALE set the pace in the four path but faded in the
stretch. DEFINE got bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace, was ridden in the five path around the turn, floated out to the eight path in upper
stretch, but did not factor. UNCLE NICK chased in the four path but made no impact. AFTER FIVE bumped an outer foe and steadied at the start, trailed
early and did not threaten. CROOKED FELLOW tracked in the two path but weakened. HOODOO BROWN got bumped by an inner foe at the start, dropped
wellback early and never menaced.

Footnotes
JOLLY SAMURAI chased in the six path, swung from the seven path into the lane, and rallied clear of inner rivals. MISSING ROCKS stalked in the five path,
bid turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. BERGHEIM set the pace in the two path, kept on from the two path entering the stretch, but was
outfinished by an outer pair to show. STORM ON THE BEACH trailed in the four path and made no impact. TEXAS CREED prompted the pace in the three
path but faded along the inside in the stretch. CHOICE NOT CHANCE pressed in the four path, bid between foes passing the quarter, but weakened.
BROOKLYN ALLEY CAT rated inside, had to check passing the three-eighths pole, and never threatened. DEBUTANTES DELIGHT raced off the pace in
the three path but was no menace. BAR HOPPIN BILLY tracked in the two path but backed up around the turn.

MEDIA MOGUL rated in the six path, ranged up under coaxing to take aim at the top of the lane, and rallied clear of inner foes. COUSIN LARRY pressed in
the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, and ran on for place. BANDERA AZTECA set the pace in the two path, came under a ride entering the
turn, kept on entering the stretch, lost the lead before the eighth pole, but held show. FIREBALL BIRDIE stalked in the four path, was driven three wide
around the turn, but was one paced. MENA raced in midpack from the five path but finished evenly. HEIR TO GREATNESS rated inside but made no
impact on his left lead. SEVEN FLAT chased in the four path and never threatened. STELLAR TAP raced off the pace in the three path and never menaced.
IN FORM tracked in the two path but weakened. DEL MOON prompted the early pace between foes but gradually faded. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT dropped
well behind early, was eased into the stretch, walked across the line, then walked off.

into the final furlong, stuck her head in front inside the final sixteenth, and held on. AVAILABLE STAR raced in midpack from the two path and rallied up the
rail in the stretch for place. BALSA chased between foes in the four path, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, and ran on to get up for show.
TWENTYONE N CHANGE tracked inside, waited around the turn, then got stuck behind a wall of horses in upper stretch, and stayed on. JACKMAN'S RIDE
set the pace in the two path, was roused midway around the turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, and dug in, but yielded late. PRINCE

of the lane, but was one paced. SATURDAY'S GOLD raced wellback in the four path and never threatened. SIGN OF WAR trailed in the five path and never
