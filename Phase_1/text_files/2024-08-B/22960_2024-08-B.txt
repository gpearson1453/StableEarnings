Footnotes
OSKAR MARTINEZ (IRE) pressed the pace from between rivals to the turn, assert himself taking control on the bend, kicked clear turning for home and
pulled away in the lane unthreatened convincingly. CONTEMPLATION stalked the dueling pacesetters from the fence, tipped out to split horses on the turn,
angled back to the inside in upper stretch and closed well with a rail rally to be second best. ELON dueled on the early lead from three wide, loomed at the
head of stretch and kept-on willingly while unable to gain on the leader. LORD OF MISCHIEF sped to the early lead from the fence, dueled to midway on the
turn, dropped out of contention in upper stretch and came on again late to hit the board. ENZO reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied four wide on the
bend and failed to sustain the bid in the lane finishing evenly. HOBBS unhurried early to be near the back of the pack, circled seven wide and showed mild
interest in the lane. GRAND KINGDOM trailed most of the way never proving a threat. HOLLY LOVES STOOPS was well placed just off the leaders to the
top of the stretch and flattened out in the lane.

Footnotes
AMALFI DRIVE hustled early to gain position, settled in hand to stalk from the rail, gained ground on the turn from the inside, waited for racing room upper
stretch, split rivals nearing the eighth pole to instantly take command and drew off as much best. MY CHARM slow early to be the trailer through the turn
and rallied with a steady belated advance down the stretch to be second best. LIBITINA set the pace on a clear, well measured lead, had no answer when
engaged by the winner in upper stretch and weakened through the drive. KIP THE DISTANCE went evenly never posing a threat. POPSTYLE broke alertly
to prompt the pace down the backstretch and steadily faded midway on the turn.

Footnotes
UNSOLVED MYSTERY pressed the pace for the first quarter, took command on the turn, drew clear in upper stretch and was unthreatened down the lane
in a convincing performance. SHEILAHS WARCLOUD reserved off the pace racing in the trailing quartet and made a steady rally from the quarter pole to
the line to gain the place. GIVE ME KISSES stalked the pace into the turn, rallied to loom on the bend and finished evenly unable to sustain the bid.
GOLDEN CHARM raced in the back bund, rallied to contention and kept on through the lane without impact. FEE tracked the leaders from the fence and
failed to mount a rally. KISSEDBYANANGEL chased the leaders from between rivals and dropped back as a non-threat turning for home. CHIEF LADY
flashed brief speed to set the pace and was through early.

Footnotes
AMERICANDREAMMAKER unhurried for the first five-eighths, rallied five wide into the far turn, rallied well down the lane, was well handled being kept from
lugging in down the lane and prevailed late in the drive. ITS SATISFACTUAL reserved off the pace down the backstretch, rallied five wide through the far
turn to take command between calls and was out-finished in the drive to be second best. MENDEE stalked the pace throughout from four wide to be
prominent and finished with a mild bid through the lane to hold the show. STRATOSPHERIC tracked the leaders from between rivals through the far turn
and failed to mount a closing bid. H M LEGACY prompted the pace to the far turn, rallied to loom on the final bend and weakened in the lane failing to
sustain the rally. PRINCESS BUTTERCUP went evenly never posing a threat. SPENDALOT trailed to late in the lane as a non-factor. VOLTA D'ORO set a
well rated pace and stopped in the stretch.

WAR HUMOR stalked the pace through the turn, responded when called upon turning for home, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter inside the
eighth pole, dueled with that one down the lane, took the advantage over VIRGINIA FITZ in the final hundred yards and just held off the runner-up at the
wire in a game effort. SAIL THESEVEN SEAS reserved off the pace near the rear of the field down the backstretch, was held up into the turn off heels,
rallied cutting the corner turning for home, angled out in upper stretch, drifted further wide, straightened away finding best stride late and closed well surging
near the wire to just miss. VIRGINIA FITZ broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, sped off to a clear advantage shortly away from the gate, maintained
that lead to the top of the lane, dug-in battling from the rail when engaged in mid-stretch and was just outkicked late in the drive in a valiant try. GO TO
BINGO tracked the leaders through the turn and chased them down the lane unable to gain grounnd. WHENEVERUREMEMBER reserved off the pace
racing three wide in the back half of the field and failed to mount a closing bid. DEDICATED HERO raced in contention through the turn and came up empty.
LISTENING trailed throughout as a non-factor.

SKY'S NOT FALLING set the pace under mild pressure through well rated fractions, kicked clear when called upon turning for home and was not seriously
threatened in the lane. EVAN HARLAN rank between horses down the lane the first time, settled in hand to be reserved off the pace down the backside,
was held up lacking racing room into the far turn, split rivals turning for home and finished well while unable to catch the winner who had gotten the jump.
KENDAMA prompted the pace throughout, was no match for the winner and kept-on well in the lane to hold the show. RUDDY BUDDY unhurried early to be
near the rear of the field for thee first half, commenced a wide rally on the far turn, and showed good late interest in the lane from seven wide. HAY CHIEF
slow early to trail, made a steady advance nearing the quarter pole to be gaining late. WOW WHATA SUMMER raced wide throughout and lacked a closing
rally. JUNGLE BEAST fractious in the gate prior to the break, trailed to upper stretch and passed tiring rivals late. TOLAGA BAY tracked the leaders from
the inside to be in contention on the far turn and finished evenly after being in-tight quarters midway down the lane. PASSION PLAY stalked the pace from
four wide and tired after three-quarters.

Footnotes
TUFANI broke alertly to be on top, was taken in hand to settle off the pace, tracked the leaders from the rail down the backstretch, confidently handled on
the far turn waiting to tip out turning for home, rallied from four wide to quickly take control and was not challenged in the lane. CIRCLE HOME unhurried for
the first three-quarters, rallied on the turn, circled seven wide and was closing well to be gaining late. SURYA reserved off the pace, rallied up the fence on
the turn, angled five wide at the head of the lane and finished well to just miss the place. GALILEI tracked the leaders from two wide through the far turn and
lacked a closing bid. REGALED trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the final eighth. NEXT EPISODE set the pace through dawdling fractions
for three quarters and weakened steadily in the stretch. CHARMED WAY well placed to be prominent from four wide to midway on the far turn and lacked a
response when called upon faded toward the back of the field coming home. NAVAL EMPIRE prompted the slow pace for three-quarters and gave way.

Footnotes
DETERMINED KINGDOM pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the lane, took command in upper stretch opening a clear advantage, drifted out
down the lane and held the closer safe. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, rallied in upper stretch while angling
inside and was gaining steadily. GOING UP well placed off the leaders along the fence angled two wide turning for home around the tiring pacesetter and
rallied mildly to be along for the show. SLIPPIN JIMMY slow early to trail and mounted a good belated rally in the lane. CELTIC CONTENDER reserved off
the pace, angled out to the six path turning for home and was grinding through the stretch. SPIRITED SOL chased the leaders from six wide on the turn,
made mild bid in upper stretch and flattened out coming home. NOTION failed to menace. GRATEFUL BRED was never a serious threat. ODINSON
tracked the leaders to midway on the turn, split rivals to be in striking position on the bend and failed to respond when called upon for the drive. KING
KONTIE hustled to make the lead, set the pace under constant pressure and gave way turning for home.

CHARMED (GB) broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, responded when called upon in upper stretch to
kick clear and controlled convincingly. GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) pressed the pace to the turn, mounted a bid at the quarter pole to threaten, was no match for
the winner and kept-on willingly to hold the place. OLYMPIC RUNNER unhurried in the early going to be at the rear of the field, circled six wide coming
home and closed well to just miss the place. READIER reserved off the pace through the turn, mounted a rally at the head of the stretch, split rivals midway
down the lane and closed well. SIDE EYE tracked the leaders from four wide though the turn and lacked a closing kick in the lane. VINSANITY went one
paced in mid-pack. LUCCI stalked the pace from four wide to be prominent turning for home and weakened down the lane. BY THE SEY SHORE hustled
early to keep pace and never posed a threat. A G DIAMOND prominently placed along the fence through the turn and faded in the stretch. JUST SAY
WHEN chased from three wide and tired coming home dropping to the rear.
