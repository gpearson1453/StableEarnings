Footnotes
A REAL JEWEL raced up close outside the pacesetter early, tapped right handed at the three-eighths pole to challenge, took over at the five-sixteenths pole
and vied between runners to the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, had the rider put the crop away late and held safely. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE brushed
with inner rival then climbed early, tracked between runners, went two wide into the turn, steered out and came five wide into the lane, finished well from
outside while drifting out to gain second but could not reach the winner. ROMAN EMPRESS brushed with outer rival early, stalked in hand and was guided
to the inside, tipped out late on the bend and was along for the show honors. SHANGHAI SUNRISE stalked the top pair outside rivals, challenged three
deep on the turn, fought in the four path turning for home, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. JUST A LITTLE LUCK showed good
early speed to take the front and set the pace under mild pressure, vied inside a pair of rivals on the turn and lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, could
not keep up with the winner approaching the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
SARWAR (FR) dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, shook free at the top of the lane and remained clear to the wire under
urging. IRISH PROPHET stalked dueling pair along the inside, roused late on the far turn, finished determinedly inside REIQUIST late and edged that rival
for second. REIQUIST dueled outside SARWAR to the top of the lane, could not keep up with that rival in upper stretch, stayed on through the final furlong
and got edged for second. DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) stalked three deep then moved into the two path around the first turn, traveled outside MALIBU
COAST at the back in the middle stages, tipped out into the stretch, came with a mild late bid but needed to find more. AH JEEZ rated in the two path
outside a rival, ridden along on the far turn, moved out in the drive and could not produce a bid. MALIBU COAST was in pursuit between runners early then
lost his path and started to climb, trailed in the two path into the first turn then started to pull, continued to tug at the rear on the backstretch, saved ground
through the far turn, looked to rally but lacked room through the final furlong behind rivals.

Footnotes
JOURNEY D' ORO off alertly then pressed the pace from outside, dueled leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted over to the rail, corrected
with the left hand and drew off. LETTHELIQUORTALK took control from JOURNEY D' ORO and set the pace under pressure from that rival up the
backstretch, dueled into the stretch, yielded to the winner shortly after and stayed on to secure second. SMOKEM EZ off slow to begin, climbed at the back
early then was taken out wide into the clear, chased five deep into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and kept on for a clear third. THIRSTY THURSDAY
chased outside rivals then four wide into the turn, exited the bend in the three path and weakened. COME OUT FIGHTING tracked off the inside, went three
wide into the turn, angled over to the rail around the bend and faded. OUTGUNNED settled inside out of range, saved ground through the turn and could not
make an impact. MI CABO EXPRESS off slow to start, climbed early chasing off the rail then went between rivals, raced two wide at the back on the turn,
drifted four wide into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
THOUGHT PROCESS broke well then took a tracking spot in the two path, drew closer two then three wide on the far turn, challenged from outside outside
the three-sixteenths pole, took over quickly in upper stretch, cleared at the eighth pole and won going away under urging. LEE'S BABY GIRL fought for the
early lead then took control in the two path before moving to the inside, showed the way clear to the far turn, roused around the bend from the fence,
confronted by THOUGHT PROCESS entering the lane, yielded to that rival in upper stretch, kept on through the final furlong and was clearly second best.
UPTOWN SWEETHEART traveled along the inside towards the rear in the opening stages, coaxed along the rail then eased over to the two path on the far
turn, tipped out into the lane and offered a mild response to earn the show honors. APOCALYPTIC stalked the pacesetter from inside, got put in tight with a
quarter mile remaining and weakened down the lane. SCHILFLIED broke well then raced keenly in hand when rated in the two path, pushed on around the
far turn, came in a slightly to bother APOCALYPTIC at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch run. ARANSAS PASS sat off the pace outside a rival then in
the two path, coaxed along up the backstretch, raced between rivals leaving the backstretch, asked left handed entering the lane and lacked the needed
response. GODDAUGHTER raced well off the leader in the two path, moved out and traveled three deep leaving the backstretch, continued three wide to
the stretch, got floated out a bit at the top of the lane and had little left for the drive. RHYTHMICAL broke a bit slow and trailed from inside, asked around the
far turn still at the back of the field, moved out in the lane and never got involved. THIRSTY DESTINY allowed to settle along the fence, pushed on through
the far turn still next to the rail and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
FUNKENSTEIN sat off the pace three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, moved inside on the backstretch, closed in around the far turn, rallied up
the inside to take over midstretch, drove clear with a sixteenth remaining and was in hand nearing the wire. LORD SHELDON tracked the top pair from the
two path, roused on the far turn and asked right handed past the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch, challenged four deep with a furlong left to run but
could not match the winner late while gaining second. IMPOSSIBLE TASK dueled from inside, exchanged leads with outer rival on the backstretch,
continued to fight along the rail through the turn, carried a short lead into the final furlong, relinquished shortly after and faltered late. ABADON stumbled
leaving the gate, forwardly placed two then three wide on the clubhouse turn, chased out of range on the backstretch, rounded the second bend three to
four wide and failed to rally. DEPARTURE dueled from the three path into the first turn then moved into the two path around the bend, pressed inner rival
early on the backstretch before moving up on even terms again then exchanged leads to the far turn, fought from the two path around the bend, dug in to
the eighth pole then weakened in deep stretch. ROYAL ACT broke a step slow, trailed off the inside then outside a rival early, had one rival beat into the
second bend, angled over to the inside and was never a factor. TERRACOTTA SOLDIER traveled along the rail near the back then trailed inside ROYAL
ACT around the first turn, had sole ownership of last into the second bend, eased over to the two path and never got involved.

BOSS SULLY fought on even terms inside RED PILL up the backstretch, inched ahead on the turn, maintained a short lead over that rival into deep stretch
and held gamely to the wire. RED PILL dueled from outside to the turn, kept the pressure on BOSS SULLY around the bend, fought gamely through the
lane but had to settle for second best. NEWS AT TEN (GB) off slow in the beginning, traveled along the inside and had one beat into the turn, saved ground
to the stretch, closed well and gained third. TEJON PASS tracked between then off the rail, moved inside on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, finished
willingly late and closed the gap while earning a minor award. FLEET FEET stalked the top pair from the rail, roused late on the bend, steered out in upper
stretch and finished evenly late. TRUST DADDY stalked the leading duo outside a rival, ridden along through the turn, got floated out in upper stretch and
weakened. EDDIE'S LAST tracked three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, tipped out into the drive and weakened. VALIANT
KNIGHT dropped back when climbing along early, took an awkward step when making a hard lead change early on the turn, was taken in hand and eased
around the turn and through the stretch, eventually crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
CITIZEN BULL pressed the pace from outside, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, put a head front entering the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch and
maintained command over SMASH IT to the wire under urging. SMASH IT away quickly to take control, set the pace with CITIZEN BULL alongside, fought
on even terms with that rival past the five-sixteenths pole, was overtaken into the stretch and stayed on gamely inside the winner for a clear second. KALEA
BAY broke a step slow and was coaxed along early, chased outside the top pair to the turn, rounded the bend in the three path, could not threaten the top
pair in the stretch run and churned on to best the rest. UNIQUE POWER broke in a bit and was coaxed from the gate, stalked along the rail into the turn,
ridden along around the bend, asked left handed entering the stretch and faded. POST GAME off slow in the beginning, tracked four wide into the turn,
moved into the three path around the bend then came back out a bit into the drive and weakened. POWER PLAY coaxed from the gate, dropped back off
the early speed, went five wide into the turn, steered over to the two path then came out again leaving the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ISCREAMUSCREAM vied for the lead inside rivals leaving the chute, inched ahead to take control first time through the stretch, cleared around the
clubhouse turn then took hold leaving the bend, ceded command to WHISKEY DECISION at the five-eighths pole, stalked that rival up the backstretch,
challenged from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, disposed of inner rival entering the lane and stayed clear under urging through the final furlong.
MEDORO stalked between runners then started to pull around the first turn, continued in the two path between foes into the far turn, roused at the top of the
stretch and steered out to take aim at the winner entering the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. ZONA VERDE (IRE)
stalked the pace from the rail position, got put in tight briefly past the three-eighths pole, drew closer around the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, could
not rally once gaining a clear path but kept on to hold third. BUCHU settled outside a rival at the back then moved inside when trailing first time through the
stretch, went outside a rival on the backstretch and ran up on heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, tipped three wide around the far turn and offered a mild
response to earn minor award. SAKURA BLOSSOM steered to the two path racing near the back early, moved inside on the far turn then came two wide
into the drive and lacked further response. WHISKEY DECISION vied between leaving the chute then took a stalking position in the two path, pulled forward
and cleared at the five-eighths pole, showed the way into the far turn, challenged by the winner at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command a quarter mile out
and weakened down the lane. CIRCLE OF TRUST unhurried in the beginning along the inside, trailed past the five-sixteenths pole, had one rival beat into
the stretch and failed to menace. SEA DANCER showed speed three deep early then took a stalking position outside a pair of rivals, dropped back on the
far turn, trailed two wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

path into the first turn then took control and moved inside to set a pressured pace, cleared briefly into the far turn, pressured again by ZIMBA WARRIOR at
the five-sixteenths pole, dueled into the lane, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened late. TIZ TOK tracked two wide then between rivals,
ridden along on the far turn, drifted out into the lane and gained third. STOP AND A TRES stalked the pace from inside, ridden along into the far turn,
chased a bit off the rail into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. BIG BUZZ tucked inside at the back, went outside a rival into the far turn,

Footnotes
DANCING SOUL showed the way early under pressure, led along the inside through the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held off the late charge from
a pair of runners in the closing moments. AVENTAPP settled inside off the pace, waited for room from the quarter pole to the top of the lane, gained a clear
path and was give her cue, came with a late rally and challenged between runners in the final strides but ran out of time. CHAMPAGNE CAMIE raced
outside a rival off the pace, traveled two wide then chased three deep into the lane, moved out, closed fast but was edged for second. LOOPY prompted the
pace up the backstretch and around the turn, could not keep up with the winner in upper stretch, then flattened to fourth late. TIERGARTEN raced between
rivals at the back then moved inside, tipped in the lane, finished willingly but ran into traffic and had to alter out late. MYLITTLERUNAWAY traveled three
deep then two wide between rivals at the rear, remained two wide to the stretch, ran into brief traffic outside the eight pole and failed to make an impact.
SWEET SONNY chased along the inside, moved off the fence in the lane and could not summon the needed response. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB) raced four
deep at the back then three deep around the turn, moved out in the lane and failed to menace. WOODBINE WAY chased after the top pair off the rail, went
two wide around the turn and weakened down the lane.
