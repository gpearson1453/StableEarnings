Footnotes
CAUSE OF LOVE battled for the lead four then three wide down the backstretch, took command on the turn, set the balance of the pace and drew off under
mild urging. LARSA contested the lead three then two wide for a quarter, dropped back on the turn, came on again late three wide, finished clear for second
then pulled up injured after the wire and was removed from the track via equine ambulance. CLIFTONS BALLERINA close up from the beginning, offered a
mild bid four wide in upper stretch then leveled off. FABULOUS CLOWN dueled for the early lead along the inside, dropped back before the turn, came on
again along the inside into the stretch then weakened late. POINTOF ATTRACTION allowed to settle, rallied five wide into the stretch then came up empty. I
GOT HOPE was outrun. ARTIES CRYPTONITE was no factor.

HIDDEN RANSOM away alertly, set a pressured pace for a half, dueled with the runner up the length of the stretch and proved best in a game effort under
strong handling. A VAN ON THE RUN pressured the winner two wide, drew on even terms for the lead nearing the top of the stretch, battled to the wire but
was denied. WEEKEND RETREAT was restless in the gate and went evenly. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY failed to respond. CRACK COMMAND trailed,
stopped on the turn, lost contact with his field in upper stretch and jogged to the wire.

STONE COLD CAT trailed past mid turn, closed with a rush between rivals two wide under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. BABA LOOEY
had good early speed between horses, drop back on the turn, shifted out four wide, rallied to make the lead near mid stretch then couldn't handle the late
charge of the winner. NICK CAN FIX never far back, swung wide and closed a gap late six wide. VICTORY DIVISION had a mild late rally five wide. SWEET
LEMON DROP away alertly, set a pressured pace past the middle of the turn, kept on into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ATTACK ANGLE
pressed the pace along the inside past the quarter pole, the rider lost his whip at the top of the stretch then faded. SHOW SLIDING HOME pressed the pace
four then three wide through the turn then was used up.
