Footnotes
DEL ROSARIO trailed inside, angled out to the five path under a drive midway around the far turn, got herded out to the eighth path on her left lead passing
the eighth pole, but rallied past an inner trio late. GIDDY UP BABY stalked in the four path, was ridden between foes from the two path into the far turn,
floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, drifted out on her left lead passing the eighth pole, but ran on for place. NASHVILLE SLEW chased from
the five path turning into the backstretch, bid under a ride in the three path approaching the quarter, took the lead while floating out to the five path at the top
of the lane, and kept on, but was caught by an outer pair late to show. MUSTANG BUCKS laid up close along the inside, was roused to take command
entering the far turn, swung out to the three path turning into the stretch, but faded. ELEANOR RIGBY tracked in the three path but never threatened.
WIDERTHANAMILE got rank around the first turn to show the way in the three path down the backstretch, but gaveway around the far turn.

Footnotes
CLEARLY COPPER trailed in the three path, was driven from the four path into the far turn, angled to the rail turning into the lane, and rallied to get up in
the final strides. SIMPLY STRIKING set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue midway around the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the
top of the stretch, kicked on to inch clear passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an inner foe late to place. LETS GO KOKO had an awkward start,
stalked in the three path, was coaxed along into the far turn, floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. PARALLEL tracked in
the two path, waited along the rail around the far turn, angled out to the five path to take aim at the top of the stretch, but finished evenly. ASHIMA rated in
the four path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but made no impact.

REZASROLEX bumped between foes at the start, dueled for the lead inside, was coaxed passing the three-eighths mark, tipped out to the four path at the
top of the lane, and dug in to hold gamely. ICELANDER bumped with an inner foe then an outer foe at the start, vied for the lead between foes in the two
path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. ROAN trailed in the four path, angled out passing
the quarter, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. CACIQUE ABARRIO bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated
inside, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, drifted in and made no impact. BANNEKER pressed the pace while trying to lug in from between
foes in the three path, lost ground along the rail around the turn, and weakened. SHEA D WORLD prompted the pace in the five path but weakened in the
stretch. INSISTING veered in and bumped an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the five path, had to steady in the four path passing the quarter,
and failed to menace. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF ICELANDER AGAINST THE RIDER OF REZASROLEX FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.

NOBLE N MAGICAL set a clear pace in the two path, drifted into the five path turning for home and widened under drive. FOREVER NOW chased the
winner from the rail and was clearly second best in the lane. TO THE MAX was fractious behind the gate, chased the pace three wide, could not match
strides nearing the quarter pole but bested the rest. BLUFF broke a bit awkwardly, raced four wide and never threatened. BOLD N BREEZY bumped with
SWEET LAZARUS just after the start, raced off the pace four wide and lacked a rally. LIGHT FOREVER was outrun while racing two wide. JOHNNY
NOTIME had only brief speed two wide. SWEET LAZARUS bumped after the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
BLUE SLIDE PARK raced in midpack in the three path, ranged up in the five path around the far turn, swept to the lead while tipping back into the three path
in upper stretch, and kicked away. FRANKS MIMI stalked in the four path, was coaxed along in the three path around the far turn, swung from the five path
into the stretch, and kept on for place. CRYPTO MAN vied for the lead in the two path, took command going into the far turn, was cued midway around the
far turn, but lost the lead in upper stretch, and flattened for show. TIZ THE COAST chased in the four path, was driven in the three path around the far turn,
but made no impact. HEATHCLIFF rated in the four path but failed to bid in the six path down the lane. ORB ALPHA had a slow start, raced wellback in the
two path, angled out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but did not factor. GRAND TOWER raced off the pace in the two path but never threatened.
AMBUSHED dwelt at the start, trailed in the three path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the lane, but failed to bid. TUDDENHAM MILL (IRE) rated in
the two path but never menaced. IMMENSE FAITH prompted the pace in the three path but was empty from the two path down the stretch. MOTIVO was
reluctant to load, led along the inside early, but lost the lead after a half, and gaveway around the far turn. LAST U TURN broke thru the gate before the
start, tracked inside but began to weaken after a half, pulled up turning into stretch, and walked off.

SOUND OF THE BEAST dueled at the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe under steady urging. AVANT GLORY prompted the pace four wide,
bid near the quarter pole but was unable to match strides with the winner in upper stretch while finishing willingly to be a clear second. MORGAN POINT
bobbled at the start, trailed in the two path, angled four wide near the eighth pole and was along for the show. BLACK FURY dueled two wide between foes
and weakened in the drive. LACE UP chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. JOE DI BAGGIO pressed the pace three wide between foes
and faded in the drive.

COMEDY TOWN stalked in the six path, was roused to bid while four wide midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane,
tipped inwards, and inched clear. LOCO ABARRIO pressed in the four path, took the lead in the three path passing the three-eighths mark, swung from the
five path into the stretch, ran on but lost the lead before the eighth pole, and held place. VIVIR CON ALEGRIA (CHI) set the pace in the three path, lost the
lead while angling to the rail under a ride early around the turn, but kept on from the three path down the lane for show. BIG MARTINI prompted the pace in
the five path, was driven in the three path around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but was one paced. POSITIVE REVIEW
trailed in the five path and never threatened. CLASSIC CAR WASH chased in the two path but never menaced.

Footnotes
CHECK THE GRADE set the pace in the two path and held firm under a steady drive. NO ACTION prompted the winner in the three path, slowly gained
through the stretch but could not get past. HEIR TO THE ROAR hesitated at the start, trailed in the three path, fanned five wide turning for home and rallied
belatedly. SHEZA RAJUN CAJUN chased the pace three wide, lacked the needed rally but kept on for a minor award. DRINKS ON ME saved ground and
failed to menace. IDEAL BREEZE gave chase four wide and lacked a closing bid. BARBARA was outrun while racing two wide.
