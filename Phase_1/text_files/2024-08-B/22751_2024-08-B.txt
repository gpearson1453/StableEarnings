Footnotes
I'M OTTER HERE pressed the pace early on two wide, took over command nearing the lane, was in the two path into the lane and drew clear in the stretch
under a steady drive. REAGAN'S WIT stalked the pace early on from the inside of the second flight, split horses entering the lane from the two path, made a
bid down the lane but had no final gain on the winner late. FLEMING stalked the pace early while two wide from the second flight, made a bid from the three
path entering the lane but flattened out late in the stretch run. LUCKY MISCHIEF raced two wide along the first turn while back early on, was in the four path
into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. GAVE PROOF raced two wide from the third flight, was in the three path into the lane and leveled off late in
the stretch run. TIZ A SHOWDOWN was bumped and bothered at the start, raced in the two path into the lane and improved position down the lane. R Y
D'ORO came in at the start, chased the pace early on from the third flight, was in the two path into the lane and faded in the stretch. TRAIN AND TRUST
came out at the start and was never a factor. MODERN MASTER was a tad slow and squeezed back at the start. CRYSTAL HILL set the pace from the
outset, was on the inside into the lane and caved down the lane.

LIL TOWN SIS hopped at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and edged clear in the final stages.
VERY WEALTHY stalked the pace early, made a bid nearing the lane, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch, edged past near
the sixteenth pole but yielded late. WEATHER MAP chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and moved up in
the late stages. BOBBIE SOX set the pace early, raced in the three path into the lane, was under a long drive in the stretch and faltered late. ALAMO was
never a threat. TRAVAILLE was never a factor. MESMERIZING ME tracked the pace early from the inside, stayed near the rail into the lane and was empty
down the lane.

ROYAL SALUTE raced near the inside along the first turn, dueled down the backstretch and along the far turn, was in the two path into the lane, shook free
near the eighth pole and widened nearing the wire. MCGINNIS was bumped at the start, set the pace early along the first turn, jumped a shadow once in the
backstretch and lost action briefly, came back and dueled in the backstretch and along the far turn, was in the three path entering the lane, yielded late in
the stretch and held place in the final stages. GET AHEAD NOW was a bit slow at the start, raced in the two path along the first turn and was back early on,
was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining on the place in the final stages. BOMB CYCLONE was bumped at the start, raced
two wide along the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid three wide nearing the lane but flattened out late in the stretch run.
MUNYHUNGRY raced in the three path along the first turn, chased the early pace, was in the seven path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive.
REMARKABLE MO raced in the three path along the first turn, shied and lost action along the backstretch, was in the six path into the lane and empty late
in the stretch. BEAVER STATE was a bit slow at the start and never a factor. TAPITORO was pulled up along the backstretch and taken off the track via the
equine ambulance.

OUTLIER stalked the pace early on three wide, dueled from the five sixteenths pole to near the sixteenth pole and finally shook free in the final stages.
SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) chased the pace early, made a bid three wide entering the lane, was under a long drive down the lane and gave in during the
late stages. TAPSASIONAL dueled early on two wide, was in the two path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. BACKGROUND tracked the pace
early on, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. NAVY SOUL was never a threat. BORN FLAWLESS dueled for a half from
the inside then folded up.

the four path into the lane and shook clear late under a steady drive. WINSTON WOLF raced back early on, was in the two path into the lane, rallied down
the lane and was just up for place at the wire. KARLWITHANARL dueled early on with a long lead, was in the two path into the lane, weakened down the
lane and lost place at the wire. HARLEEZY was a tad slow at the start then was steadied early on, trailed the field, was on the inside into the lane and
moved up late in the stretch from the inside. KING RUSSELL was bumped at the start, raced two wide along the first turn, chased the pace early on, was in
the four path into the lane while being shuffled a bit and came again late in the stretch run. TIVERTON (GB) tracked the pace early on, was in the four path
into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. STROKE OF MIDNIGHT raced two wide along the first turn, was in the four path into the lane and

Footnotes
AJAAYB raced back early on, was steadied nearing the quarter pole, fanned into the seven path entering the lane, made a bid down the lane under a long
drive and prevailed at the wire. EGLISE vied for the lead early on three wide, took over command, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive
down the lane and just missed at the wire. MOMENTUM FILES vied for the lead early on from the inside, was in the two path into the lane and weakened
late in the stretch run. STARSCAPE was a tad slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the two path into the lane and moved up late in the
stretch drive. RIDDLE SOLVER raced back early on, was steadied along the inside near the quarter pole, stayed on the inside into the lane and improved
position in the stretch. CRUSHED IT tracked the pace early on, raced in the six path into the lane and faded down the lane. HOLSTER was never a factor.
DIAMOND LORD had early speed from between horses then folded up.
