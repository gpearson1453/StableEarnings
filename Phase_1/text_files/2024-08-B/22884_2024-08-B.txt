Footnotes
SUMMER FLOWER raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up between rivals on the far turn, angled in a bit and made a rail run turning for home, closed
willingly, took charge, pulled away and was ridden out. ONE FINE WINE tracked on the inside, bid between rivals on the far turn, rallied into the lane, was
no match for the winner, then dug in to save the place spot. SUNNYRIDGE JAIME raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, steadied
slightly behind SUMMER FLOWER past the quarter pole, then rallied mildly inside in the lane. BINGO'S ESPRESSO stalked two wide, chased three wide
on the far turn and weakened. MOLLY'S A BULLET stalked three wide, chased four wide on the far turn and weakened. BABY CAKES steadied at the start,
raced off the pace inside and did not factor. WHISKEY AND RAIN set the pace on the inside, dueled into the stretch and faded. GYPSY STYLE steadied at
the start, raced wide entering the clubhouse turn, then did not factor. A Jockey Objection by the rider of SUNNYRIDGE JAIME against the winner was
dismissed.

inside of that rival, regained command passing the sixteenth marker and drew clear under urging. HAVE A HAPPY broke a step slow, raced three wide off
the pace, made a four wide run on the turn, rallied to a short lead in upper stretch, dug in gamely, then was outfinished. BET ON BETH chased the leaders,
chased on the turn and rallied mildly for third. EASTER MILLIE vied between rivals for the early lead, chased on the turn and weakened. GOONIE vied
inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. MONNIE'S MAGIC broke a step slow, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. ALLENHURST raced
four wide off the pace, chased three wide on the turn and had no rally. CORRIB QUEEN raced off the pace between rivals, two wide on the turn and did not

RIDING PRETTY stalked three wide, bid three wide on the turn, led into the stretch, then dueled outside of BEL PENSIERO through the stretch run and
edged away in the final yards. BEL PENSIERO set the pace on the inside, dueled with RIDING PRETTY passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely in upper
stretch, dueled determinedly inside of that rival to deep stretch and then yielded. BEACH DAZE raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn, angled out in
upper stretch, rallied outside and got up for third at the wire. D' TIGER LILY tracked early on the inside, chased on the turn, dug in through the lane and lost
third. I CAN RUN was outrun early, moved up at the quarter pole and passed tired foes. SEA MAIDEN pressed the pace in the early stages, chased
between rivals on the turn and tired. CAPTURED DARLING stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and faded.
