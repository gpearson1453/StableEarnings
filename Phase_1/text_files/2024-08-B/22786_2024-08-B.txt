GLADRIEL rushed up to duel inside then shook clear in the stretch while kept to her task. HIDDEN CACHE broke alertly and moved close up three wide
then made a gradual gain late. SNAPPY RIDE broke slowly, advanced inside with good late energy. VALIANT MAJESTY alternated for the lead outside to
the stretch then weakened slightly. UNADULTERATED lagged far behind then narrowed gap too late. OUR UPTOWN GIRL settled wide off the dueling
leaders, made a brief wide bid on the turn then faded. BOSS LIKE BETH lacked speed and was always outrun. MATTY BO flashed speed opening quarter
then gave way readily. CAUSE I SAID stopped, pulled up lame in the stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
DAD'S ON A ROLL settled inside, angled out rallying into the stretch and edged clear while geared down late. EL HERMANO advanced wide on the final
turn then was outfinished by the winner. TRENDING UP broke slowest and trailed for half mile, swung wide into the stretch then went evenly. SMART AND
FAST angled inside early and continued well while no threat. AHSAD hustled to the front inside, engaged in heated duel then proved empty. SOCIAL
GROUP dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. ELVIRUS vied through rapid fractions for five furlongs and stopped. SUPER JOHN settled
in clear behind dueling leaders and gave way. MIDNIGHT ACT was fractious in gate prior to the start then gave way.
