SPECIAL BEACH avoided the fallen foe past the half mile marker, closed rapidly through deep stretch under right handed urging in the five path and was
along in time. SABELLE broke in front and quickly opened a large lead, set the pace past the sixteenth pole and was run down. LILAC LACE reared at the
start, chased the early pace and went evenly. COROMANDEL erratic early along the inside, had brief speed. SUSHI Q settled in the four path, stumbled
badly over a fallen rival past the half mile marker and unseated her rider. CHARGINA chased the early pace inside, shifted out to the four path near the half
mile marker, suffered a catastrophic injury, fell and was euthanized. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

LA REINA DEL NORTE chased the pace two wide through the turn, altered course to the six path at the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly under mild
left handed urging and got up in the final strides. CHESS NOT CHECKERS allowed to settle, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead at the top
of the stretch, quickly drew clear and just missed hanging on. HASTY LADY trailed through the turn, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the middle of
the racetrack. MORE MUCHO offered a mild bid along the rail nearing the quarter pole then came up empty. SWEET BELEN sprinted to a daylight lead
soon after the start, set the pace for a half then was used up. SIERRA DIAMOND settled outside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
RAVEN MOON slipped through along the rail to make the lead leaving the clubhouse turn, gave up the advantage at the half mile pole, kept pressure along
the inside, shifted out two wide on the far turn, came on again to regain the lead in upper stretch and proved best under left handed urging. MISTER MOBIL
well placed, dug in through the stretch three wide and got up for second. WETZEL allowed to settle, finished with good courage along the rail. HITE trailed
for four and one half furlongs, bid four wide into the stretch then was outfinished. INDIAN FEVER set the pace through the first turn, was headed, regained
the advantage at the half mile marker, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. SAMMY'S SMILE failed to menace.
