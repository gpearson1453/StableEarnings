YOGYA saved ground stalking BANGIE GO, moved up along the inside of that one nearing the three-eighths pole, took the lead entering the stretch while
dueling with UNBRIDLED SCHOLAR, drifted out during the drive bumping with that one and was all out to prevail narrowly in a stiff drive. UNBRIDLED
SCHOLAR was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to join the leaders at the quarter pole then was carried out during the drive by YOGYA
then came in to bump with that one nearing the sixteenth pole and just missed. BANGIE GO set the pace to the quarter pole while racing two-wide, was
unable to stay with the top two during the drive but held on for the shoiw. SHE SAID MY WAY was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and
improved her position. RIVER DANCE was reserved early, came four-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. UNBRIDLED VIOLET saved
ground while racing in the middle of the field and tired. THE JOCKEY OF UNBRIDLED SCHOLAR LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST YOGYA BUT
AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS OF THE RACE THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDR OF FINISH.

OVERLY FAST saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. THIRD WHEEL was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished
well for second in a steady effort. I'M NOBLE steadied in tight along the inside nearing the seven-eighths pole then angled out to be three-wide, moved up
along the outside nearing the three-eighths pole, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. HAPPY DOES was unhurried early, came
six-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. STEPHEN JAMES saved ground chasing the leaders and lacked a rally. NATION OF FAITH dropped
back while saving ground and was not a factor. HADLEES HONOR was close-up early racing along the inside and tired. MOVE OVER (GB) was
prominently placed for six furlongs and gave way.

ROLL DEM BONES dueled for the lead with SUMMANUS and PARTY FOUL from along the inside, shook them off to open a clear lead nearing the eighth
pole and increased his advantage. MR. FIREBALL was reserved early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole but unable to reach the winner while
finishing well for second in a steady effort. QUIET CHARM steadied from between horses in the opening furlong then dropped back, came three-wide into
the stretch and rallied late. SUMMANUS dueled with ROLL DEM BONES to the stretch from along the outside and weakened. UNCLE LEON settled in the
middle of the field while racing two-wide and went evenly. MIRROR IMAGE was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously
threaten. TAINO HOUSE saved ground chasing the pace to the stretch and weakened. PARTY FOUL disputed the pace racing three-wide to the stretch and
then gave way during the drive.

Footnotes
SOLDATNA tracked the pace while racing three-wide, came six-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth. A LOT OF VERVE was
allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole while ICE TWOER came out in front of him then quickly recovered and
closed strongly for second. ANTICIPATED broke in to brush with PASS THE CROWN then dropped back and saved ground, slipped through during the
drive and finished full of run. ICE TOWER dueled with PASS THE CROWN for the lead into the stretch while three-wide, drifted out nearing the sixteenth
pole then came back in again and held on well in a good effort. PASS THE CROWN was brushed at the start by ANTICIPATED then dueled for the lead
with ICE TOWER into the stretch while racing removed from the rail and weakened slightly late. NIGHT TO REMEMBER was reserved off the pace, rallied
five-wide into the stretch but lacked the needed late response.
