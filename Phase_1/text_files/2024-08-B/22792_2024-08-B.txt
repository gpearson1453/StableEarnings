Footnotes
DOCSGOTALLTHECANDY veered in at the start, was hustled along inside to set the pace, was under pressure throughout and held on gamely. BOBBY
ROCKY JAKE pressed the pace while racing between horses, went willingly to the wire, couldn't get by the winner and was outfinished in a good effort.
RUNNING STATUE ducked out at the start, rallied four across on the turn, closed steadily, didn't have enough late and settled for show. MASTER OF
TWEETS stalked the pace, dropped in entering the turn, bid inside and came up empty. GRAY CHARLES was outrun in an even effort. FLEX WARRIOR
was hard to load, hesitated at the start to be off slowly, raced in the back and was not a factor. HIGHS N GOES broke in, pressed the pace three across to
the turn, fell back and stopped.

winner. RUDY RUDY RUDY broke out, was never far back, raced inside, lacked a late response and held for show. ARMY CADET pressed the pace five
wide, fell back on the turn, tired and gave way. MARCUS JUNIUS pressed the pace while racing between horses to the second turn, tired and stopped.

Footnotes
PURRING raced mid pack while saving ground, angled out on the turn, bid six wide, closed willingly, wore down her rivals, got up late and won going away.
BALLROOM EYES broke out, stalked the pace, shifted out on the turn, bid willingly to contend and was outclosed to finish second best. MINARI stalked the
pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, dueled to late stretch, was outclosed and held safely for show. MIDNIGHT PROWLER moved up to set a
pressured pace, responded when challenged on the turn, dueled to deep stretch, faltered and lost position late. DIRTY GOLD was never far off the pace,
advanced to the turn, bid between horses to get in range, had little left for the drive and fell back. STELLA D'AMORE was carried out on the first turn,
pressed the pace, bid between horses on the turn, dropped back and gave way. TIZ D AMAZIN LADY bobbled after the start, trailed the field, went widest in
the drive and passed tiring rivals. RAPID MISS TAPIT put in an even effort in an outside trip and failed to threaten. PUSSYCAT bore out on the first turn,
pressed the pace, was through after a half and stopped.

DARVESH was off a step slowly, advanced inside to turn, angled out, close steadily and wore down MR LIAM AND ALAN to get up late. MR LIAM AND
ALAN pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command, inched clear, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best.
HEAVY EQUIPMENT set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back, leveled off and was all out for show. SOUTHERN PASS TIME broke out, stalked the pace,
fell back on the turn, went widest in the drive and finished evenly. CAJUN CRUISER trailed the field.

well. BAM BAM BLU dropped inside to save ground, bid along the rail on the turn to get within range and hung late. LOOK SHARP lagged early in an
outside trip, lacked the needed rally and failed to menace. SHARP RED EAGLE vied between horses to the turn, dropped back and gave way. CIGALE

DANCING ON MY OWN pressed the pace, assumed command entering the stretch, inched clear and just lasted. KISS ME HARDY broke in, raced in the
second flight, rallied into the second turn, bid six wide, closed willingly, was gaining fast and was outnodded to just miss at the wire. MAVILUS was
unhurried early, bid along the rail on the turn, finished well to earn show and was clearly best of the rest. RESPECTFULLY set a pressured pace to the turn,
weakened in the drive and dropped back. CARROLL GIRL failed to threaten in an even effort. BEACHGRASS was crowded at the start and trailed the field.

THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) was allowed to settle, raced in the back, shifted out and advanced outside into the final turn, bid four wide, assumed command
and drew clear under mild urging. LIMITED LIABILITY was unhurried early while always close, shifted out in the upper stretch, bid five wide and closed to
finish second best. ENGLISH CONQUEROR stalked the pace, challenged between horses in the upper stretch, didn't have enough late and settled for
show. APRIL FOOLS ANDY set the pace while rated to the upper stretch, weakened in the drive and dropped back. REALLY GOOD pressed the pace
along the inside to the final turn, weakened in the drive and faded from contention.

Footnotes
CITY KISS broke sharp, took control of the tempo along the inside, vied around the bend, shook free in upper stretch, stayed clear under a strong drive. FIA
FIRST vied between runners into and around the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, angled outside rival in upper stretch, and finished willingly
through the lane. BIG BOLT broke a step behind the field, settled in outside towards the rear into the turn, bid five wide leaving the quarter pole, unable to
switch leads through the stretch, finished evenly to the wire. BIG BOURBON BABY bump at the start, vied for the lead four wide into the turn, loomed a
threat leaving the quarter pole, faded in deep stretch. WOKE UP A DIVA was slow away from the gate, lacked speed into the turn, went by-two faders very
late. IMA SILVER LADY chased the pace into the turn, under pressure in upper stretch, weakened through the stretch. HOME TOWN FAV bumped at the
start, pressed the issue around the bend, and never threatened to the wire.
