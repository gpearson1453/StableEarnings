Footnotes
MISBEHAVIN away alertly to the front, well handled throughout held sway to the wire under stout handling. MISS KENZIE raced back to the stretch, angled
out with a late run to the wire for the place spot. BANIDOSO broke awkwardly while well back to the stretch and closed the gap for the show spot.
COMPLEX CAT lunged at the start with sharp speed outside to duel into the stretch but weakened from inside readily. SHRINER tried to keep up for a half,
gave in readily from the turn. JAR had a terrible start from the gate and never menaced.

Footnotes
LUCKY ANA rated off leaders to the half took over with an aggressive move to go clear to the wire. VOGELSANG good position to turn, widest run into
stretch coming too late. FRAZZLED raced along evenly with no kick for the top two and settled for third spot. ISA LEI inside speed to duel for a half,
weakened from that point. SHEAR never a real menace throughout. GOLDEN STORM never threatened. SWIGERT chased for a half, dueled to far turn
with nothing left and faded. SANDRINHA LOVE good position to the half with no late response when needed. This race originally carded for the turf was
transferred to the dirt course due to the jockeys who deemed it unsafe following the running of first race that was on the grass. Acm 8-30-24
