DARE TO COMPARE broke sharply to set the pace, responded to a looming threat from MONOPOLIZE at the head of the stretch, and stayed clear.
MONOPOLIZE stalked the pace while three wide, bid into the lane from the rail but lacked the closing response needed. CROWN OF CAIRO chased inside,
shifted out into the stretch, produced a mild bid then flattened mid stretch. BLAZING SUN broke outward, stalked the pace while four wide, and stopped with
a furlong remaining.

CAPE'S LEGACY pressed the early pace inside, gained a slim advantage nearing the quarter pole, opened up through the stretch and was wrapped up late.
PASSAGE saved ground early, closed well late but was no match for the winner. WORKIN FOR THE MAN set the early pace, was overtaken in the far turn
and faded gradually in the stretch. COUNTY WINDS lagged early, and offered a mild late bid. CAPE FOREST offered little. TRUE ALYBYE hustled early,
and gave way.
