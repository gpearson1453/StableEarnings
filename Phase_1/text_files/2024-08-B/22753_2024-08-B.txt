LOADED SECRET showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. SMOKEN CHLOE
was away alertly and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER settled off
the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was up for show. SISTER COUSIN stalked the early leaders but
chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch. ROYAL CHROME was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of
the stretch was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOUR ACES HIGH stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. JACK THE CAT
settled off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. PAPERBACK HERO was off the pace
and moved up on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. HIATUS set the pace but was headed on the far turn and had no
late kick. SOCIETY JOE was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. SPANISH
SERENADE was in touch but lost ground on the far turn and was not a factor. BAIT N SWITCH was in range early but chased on the far turn and dropped
back through the stretch.

unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was second best. BORN TO BE GOOD was in range, raced evenly
on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. LITTLE FIRE was well back, closed the gap on the turn and from the six path at
the top of the stretch was up for a share. SHEBATOWN was away alertly and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch weakened.
THUNDERHEAVYRAIN was in mid pack and hustled along on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no rally. KATCHY NAME was up
close early but chased on the turn and was empty. BIG BELL was off slow and saved ground on the turn but had no impact.
