causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside, prompted the pace two wide through the turn then faded. STRIKE PLATE veered in at the start and
failed to menace. SKUNK APE bobbled then was bumped from his inside at the start and was no threat. SLIPOFFTHEARIATS veered in at the start and
was outrun. HIDDEN HEART was bumped hard at the start and had brief speed. HURRYCANE DON was bumped hard at the start, stopped nearing the

PLAIN AND SIMPLE prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, dropped to the rail, dug in gamely through the final stages and proved best by the
narrowest of margins. GREERS FERRY trailed early, advanced steadily three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch, set the balance of the pace
and just missed hanging on. LEAVENWORTH stalked the pace along the inside, shifted to the six path entering the stretch giving up ground then came on
again late. HE'S A PISCES away alertly, set the pace along the inside for six furlongs then weakened. MIRO was through early.
