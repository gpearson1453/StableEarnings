Footnotes
LINE ASTRAY tracked in the three path, was coaxed along from the four path into the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and
stayed on to inch past an inner foe in the final strides. GROWTH MINDSET laid up close in the two path, bid under a ride in the three path midway around
the far turn, took command passing the quarter, swung from the three path into the stretch, kicked on while tipping outward in the final furlong to try to fend
off an outer pair, and dug in, but was edged out by an outer foe in the final strides to place. MISTER COOPER bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed
in the two path, angled out to the six path under a ride midway around the far turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the lane, and ran on for show.
CRYPTONYM bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the five path, swung out to the eight path under a drive turning into the stretch, but made no
impact. HIGHLAND PEAK had an awkward start and raced wellback in the two path early, was coaxed along between foes into the far turn, nut did not
factor on his left lead from the four path down the lane. FRONT TRAFFIC bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the two path, moved into range
between foes around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. GINGERSNAP JACK raced in midpack along the inside but got shuffled back around the far turn,
and failed to bid. DECISIVE PRIDE broke in at the start, set the pace inside, but lost the lead approaching the far turn, and faded. FLASHOVER prompted
the pace in the three path, bid for the lead after the half, took command in the two path entering the far turn, but was overtaken midway around the far turn,
and gaveway. GENTLEMAN CALLER bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but weakened around the far turn.

SWEET CHA CHA set the pace in the two path, kicked clear turning for home and held safe under a steady drive. GONNA PICK DOMENIC pressed the
winner in the three path, could not quite keep pace in upper stretch but kept on to narrow the margin late. GREAT HUNT saved ground off the pace and
rallied belatedly. FASTIDIOUS had his head turned at the start, raced in range four wide, drifted a bit turning for home and was one-paced through the lane.
TEMPERATURE RISING was devoid of speed while racing two wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole and was no threat. GODWIN was outrun while
racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
CONFER tracked in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the lane, bid in upper stretch, and drew clear of the
inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. SPREZZATURA bobbled at the start but recovered well enough to show the way along the inside turning into the
backstretch, came under a drive going into the far turn, dug in after losing the lead to an outer foe midway around the far turn, kicked on to regain a small
advantage while floating out to the three path in upper stretch, but was caught around the sixteenth by an outer foe to place. SOUTHERN PALACE got a bit
keen around the first turn to prompt the pace in the three path entering the backstretch, bid midway around the far turn, led passing the quarter, swung from
the four path into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong to show. BROWN EYED BEAUTY rated in the three path but never threatened. SADE PURSE
raced off the pace in the five path and never menaced.

Footnotes
PRINCESS MISS EMIL broke on top but quickly retreated to last, trailed inside, swung six wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up late. SPICY
GUACAMOLE settled off the early pace, advanced four wide around the turn, rallied through the lane but was outkicked between foes late.
COMMENCEMENT stalked the pace from the rail, took the lead near the eighth pole but was outfinished late. AZURE LADY chased the pace two wide and
lacked the needed rally. TIMELY REWARD pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, vied to midstretch and weakened.
HIS CHOICE set the pace in the two path and tired in the drive. OPEN SKY played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PERFORMANTE broke in at the start, pressed in the two path, lost ground under a drive in the three path rounding the turn, floated out to the eight path
turning into the lane, and re-rallied to get up in the closing stages. AMAZING WOO broke in at the start, vied for the lead in the three path, came under a
ride in the two path midway around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kicked on, but was caught by an outer foe in the final
strides to place. WINOOSKI rated in the two path, was cued from the rail midway around the turn, and kept on for show. COME DREAM WITH ME laid up
close inside, was ridden in the three path around the turn, took aim in the six path entering the stretch, but flattened. PRINCE DAVID had a slow start,
chased in the four path but never threatened. SUNDAY AT CHURCH had a slow start and always trailed around the five path.
