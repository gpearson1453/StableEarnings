Footnotes
POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO stalked two wide, made a strong three wide bid on the turn, rallied outside of LARAMORE in the stretch run, wore down that
rival at the sixteenth marker and edged away. LARAMORE set the pace on the inside, raced off the rail turning for home, dug in gamely in the stretch run
and then yielded. FOREST MAIDEN stalked three wide, chased outside on the turn and rallied mildly for third. CEDAR VALLEY stalked close up outside,
bid between rivals on the turn, dueled into the stretch and weakened. BULLET ON TAP broke a step slow, chased inside throughout and lacked a rally.
OSCAR GAZE broke a step slow, trailed the field and did not factor.

TYCOON stalked two wide, moved up on the backside, bid on the far turn, dueled with ORDER OF MAGNITUDE into the stretch, edged away from that rival
at the furlong marker and drew clear under urging. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE raced three wide on the first turn, stalked between rivals, bid three wide on the
far turn, dueled with the winner and came up second best. ACHILLES HEEL tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, came two wide into the lane and
rallied mildly for third. BRASSTOWN cleared the field soon after the start, set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the far turn and faded. DURKIN'S
CALL raced four wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and gave way. GLIDING AFLEET stumbled badly at the start and away
awkwardly, then checked in tight and had the rider lose the irons entering the first turn, recovered them on the backside and remained far back. After a
Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.
