Footnotes
LANDSLIDE IS HOME rushed up early to take the lead, was kept in the two path while snugly rated, was challenged approaching the finish and dug in
determinedly. AWESOME STRIKE saved ground around the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and closed late to just miss in a game effort.
KING SWANSBORO , allowed to settle down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch, moved up between
horses, was bumped by HOMER JONES in upper stretch and again in mid stretch then finished gamely. HOMER JONES stalked the pace, circled the turn
three wide, floated four wide in upper stretch, twice drifted in bumping with KING SWANSBORO in the stretch and hung. GENERAL J R lacked speed and
was no factor. MIKE THE BOMB chased the pace, angled to the five path turning for home and faltered.

Footnotes
RIGHT QUICK broke outward, corrected and stalked the pace off the inside, crept closer into the lane, closed in under pressure leaving mid stretch,
corrected with right handed asks after drifting, took command soon past the sixteenth pole, briefly cleared then held sway. FIERCE COMPETITION , taken
to rate a bit near the five eighths, chased three wide outside a rival mid turn, shifted out five wide for the drive, leveled off under solid handling past the
furlong grounds and quickly gained through the final yards. BELLS ARE RINGING sped clear early, was nudged along towards the inside, dug in when
confronted past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. DOWSING ROD , taken in hand soon after the break while off the inside, swung six wide for the drive
and closed belatedly. MINIMO chased two wide, eased out to be four wide in upper stretch, raced between runners past mid stretch but lacked a serious
finish. AMAZING JETT saved ground pursuing the pace, angled three wide in upper stretch then needed more between rivals. A B C YA , brushed at the
break, found himself well off the pace into the turn while saving ground, continued inside from there and churned on a bit late. LITTLE CAGEFIGHTER ,
pinched back at the break, dropped back and was eased late.

Footnotes
ADMIT NOTHING prompted the pace to the inside of rivals, eased back near the half allowing the duelers to go on, responded when afforded an inner rail
route soon into the stretch, forged through and took command heading to the furlong grounds, kicked away under a solid drive then held firm to the wire.
LAST SECOND LOUIE edged up between rivals to take a slim lead nearing the three quarter pole, emerged in a duel two wide and to the inside of PHOTO
HOP leaving the half, battled head to head with that one past the three eighths, maintained command between runners leaving the quarter pole, dropped
back a bit leaving mid stretch then gamely came back on towards the rail to regain the place. AMANI'S TIGER settled in the clear and off of a contested
early pace, angled out and ranged up four wide outside rivals approaching the stretch, vied past the three sixteenths, switched over to his left lead leaving
the eighth pole and hung. PHOTO HOP , three deep with the early pace, dueled outside LAST SECOND LOUIE around the turn, fought on between horses
nearing the lane then weakened past the three sixteenths. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE , off slowly, settled off the inside, was given a brief ask past the five and a
half furlong marker, shifted out four to five wide into the lane then was eased through the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

THE BIG ENCHILADA sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted to the two path entering the stretch, was challenged in upper stretch
then drew off under urging. P MONEY , well placed around the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and flattened out. LITTLE SKIPPY , three deep
chasing the winner around the turn, was fanned four wide turning for home and weakened. GREAT KISSER prompted the pace outside the winner,
challenged for the lead between horses in upper stretch and weakened. UPSIDEDOWN MAN dropped back soon after breaking alertly, trailed and angled to
the six path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DOC LINKOUS , three then two wide prompting outside BEACH COWBOY, moved to near even terms heading to the quarter pole, forged clear after being
set down into the lane, kicked away emphatically while under a drive past mid stretch then continued to widen while cruising home the final sixty yards.
BEACH COWBOY moved to a short lead early, secured the inside and set a pressured pace around the turn, ceded the lead into the stretch, gave hard
chase past mid stretch the held well to be second best. MAT MATTERS , forwardly placed two wide and to the inside of the winner early on, tracked the
embattled leaders mid turn, shifted out three wide into the lane but lacked a serious finish. LUCKY PRINCE saved ground without threatening. RAPIDITY
reared up in the gate when unruly pre race, was backed out, examined then re loaded, chased three wide, failed to drum up a kick in upper stretch then
faded. IFEELBADFORYOUSON broke a bit slow then edged up outside a rival near the half mile marker, failed to kick on under pressure mid turn and gave
way. SILENT ROAR , off the pace and off the inside, angled out four wide mid turn, lacked a punch into the stretch and faded. STORMY HOLLOW hesitated
at the break spotting the field multiple lengths, raced greenly while wide, dropped in nearing the lane then had his rider lose the crop when being eased near
mid stretch.

Footnotes
ITALIAN SYMPHONY , three wide the fist turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three wide on the far turn, gained the lead in upper
stretch, drifted out forcing out CROSSLAND in mid stretch then drifted out, herding that rival in the late going. CROSSLAND stalked the pace, behind horses
into the far turn, swung four deep leaving the bend, advanced outside ITALIAN SYMPHONY in upper stretch, finished gamely but was bothered in the
stretch drive. AMERICAN WAR HERO was no threat, swung wide in upper stretch, dropped back and passed tired horses. SAVE THE KING bobbled
leaving the starting gate, set the pace slightly off the rail and gave way leaving the far turn. BLAME THE TUX chased the pace outside SAVE THE KING
and faltered. MISSIONAIRE trailed and was eased. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of CROSSLAND, ITALIAN SYMPHONY was
disqualified and placed second.

HALEIGH B sped clear early, was joined from her outside by BELLA PRIMA then headed with five eighths to go, stayed on to contest the pace into the turn,
battled inside a pair of foes from the three furlong marker, responded to stout encouragement and regained command into the lane, was guided off the rail
clearing past the three sixteenths then eagerly drew out while kept to task. MO TOUGH stalked the embattled leaders into the turn, bid three deep soon
after, sparred to the quarter pole, failed to kick on with the winner but continued on with some effort to out kick BELLA PRIMA for the place. BELLA PRIMA
moved up to join the winner from her outside nearing the five eighths, held a slim lead disputing the pace into the turn, stayed on to duel between runners
from the three eighths to the quarter pole then gave way grudgingly. DUNVEGAN DOLL saved ground without a response.

MALIBU BEAUTY prompted the pace outside GOLD DIGGING BROAD down the backstretch, secured command entering the turn, opened up entering the
stretch and was kept alert in the drive. GOLD DIGGING BROAD , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the rail down the backstretch, lost the lead
entering the turn, swung outside leaving the turn and closed late. BELLA BETTINA lacked speed, remained along the inner rail throughout and had a slight
rally. ONE SILK STOCKING raced in two path on the turn while outrun. CUT FROM CLASS chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, faltered and
was eased. MY BRAZILIAN GIRL , near the inner rail on the turn, moved to the three path entering the stretch, faltered and was eased. PER RULING
#24-100 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION GOLD DIGGING BROAD WAS DQD FROM SECOND TO UNPLACED FOR A CROP

LITTLE LANCE bumped with an inner rival at the break, secured the inside soon into the backstretch and rated off the embattled leaders, took closer order
into the far turn, worked outward to be four wide into the lane, made a grinding run under left handed asks and got up in the final yards. DISPUTED CLAIM ,
three wide into the first turn, dropped in a path and got into an extended battle outside THE BAND RUNS ON, took over under a drive soon in into the lane,
shook clear in mid stretch, switched over to his left lead near the sixteenth pole, kept on valiantly but just failed to contain the winner. PASSIONED , four
wide the first turn, was guided in a path and moved up to stalk the duel near the half, shifted out five wide with pursuit in upper stretch then churned on with
effort to slowly cut back into the margin. GALATIANS , away last when bumped and in tight at the break, settled off the pace while saving ground, was under
pressure past the five sixteenths, angled three wide for the drive and steadily gained between foes. THE BAND RUNS ON , a bit fractious in the gate, vied
inside a pair into the first turn then emerged past the seven eighths in a battle to the inside of DISPUTED CLAIM, alternated the lead with that one to the
head of the stretch, kept trying to mid stretch then faded a bit late. J D FACTOR vied briefly between foes then was eased back off the leaders soon into the
first turn, was under a hustling ride three to four wide from the far turn and came up empty. BROTHER BRAD , two wide and well off the duelers, faltered
leaving the quarter pole.

Footnotes
RICCIO stalked the pace under confident handling, circled the turn three wide, bid for the lead outside HUNTER JOE in upper stretch, pulled away the final
furlong and was kept to his business in the drive. HUNTER JOE hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace for six furlongs, failed to match strides with
the winner but finished well to clear hold the place. WICKED PRANKSTER dueled outside HUNTER JOE, failed to keep up leaving the turn and faded.
VANCE SCHOLARS lacked speed, raced near the inner rail around the turn then steadily retreated through the stretch. BESTSUGARDADDYEVER ,
outrun, dropped back and was reported by the stewards as having bled.

Footnotes
PUDGE BOY PALACE , quickly to front, rated kindly towards the inside, responded and spurted away under a drive past the three sixteenths, wandered
outward a bit before being corrected and dug in tenaciously to prove best. LANGLEE AVENUE , hustled to contention, prompted the pace outside the
winner, was under a ride while staying close up past the three eighths, drifted out a few paths with strong pursuit in mid stretch, corrected with some right
handed asks, drifted out again late and kept on gamely. ASCRIBE broke a bit slow, regrouped then lost ground four wide around the first turn and through
the backstretch, gained outside foes past the five sixteenths, chased while drifting out through the drive and churned on. LAW OF THE JUNGLE , three wide
between rivals past the five eighths, angled in under a ride near the three sixteenths, straightened and finished with interest. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD ,
two wide then towards the inside leaving the far turn, failed to kick on under pressure near mid stretch and faded. EYES ELEVEN steadied when in a bit
tight soon after the break, regrouped and moved up while fighting some restraint past the seven eighths, stalked into the far turn, lacked a punch while
under asking into the stretch and gave way. WE DONT NEED ROADS , off the rail while off the pace, lacked a response leaving the far turn and retreated.
