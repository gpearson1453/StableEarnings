Footnotes
REAPPLY set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then lasted under steady pressure. SHOWDOWN KING rated back
inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and missed.
PARTNER TOURS stalked the pace on the outside, lost some position two and three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch,
evened and held the show. CAMINO DE SANTIAGO mid pack, pulled to contention down the backstretch, held position three wide through the turn, bid
outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match strides with that one, weakened and held a share. CALL THE BALL never far back, looped up three
and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally. REINVEST was never involved and walked off.

GRACE IN EXCESS rated inside, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged
up in the final strides. STARCRY mid pack, moved up to gain a short lead three wide through the second turn, shook clear into the stretch, drew off, then
was no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. WEST COAST SONG unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn,
fanned five wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. VERSACE SUMMER allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second
turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. SLAINTE MHATH led in the early going inside, vied down the backstretch, angled out three wide
through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. ELUSIVE EMPRESS passed tiring rivals. REGAL MISS tracked
the pace back, gained position on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and faded the final furlong. BELLA SKYE
set the pace off the rail, shook clear down the backstretch, then faded through the second turn.

the furlong marker, shook clear late, then lasted under steady pressure. CALVARY KAT bumped and pushed in at the start, moved up two and three wide
through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. ROCK N REWARD broke in, bumping and pushing in a rival at the start,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. POSH PLAYDAY
unhurried, looped three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and closed for a share. RUSTY MY BROTHER sprinted
away in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the furlong marker, then faded late. BOURBON BREEZE mid pack, looped up three and four wide
through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally. SWEET AMY rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch and faded the final furlong.

that path into the stretch, drifted in and weakened late. HUNTIN' THE RUT sprinted away from the field in the early going, stayed on when challenged

three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. THOUSAND LOVES hopped at the start, was well placed and inside,
