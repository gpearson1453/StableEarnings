Footnotes
JOKER MATT was five wide leaving the chute, advanced quickly through the final turn, was urged to challenge A MAN'S MAN to a duel, and edged away
late. A MAN'S MAN stalked the pace while five wide, went in pursuit of the leaders nearing the quarter pole, gained the advantage but was soon confronted
by JOKER MATT, responded to challenge but was unable to sustain the rally needed. JUMEIRAH COAST lagged early, and closed belatedly. WYE CROSS
gapped early, and lodged a mild bid. LIL ZAPPER showed the way into the backstretch, dueled into the final turn, and faded in the stretch. LITTLE GROOT
pressed the pace while four wide, dueled outside of LIL ZAPPER and came up empty for the drive. MONEY MUNCHER stalked four wide, and tired.

Footnotes
CAB SAV was under a snug hold while three wide in the opening turn, was reserved off the pacesetters through the backstretch, moved up alongside the
leaders to challenge the front, gained the lead in the final furlong and drove clear. CREDIBILITY rated off the pace, roused outside into the lane, and inched
up for place. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR saved ground inside, rallied belatedly splitting foes, and was along for show. WEDGE POND stalked the pace while
four to five wide, contested the pace from between foes nearing the quarter pole, and weakened deep stretch. DANCING WILLIE set the pace from the
three path, was under attack nearing the quarter pole, and yielded in stretch. LONESOME CAT offered little. ROCKTILLYOUDROP outrun throughout.

NICE GUY EDDIE set the pace while two wide, responded to a challenge from CHASE THE SUN, matched strides through the stretch under heavy
handling, dug in gamely in the final strides refusing to relinquish control. CHASE THE SUN prompted the pace while three wide, moved up alongside NICE
GUY EDDIE to contest the lead, dueled outside under encouragement, battled on late stretch but was outfinished after a long hard drive. NORTHERN
JEWEL sat just off the pace from along the rail, dropped back in the far turn, and rallied belatedly to score show. SQUALOTORO tracked the pace while five
wide, moved up menacingly into the stretch, was all out and was bested. MOUNT ASGARD trailed and bid belatedly. MUCHO MAGIC sat in striking range
while four wide, and failed to threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
DON'T LET ME DOWN saved ground early from along the rail, was asked to quicken through the final turn, shifted out two wide at the top of the stretch, and
prevailed in a multi-horse scramble to the wire. KYSTONE was reserved off the early lead while four wide in the opening turn, drove three wide into the lane,
closed gradually and was just up for place. EXPLODE sat just off the pace while three wide under a snug hold, moved up alongside FROSTEDBIRD to
challenge the lead, gained a slim advantage into the stretch, and was rundown. POINT TO THE STARS raced wide through the backstretch, rallied
three-wide into the stretch and missed after a game late effort. WRONG SPOT hesitated at the start, trailed and lodged a late bid. STREET VENDOR
settled inside, and lacked the kick that was needed. FROSTEDBIRD hustled outside for the early lead, was joined in the far turn by EXPLODE, and gave
way late. ARISTOCRACY failed to threaten.

hurried into the first turn, dueled inside of ZICATELA, inched clear of rival midstretch but was worn down in the final yards. PARKING PERMIT settled along
the rail, and produced a mild bid. VIATURE rallied into the stretch then weakened late. WHERE'S THE GOLD was wide into the final turn and showed a mild
interest late. ATTENZIONE failed to threaten in the stretch. THE BEAT was not a factor. IT WORKED showed little.

Footnotes
COOLWIND unhurried early, took closer order leaving the backstretch, circled the field in the final turn, closed steadily outside and drove clear.
GUNFIGHTER was five wide into the opening turn, was wide in the backstretch, drove five wide off the final turn, and was outkicked. THESHACK allowed to
settle off the early pacesetters, shifted out five wide in the backstretch, rallied between foes into the stretch, and held show. KEEN FLATTER sat just off the
pace while three wide, was roused at the quarter pole, and lacked the rally needed. SAXON SAGA set the early pace under a snug hold, was under attack
at the top of the lane, and faded inside. FOUR O SIX CREED unhurried while five to six wide, shifted outside into the stretch, and failed to threaten in the
drive. BODEMONSTER saved ground and lacked a response when called upon. I'M DASHING lacked serious bid. IT'S A FACT was in close quarters in the
opening turn, stalked three wide, and wilted.

Footnotes
AVANA stumbled leaving then was allowed to settle, targeted the leaders then blazed by them at the head of the lane and wrapped up with enthusiasm.
MIDNIGHT LADY stalked inside under a hold, prompted the pace, was roused at that the quarter pole but was no match for the winner and held safely.
SILKSTONE led the way into the backstretch, dueled outside of MIDNIGHT LADY, and weakened in the final sixteenth. WHO'S THAT BABY stalked four
wide, rallied four wide leaving the final turn, and improved late. BROOKE MAGIC reserved off the early pacesetters, waited near the five-sixteenth pole,
lacked running room early stretch, and gave way. KULSUM offered little. ANNAMARIA was in tight then clipped heels in the opening turn, and tired early.
STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the first turn involving ANNAMARIA but made no change.

INFINITE PATIENCE sat in striking position while three wide, moved up alongside SPITTEN KITTEN, gained the lead and remained clear. MAJESTIC
OOPS saved along the rail, advanced quickly in the final turn, responded to encouragement in the stretch and was unable to sustain the bid that was
needed. BIG HUG raced in second flight while four to five wide, took closer order leaving the backstretch, drove four wide at the quarter pole, and lacked the
needed response. SPITTEN KITTEN set the early pace, lacked a response when confronted by INFINITE PATIENCE, and gave way grudgingly. HIGHER
IMAGE unhurried, failed to threaten. FORCE TO REKN WITH mild interest late. TELLTALE chased the pacesetters under a strong hold, and faded in the

Footnotes
VARATTI attended the pace from the rail, sat just off the pacesetters through the backstretch, shifted out in the final turn then grabbed the lead, and held
under steady pressure. DECOY rated well off the pace, launched a rail bid into the lane, but couldn't muster the bid that was needed. AT ATTENTION raced
near the back of the pack, was wide in the final turn, closed gradually then flattened. GABBYSONHOLIDAY sat in range while three wide, and lacked a kick
that was needed. RIVERSIDE tracked five wide, hustled in the final turn while in traffic, and came up empty in the drive. GREAT ESCAPE fanned four wide
in the opening turn, was asked to quicken in the far turn, and had no response when called upon. AMERICAN BLAZE fanned five wide into the first turn,
chased outside and tired. SILENT RUNNER pressed the pace while four wide, was unable to keep pace with the field and gave way. SPACE contested the
pace in the backstretch while under a strong-hold, and stopped after the quarter-pole.

AUGUST RAIN settled at the back of the field, took closer order leaving the backstretch, lacked room in the leaving the far turn, hustled on the final turn then
shifted outside rolling by and prevailed going away. J DUTTON sat midpack while three wide, fanned four wide in the final turn, rallied three wide into the
stretch under steady encouragement, and was outkicked. ROUSSETTE trailed the field early, shifted out in the far turn, angled down to the rail at the
quarter pole, and closed well late. CLASSY CITY rated off the pace, asked to quicken in the final turn, and lacked the closing response when needed.
AWESOME ROAD crowded early, was five wide leaving the backstretch, lodged a bid at the quarter pole, and yielded in the stretch. LORD OF BATTLE
raced in closest pursuit, moved up alongside ITSALLGOODMAN leaving the backstretch then inherited the lead briefly, and wilted. MCEWEN tracked four
wide, and tired. SHINING TIGER offered little. NORTHERN FORCE chased inside and gave way. SKIPPER'S PRIDE lacked bid. ITSALLGOODMAN
crossed over quickly then set the pace and tired early.

APPREHEND trailed the field early, advanced quickly outside, circled the field into the final turn, closed steadily and drove clear. FLASHFORDANI lodged a
bid nearing the quarter pole, split rivals into the stretch, and was outkicked. SMART PLAY was reserved off the early pacesetters, was four wide leaving the
backstretch, rallied five wide into the stretch, and earned show. LYKAN roused at the quarter pole, experienced traffic entering the stretch, and finished on
the wire for fourth with KAUAI DAN. KAUAI DAN chased two wide, was under urging in the final turn, weakened then finished up with LYKAN. TORIADOR
set a pressured pace, and yielded in the stretch. DERZKII pressed the early pace inside, dueled leaving the backstretch, gained the advantage in the last
turn, and faded inside. HYPERFOCUS was outrun throughout.
