Footnotes
ELIKA stalked the early pace four wide, rallied determinedly in the middle of the racetrack through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. TAYYARA
reluctant to load, battled for the early lead three wide, shook clear on the turn, drifted to the middle of the racetrack under right handed urging, set the
balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN trailed into the stretch and found her best stride late in the six path. WORKING
HOLIDAY raced widest and went evenly. BEAUTY IN MOTION was no factor. PINK PARTY PANTS dueled for the early lead two wide, had speed through
the turn then gave way. KRISTIN matched strides for the early lead along the rail, steadied nearing the three furlong marker and dropped out of it.

Footnotes
ITSMYLUCKYCOYNE never far back, closed willingly under left handed urging in the seven path through deep stretch and was along in time.
ANYGIVENDAY set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted to the four path, opened a clear lead before the furlong marker then couldn't
handle the winner. VERNON'S BEST pressed the early pace two wide, dropped back a bit and shifted to the rail entering the stretch and finished with good
courage. STRIKE PLATE vied for the early lead three wide, loomed boldly midway on the turn, drifted out to the six path when put to left handed urging in
mid stretch then faded. STRIKING LAD failed to menace. EQUITY CAT was no factor. MY BUDDY MICAH was no threat. SKUNK APE was outrun. DUE
TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE FIVE EIGHTHS TIME WAS UNAVAILABLE.

the furlong marker and proved best under strong handling. MOMMA K'S BOY never far back, altered course from the five to the three path near mid stretch
and rallied for second. BLUE NOMORE allowed to settle, swung wide and closed a gap late in the seven path. IRONCLAD ALIBI trailed until deep stretch
and passed tiring rivals in the six path. WOLFINE had brief speed three then four wide. ROLL A QUARTERS hopped at the start, rushed to the lead soon

COURTHOUSE COVE pressed the pace two then three wide then entire trip and proved best by a narrow margin under a strong hand ride. POKER
PARTNER was bumped at the start, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted to the five path, gave up the lead then fought back gamely through
the final stages and just missed. LUCKY NINETEEN stalked the pace into the stretch and finished with good courage four wide. FLAWLESS CAT hopped
then bumped with POKER PARTNER at the start, stalked the early pace, rallied along the rail to make the lead in upper stretch then came up empty in the
final stages. BIG POPPER failed to menace. EL BAMBINO was no factor. DESTINO was no threat.

and proved best under an energetic hand ride. GUT INSTINCT set a pressured pace inside the winner until deep stretch and just missed hanging on.
MOREAU never far back, finished with good courage three wide. LAST COOKIE allowed to settle, offered a mild bid three wide midway down the
backstretch, kept on into the stretch then came up empty. STEVIE T with the second flight along the inside, was through after a half. HECHICERO checked
