REGGIE RUNS ROGUE broke in at the start, settled on the inside, eased out on the turn and made a four wide bid off off the bend by the quarter pole, drew
clear by the furlong marker and widened in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. RIO CHAMA was settled early on the outside, three to four wide on
the turn and made a five wide bid leaving the trun, but could not go with the winner while gaining the place award late. ACE IT dueled for the lead two wide
and made a two to three wide bid off the turn but faded in the final furlong, lost place award late. THIS JUICE B LOOSE dueled for the lead on the inside
and weakened.

Footnotes
INCINERATOR prompted the pace from three wide to the top of the lane, took control in upper stretch and repelled all challenges down the lane. TALL
ORDER unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane and closed well belatedly. KATIE'S
NOTION stalked the pace from two wide on the turn, rallied to loom in upper stretch and finished evenly unable to gain on the winner. ELUSIVE EDGE
tracked the leaders from the fence down the backside, was held up off heels, settled to be in contention turning for home, lacked a clear path to close in the
lane and angled inside to make a late mild bid. SIR LANCE broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a pressured pace to the head of the stretch
and weakened in the lane. NINTH OF APRIL reserved off the pace along the fence, angled to the clear in upper stretch and lacked a closing kick.
MIDNIGHT TEQUILA trailed most of the way and was never a threat. ROCKLAND EXPRESS chased the leaders for the first half mile from mid-pack and
faded in the stretch.

RESPECT THE LAW hustled to the lead from the gate, set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch when called upon and was
never threatened in the lane. MINDFUL ANGEL reserved off the pace while saving ground along the rail, commenced a rally midway on the bend, angled
out four wide turning for home and closed well to be second best. ORQUIDEA REAL pressed the pace from three wide through the turn, was no match for
the winner and kept-on willingly through the lane. FLORIDA FLOWER jostled at the start when rival two posts out broke well inward bumping outside rival
hard and into this one leaving the gate, gathered together to settle into stride at the rear of the main body, followed MINDFUL ANGEL along the fence
through the turn, stuck to the rail cutting the corner and rallied to hit the board in a good effort. SLANDEROUS stumbled at the start to be of balance making
a left turn across two inside rivals bumping FLORINA hard and into that one's inside rival, raced on the to be near the rear of the field and closed mildly in
the stretch. WICKEDREVOLUTION was well placed stalking the pace from the rail to the top of the lane and lacked a closing response. FLORINA bumped
hard and squeezed out at the start by outside rival being eliminated at the gate and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. HONESTLY chased from the outside
while racing mid-pack and failed to mount a bid. CAROLINA D'ORO showed some early speed, dropped back turn and was never a threat. LIZ DREAMIN
flashed some early speed and was through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START, UPON REVIEW THEY MADE NO
CHANGE.

SENDERO tracked the leaders down the backside, rallied four wide on the turn to engage the pacesetters, quickly drew clear in upper stretch and held the
persistent closer safe. LORD DONEGAL rated in mid-pack for the first five-eighths, circled five wide on the far turn, chased the winner down the lane and
continued to cut into the margin through the stretch while unable to reel that one in having to settle for second best. WORLD FACTOR stalked the pace from
the rail to the far turn, angled out in upper stretch to the clear and showed good late energy. PHOTO COPY bumped start by outside rival, raced unhurried
for three-quarters and made a steady advance to be rallying late. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER reserved off the pace while racing three wide to the far turn
and rallied mildly in the lane. WHERE'S CHARLIE broke in bumping rival, was slow for the first half racing at the rear of the field and showed late interest
passing weakened rivals in the lane. DYNA MAST went one-paced without ever threatening. GRAFT pressed the pace from three wide to the final bend,
rallied to take a brief lead on the turn and faded coming home. MY SANCTUARY raced evenly without impact. WILL'S MUSIC was not a factor and was
vanned off after the race. BIG BIG STAR pressed the pace from between rivals and gave way in the stretch. THANK YA PETE rushed to the lead down the
lane the first time, opened a clear advantage on the backstretch and stopped turning for home.

Footnotes
SPICE BAG tracked the leaders from the fence through the turn, angled out to rally at the head of the lane, wore the pacesetter down inside the sixteenth
pole and finished determinedly to hold off the closers at the wire. GREY SHADOW unhurried in the early going while well in hand, made a steady advance
commencing midway on the bend and closed willingly but not in time. SINETIC reserved off the leaders on the outside in mid-field and rallied steadily
through the lane to be gaining belatedly. SIR CHANCE A LOT pressed the pace from two wide through the turn, took command turning for home, dug-in
down the lane to be prominent late and gave-in grudgingly. FREDDY BOY chased from five wide through the turn, rallied to be in striking distance midway
down the lane and was out-finished late. BLUE OCEAN RAVE stalked the pace to the head of the stretch and faded in the lane. NERVANA set a pressured
pace to the quarter pole and weakened coming home. LIKEAGENTLEMAN was never a threat. IMPERIAL BRUT broke a step slow to trail and was always
outrun.

LIAR'S POKER set a pressured, well rated pace throughout, responded when called upon turning for home, dug-in when challenged late in the drive and
refused to yield holding on in a determined drive. BRING ME A CHECK tracked the leaders from three wide comfortably down the backside, rallied nearing
the quarter pole and finished well cutting into the pacesetters margin through the stretch but was denied in the final strides. LORD EDDARD STARK
reserved in hand early while taken off the fence in the run into the first turn, remained rated off the pace to the far turn and mounted a belated rally in the
lane to be gaining in deep stretch. DRAKON raced in mid-opack on the outside down the backside, rallied four wide turning for home in a long drive and
steadily gained in the lane. CONMAN tracked the pace from thee wide in the first turn, worked his way to the rail down the backside, angled six wide for the
drive and rallied with a grinding bid in the lane. CRABS N BEER passed tiring rivals in the lane having been no threat. COINAGE pressed the pace for
three-quarters while well held, kept-on chasing the winner to the eighth pole and weakened late in the drive. MISSION READY trailed throughout as a
non-factor.

Footnotes
IN THE END stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, rallied turning for home to take command in upper stretch and pulled clear in the lane.
WAITTILMIDNITEHOUR broke in air, gave field five lengths, trailed to the top of the lane, circled twelve wide and closed fast with a belated rally.
ASKNOTWHATYOUCANDO reserved off the pace, commenced a steady advance midway on the turn and was caught for the place in the final stride. MISS
M M tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied to threaten in mid-stretch and was outkicked in the drive. INSTPARTY slow early to be at the back of the
main body, and made steady gains in the stretch showing good late energy. MELIPONINI BEE chased the leaders from five wide and failed to mount a
closing rally. NUWANDA raced in contention on the turn, rallied turning for home to be prominent in mid-stretch and flattened out in the final eighth. ACE UP
HER SLEEVE passed tiring rivals in the stretch failing to be a threat. FLORINDIA was not a factor. LOVIELEE set a pressured pace to the head of the lane
and stopped late in the lane. MICHEAUX pressed the pace for three-eighths and gave way.

Footnotes
VALIANT VINNY sped to the lead shortly away from the gate, opened a clear lead on the turn, widened the advantage in upper stretch and held sway late.
SUE LOVES BARBADOS reserved off the pace to midway on the bend from five wide, rallied in the six path in upper stretch and closed well to be gaining
late. BOMBOLONI well placed tracking the pace from three wide down the backside, was held up entering the turn lacking racing room, leveled off and
made a steady rally. BOURBON AND ICE stalked the pace to mid-stretch and kept-on evenly in the lane failing to gain on the leader. UNCLE ANDREW
unhurried in the early going to be near the back of the field, steadily advance nearing the quarter pole and made a mild bid seven wide late in the lane.
CAJUN'S MAGIC tracked the pace and lacked a response when called upon on the turn. SPEAK UNITY saved ground with a rail trip to no avail. MARCHED
stalked the pace through the turn and gave way in the lane. ELEVATED FOREVER was not a factor. RAGTIME BLUES was never a threat steadily fading
to the back of the field.

CLASSY LIL BETTY was well placed along the rail reserved off the leaders in mid-pack, followed the runner-up along the fence on the turn, cut the corner
turning for home and burst through the opening on the rail when the runner-up drifted out, took the lead midway down the lane and held on late under
confident handling. COUNTRY ECONOMICS stalked the pace from the rail through the turn, took command turning for home, drifted out to the three path
allowing the winner up the fence, lost the lead to that one at the eighth pole and gamely came on again late. THY NAME IS WOMAN rated in mid-pack on
the outside four wide, rallied in upper stretch and finished willingly to be along for the show. SAINT DEVEREAUX tracked the leaders to midway on the
bend, rallied approaching the quarter pole when angled out three wide and lacked a closing kick unable to sustain the bid. I BE GONE reserved off the pace
and rallied well showing good late energy in the stretch. ONE WITH THE FORCE unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field through the turn
and rallied passed tiring rivals in the lane. PULL NO PUNCHES went evenly lacking a closing bid. DAWN'S CREED set a pressured pace to the top of the
lane and weakened through the drive. RAPID TULA pressed the pace to midway on the bend and came up empty. HUSTLE was not a factor. BONNIE
BLUE contended through the turn, quickly dropped to the back of the field tiring in the lane.
