on the turn and gave way. FOOD FOODIE lacked speed, moved inside in the stretch and was no factor. TOUGH WORKOUT earned a narrow lead inside

Footnotes
MAGIC MICHAEL stalked the leaders outside, bid on the final turn then drew away in the stretch while kept to his task. RIDIN WITH BIDEN prompted the
pace in hand, led briefly before a mile then weakened in the stretch. MODERN ERA dropped far behind then offered some late energy outside.
ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA led narrowly inside then began tiring at the five sixteenths pole. SUIGU STAR trailed to midstretch then caught a fading opponent.
MARVELOUSMOONDANCE saved ground in the clear for three quarters and gave way.

SILENT MODE dueled outside, edged to the front at the quarter pole and held on gamely. SMOKE WAGON settled inside, angled out into the stretch and
continued willingly. PRINCE COLTON hustled to a narrow lead inside, vied to midstretch and tired. BOOSTER SHOT well placed outside the dueling
leaders then flattened out in the stretch. DANCE A DINI trailed far behind then caught pair of tiring rivals. FAIR HAIRED BOY settled inside, made a brief
wide bid on the final turn then gave way. RABBIT prompted the pace for three furlongs and stopped abruptly.
