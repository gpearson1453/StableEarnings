GRYPHON'S WINGS raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter inside then proved empty. KESTENNA (GB) broke poorly, lagged far behind then the

Footnotes
MY BOY TULLIO rushed to contention inside, shook loose on the turn then gradually widened driving. MY BROTHER CHARLIE stalked the pace wide went
after the winner in the stretch but was second best. ROSSINGTON lacked speed, advanced in the two path with a mild rally. WHOOSH dropped back early,
chased very wide on the turn and was no menace. BUBBY PAPERMAKER trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. MAD MAXEY raced close up behind
dueling leaders and stopped. TEXAS AIR FORCE was eased back after the opening quarter and lacked a response. JSK PHARAOH'SREIGN set the pace
to the far turn then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
SEA TRIDENT controlled the pace then widened in the stretch under moderate drive while never threatened. STAR WEAVER lacked speed inside,
continued to save ground, angled out in the stretch rallying. BIG BROWN SHOES raced outside, briefly closer on the turn and continued well.
HOLDTHEFLIGHT was urged close up between rivals down the backstretch and weakened. CADDY MAN prompted the winner for half a mile and
weakened. RELISHMENT dropped back in the two path then gave way readily. SUMMER ASH lagged far behind losing contact with his field. NOBIZ LIKE
JETBIZ suffered catastrophic injury to his right front in the stretch and was subsequently euthanized. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the third
finisher for interference on the turn was dismissed.

ET'S MOON MAIDEN settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out on the turn, collared the leader and rallied clear. GIRVIN'S PRINCESS led narrowly
under pressure, was challenged into the stretch and continued gamely to the wire. PRINCESS CUPID forced the pace outside to the stretch and faltered.
CIVIL NOTION trailed for half a mile then offered some late energy. DREAM CHASER broke alertly and prompted the pace outside then faded on the turn. I
BELIEVE IN MAGIC raced four wide down the backstretch and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME TIME raced in close pursuit of the pacesetter, led at the quarter pole then gamely held rivals safe. RUNYONESQUE lacked speed, advanced
inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. IRISH HONOR broke slowly, advanced inside then swung wide in the stretch rallying. GREENER
PASTURES rallied three wide on the final turn then flattened out late. DALTON set a clear pace for half a mile, was collared and weakened slightly.
RERALLY fanned six wide into the first turn, angled in then back out in the lane. LUCKY DUDE saved ground, faded after half a mile and was no factor.
BRINDISI urged close up outside briefly then gave way readily. KINGSVILLE chased wide and stopped abruptly.
