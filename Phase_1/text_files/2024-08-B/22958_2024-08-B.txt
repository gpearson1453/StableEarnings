Footnotes
ABLE SEAMAN raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the six path to began a bid passing the quarter pole, gained ground
outside and kicked clear late. ARJUN FOR KARZ dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend, dug in in the lane and
was caught late. WOCKA WOCKA bumped repeatedly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the rail early, came around the
bend in the five path, began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground late. I'LL MAKE BANK dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to
battle from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and gave way late. TOWNER TOO raced in the middle of the pack through the opening stages,
navigated the bend from the four path and finished evenly. BEGGIN FOR TROUBLE was squeezed back at the start, recovered to stalk the leaders on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and weakened in the stretch. CHIPOTLE veered in and bumped with the horse to his
inside at the break, recovered to chase the front runners between horses through the early going, continued around the bend in the three path and faded in
the lane. PIERRE NOEL tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
THEALLIGATORHUNTER led the way up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and dug in gamely in the lane, dueling to the wire to just
hold the win. SIR STERLING tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path, challenged approaching the
quarter pole and dueled the the length of the stretch but could not get by the winner, just missing. STREET WARRIOR bumped with the horse to his inside
at the start, stalked the leader between horses early, saved ground around the bend and kept on in the lane but was no match for the top two. DISTORTED
PRO bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the
three path and was outkicked in the stretch. BAYOU BENNY raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three path and
made no bid.
