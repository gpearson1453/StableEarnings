Footnotes
ARISTOCRATIC , away in good order, edged up to the inside of SHIP THE GOODS heading towards the turn, dueled around the turn and through the lane,
asserted himself under left handed asks to take control in deep stretch then held firm. SHIP THE GOODS bobbled at the break and bumped with an inner
rival, sped up to a slim early lead then was joined from his inside by the winner, sparred from the half mile marker then ceded grudgingly through the final
yards. PRESSING CONCERN showed good speed and forced the issue into the turn, failed to quicken with the top pair leaving the quarter pole while three
wide, raced a bit wider chasing into the stretch and stayed on to save the show. BANDITS HEART drafted back off the leaders while saving ground and
under some early rating, eased out under pressure for the drive and offered a mild response. KBCYA LATER , brushed at the break, saved ground most of
the way and lacked a solid finish. VESELSKY , off the pace, raced two to three wide and failed to make an impact. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK , brushed at the
start, was hustled up between rivals leaving the chute, rated back a bit soon after, was urged along off the inside and faded.

Footnotes
LITTLE BIT RISKY rushed up between rivals soon after the break and took command exiting the chute, set the pace towards the inside and under a firm left
handed grip, came two wide for the drive and edged away while kept alert. WAR SALUTE drifted in at the break, corrected and hustled up to contention,
saved ground advancing into the lane, kept on gamely and earned the place. FEAR NOTHING had speed between foes, pressed the pace outside the
winner into and around the turn, ceded the place position inside the sixteenth pole but kept on with good effort. KITTY'S SON , three wide pursuing, circled
into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. GYM BOME reared up when fractious in the gate, rated back off foes leaving the chute, dropped off the pace while
saving some ground then failed to drum up a rally. BAD BOY BLAZE stumbled at the break and lost his rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of
BAD BOY BLAZE. No action was taken.

COUNT DADDY settled off the rail, commenced a four wide run around the far turn, looped rivals heading towards the stretch then drew away under a
steady drive. STREET TOUGH prompted outside a rival, bid three wide between foes nearing the lane, stayed willingly and saved the place. DASHING
D'ARTAGNAN steadied soon into the backstretch, edged up between rivals, steadied mid way on the final turn, shifted out and finished with interest.
CORONATION TIME , in a bit tight at the break, settled off the inside, angled four wide on the final turn and churned on. PHOTO HOP saved ground
advancing leaving the far turn, checked when blocked with run nearing the stretch, altered out and kept trying. THENAME OF THEGAME lagged far back,
picked up steam leaving the far turn, swung out in the drive and offered a late bid. JACK CLOUD set a pressured pace towards the rail and weakened in
upper stretch. SEEKER steadied around the first turn, stalked inside, eased out past the quarter pole then stumbled when in tight off heels nearing the
furlong grounds. TRUSTME IAMADOCTOR pressed two wide, steadied between foes near the eighth pole and faded. I HAD ENOUGH clipped heels in the
opening sixteenth unseating his rider, went around the track causing some havoc, was corralled after the race and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry
concerning the early going but no action was taken.

MR MAC QUHAE , patiently rated behind horses, steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering the final turn, eased out to the two path
approaching the stretch, closed determinedly outside BONDED and was up approaching the finish. BONDED set the pace along the inner rail and gave way
grudgingly. CLUBMAN hugged the inner rail around the first two turns, swung outside leaving the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide and offered a
slight rally. MORNING THOUGHTS chased the pace outside BONDED, raced in the three path the far turn and weakened. BRETT'S WORLD , always

LATE FROST prompted the pace outside YESTERNIGHT, overtook that one mid way down the backstretch, steadily edged away and was under urging in
the drive. HOT FUDGE WARRIOR stalked the pace in a striking position, raced in the three path between horses entering the far turn, chased the winner,
remained on her left lead in the stretch and flattened out. MATTITUDE bumped on both sides leaving the starting gate, worked between horses, moved in
the stretch in the path and finished willingly. DISCREET OPS stalked the pace while along the inner rail and lacked the needed late response. UTTERLY
ENCHANTING , very wide the far turn, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. GINGER GIRL bumped KITTEN'S APPEAL when coming in at the
break, steadied when shuffled back soon after the start, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was no factor. YESTERNIGHT showed speed along
the inner and weakened. SHE'S DANCING was outrun. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD , wide both turns, chased the pace and tired. KITTEN'S APPEAL bumped by
GINGER GIRL, raced in the three path the first turn, gave way and was eased.

ANY FOOLS GOLD , alertly taken to the inner rail approaching the first turn, stalked the pace inside foes, eased out mid way on the far turn, took command
in upper stretch and drew off. IRISH ANGEL prompted the pace outside EIGHT OZ MOCHA, over took that one mid way down the backstretch, lost the lead
in upper stretch and finished willingly. JUNE BELLE lacked speed, raced along the inner rail, swung out in upper stretch and rallied. BREAKING RULES ,
four wide on both turns, was no factor. BATTLE TESTED , four wide both turns, weakened. EIGHT OZ MOCHA showed speed along the inner rail and gave
way the final furlong. GO WALLY GO raced along the inner rail on the far turn and gave way. LORRAINE'S WAY trailed.
