EASY SEVEN well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, dueled with that
one, lugging in under left hand urging, then edged ahead at the furlong marker and drove clear late. FIRST FORAY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, dueled with the winner and was no match for that one late, while clearly best of the rest. MIDNIGHT FAME
angled out early and gained position three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and evened out. FIT AS A FIDDLE exchanged bumps at the
start, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened. PARTY HOPPER bumped at the start, bolted when
the outside was clear and lost contact with the field.

evened the final furlong. JASMINES WORLD tracked the pace back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, drifted
in and faded. MOCHA DIANE well placed, steadily lost ground. MARKET ORDER stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the
turn, drifted out four wide into the stretch and faded. TIMELESS LOVE dwelt at the start, ran loose after the rider dismounted, then walked off. AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
VALIANT VICTORIA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. GREEN
CHILE stalked the pace on the outside, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain
and missed. CHEROKEE CHATTER hopped at the start and broke awkwardly, steadying, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and lacked the needed late kick. BOCA unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide
into the stretch, angled widest and had a mild late gain for a share. KAGERO mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled four and five
wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. TUDOR PEAK well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into
the stretch, drifted in and faded. NOW ACT SURPRISED broke a step slowly from the gate and was never involved.

Footnotes
HENRY'S WORLD sprinted away from the field quickly, held sway unchallenged, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. EXTRA MEDIUM tracked
the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out and lacked the needed late kick. UNCLE JOCK mid pack and
inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, lugged in and held the show. SAMURAI LEGACY mid pack, moved up
two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and edged up for a share. LEONARD'S LEGACY well placed and outside,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and evened out. OLDZFOURFORTYTWO unhurried, looped up three and
four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position. SEEING RED was no factor. THE COOKIE MAN was never involved.
