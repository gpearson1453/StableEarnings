Footnotes
RED HAT HANNA sped to the early lead, saved ground on the turns disputing the pace, went clear in upper stretch, skimmed the rail near the sixteenth pole
and was kept to her business in the drive. X GENE remained along the inner rail, chased the pace and finished gamely. FIRST TO ARRIVE raced in the two
path on both turns and lacked the needed late effort. DROPPING LEMONS stayed along the inner rail and failed to rally. DIAMOND SUE hopped slightly at
the break, was unhurried early and failed to be a factor. RASCALLION was outrun. DESIGNER disputed the pace outside the winner, gave way and was
eased late.

Footnotes
SHARED AUTHORITY quickly went clear then dropped in to secure the inner rail, ceded command as MISS PEARL HART rushed up heading to the turn,
stayed on under rating to contest the pace, regained the lead past the the three sixteenths then eagerly drew away under a left handed drive. MOLLY OF
STRATFORD bore out at the break bumping MISS PEARL HART, corrected and pursued towards the inside, remained inside into the lane and finished
willingly while gaining the place. MISS PEARL HART , bumped and forced out by an inner rival leaving gate, steadied soon after, accelerated outside and
put a head in front nearing the turn, sparred past the five sixteenths, failed to match strides into the stretch and faded. DIVINE MAGIC , towards the inside,
was not a factor. SAY NO MORE was outrun. An objection by the trainer of MISS PEARL HART against MOLLY OF STRATFORD alleging interference
leaving the gate was not allowed

CATALINA CRUZIN raced in mid pack leaving the first turn, stayed in the two path down the backstretch, eased out three wide leaving the far turn, was
brushed by FROSTY MAYA inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. FROSTY MAYA sped to the early lead, opened up on the backstretch, was well clear
into the stretch and brushed the winner when drifting out late. AUNT JO lacked speed, raced near the inner rail into the far turn, swung outside leaving the
bend and passed tired horses. OUTFACTORED chased the pace along the rail and weakened. SMART RED , outrun, lost ground on both turns.
IMINCHARGENOW chased the pace in the two path down the backstretch and faltered entering the stretch. RAZORETTE , squeezed back soon after the
break, was always far back.

Footnotes
SANDRA D cleared entering the first turn, dropped in and secured the rail, rated kindly up front while handling some outer pressure from
ANGELOFCANTERBURY, moved away under some coaxing into the second turn then widened from there while kept to a steady right handed drive.
ANGELOFCANTERBURY , away alertly, rated back off the winner as that one cleared, angled out to prompt the pace, saw the winner get away near the
three eighths, was under heavy pressure pursuing from the far turn and stayed on willingly to save the place. PISTOL LIZ ABLAZEN , brushed soon after
the break, was hard urged early while saving ground, remained inside with pursuit and came up empty. VIENNESE WALTZ , brushed after the start, lagged
well back into the backstretch, was under a hearty ride past the three eighths, saved ground into the lane, shifted out and finished with interest. GO
SHERRY GO , three then two wide outside a rival, failed to kick on under pressure past the three eighths and weakened. QUEEN OF THE DANCE drifted in

MENDYS HONEY vied outside POGGIBONSI through the opening furlong, spurted clear into the turn, responded to solid right handed asks in mid stretch
and proved clearly best. POGGIBONSI disputed the early pace inside the winner, failed to quicken with that one heading to the turn, shifted out and was
pushed along pursuing into the lane, kept on with effort and saved the place. LADY SERENITY , out footed to the front, was relegated to chased two wide
leaving the turn, saved ground into the stretch, worked outward leaving the sixteenth pole and finished with interest while just missing the place. BANDITS
WARRIOR , three wide chasing mid turn, came up empty. HATEFUL failed to keep pace.

ISABELLA'S GLORY , nudged along while trailing into the backstretch, angled out leaving the three eighths and commenced a run, circled rivals four wide
advancing into the lane, forged to command near mid stretch, remained on her left lead and drew clear under a drive. TRAIN WRECK , brushed at the
break, prompted the pace while saving ground, was under asking to hold position past the quarter pole, tapped the brakes behind the leader approaching
the stretch, got through towards the rail and challenged soon after, could not quite go with the winner leaving the sixteenth pole but kept on gamely to
secure the place. GHEE FOR THE WIN , urged in the clear near the three eighths, hugged the rail with some momentum into the lane, stayed inside and
kept on with good energy. MARLEY'S GHOST , brushed leaving the gate, raced between foes past the stands the first time, chased three wide past three
sixteenths, moved up a touch into the lane then flattened out. STICKWITHTHECOLORS broke a step slow, edged up three deep passing the stands the first
time, dropped in a path to prompt the pace, threatened under a ride into the far turn, gave futile chase past the three sixteenths and weakened. SHAKE IT
BABY sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, handled outside pressure into the far turn, remained clear under asking nearing the lane, was
hooked from both sides soon after and surrendered in mid stretch.

Footnotes
DUTCH MILLS , well off the inner rail on the first turn, swung out on the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide, closed determinedly, led late and drove
clear. ONE WAY TRAFFIC accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, his rider dropped his whip leaving the far turn, bobbled when switching
leads in upper stretch and finished gamely. GET LIKE MIKE , briefly steadied lacking room along the rail leaving the backstretch, angled three wide on the
far turn and rallied mildly. BUCKIN' DREAMER , three deep chasing the pace down the backstretch, weakened. DUNPHY chased the pace outside ONE
WAY TRAFFIC and gave way on the far turn. MONCRIEF drifted to the four path entering the first turn, raced in the three path the far turn and was never a
factor. ALL THE WAY hugged the inner rail, chased the pace and faltered.
