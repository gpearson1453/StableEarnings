Footnotes
AMPITUP hustled to the early lead but faded on the turn, made a rebid in upper stretch to prevail. YAKETY YOCK vied for the early lead but fell back
quickly then saved ground around the turn and made the late rally to be second best. KARNES raced off the pace then moved up from three wide at the
three furlong marker and took the lead at the quarter pole, fought gamely in the stretch but was outfinished. CUSTOM'S CLEARED raced in the middle of
the pack while saving ground through the turn, angled out to four wide in upper stretch and made a late run to improve his position. UNINSPIRED trailed the
field through the turn and showed late interest in the stretch. MARDI GRAS MAMBO hustled along to press the pace from three wide and took the lead at
the three furlong marker but was collared near the quarter pole and gave way. JOSH G raced in the middle of the pack and passed tiring rivals. FRIENDLY
HINT was off a step slow and remained back. JONAS GRUMBY stalked the early pace from three wide to the turn and retreated. REXINATOR raced near
the back and was not a factor.

STEEL GUITAR prompted the pace around the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch, moved to engage the leader midway through the
final turn and took the lead near the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch. RUN DREAMING rushed to the lead to set most of the pace but was headed
midway through the final turn and fought gamely to mid stretch and was a clear second. BACK STREET BABY saved ground while racing off the pace
through the final turn then angled out to three wide in upper stretch to be best of the rest. EVERYLITTLESINGH tracked the leaders from three wide around
the first turn then dropped back through the final turn and passed tired rivals. CHAPELLETE was unhurried to the final turn then made a three wide bid but
flattened out. SMART IZZY was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a mild bid from two or three wide on the backstretch but failed to sustain
that bid.

QUITE THE CATCH trailed the field to the top of the stretch then made a late rally to run down the leaders under determined handling. SWEET MORGAN
LEIGH raced off the pace on the inside to the top of the stretch then moved out to three wide to make a strong stretch run and took a brief narrow lead late
and was denied by the late closing outside rival. CALL ME SUSAN was off a step slow and saved ground throughout, slipped through at the top of the
stretch and finished strong to just miss the win. FAST MEDICINE was forwardly placed, moved to engage the leader on the turn, took the lead at the quarter
pole but was collared in the final sixteenths and was out finished. WANNAWHOLELOTTALUV prompted the pace through the turn but floated out in upper
stretch and finished evenly. ALYSE PARKER showed good early speed but was headed near the quarter pole and gave way grudgingly. GORMLEY'S
QUEEN raced near the back early then made a mild bid on the turn but was no a factor. DEVIL'S POOL raced in the middle of the pack but was not a threat.
SIMONEAUX STORM raced close up early to the turn and retreated.

DIXIE FARMER was allowed to settle around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch and made a rail bid on the final turn, shifted out to
two path in upper stretch to take the lead near the eighth pole and fended off the late closing TENSAS CANDY to prevail. TENSAS CANDY trailed the field
to the half mile marker then moved between horses at the five sixteenths pole, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch and made a late rally to just miss the
win. NORAH G stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then took the lead at the five sixteenths pole but was collared at the eighth pole and
was best of the rest. CHEAPSKATE DIVA pressed the pace around the first turn then took the lead going into the backstretch and held that position to the
three furlong marker and weakened. FOR HARPER was allowed to settle and made a middle move but flattened out. BIRDIE CALL tracked the leaders but
failed to menace. CERTIFIED GEM raced in the middle of the pack from three wide but was not a threat. LUMINOUS FLIGHT sprinted away to the early
lead then vied to the half mile marker and gave way. SIKARA SIKARA bobbled at the start then raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn and

Footnotes
ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT was unhurried down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn and fanned out to six wide in upper stretch to
make a late rally to be up in the final jump. WISE VERDICT tracked the leaders from the inside then tipped out to three wide in upper stretch while moving
between horses at the eighth pole to clear late but was nipped at the wire. BLUE CHEESE was allowed to settle near or at the back to through the final turn
then fanned out to seven wide in upper stretch and made a late rally to be up for the show. COSMIC TRAIN raced in the middle around the first turn then
steadily advanced from two wide through the final turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and fought gamely in the stretch but was out kicked. BRIAN'S
IRON MIKE matched stride inside of BEHEMAH STAR to the quarter pole then inched away into the stretch but was eclipsed at the eighth pole and gave
way grudgingly. SUNDAY BREEZE raced in the middle of the pack and failed to menace. WOODS N WATER raced in the middle of the pack and passed
tiring rivals. BEHEMAH STAR matched strides outside of BRIAN'S IRON MIKE to the quarter pole and weakened. BIG BOO was off a step slow and
remained back.

SIX STRING sprinted away to a clear lead but was challenged on the turn and fended to draw off in early stretch but lugged out badly and held on.
NONEYA raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then moved out to three or four wide in upper stretch for the late rally and was best of the rest.
SWEET ALEXIS raced near the back down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn, moved between horses at the eighth pole and
made a late surge for the show. LUYV veered in leaving the starting gate and bumped rivals then stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, floated
out in upper stretch and faltered. MAGNOLIA AVENUE trailed the field to the quarter pole then made a mid track rally. CLEARLY A TEST raced near the
back then made a mild bid on the turn, fanned out to seven wide in upper stretch and made a late run but failed to menace. OLIVIA G was bumped by rivals
and clipped heels, stumbled and had to steady early, raced near the back and passed tiring rivals. FIRE VISION prompted the pace while challenging the
leader on the turn but tired late. MISS PRIORITY raced off the pace on the inside then tipped out to three wide in upper stretch but was empty. CUTE
