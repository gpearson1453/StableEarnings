Footnotes
SOMETIMES I DO bore in leaving the gate then moved in and rated the pace, met the challenge of Southern Saint leaving the first turn and contested the
edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling and held on. TIZAWINNER, pinched back at the start, rounded the first turn about
the four path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, improved steadily in the five path on the far turn and finished well to take second the final stride.
COLONIAL ROAD settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and was outfinished in
the duel through the stretch. SENSUAL CHOCOLATE stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole and contested
near even terms two deep on the far turn, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. GETTIN SPICY stalked four wide on the opening turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and weakened in the lane. FUJI FIRE was forced in at the break, raced in the
three path the first turn and bid only mildly from the three eighths pole. SOUTHERN SAINT stalked two deep the first turn, challenged into the backstretch
but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole and faded at the rail on the far turn. BESOTTED saved ground.

TUP'S TO TAKE was hustled to the front inside and set an unrestrained pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail
and held well with steady stretch handling. CEDAR RUNS FIBER became a bit anxious in the gate then gave chase, contested at a slim disadvantage two
deep on the turn but relented in the stretch duel. LITTLE RICHIE gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and dueled for third inside the sixteenth pole.
SALTY STARKEY gave chase inside then flattened mid-stretch. KVELLION gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in the lane.
BEST HOP IS A DROP saved ground. NOVEMBER IMPERIUM never factored and rounded the turn in the three path. THOR'S LAD gave chase then
weakened in the five path on the turn. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP never factored and raced in the four path on the turn.

SYMPTOMATIC stalked from the four path the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead at the five sixteenths, contested the edge
in the three path on the far turn and dug in under steady handling to widen later yards. YES TO LOVE took the lead at the rail into the first turn, was met
leaving the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase through the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, angled off the
rail mid-stretch and held on for second. JUST HAVE FAITH rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and dueled for third mid-stretch. JUMPIN JACK BRASS settled in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. PARALLAX VIEW stalked three wide into the first turn and moved to even
terms leaving the nine sixteenths pole, dueled close from that point and rounded the far turn three wide, but weakened leaving the turn. GIRLS PERFUME
flipped in the gate and ran loose afterward, then ran wide both turns. BET YOUR BOOTS ran in the six path on the first turn, left the turn wide and never
factored. CREME DE LA QUEEN stalked two deep while between horses the first turn, contested even terms leaving the nine sixteenths pole and remained
a factor through the backstretch, but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened. Bull's Legacy flipped in the gate and was a late scratch. Per

Footnotes

the head of the lane, dueled clear past the eighth pole and held well with steady handling. LOGSTRADAMUS was shuffled back soon after the start, raced
off the rail the first turn and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and dug in to take second late yards.
ROCKET APPEAL rated off the pace inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn then
flattened late yards. REMYS SHOWTIME veered out leaving the gate then rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole,
was met off the rail approaching the head of the lane and weakened passing the eighth pole. GOLDEN APPEAL raced in the four path the first turn, left the
turn outside and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and passed some rivals. SARGENT KOBE settled
off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and flattened mid-stretch.

Footnotes
BAD LINEAGE raced well back off the rail the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four
and five paths on the far turn and dug in to inch ahead the final yards. PARK AVE PRINCE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn but reluctantly ceded the final yards. ZIGGY STARDUST raced in the
four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path on the far turn, but flattened stride mid-stretch.
YOUTHFUL ENERGY stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened stride leaving
the turn. W V LAD rated close inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. DENIZETTI saved early ground then
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. BRADLEY DO RIGHT settled in the three
and four paths on the first turn, steadied from tight quarters passing the nine sixteenths pole, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths but weakened
while losing ground on the far turn. SHOOT THE BREEZE raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail and weakened. MY BUDDY DUANE raced in the seven path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths
