Footnotes
SAMURAI PRINCE vied for the lead with MEDICINE TAIL in early stages, shook off rival and took on the challenge of WESTONS WILDCAT entering the
turn, vied along the inside around the turn, cut the corner and shook free entering the top of the lane, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task.
WESTONS WILDCAT sat three wide in striking distance in opening stages, advanced to engage SAMURAI PRINCE for the lead entering the turn, could not
match strides at the head of the lane but sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. MEDICINE TAIL vied for the lead two wide in opening stages,
could not match strides with the eventual winner entering the turn, ran on two to three wide through the lane and cleared a share. PURE ROCKET raced off
the top trio in early stages, lugged out around the turn, weakened, came five wide into upper stretch and had no late response. TEMPTED MISSION was
away awkwardly at the start, remained in the back and never got going.

widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. DISCREET INVASION raced off the early pace near the inside, hustled along two wide around the turn,

position and cleared the rest. BLACK STORM lacked speed and raced in the back, edged closer late on the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and
improved position without threatening. PRESS SNOOZE broke on top then conceded position and chased the clear top trio in the opening quarter, hustled
along four wide into upper stretch and never threatened. HULEN vied inside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not move on with rival leaving

KOBE'S CAUSE sped the lead soon after the start and held a clear lead around the first turn, set the pace with NASTY EXAGGERATOR the only close
pursuer, kept clear around the far turn, cut the corner entering the upper stretch, widened advantage and kept to task. RECORDER raced off the clear top
pair up the backstretch, edged closer late on the far turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and gained second best. NASTY EXAGGERATOR was
the only close pursuer of the leader up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn, sustained bid through the lane and dug in late to hold
show. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND raced well off the early pace, was ridden along the rail around the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive and just missed
show. TUFF WILLY TE rated off the clear top trio up the backstretch, lost position around the final turn, hustled along three to four wide into the upper
stretch and failed to threaten. HEZA WILD RIDE lacked speed and saved ground to no avail. WELLER ROGUE failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
CHROME RACER was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the top pair while racing well clear over the next pursuer, took over the lead late on
the backstretch, widened advantage still racing in hand, was ridden along two wide into upper stretch, tapped a couple times right handed, drew off and
finished in hand. SCOOT ALONG was unhurried around the first turn and into early backstretch, picked up the tempo nearing the far turn, hustled along
three to four wide into upper stretch, was no match for the clear winner but sustained a solid bid and finished clearly second best. ALMA'S PRINCESS raced
off the clear top trio up the backstretch, coaxed two wide out of the far turn and ran on for a share. KID BIZ was well reserved racing in the back, swung four
wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. TAP ME A TEXT dueled around the first turn and continued to battle with I THINK I KNOW YOU into the
backstretch, got overtaken by eventual winner nearing the far turn and steadily faded. I THINK I KNOW YOU vied for the lead with TAP ME A TEXT around
the first turn, continued to battle into backstretch, could not move on past the half mile marker and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
DRILL'S LI'L MAN was forwardly placed in opening stages, advanced to engage TIME MACHINE for the lead entering the turn, shook free late on the turn,
came two wide into the upper stretch, angled to the inside and pulled away. RAYMOND rated just off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, briefly
tipped out a path at the head of the lane then angled back in, given cue and finished second best. HUNTERS GHOST slightly hopped and came away last
at the start then advanced to race in just off the top trio, was ridden along three to four wide late on the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and
secured a share. OCEAN RIDE was forwardly placed three wide up the backstretch, ran on evenly around the turn, came three paths wide into stretch,
failed to kick on and finished on equal terms with TIME MACHINE. TIME MACHINE led the way in the opening quarter, vied for the lead with the winner
around the turn then flattened and finished on equal terms with OCEAN RIDE. RONIC raced in the back although never too far back in the opening quarter,
raced two wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
MO'S MOJO sat back in early stages saving ground, tipped out a path and picked up the pace at the quarter pole, shifted to the four path at the head of the
lane, responded gamely when called upon and surged by in final strides. WHEELER DEALER tracked the early leader along the inside, cut the corner
entering the top of the lane, engaged LOVER BOY for the lead, fought gamely along the inside and got denied in final strides. LOVER BOY led the way in
opening stages and continued on top around the turn, took on the inside challenge of WHEELER DEALER at the head of the lane, dueled gamely two wide
and got overtaken late. STORM CATCHER tracked the leader in early stages, edged closer late on the turn, given cue three wide at the head of the lane
and lacked the needed kick for serious impact. BARBERSHOP raced off the early front runners, chased four wide around the turn, came five paths wide into
upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. KINGSWOOD raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and failed to threaten. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP chased
the early pace three wide and weakened turning for home.
