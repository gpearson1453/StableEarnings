Footnotes
JEAN VALJEAN led the way up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and kicked clear in the lane. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK chased the
leader up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on to the wire but was no match for the winner. I KNOW MAP was away from the
gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late.
MAGIC SPIN raced off the pace on the outside early, saved ground around the bend and improved position in the stretch. BRADITUDE raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and showed no kick. KISS THEM DEADLY raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the lane. ALMOND CIDER raced in the middle of the
pack between horses through the opening stages, came around the bend in the two path and faded in the stretch. MO MOSCATO raced off the pace on the
inside up the backstretch, dropped back to trail well behind the field while saving ground around the turn and was empty from there.
