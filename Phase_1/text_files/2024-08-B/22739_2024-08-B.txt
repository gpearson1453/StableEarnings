BIG SWAG tracked the pace along the inside, edged closer on the rail late on the turn, cut the corner then tipped two wide in upper stretch, came under
right handed pressure, responded gamely and finished going away. WAR ECHO sped to the lead at the start and quickly widened to a clear advantage,
continued clear into the lane then got overtaken by the winner in the final sixteenth. RUNNING BAYOU was off a step slow at the start, raced off the early
pace then urged just off the inside around the turn, chased along the rail in the lane and prevailed for a share. KING OF SWING raced off early pace,
chased three wide around the turn and needed more for impact. SAMMY'S A GIVINE was forwardly placed from the onset, chased the leader around the
turn then came up empty in the lane.

KOSELIO tracked the pace through early stages, moved up to challenge for the lead approaching the quarter pole, vied with DRIFTER turning for home,
shook free upper stretch, held a slim lead into the final furlong and kept clear. GREY STORM saved ground around the first turn, settled through early
stages then picked up the pace along the inside entering the far turn, tipped out near the quarter pole, shifted to the four path at the head of the lane,
steadily edged up closer and got a nose up for place. DRIFTER was off a step slow at the start, steadily advanced to race in range of the leaders mid-way
up the backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, vied with the eventual winner, could not match strides past upper stretch but
continued in close contention then got nipped for place in final stride. COMMANDER REX led the way around the first turn and continued to set the pace
into the backstretch, took on challengers near the half mile marker, got collared for the lead near the quarter pole, cut the corner and ran on into the lane

TOSKA'S RULER moved up the inside in opening stages and pressed the early pace, took over the lead three furlongs from home, held clear around the
turn, cut the corner and widened to clear advantage, came back under a drive nearing the wire and finished on equal terms with late gaining SECRET
BLARNEY. SECRET BLARNEY was well reserved racing in the back, hustled up four wide into upper stretch, steadily edged up closer then surged to the
wire and finished on equal terms with TOSKA'S RULER. JAYSKER tracked the pace along the inside, failed to advance when called upon around the turn,
came two to three wide into upper stretch, ran on and captured show. SHUT UP MAN was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, continued in striking
distance racing three wide around the turn, continued to chase after TOSKAS RULER into stretch run, evened out late and got caught for show. FRANKLY
EPIC set a pressured pace in the opening quarter, got overtaken by TOSKAS RULER entering the turn, chased along the inside then faded in the lane.
AMERICAN POSSE rated just off the early pace, hustled along four wide around the turn then the rein broke leaving the turn, taken wide and not
persevered with late.

Footnotes
PALACE GUARD dueled inside of C R INSTAGATOR up the backstretch, shook free mid-way around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, remained
confidently handled and finished ridden out. SHIPS ON FIRE raced off the clear top flight in early stages, launched a three wide bid in upper stretch and
finished second best. SUCCESSION raced in the last flight, rode the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and
cleared the rest. TAP THE BRAKES raced off the clear top flight positioned near the inside, chased two wide around the turn then faded in the lane. C R
INSTA GATOR dueled outside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not match strides mid-way around the turn then tired in the drive. LATE FOR
LUNCH turned head right when the gate opened and came away slow losing a lot of ground on the field, rushed up to race in the last flight, came five wide
into upper stretch and never threatened. STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START, AFTER REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED LATE FOR
LUNCH RECEIVED A FAIR START WHICH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
SAVOYA RETURN vied three deep up the backstretch, continued to battle outside of PREACHER MAN SAM past the quarter pole, came two wide into
upper stretch, took a slim lead, widened advantage a furlong out and held clear. WILY WADE vied inside a duo up the backstretch, flattened off the top pair
near the mid-way point on the turn, angled three wide for the drive, launched a game rebid, steadily edged back up and nipped rival for place. PREACHER
MAN SAM vied between rivals up the backstretch, battled on with SAVOYA RETURN past the quarter pole, could not match with eventual winner at the
head of the lane but ran on in close range and got nipped for place in final stride. RULING THE ROOST was off a step slow at the start, raced in the back,
moved up closer four wide late on the turn, ran on three wide in the lane but lacked the needed kick for impact.
