Footnotes
NORTH WARDEN was content to sit outside watching the frontrunner in the early going, moved in by the quarter pole to bid three wide outside in upper
stretch and when set down drew off smartly in the final furlong for the win. MONDAY MORNING travelled outside horses in midfield down the backside, took
closer order on the front pair when asked at the five sixteenths pole, posed the only threat three wide turning for home and determinedly chased the winner
but to no avail down the stretch. THEFRONTIERSMAN co-trailed on the rail at the half, started to commence a run when shifting outside in midturn,
gathered more momentum in the five path straightening for home and rallied in the stretch to be a clear third. LEGS LIKE GIZMO pulled the rider to the lead
while under a snug hold setting a soft pace up front into the wind, dictated terms alone on the lead throughout the turn, was collared outside by the winner in
upper stretch, could not offer any more resistance by the furlong marker and faded to save for a minor share in the end. DEMBA tracked the pacesetter
inside down the back straight, was asked for more but could not go with the front two running around the turn and finished up willingly to the wire while
dueling for a minor piece of the prize. MUCHO MAGNIFICO co-trailed on the outside at the half, made little impact three wide between horses through the
turn, shifted out to be four wide for the drive but failed to menace in the stretch running. MODDASSAH broke in, hopped at the start, settled in mid-division
on the rail with four furlongs to run, was urged for more midway around the bend inside foes but was going the wrong way and could not offer a finish in the
stretch drive. ARRAKASTA IZAN stalked three deep outside rivals along the backside, could not keep up with others while travelling three to four wide
around the turn, angled out widest in the seven path for the drive but could not factor down the lane.

Footnotes
JIM'S HOPE was off a step slow to trail in the beginning, improved mildly on the fence along the backside, inched closer, saving all the ground in the far
turn, was encouraged left handed in upper stretch, found his best stride late and wore down the stubborn frontrunner in the final seventy yards. PENNER
ASH (IRE) cleared the field to get to the fence into the first turn setting the fractions, continued to roll on unopposed down the backside, spurted away at the
top of the lane but just could not hold off the winner late and gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards to be second best. NOAHS ARK settled just
behind the frontrunner on the rail in the early stages, closed the gap on the leader when nudged for more at the quarter pole, was no match for the top two
in upper stretch and stayed on to the finish line to hold safe for the show money. UPTOWN LIGHTS travelled four deep outside horses tracking the leader in
the first turn, was relegated to the back of the pack between foes at the half mile marker, offered a brief run when bursting through runners at the quarter
pole but was one paced in the lane to settle on the fringes in the end. HEMLO GOLD had a tracking position in the three path with runners on both sides in
the first bend, settled near the rear three deep on the outside down the back straight, was hard ridden but made little headway around the far turn, angled
out to be five wide turning for home and gave way at the furlong marker. GRAN SPIRITED tracked just outside in the two path into the first bend, continued
to just sit behind and outside the pacesetter down the backstretch, could not quicken when between rivals at the three furlong marker, backed away through
the final turn and was empty for the drive to the line.

Footnotes
READY SHAKESPEARE co-trailed on the outside at the half mile marker, started to rally around rivals with seven sixteenths from home, continued a good
sustained four wide run, circling the field on the turn, angled five wide for the drive, was tenacious down the lane and got up at the wire under a well timed
stretch rally. DREAM JEREEM emerged from the pack to have the lead at the five furlong pole, opened up on runners throughout the turn, was still moving
well, in control straightening for the drive, never wavered to the finish line but was just outrun late by the surging winner while still easily besting the rest of
the field. SPEEDY PAL was brushed outside to begin, stalked in the third flight outside rivals down the backside, kept pace with the leaders while inside
horses around the turn to be in range for a share by upper stretch and finished up with run on the fence to nail third money at the wire. FAIRWAY TO
HEAVEN had a good spot, watching the engaged duo down the back straight, closed in to narrow the gap by the quarter pole, posed a threat three wide at
the top of the stretch, ran well down the lane but stalled late to just lose the show award at the finish line. UNCAPTURED MOMENT travelled in mid-division
with runners on both sides, took the short way around going evenly on the turn, angled out to the three path for the stretch run and finished up with good
intent in deep stretch. COHERENCE was brushed at the start, lost some positions when shuffled back a touch along the backside, made a brief run in the
third tier between horses with the eventual winner to his outside at the quarter pole, shifted to the five path for the drive and finished up willingly to the wire.
PET SOUNDS was off a step slow to trail at the start, improved on the fence to sit in mid-pack by the half, was steadied sharply at the seven sixteenths
marker on the rail and could not play a role after the fact. HATMAKER GIZMO co-trailed on the inside at the half, made little progression around the turn and
passed a weary rival on the fence in the lane. FAST AND READY was hustled outside to prompt the pace along the backstretch, chased the pacesetter but
was losing ground through the turn and retreated between foes four wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes
READY TO BATTLE was well-placed early stalking from outside, was four to five wide into and on the turn, advanced to bid just past the five-sixteenths
while coming in a bit, moved clear leaving the bend still nearer the rail, was under strong urging throughout the drive and just lasted. THREAD bumped the
outer rival at the start, settled outside toward the rear, went five to six wide on the turn, was gaining steadily late but just missed. SAPPHIRE CONNECT
was taken in hand settling mid-pack, raced mostly four to five wide through the turn and stretch, secured and held show honors while no match for the top
pair. SNATCHED settled at the rear off the rail but inside runners, shifted six wide leaving the turn, kept on between foes in the stretch to improve. SCAT
GIRL was bumped at the start, outpaced early, raced uncomfortably behind and between heading into the turn, swung seven deep turning into upper
stretch, kept on but needed more. MISS DEMANDING exchanged a bump at the start, was coaxed forward between runners to force the pace, regained
command briefly early on the turn, ran on but needed more. YORKTON ROSE exchanged a bump at the start, chased nearly mid-pack inside off the rail,
was one-paced and not a threat. MCGILL broke just a bit awkwardly, attended the early pace, was still within range three to four wide when put to urging at
the three-eighths, lacked the needed response. CRIMSON SEA was forwardly-positioned between runners mid-pack, came up empty. SPUN AROUND was
forwardly-placed inside prompting the pace, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY FIELDS tracked on the fence in the early going, galloped along smartly, moving well on the rail behind the leader along the backside, had
nowhere to go nestled on the rail through the final turn, finally found a seam, angling out in the four path by mid-stretch, got clear and exploded late to get up
a few jumps before the wire with a patiently handled ride. LITERATE tracked in the second flight outside foes on the first bend, continued to be outside
runners in midfield down the backside, closed in when forced to move between horses three wide with five sixteenths from the wire, was checked losing her
path three wide in upper stretch, re-rallied when shifting five wide at the furlong pole and got up to get the nod for second place right on the line.
WICKENHEISER was unhurried to trail in the early going, continued to settle into stride at the rear down the backstretch, swooped around runners four wide
on the final turn, loomed boldly in the five path turning for home, took the lead briefly at the furlong pole but was outkicked late to settle for third money at the
wire. MARKSMAN QUEEN (GB) took command at the start, was unchallenged, slowing the pace down along the backside, was headed outside by a
barrage of horses at the quarter pole, dug in stubbornly on the fence in upper stretch fending off rivals until the eighth pole, had no more to offer late and
faded with seventy yards remaining to settle on the fringes. TALBEYAH (IRE) stalked near the rear outside rivals in the first turn, made an early move four
wide around the field at the three furlong pole, seized command shifting inwards to the three path in upper stretch, could not continue the run and stalled in
the final seventy yards. DEVIL'S BIT stalked near the back inside in the early stages of the race, could not gain on rivals, seeing the field while running
around the final turn and passed a weary foe outside at the furlong marker. TAQUANYAH pressed the pace outside in the first turn, was relegated to a
tracking role just behind the pacesetter along the backside, was roused trying to keep up between rivals at the quarter pole, offered little response and wilted
in upper stretch. SPANSIVE refused at the start and walked off.
