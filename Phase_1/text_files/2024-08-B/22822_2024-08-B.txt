Footnotes
OLIVIERA stalked the pace from the rail to midway on the turn, rallied up the inside to take command nearing the quarter pole, quickly drew clear when
called upon in upper stretch and was wrapped up late in the drive as much the best. JULIA'S A FOX pressed the early pace, settled in hand off the
pacesetter on the bend and finished willingly to be second best while no match for the winner. TIERRA SANTA showed early speed to take command down
the backside, widened on the turn and had no answer when challenged weakening through the lane. THOUSAND AND WON was always outrun.

Footnotes
NAUTILUS stalked the pace for the first five-eighths, circled three wide to engage the leaders at the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and finished
well unthreatened through the lane. GROUP EIGHTEEN tracked the pace through the turn, rallied four wide turning for home, wandered a bit in upper
stretch and kept-on willingly to gain the place. BRUCE BANNER reserved off the pace for a half mile, made a steady advance to contend in upper stretch
and was out-finished in the drive. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED trailed for three-quarters and passed weakened rivals in the lane. ZOOMER went evenly as a
non-threatening. GOODLUCKCHUCK prompted the pace to midway on the turn and weakened coming home. HE IS BONAFIDE showed speed to lead for
a half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
SLIPPIN JIMMY reserved off the pace near the rear of the field early, rallied on the turn, lacked racing room nearing the quarter pole having to be held up,
re-bid in upper stretch, split rivals forcing his way through three wide in deep stretch and was going away at the wire. THE CONNECTOR set a pressured
pace from three wide to the top of the lane, edged clear in upper stretch and could not hold off the closing winner while holding the place gamely. JUPITER
BLUES tracked the leaders from the fence saving ground on the turn, tipped out two wide down the lane to loom and was out-finished late in the drive.
UNCLE ANDREW broke a step slow to be at the rear of the field, circled eight wide turning for home and closed with good interest belatedly. LOVE YOU
MUCH stalked the pace from between rivals through the turn, rallied to be prominent in mid-stretch and flattened out late. BACKWOODS BOOGIE chased
the pace from five wide through the turn and weakened in the lane. MY BOY BLUE raced in the back half of the field through the turn, commenced a rally
turning for home, lacked racing room in upper stretch and finished evenly. SPRITZER pressed the pace from the inside to the head of the lane and gradually
gave way in the stretch run.

ARCTIC OUTBREAK stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, rallied on the turn, drifted out to the five path turning for home to mount his bid,
wore down the pacesetters inside the sixteenth pole, came out to bump his outside rival late in the drive and prevailed at the wire. RUNNER EYES
unhurried for the first five-eighths to be near the rear of the field, rallied from seven wide turning for home, drifted in to put GANGSTER in tight quarters in
upper stretch, closed well down the lane to be gaining on the outside, was bumped hard in the final hundred yards by the winner and kept-on to just miss.
RADIANT TONES prompted the pace down the backside, assumed command into the final bend, dueled on the lead to deep stretch and could not hold off
the top pair in a game effort. BUY TOM A BEER stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied to battle on the lead through the lane and was outkicked in the final
yards. GANGSTER reserved off the pace to race mid-pack to midway on the far turn, rallied six wide turning for home, was in tight quarters in upper stretch
and flattened out. LUCKY CAT was not a threat. BULL RIDER set the pace for a half mile and tired. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE
RIDER OF RUNNER EYES CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER IN DEEP STRETCH, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
RENNIE was well placed along the inside, angled out nearing the furlong marker and made a bid to edge clear in the final sixteenth to prove best under a
drive. GREEN BEANS set a pressured pace on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn, then dug in leaving the furlong marker but could not hold off his
barn mate while being clearly second best. LOTHARIO was bumped at the break, pressed the pace three to two wide, then faded in the drive, held show
award. BAND LEADER broke out and bumped a rival at the break, settled on the outside, four wide on the turn and came five wide off the turn and improved
position. TIK TOK DADDY was settled early on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the trun, angled in nearing the furlong marker and had no rally.
NANCY MADE MY DAY tracked the pace three wide on the turn and weakened. CECIL THE GREAT was settled early in between rivals, two wide by the
quarter pole while being no threat.

Footnotes
COAST ALONG broke alertly to take command from the gate, was well rated while under mild pressure to the top of the lane, widened the advantage in
upper stretch and was unchallenged through the lane. JETAROS pressed the pace early from the fence, was taken in hand to settle into a stalking position
along the rail to midway on the turn, rallied while tipping out two wide, could not gain on the winner and chased him down the lane as second best. GREAT
IDEA unhurried for the first three-eighths, mounted a five wide rally circling the field and closed willingly to be along for the show. SILVER FRONT trailed to
the top of the lane and made a belated bid from wide down the stretch. VINSANITY raced mid-pack through the turn rallied mildly in upper stretch and
flattened out. HAPPY JAUNT raced near the rear of the field most of the way and mounted a mild rally without impact in the stretch. ZARTOWNIS stalked
the pace to be prominent at the head of the lane and faded through the stretch. SHOWSTOPPER COPPER showed brief speed to prompt the pace and
came up empty.

Footnotes
UNION BULLDOG well held in the early going to be near the rear of the field along the fence, kept off heels, patiently handled, rallied five wide on the far
turn to engage the leaders in upper stretch and prevailed in a determined drive. HALLELUJAH HARRIS stalked the pace from the rail down the backside,
rallied on the turn tipping out around tiring rivals, dove to the inside in upper stretch to find clear racing and finished willingly along the fence unable to reel in
the winner while clearly second best. GRAND KINGDOM tracked the leaders from three wide to the far turn, rallied to be prominent turning for home and
finished evenly unable to sustain the bid. REGGAE MAN took command on a well rated pace, opened a clear lead down the backside and had no answer
when challenged at the quarter pole. KARMA'S INTHEHOUSE was rank down the lane the first time, fought restraint while attempting to get out on the first
turn temporarily losing his action, settled down the backstretch and finished with mild interest while still racing wide. NAVY ADMIRAL raced in contention
down the backside on the outside of the second pair, and had no response when called upon entering the final bend.

Footnotes
QUOKKA settled in hand to a tracking position in the first turn, continued to be well placed along the fence on the far turn in striking distance, tipped out at
the head of the lane to take command and prevailed in the drive. SMART STRIKER unhurried ifor the first half mile to be near the rear of the field, made a
steady advance to contention on the far turn, worked through traffic in upper stretch to find clear racing along the fence and closed willingly. NORTHERN
TICK TOCK rated while tracking the leaders from four wide, rallied on the turn to loom in mid-stretch and failed to sustain the bid finishing evenly.
WRITEITONTHEICE reserved off the pace to the far turn saving ground along the rail and mounted a mild bid in the lane. SILVERBULLETTWENTY raced
near the rear of the field to the head of the lane and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. KOLOMIO set the pace through the first turn, surrendered the lead
when rival made an early move down the backside, continued to chase the pace through the final bend and weakened in the stretch. SPLENDID SUMMER
stalked the leaders through the first turn, rallied from three wide down the backside to take command to upper stretch and tired late in the lane.
CAPTURETHELAUGHTER showed brief speed to be with the leaders for a half mile and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
RYE DIGGITYDOG was settled early, advanced on the inide on the turn and made a inside move off the turn and was clear by the furlong marker and
maintained a clear lead to the wire under right handed crop urging. GET THEM DIGITS broke in the air at the start and trailed early, two wide on the turn,
swung out five to six wide leaving the turn and closed well to be clearly second best. DUCKPINS was reserved early and saved ground on the turn, then had
a good finish on the inside to gain the show award. PAYNTED BLUE was away alertly to set the early pace while clear but was trying to lug out on the turn
while in the four wide, then faded the final furlong. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT chased the pace and was two wide on the turn, made a mild bid two wide off
the turn but flattened out. ZALFIERRO chased the pace and was three wide on the turn and weakened in the drive.
