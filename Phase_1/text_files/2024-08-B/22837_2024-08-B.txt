Footnotes
SENZA PAROLE bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed between horses, was taken back off the pace in the vicinity of the nine-sixteenths pole then
moved out, gained quickly in the four path early on the turn then made a bid outside the three-eighths pole, cruised to the front coming to the quarter-pole
then turned into the stretch in the five path, accelerated clear near the three-sixteenths pole then drifted in while drawing off and widened while kept to the
task under a mild hand-ride to prove much the best. STUNNER was coaxed along on the outside, chased in the five path on the turn, pursued the winner in
the stretch and was clearly second best. HAY EVABODY showed speed on the outside of foes then set the pace, dropped from the three path to the rail
under urging on the turn, was headed by the winner near the quarter-pole and tired while clear for the show. ICE CREAM BOAT bumped with a rival at the
start then dropped back, was urged along near the rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came into the stretch in the six path and failed
to threaten. SPUN CANDY showed speed on the inside of rivals, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths pole, chased while moving from the rail to the two
path on the turn and capitulated. COMPLEX SECRET was urged along off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths pole, shifted from the two path to the
three path on the turn, lugged in some in the stretch and came up empty. TIPTOP stumbled at the start and was last away, raced on the outside under
urging while well back, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
JUST MUSIC away well and to the front, got eased off and was taken brief hold midway on the first dog legged turn, chased just off the inside coming under
urging at the seven-sixteenths behind foes, tipped out three wide to a clear lane as DAZZY tipped four wide and leaned on THORNY making a fortuitous
opening at the three-eighths, advanced on the front and swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge and was bumped by
PRINCESS BECCA coming out when seizing command a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish. PRINCESS BECCA raced three then two
wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch, took over command at the
three-sixteenths, dug in under challenge from flanking rivals, came out to look JUST MUSIC in the eye and bumped her when headed for command at the
sixteenth pole, ran on safe for the place honors. ELLIPTIC coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive well clear of the rest for the place honors while outkicked by the top pair. THORNY coaxed from the start,
chased three then four wide, got nudged five wide at the three-eighths by DAZZY when placed to coaxing, continued five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. ENIGMATIC established the front shortly after the start and showed the way crossing to the inside into the backstretch after being three wide
through the first turn, remained on hold until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in and was collared at
the three-sixteenths and tired. DAZZY four wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch, was three wide into the far turn
and tipped out four wide at the three-eighths carrying THORNY five wide at that station, faded and tucked three wide into upper stretch, then tired through to
the finish.

Footnotes
EL REZEEN was rated between horses in the two path on the first turn then settled on the inside, moved closer on the final turn, shifted to the two path late
on that bend, rallied four wide into the stretch, accelerated to the front inside the three-sixteenths pole then kicked clear, responded well in the final furlong
and remained clear under steady urging to prevail. BE LIKE CLINT had his head turned and was unprepared at the start while last away, was taken under a
tight hold at the rear, lagged at the back while reserved inside to the two path, remained at the rear on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole,
swung six wide into the stretch then drifted out under a left-handed crop and finished willingly to get up for the place. CLASSIC CREATION dropped from
the two path to the inside on the first turn, settled off the pace in the two path, moved closer on the final turn, steadied outside the quarter-pole, came three
wide into the stretch then moved further out, split foes around the furlong marker and earned the show. HARRY HOOD broke out at the start, was hard held
in the three path while between foes on the first turn then reserved in the two to three path, came under urging late on the backstretch, went three wide on
the final turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. HUNT BALL was reserved under a tight hold while saving ground, gained
while moving from the two path to the rail on the final turn, waited behind horses at the quarter-pole then came off the inside in upper stretch, brushed with a
foe inside the three-sixteenths pole and came up empty. BORN DANCER went three wide on the first turn, tracked the leader in the two path, was urged
along late on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the final turn, brushed with a foe near the five-sixteenths pole, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, brushed with an opponent inside the three-sixteenths pole, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. UNION TRAIL went to the front, raced
two path to the inside on the first turn, showed the way with a clear advantage on the inside, was let out when briefly challenged with five furlongs to run,
came under encouragement along the rail on the final turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and gave way. BREES was hustled from the
gate after breaking towards the rear then rushed up into the first turn, raced in the four path on that bend, settled outside in the three path, tracked the pace
down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the final turn, brushed with a rival near the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back into the final furlong and
tired.

BIG BLUE LINE got bumped at the start by CASTLE CHAOS, who recovered inwards from a stumble, and in turn bumped ROCKET CAN, chased along the
inside through the first turn before tipping three wide down the backstretch, remained patiently handled as rivals got busy through the far turn, swung three
to four wide at the quarter pole, tipped out three paths at the three-sixteenths from in behind rivals stacked in front, rallied to issue a challenge inside the
final furlong and surged late to get up in the final jumps to the finish. ROCKET CAN got bumped at the start by BIG BLUE LINE due to pressure from
CASTLE CHAOS, chased just off the inside, came under coaxing briefly inside at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was
bumped by POWER SEEKER due to pressure from CASTLE CHAOS coming in when switching leads, tipped out bumping POWER SEEKER back into
CASTLE CHAOS and in turn UNTREATED gaining clearance from in behind the leader to dig in under a drive and take command near the sixteenth pole,
dug in under late threat and was nailed in the final strides. WINIT coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way
crossing to the two path into the backstretch, settled in hand and into a comfortable rhythm patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared a sixteenth from home, then kept on to the finish. UNTREATED
coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, got bumped by CASTLE
CHAOS three-sixteenths out due to pressure from ROCKET CAN tipping out beginning a chain of bumps and stayed on one paced through to the finish.
UNBRIDLED BOMBER four wide through the opening dog legged turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid while unable to impact the top spots. POWER SEEKER coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and got bumped outside by CASTLE CHAOS straightened away and in turn
bumped ROCKET CAN, had that foe tip out near the three-sixteenths and was bumped inside and back out into CASTLE CHAOS, then weakened in the
late stages. CASTLE CHAOS stumbled awkwardly inwards at the start bumping BIG BLUE LINE into ROCKET CAN, chased three wide through the first
turn and then four wide down the backstretch, continued four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into
upper stretch, came inwards when switching leads straightened away and bumped POWER SEEKER into ROCKET CAN, then had ROKCET CAN tip
outwards and bump POWER SEEKER and was bumped by that rival out into UNTREATED three-sixteenths from home before weakening in the late going.

FUTURE IS NOW moved in early and took the path from a rival, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two then three path on the turn, had the rider
look behind him to both sides while taking the lead at the quarter-pole, floated out and bumped STAR GUEST soundly into upper stretch then was
straightened, lost the advantage at that point, dueled inside that foe under strong handling, regained the lead approaching the sixteenth-pole, swapped back
to her inside lead late and gamely prevailed. STAR GUEST (GB) was rated off the pace under a snug hold, moved from the two path to the four path while
in dead-aim of the leader on the turn, gained to make a bid while bumped soundly and carried out to the six path into upper stretch, took a short lead at that
juncture, dueled outside the winner under a drive while remaining on her inside lead, lost the advantage back to that foe nearing the sixteenth-pole and
missed while clear for the place. ROSES FOR DEBRA settled at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path, was roused outside the
quarter-pole then swung into the seven path entering the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick while far clear for the show.
LADY MILAGRO was restless in the gate, came away in good order, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path while under extra
left-rein pressure on the turn, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole then spun three wide into the stretch and tired. GLITTER UP was taken up briefly while
having her path taken by FUTURE IS NOW early, settled near the back, was urged along in the four path on the turn, drifted in outside the furlong marker
and had nothing left. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors while well clear of the rest and along second best. DREAM ON CARA bobbled at the break,
chased just off the inside down the backstretch before going four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide

inside under some pressure from a pair and then a trio to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front just inside the
five-sixteenths and took the inside route into upper stretch, then folded in the drive. MAXING THE BANK stumbled at the start and was bumped by GOING

Footnotes
RARE ART moved around in the gate just before the start and was off a step slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside while given cover,
was roused while three then four wide on the far turn, rallied in the five path into the stretch then made a bid outside of two foes, took a short lead into the
final furlong, battled outside of two rivals while drifting in outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging. GOOD CONDUCT established a
forward position early, dropped in to race in the two path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under a snug hold, turned up the pressure in the
two path on the far turn, made a bid in the four path into the stretch, took a narrow advantage around the three-sixteenths pole, battled between foes into
the final sixteenth and missed while able to get the place. WILD AND FREE went to the front, dropped to the inside into the first turn, was well rated while
setting the pace, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, fought on
inside of two rivals into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. POOKIE saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, raced
inside for most of the far turn then moved to the two path, was roused near the quarter-pole and improved for the last spot in the superfecta. TIZ HER
MONEY saved ground while settling towards the rear, was roused while cutting the corner into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths pole and
lacked the needed response. AMERICAN JUSTICE leaned out then bumped with a foe at the start, was taken under restraint early, tugged keenly on the bit
into the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole and came
up empty. FORCE OF LAW became rank while taken under restraint early, was vigorously held off heels nearing the first turn, went two to three wide while
rank through that bend, raced under reserve while still fighting the rider some, was let out then roused in the two then three path on the far turn, moved out
near the furlong marker and failed to rally. LEANER AND MEANER broke out at the start, raced three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside but
with some cover, went three wide while roused on the far turn and was no factor then was reported to have bled. RESCUE ME bumped with an opponent at
the start, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, went three then four wide while roused on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch and also failed to rally. OUR PROSPERITY was urged along early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was roused in the
four to five path on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MARIACHI broke out then was corrected by the rider, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took a short lead under urging in
upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. CLASSIFY brushed with a rival at the start, moved
up between horses to get the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper
stretch, fought on gamely while dueling with that foe to the finish and just missed while clear for the place. DILGER (IRE) settled off the pace, was roused
while inside on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and finished with good courage to get the show. FORREST
CITY broke out and brushed with a foe, chased the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted to the three path, was driven into the
stretch in the five path and lacked the needed kick. TIVY leapt in the air and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, settled on the outside under
some urging, went five wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. DAUFUSKIE
ISLAND raced just off the pace, chased between horses while three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. EDIFIED was off
slow and spotted the front several lengths, angled in while urged along near the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. NOTAH
was hustled from the gate then urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the
drive and came up empty. LEDDY broke a bit slow then dropped back, angled in under urging at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn,
came into the stretch in the three path and was no factor.

Footnotes
RAGING SEA broke out at the start brushing IDIOMATIC, settled along the inside through the first turn before tipping out to the three path down the
backstretch unhurried near the rear, remained on hold until placed to coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch briefly
carrying SOUL OF AN ANGEL out before clearing that foe straightened away, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and
was bumped in the shadow of the wire before getting up in the last jump to prevail. IDIOMATIC got brushed at the start by RAGING SEA, who broke out a
step, ranged up inside of RANDOMIZED to engage that rival in head to head combat into the first turn from the two path, knocked heads widening away as
a team down the backstretch tucked to the inside, remained inside through the far turn shaking off RANDOMIZED with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside
route into upper stretch and got roused for the drive straightened away, the rider peering to the infield board to assess any oncoming threat, dug in under a
right handed crop and shied out near the eighth pole, came under a left handed crop and shied in near the sixteenth marker all while under growing threat to
the outside, dug in once more under a right handed crop and came out three to four paths bumping RAGING SEA just before being nailed on the wire.
SOUL OF AN ANGEL broke a beat slow and conceded three lengths to the front before settling into stride at the tail of the field, raced just off the inside
through the first turn and then three wide down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled
six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. RANDOMIZED stumbled to her knees forwardly at the start breaking on top despite the
stumble, raced three wide through the first turn engaged head to head by IDIOMATIC to the inside, dueled from the two path down the backstretch widening
away as a pair from the rest of the field, continued just off the inside through the far turn and began to get shaken off three furlongs out, came under urging
at the five-sixteenths beginning to retreat and spun just off the inside at the head of the lane, then tired through the stretch. XIGERA chased along the inside
and then just off the inside isolated between the duel up front and the pair of rivals out back, came under coaxing three furlongs from home attempting to get
first run on the duel, spun two to three wide into upper stretch in retreat and faltered in the drive.
