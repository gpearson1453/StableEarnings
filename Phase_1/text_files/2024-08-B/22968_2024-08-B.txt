Footnotes
MACHO MUSIC set a clear pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened under mild hand urging. NESHUME chased the winner
in the three path, was no match for that foe but held well to a clear second. WIN WITH FAITH raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch
and rallied for the show. BOHEMIAN STYLE saved ground off the pace, angled into the three path in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. ALWAYS A
GENTLEMAN played no factor while racing three wide. HELICON broke a step slow, saved ground and never threatened. WHISKY RESERVE failed to
menace while racing five wide. SUMMERFIELD was outrun while racing three wide. VALIANT MELODY had his head turned at the start, raced four wide
and never reached contention.

Footnotes
BOSTON ROSE (IRE) stalked in the four path, bid early around the far turn, took the lead in the three path midway around the far turn, was roused passing
the quarter, and kicked away. BEACH READY set the pace in the two path, was cued when challenged by an outer foe passing the three-eighths mark, lost
the lead midway around the far turn, but chased on from the four path in the stretch to hold place. SLENDER SLIPPER rated in the five path, was coaxed
along while three wide going into the far turn, but was one paced from the four path in the stretch for show. CLASSIC BALLAD tracked in the two path, was
driven along the rail around the far turn, but flattened. C. S. VIVACE had a slow start, trailed in the four path early and never threatened. ORO ORO laid off
the pace in the three path but was no menace.

VINICIO stalked in the four path, was coaxed along around the turn, took aim while swinging out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kicked on to inch
ahead in the final strides. COVE STAR set the pace in the two path, was roused passing the quarter, ran on while hanging on his left lead down the stretch,
but was nailed by an outer foe at the wire to place. INSOLENT bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, was driven
around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. CAJUN'S CHOICE raced off the pace in the two path, angled out to
the six path at the top of the stretch, but got stymied in upper stretch, and made no impact. GO CHARLIE GO tracked in the two path, was coaxed from the
rail around the turn, but flattened. MAX FORWARD SPEED bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path early but never threatened.
RAGS SPECIAL bumped on both sides at the start, trailed in the three path early and never menaced.

SOCIALLONGDISTANCE set a clear pace while racing in the two and three paths, drew off down the backstretch, widened around the far turn, continued
on the left lead in the lane and held clear under a drive. CASHIER CHECK saved ground off the pace and ran on inside to gain the place late. ROAR
READY chased the pace two wide, could not gain on the winner and was outfinished for the place. WAR BEAT failed to menace while racing four and five
wide. REMINDER played no factor while racing two and three wide. PRIVATE THOUGHTS threw his head at the start, raced off the pace four wide and
lacked the needed rally. UNO TIGER was outrun while racing four wide. MANHATTAN BOY chased the pace three wide and retreated after six furlongs.

MOST HANDSOME got pinched at the start, tracked in the four path, swung from the five path under a drive turning into the lane, and stayed on to draw
past an inner foe in the final sixteenth. ITZA BOSS prompted the pace in the three path, bid in the two path early around the turn, took the lead approaching
the quarter, drew clear in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. BACK EM UP rated along the rail early, was coaxed
along around the turn, and finished evenly from the four path down the lane for show. ZADDY chased in the three path, was ridden in the two path around
the turn, and did not factor. RIDING A DREAM broke in at the start, raced wellback in the five path and made no impact. RIPTON'S MUSIC set the pace in
the two path, lost the lead along the inside midway around the turn, and faded. MEGA DON raced off the pace in the four path and never menaced. CAJUN
VENOM broke in at the start, pulled up early and was transported off the track in an equine ambulance.

Footnotes
DEFENDED set the pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch and held clear under steady urging. PUCKERED raced off the pace in the two path,
waited briefly for room in upper stretch then finished willingly to be clearly second best. FIELD OF BLOSSOMS raced up close at the rail, angled three wide
in upper stretch and was no match for the winner while holding well enough for the show. MARVELOUS LADY stalked the pace three wide and weakened in
the drive. CHILLING FACTOR chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) was outrun inside. PLANKTON played no factor
while racing four wide.

Footnotes
GLOBES tracked in the two path, was driven from the three path into the far turn, bid while floating out to the six path at the top of the lane, stuck his head in
front passing the eighth pole, and just held on in a head bob. BRYCE CANYON dropped wellback early, got coaxed along in the three path after a half, was
driven from the four path around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and rallied, but missed the bob. GENTLEMAN GERRY laid
in range from the four path down the backstretch and kept on down the lane for show. NIGHT JUMPER stalked in the three path, bid under rousing from the
two path going into the far turn, took command midway around the far turn, angled out to the four path entering the stretch, but faded on her left lead.
COACH ABERNATHY raced off the pace in the two path but never threatened. SPETTRO showed the way in the two path but gaveway along the inside
passing the quarter.

Footnotes
STING MUSIC stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes around the far turn, took a narrow lead between foes nearing the quarter pole then drew off
under a drive in the lane. RAPSCALLION was soundly bumped on both sides at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch and
rallied for the place. TITAN moved to the lead in the three path around the first turn, drew clear midway around that bend, set the pace along the rail around
the far turn, was collared near the quarter pole and kept on well enough for the show. STARSHIP MAGELLAN had his head turned at the start, raced off the
pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and had a mild gain. DIXIE PREACH tracked the pace three wide, bid three deep midway
around the far turn but weakened in the lane. FIRST SHOT FIRED was bumped at the start, chased the pace two and three wide and faded through the
lane. FIGHT TIL DAWN broke in and bumped RAPSCALLION into FIRST SHOT FIRED, raced off the pace two wide and played no further factor.
