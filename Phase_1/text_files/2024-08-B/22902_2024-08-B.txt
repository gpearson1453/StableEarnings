Footnotes
SIR trailed down the backstretch, circled his field rapidly in the six path through upper stretch to make the lead past the furlong marker under right handed
urging then drew off at will to win as much the best. SIR MASON made the lead soon after the start, shook clear on the turn, set the pace until deep stretch
then was no match for the winner. PRINCE FRED saved ground and went evenly. SKYHOOPER chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed
response. MARSICO chased the leader two wide into the stretch and weakened late. OUTA JAIL ON BAIL was no factor.

Footnotes
VAL'S TWINSTAR away alertly, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, shook clear on the turn then widened the balance of the trip under mild right
handed urging to win as much the best. BOLD RUBY settled along the inside, rallied through the turn two wide, bumped hard with BOLD RUBY past the
quarter pole and finished second best. CANELA FINA unhurried early, found her best stride late in the five path. RON DAH LOU was bumped between
rivals at the start, stalked the pace three wide and went evenly. MISS SIX veered out at the start bumping RON DAH LOU, prompted the pace two wide into
the turn then weakened in the stretch. SOMETHING LUCKY failed to menace. RALPH'S LIL' VICKY had brief speed. PRINCESS EM vied for the lead along
the rail, was bumped hard past the quarter pole, checked hard and dropped out of it. RIVERS RUN RED bumped at the start and was through early. WINGS
OF HEAVEN threw her head at the start and trailed throughout. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED
BOLD RUBY FOR INTERFERENCE PAST THE QUARTER POLE AND PLACED HER EIGHTH.

Footnotes
RAISE THE PURSES was restless in the gate, bumped at the start, allowed to settle, rallied steadily on the far turn and into the stretch four then three wide
under left handed urging, made the lead near the furlong marker and edged clear in the final stages under strong handling. SERVE REVENGE COLD
bobbled inward bumping the winner at the start, prompted the early pace three wide, made the lead nearing the far turn, set the pace until mid stretch then
held on for second. UNBRIDLED CAUSE set a pressured pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, dropped inside before the far turn, kept on but was
outfinished in a determined effort. SERENDIPITOUS pressed the pace along the inside for a half, dropped back and shifted three wide, remained a sharp
threat into the stretch and weakened late. BEAT THE DEALER was no threat. OHIO EAGLE was no factor. KARAMEL CORN was restless in the gate and
trailed.

GRETCHENS MANE MAN prompted the pace two wide past the quarter pole, made the lead, drifted to the middle of the racetrack at the top of the stretch,
was put to right handed urging, opened a clear lead before the furlong marker and lasted under strong handling while gradually shifting into the four path.
PROFESSOR NICK stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in along the rail but was too late. JAC'S EMPIRE set the pace to the top of the stretch and was
outfinished while racing in the two path. COLONEL COOPER failed to menace. AIR RAID was fractious in the gate then never threatened. DR. GEORGE
had good early speed then faded.

into the stretch and drifted to the five path in the final stages while closing some ground. AWESOME ENOUGH had speed from the start, moved up two
wide through the turn, shifted to the seven path in deep stretch and finished evenly. ESTILO FAVORITO stumbled outward bumping LAUDA SPEED at the

QUEENIE ROSE unhurried early, closed rapidly along the inside under left handed urging through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. EMERSON
JONES pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and just missed. LARRY'S ANGEL set a pressured pace along
the inside into the stretch, also drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and was narrowly beaten. SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS threw her head as the gate
opened, reared high in the air causing her rider to lost his left iron and was declared a non starter. BODIL had brief speed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW CONCLUDED THAT SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS DID NOT RECEIVE A FAIR START AND WAS DECLARED A
NON-STARTER.
