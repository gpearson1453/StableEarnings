Footnotes
SPURS UP stalked the pace through the turn, rallied two wide to take command in upper stretch, drew away through the lane and was under wraps in the
final hundred yards as much best. AIN'T NONCENTS unhurried in the early going to trail, steadily advanced midway on the turn circling six wide at the top
of the stretch and finished willingly as second best. ORANGE JUICE tracked the pace through the turn while well placed in striking distance and failed to
mount a closing rally. EL MIC TIESUN trailed to the quarter pole and showed mild interest in the stretch. ICETECA went evenly without a late bid. MELODY
WIN failed to menace. EL GUAPO showed speed to be on a clear lead through the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHAMPLAIN'S DREAM set a well rated pace under steady pressure throughout, responded when called upon turning for home and repelled all challengers
in a determined drive. BAYWATCH BLONDE broke a bit awkwardly, settled into stride to race mid-pack the first half mile, split rivals on the turn to move to
contention, waited behind a three horse wall at the quarter pole, angled four wide turning for home and steadily closed through the lane and was denied at
the wire. CHANNEL LOOP pressed the pace throughout, battled down the lane, was never able to gain on the winner and finished willingly to hold the show.
CAPO DONNA unhurried for the first half mile to be the trailer, rallied on the turn circling five wide and was gaining late in the drive. SHAKREVENGE
stalked the pace for three-quarters, made a bid in upper stretch to loom and weakened inside the eighth pole. CHANGE ORDER was not a factor. TINS
tracked the leaders for a half mile and faded.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF ABBA set the pace on a well rated, well measured lead, widened her advantage turning for home when called upon and held the closer
safe at the wire. MALAWNIA reserved off the pace to be near the rear of the field for the first half, commenced a steady advance entering the far turn and
closed well to be gaining through the lane coming up just short. ONCE AN EAGLE unhurried for the first five-eighths, rallied five wide circling the field and
mounted a good rally belatedly. KOBE'S SMILE reluctant to load, broke inward crowding rival leaving the gate, tracked the leaders to the far turn, rallied to
threaten on the turn and flattened out late. MARY KATHERINE stalked the pace early, faded into the far turn and finished evenly. CHA CHA TAP was forced
to be in the gate for an extended time when outside rival was reluctant, broke a step slow and was squeezed out at the start and was never a threat from
there travelling one-paced. LADY OPHELIA fractious in the gate, broke well to press the pace for a half mile and gradually gave way.

Footnotes
PASCALINE reserved off the pace saving ground along the fence, tipped out to split rivals on the turn, waited behind rivals turning for home, searched for
racing room in upper stretch, split rivals in the lane surging through a hole that presented itself three wide in mid-stretch and prevailed late in an outstanding
performance. MONTADOR tracked the leaders from four wide in the turn, circled six wide turning for home, took command in mid-stretch and was
out-finished in deep stretch. GOLDEN ICE unhurried early, was set to an early drive on the turn and rallied wide to be gaining late. LOVE PACK broke in the
air giving the field several lengths, gained ground from four wide in the turn, angled nine wide in the lane and mounted a belated rally. START TO WIN well
placed tracking the leaders from the rail in the second flight, rallied turning for home from two wide to threaten and flattened out late in the drive. PENEI set
the pace while dueling from the rail through the turn and weakened down the lane. PARACLETE stalked the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid.
ALIGN pressed the pace from between rivals to the quarter pole and gave way in the lane. NEW PLEX was never a threat. GRAND LIAM pressed the pace
from three wide battling on the lead and stopped turning for home.

Footnotes
STRUTSHERSTUFF stalked the pace from the rail while well in hand, tipped out two wide turning for home to overhaul the pacesetter and was going away
through the lane. HAIL NO broke alertly to take the lead, set the pace on a well measured advantage, had no answer when challenged in upper stretch by
the winner and kept-on willingly to hold the place. SPLASH OF JACK prompted the early pace, dropped back losing position on the turn, re-rallied in the
lane angling to the inside to just miss the show. LAST GLANCE unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field at the quarter pole and showed
late interest in the lane. DAISY MY NAME tracked the pacesetter down the backside, rallied three wide to loom up on the turn and flattened out in the
stretch. SPECIAL CAP went evenly without having an impact. SECESSIONIST trailed most of the way as no threat. FLORINE chased from five wide
through the turn and faded coming home.

NO SHOW SAMMY JO (GB) stalked the pace from the inside to the far turn, was held up waiting for racing room nearing the quarter pole, tipped out two
wide when clear to quickly take command in upper stretch and drew off as much the best. SPOTTY SHOWERS reserved well in hand to be reserved off the
pace down the backside, rallied up the rail cutting the corner turning for home and finished well to be up for the place. INANNA'S QUEST crowded at the
start raced up to prompt the pace to the quarter pole to be well placed in striking distance and had no closing bid. DARK DAHLIA leaned in at the start, was
rated off the pace to the turn, angled eight wide at the top of the lane and put in a mild bid don the stretch. DON'T TELL DEREN made an early four wide bid
on the turn to loom and flattened out. ANGEL ART set the pace on a well rated lead to the far turn and gave way coming home.

Footnotes
BIG BRASS BED stalked the pace from the rail in a pocket trip through the far turn, tipped out three wide to rally in the lane, surged nearing the wire to
prevail and was vanned off. SLEEPWALKER set a well rated pace while well measured comfortably in hand, responded when challenged turning for home,
dug-in through the lane and was caught in the final strides. SETTLING STORM prompted the pace from two wide, made a bid turning for home to duel with
the pacesetter through the lane and was just out-finished in a good effort. TURF ROCKET stalked the pace from three wide through the far turn, rallied
willingly down the lane and just didn't have enough. PLANET CLARE trailed most of the way and mounted a mild rail rally in the lane.
ORDEROFTHEPHOENIX (IRE) was rank while being well held to keep off heels for most of the trip, was never able to settle into a natural rhythm and never
had a chance. HERON BAY was not a threat. LOU ANNA gained ground down the backstretch to slowly gain a contending position on the final turn and
lacked a response when called upon for the drive. THE RACE WAS NOT TIMED DUE TO AN EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
ROCIO tracked the leaders from three wide to the far turn, rallied on the turn to take command nearing the quarter pole and finished well holding the closer
safe through the lane. ALL GAS NO BRAKES reserved off the pace down the backstretch, made a steady advance to be gaining on the final turn, angled
four wide to threaten the leader in mid-stretch, failed to get passed while being second best. JUDY'S FLYER stalked the pace from the pace from the fence
to be well placed turning for home and lacked a closing kick. NEW WAY trailed for a half mile and showed some late interest with a grinding rally. MISS
TAPATIA passed tiring rivals in the stretch. HUIXTLA pressed the pace for three-quarters and faded in the lane. BODY LANGUAGE set the pace for a half
mile and was through early. RACE TIMES ARE UNDER REVIEW DUE TO AN EQUIPMENT ISSUE.

Footnotes
MOON FACTOR broke alertly to take command from the gate set a well measured pace, opened a clear advantage when called upon turning for home and
was unchallenged in the lane. COURAGEOUS MISSION tracked the pace from the rail down the backside, lost position on the turn dropping back and
re-rallied in the stretch to close well to gain the place. HIGHTAILING HARRY stalked the leaders through the turn from between rivals, rallied in upper
stretch and failed to sustain his bid through the lane while being best of the rest. GREY FLANNEL BOSS tucked in along the rail to race mid-pack, was
steadied severely early on the turn when BOLD ROCK stopped abruptly in his path, was gathered up and mounted a belated mild rally in the lane.
STORMIN' RUNNER prompted the pace to the quarter pole and weakened. FORCED ATTITUDE went evenly failing to menace. KONGZI made a steady
gain passing tiring rivals without having an impact. BOLD ROCK contended in the early going chasing the leaders, stopped on the turn and faded from
contention. BUTHESPRETTY was not a factor. BLACKTHORNE BRUSCA attempted to bolt into the turn and continued to want to get out around the entire
bend while held up in hand. THE RACE TIME IS UNDER REVIEW DUE TO AN EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION.
