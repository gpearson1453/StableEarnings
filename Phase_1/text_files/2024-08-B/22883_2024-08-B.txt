Footnotes
JERIKO broke midpack, bumped both sides at the start, bumped on hind end early, drifted out a touch approaching the gap and made contact with a drifting
in THA DUKE, who was bumped in by SCOOPS DYNASTY, which caused THA DUKE to be crowded, lugged out two paths passing the eighth pole under
right handed urging, down a head with a hundred yards to go, and got up in the final yards. EMPRESSUM outbroke by inside rival EDBERG VERDE, broke
out slightly and bumped rival JERIKO, drifted out when EDBERG VERDE drifted out, asked passing the gap, took the leading with an eighth to go, asked
right handed approaching the final sixteenth, and caught at the wire while under a drive. CATTAIL COVE came away second best, steered out early, was
head and head with EMPRESSUM early, leaned in passing the gap, and gamely kept on to the wire in a drive. EDBERG VERDE away well, was up over a
half length early, passed by EMPRESSUM passing the eighth pole, and failed to keep up the second half of the race with the top three. SCOOPS
DYNASTY was not focused in the gate, either leaned back or just missed the break, lugged in with his head going up and down to bump rival THA DUKE,
kept leaning in while under left handed urging, bumped twice with rival THA DUKE passing the gap, lost path, when JERIKO lugged out, and finished
willingly with big strides. REQUIRED FIRST lost footing and stumbled at the start, had a wide path early, rider felt crowding about to happen passing the gap
and took hold to the wire. THA DUKE broke in brushed at the start, bumped early by SCOOPS DYNASTY, bumped and crowded by both sides, and had to
take up sharply approaching the gap, and lost all chance. STEWARDS INQUIRY, AFTER REVIEW JERIKO WAS PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERRENCE
PASSING THE GAP.
