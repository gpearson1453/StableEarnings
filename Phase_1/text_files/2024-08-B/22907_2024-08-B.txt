start, dueled inside, drew off but was caught. LOOKIN FOR GLORY raced in the four path and rallied belatedly. JUSTHAPPYTOBEHERE bumped with a
rival at the start, raced well back, rallied at the three-sixteenths pole and just missed. THISCATSABULLET pressed the pace in the two path and yielded. R
GUY MAX dueled outside of a rival but couldn't last. RICKY WANNABE was off awkwardly and was impeded at the start. PLAYING THE ANGLES raced
inside, was steadied in early stretch in tight quarters and gave way. FLINT FIRE was through early.
