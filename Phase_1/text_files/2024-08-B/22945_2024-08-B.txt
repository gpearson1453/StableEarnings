ZIPPIN SEVENZ prompted RAGANELLI from along the outside, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole and proved best under strong handling.
SCATALICIOUS saved ground tracking the leaders, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and closed strongly. RAFANELLI saved ground setting
the pace under pressure from ZIPPIN SEVENZ, responded when headed by that one nearing the eighth pole and held on gamely to the wire. LEMON
DROP LADY was prominently placed for five furlongs while racing two-wide and tired. OREO'S DREAM broke in air to get away well behind her field then
was unhurried, came four-wide into the stretch but was unable to recover the lost ground.

DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer her bid, caught PARCO at the eighth pole then
dueled with her from that point and was fully extended to prevail narrowly. PARCO set the pace while racing slightly removed from the inside rail, drifted out
slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded when challenged by DANSMETOTHEENDOFLOV and just missed in a game try. LUCY L saved
ground while racing close-up, slipped through entering the stretch but lacked the needed late response. LUVAHAPPYENDING was unhurried early, came
four-wide into the stretch and rallied late. WARREN'S MEMORABLE prompted the issue to near the stretch while three-wide and weakened. RED PANTY
NIGHT was forwardly placed early while racing two-wide and tired.
