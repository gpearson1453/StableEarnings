Footnotes
MASTERY KAT was prominent away from the start, tracked the early pace outside of KITTEN'S KID, advanced into the backstretch run and stalked the
moderate pace approaching the half-mile marker, mounted a two wide bid at the quarter pole, took command into upper stretch and met the bid of J AND M
EXPRESS heading to the furlong pole, battled the game runner-up into the final sixteenth, dug in into deep stretch and lasted in the final strides for a
determined win. J AND M EXPRESS allowed to settle, saved ground into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and was well placed while in a
pocket nearing the half-mile, gained ground two wide into the far turn, tipped three wide into upper stretch and loomed at the three-sixteenths, gamely
dueled MASTERY KAT past mid-stretch, was kept at bay in the final sixteenth and held well for second in deep stretch. DERRYGOOLIN bobbled then was
squeezed at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered and settled two wide into the first turn, gained ground into the backstretch run and tracked the
moderate pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, chased two to three wide into the far turn, swung four wide for the drive, closed well in the
stretch, needed more in the final sixteenth and was outkicked in the late stages, while well clear of the rest for third. ZAFFERANA allowed to settle in the
early running, saved ground into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace while saving ground through the backstretch run, maintained an inside position
into the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch and finished evenly. BOLD DAUGHTER hard to load prior to the start, was away from the gate a bit slowly
and was unhurried in the early stages, raced two to three wide into the first turn, content to trail through the backstretch run, was two wide into the far tun
and failed to threaten in the stretch drive. SMILE AND PROFILE was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace three wide into the first
turn, was well placed into the backstretch run, chased three to four wide into the far turn, could not muster a response in the stretch drive and gave way in
the final furlong. KITTEN'S KID hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn, set moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, showed the way into the far turn, was overtaken into upper stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong grounds and faded. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LEGAL FICTION prominent leaving the start, stalked the moderate early pace outside of LAST CALL VRON heading to the half-mile marker, chased the
pace into the turn and loomed two to three wide at the quarter marker, was floated four wide into the stretch by the drifting LAST CALL VRON, took
command nearing the furlong pole, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and kept to task under hand urging for a good debut. BIG BAD BERT was forwardly
placed away from the start, tracked the moderate early pace from the inside and was well placed approaching the turn, saved ground along the bend and
chased into upper stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the stretch drive and was second best. LAST CALL VRON hustled away from the start,
assumed early command and set the moderate pace approaching the half-mile, dictated terms into the turn and set the pace while a bit off of the rail nearing
the quarter marker, drifted out in upper stretch and lost the lead to LEGAL FICTION approaching the furlong pole, weakened while a bit erratic past
mid-stretch and held safely for third at the finish. SET PRICE broke out at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, settled in the second flight to begin,
raced two to three wide into the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a rally in the late stages. BIG CROWD raced close up to the moderate early pace,
loomed three to four wide into the turn, chased into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and
weakened. BUCKY'S DREAM on hold early on, took back off of the moderate early pace, saved ground into the turn and did not factor. MAGA KING lost his
path at the start and was away slowly, spotted the field in the early going and was never involved. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WELLSWORT (IRE) broke well and took up a stalking position behind OH GREAT (IRE) letting that one dictate the pace, was rating under a snug hold, then
moved to challenge for the lead after passing the half-mile marker, took the lead with three furlongs to go, repelled a challenge from SUNNY SPOT
approaching the quarter pole and held that rival at bay for the length of the stretch under steady handling and intermittent urging. SUNNY SPOT was held
up near the back of the pack from the break, circled the field five wide through the first turn and was up with the leaders as the field headed down the
backstretch, went to challenge on the far turn when OH GREAT (IRE) began to weaken, got to the flank of WELLSWORT (IRE) at the top of the stretch but
was unable to get past that rival at any point in the lane but was well clear of the third horse. IMPLICITLY was allowed to settle into stride from the break
tucked in to the two path for the run through the first turn, was in tight at the start of the run down the backstretch and steadied two or three times to avoid
making contact with MOVIETIME, was starting to lose ground as the field headed into the far turn, the re-rallied when put into a drive near the three furlong
pole, finished well to win the race for third. J T'S WATCH was not asked for speed from the break then got a rail run through the first turn, saved ground to
the far turn while racing near the back of the pack, started to run on from the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out to the three path for clear run and finished well
while not threat to the top pair. MOVIETIME was caught three wide into the clubhouse turn, tracked mid-pack in the three path for most of the race, held
position to the stretch then was outfinished the rest of the way. OH GREAT (IRE) seized the early lead when unchallenged after the break, dictated the
fractions with WELLSWORT (IRE) a constant shadow to the outside, began to weaken after passing the three furlong pole, faded and was not a factor the
rest of the way. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ROLLIN DICE hustled away from the start, pressed the early pace inside of UNCLE JUAN then took back to track that runner heading into the turn, saved
ground along the bend and was well placed at the quarter pole, got caught a bit in tight into upper stretch, found room leaving the three-sixteenths and
rallied at the furlong marker, gained command into the final sixteenth and edged away while kept to task in deep stretch. BERTACCHI allowed to settle while
never far back in the early stages, tracked the decent early pace from between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit three to four wide into
the turn and loomed at the quarter pole, chased into the stretch and vied for the lead between runners at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the
winner into the final sixteenth and held well for second in deep stretch. REGAL REDWOOD took back off of the early pace, tracked from the second flight
heading to the half-mile marker, raced widest into the turn and loomed four to five wide at the quarter pole, maintained an outside path into the stretch and
vied for the lead at the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and held well for third in deep stretch. ALPINE SERMON allowed to settle in the
early running, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, swung widest into upper stretch and bid at the furlong pole, could not sustain
his run into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the minor awards. PARTY WITH PADDY raced close up to the decent early pace, stalked between
rivals into the turn and chased two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, battled between rivals into the stretch, lacked a response into the final sixteenth
and weakened. UNCLE JUAN broke alertly and showed good speed away from the start, set a decent pace while prompted to the half-mile marker, dictated
terms into the turn and set the pace off of the rail nearing the quarter marker, came under pressure into the stretch, dug in and led to the furlong pole, could
not hold off oncoming rivals past mid-stretch and faded in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ROARING TIGER settled just off of the early pace, tracked three wide along the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, improved position
through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and took command at the quarter marker, led into upper stretch and was set down for the drive,
repelled DELIAN LEAGUE past the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and drove clear in the late stages. DELIAN LEAGUE settled off
of the early pace while never far back, saved ground into the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, mounted a three to four wide bid into the far
turn, chased ROARING TIGER into the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and just held for second at the finish.
UNBRIDLED RHYTHM a bit keen in the early stages, settled in the second flight and tracked the pace from a two wide path into the first turn, was well
placed through the backstretch run and saved ground into the far turn, chased to the quarter pole and saved ground into the stretch, closed in the late
stages and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. DO IT FOR DAVE squeezed at the start and broke a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in
the early stages, raced outside of rivals into the first turn and was three wide into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace while widest nearing the
half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the far turn, improved position into the stretch drive but needed more in the late stages and finished evenly.
DEFENSOR FORTIS broke in a bit at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, stalked the early pace outside of DEO, attended to the moderate pace
through the backstretch run, prompted the pace two to three wide into the far turn, got caught in tight, took up and was shuffled back at the quarter pole, was
outrun into the stretch and lacked a late response. DEO sent to assume the early lead, crossed over and set the pace into the first turn, set moderate
fractions into the backstretch run and was prompted to the half-mile marker, led into the far turn, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, could not find a
response in the stretch drive and faded. ADIOS NICANOR allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail along the
backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the far turn and did not factor in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
POINT AND SHOOT broke well and was hustled to get forward position, got a good spot right behind AFTER MY OWN HEART into the first turn, stalked
that foe down the backstretch and through the far turn, went to challenge approaching the quarter pole, pulled even at the top of the stretch, battled to the
furlong grounds, gained the advantage and was pulling clear in the end. AFTER MY OWN HEART won the race to the first turn without being pushed, then
lead the compact field in hand through moderate uncontested fractions to the far turn, maintained a clear lead through that turn then was set down at the
quarter pole attempting to slip away from the rest, was taken on to the outside by POINT AND SHOOT, battled that rival to mid-stretch then gave way but
kept on well to hold second. CLICKING tracked mid-pack two to three wide throughout, ran even-paced to the wire but lacked any finishing kick. DESERT
RUMBLE tracked the two leaders in mid-pack through the first half-mile, started to move forwardly going into the turn, bided time, was asked to go on
passing the quarter pole but did not respond and had little to offer for the stretch run. IRISH SONG LEADER bobbled slightly exiting the gate, was taken in
hand, kept to the rail and raced near the back of the pack through the early stages, was under a ride after passing the half-mile marker but did not produce a
rally, came into the stretch three wide then changed path to the inside and was never a threat. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE broke outward at the start then raced
in the three path down the backstretch at the back of the pack, had to be pushed a little to stay in contact with the field, remained in the three path to the far
turn and never mounted a rally. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
EL GALLITO hustled away from the gate, showed good speed and vied for the early lead while between runners, assumed command and set the moderate
pace approaching the half-mile marker, dueled for the lead into the turn and held a narrow advantage at the quarter marker, was overtaken into upper
stretch and battled NOW THEN into the final furlong, was kept at bay past mid-stretch, came again in the final sixteenth, re-gained the lead in deep stretch
and held in a drive for a determined debut win. NOW THEN sent leaving the start, was prominent in the early going and pressed the moderate pace from the
inside heading to the half-mile pole, saved ground into the turn and attended to the pace inside of the leading pair at the quarter marker, took a narrow lead
into upper stretch and battled EL GALLITO nearing the furlong grounds, kept that foe at bay into the final sixteenth, was overtaken in deep stretch and was
clear of the rest for second. HYDROPLANE settled just off of the moderate early pace, tracked from the second flight heading to the half-mile marker,
chased two wide into the turn, ran in pursuit into the stretch and shifted three wide at the furlong marker, was not able to impact the leading pair past
mid-stretch, made a mild late rally and held safely in the end for show honors. BOBBED N LURED broke alertly and vied for the early lead while between
rivals, got shuffled back and lost position at the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and chased the moderate pace heading to the quarter pole,
saved ground into the stretch, re-rallied in the late stages but needed more in the final sixteenth. ELEGANT LIFE hesitated at the start and was away slowly
from the gate, settled off of the moderate early pace, went two wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the
stretch and flattened out. MY AMIGO prominent away from the start, pressed the moderate early pace three deep heading to the half-mile marker, vied for
the lead three wide into the turn, drifted to the four path nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth
and faded in deep stretch. HANK WILLIAMS hopped at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, guided two to three wide along the
turn, improved position in the stretch drive but did not factor in the late stages. LURKING FEAR lacked early speed, trailed into the turn, went three to four
wide at the quarter marker and did not threaten in the stretch. SENOR FEDERICO a step slow away from the start, settled off of the moderate early pace
while not far back, raced outside of rivals into the turn, bolted nearing the quarter pole, trailed into the stretch and lacked a late response. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LITTLE LADY LOU broke out at the start and bothered SHADOWED THOUGHTS at the break, stalked the pace-setting HAPPY CHAPPY, while traveling
well, bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, finished strong under steady handling and intermittent urging and prevailed despite drifting out in deep
stretch. BROOKYS GAL broke well and settled nicely just behind the pacesetters, was patiently ridden to the turn, then found a clear trip through the field,
came four wide into the stretch and rallied under steady handling but came up short in a good effort. HAPPY CHAPPY broke best and set pressured
fractions to the turn, tried to fight back when LITTLE LADY LOU bid near the quarter pole, gave way then finished on good courage to hold third.
SHADOWED THOUGHTS was bothered by LITTLE LADY LOU who took the path right after the start, then raced close up though five wide down the
backstretch, responded when asked to pick up the pace on the turn, came into the stretch five wide with some momentum then had trouble changing leads
and flattened. KEEPYOURPRANCEON threw her head up as the gates opened and spotted the field about a four length head start, chased the field to the
turn, could not make up the lost ground but managed to pass one in the late stages. PONDERGATING was prominent to the turn, started to weaken
approaching the quarter pole, dropped out of it and was not factor down the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
