FLATHEAD FINALE bumped from the rear at the break, was kept close along the rail, waited for room through the bend, gained a clear path three wide
entering the lane, engaged REDHEADEDSTRANGER, battled and began to edge ahead nearing the wire. REDHEADEDSTRANGER vied for the lead
between rivals, edged ahead two wide on the turn, fought gamely through the stretch, did not have enough late but proved easily second best. WILDWOOD
ENCORE fractious in the gate before the start, made a small leap outward when the gate opened, bumped FLATHEAD FINALE, was straightened, sent to
the lead, soon challenged from outside and gave way for the stretch run. WILDWOOD DOROTHY displayed early speed from outside, began to yield three
wide on the bend, floated out some for the drive and continued to fade.

Footnotes
BEIRUT BEAUTY very unruly in the gate, was crowded briefly leaving the chute, altered in, settled off the rail, commenced her bid widest on the turn,
continued her rally from path four in the lane and got up in the final strides. ONACOUNTA was jostled about from outside shortly after leaving the chute,
raced in the second flight between rivals, moved clear for second two wide on the turn, angled out some for the stretch run, took a narrow lead between
horses with a sixteenth left but could not hold back BEIRUT BEAUTY near the wire. COOKIN ROSES broke on top, was soon far ahead of the rest, began
to wear down just off the inside leaving the turn and gradually drifted out as he continued to yield the final furlong. NOT TO BE DENIED was bumped and
forced into ONACOUNTA shortly after leaving the chute, roughed up between rivals briefly, was checked, taken to the outside, in tight quarters between
horses with two furlongs to go, moved out widest entering the stretch and showed a willingness to run late. LIFE OF SATURDAYS gradually angled in
leaving the chute, bumped then jostled with NOT TO BE DENIED shortly after that, raced in the second flight on the backstretch but began to yield three
wide on the bend. AUNT STELLA chased from inside the also began fading after three furlongs. The rider of NOT TO BE DENIED lodged an objection
alleging interference from ONACOUNTA shortly after leaving the chute. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul as ONACOUNTA
was not the initiator of the interference.

Footnotes
REDBIRD NATION shared the early lead from outside, was two wide on the bend, fanned out some into the lane, moved clear, drifted out slightly upper
stretch, was straightened, all out in the late going and held on. MAN OF QUALITY prominent between rivals, angled outside REDBIRD NATION nearing the
turn, lost some ground as he had to swing out some for a clear path entering the stretch, found best stride too late but was clearly second best. FLASH
CADILLAC bobbled inward at the break, recovered to be just off the pace, waited for room while boxed in on the turn, got through between rivals into the
lane, his rider lost his crop soon after, was forced to alter in just after that when REDBIRD NATION took his path, threatened two wide with a furlong to go
but leveled off in the late going. SPICY VALENTINA was hustled to contest the pace just off the inside, had the rail on the turn then gradually wore down for
the stretch run. TRICKY MOMENT broke inward, bumping INCORPORATED, chased in midpack, was two wide on the bend, angled outside MAN OF
QUALITY for the drive and ran evenly. JERSEY CAT saved ground and had no late bid. SHOW ME THE LIGHT chased from off the rail, swung out widest
for the drive and also had no stretch rally. IMA CHUNKY MONKEY moved to the inside early on, was steadied behind JERSEY CAT midstretch, altered out
and also had little to offer the rest of the way. INCORPORATED was bumped at the start, soon faded from outside, saved ground through the turn and
empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
CHARM THE LADIES settled off the early speed, took over second two wide on the backstretch, closed the gap on the leader while saving ground on the
second bend, came into the lane just off the inside, engaged FLASHY RICHIE inside the final furlong, battled beside that one and edged ahead nearing the
wire. FLASHY RICHIE bumped at the start, was hustled to a clear early lead, showed the way along the rail, was roused leaving the second turn, fought
gamely to hold on the last eighth, did not have enough in the end but was easily best of the others. KEEN RESPONSE bumped FLASHY RICHIE at the
start, was settled outside, gradually progressed while widest, drew away for third on the second bend, floated out some entering the stretch and could only
hold his position late. ORBITAL STARR chased from inside, angled out some on the second turn, improved position upper stretch and was gradually closing
in on KEEN RESPONSE in the waning yards. WILLOW RIDGE faded from outside on the backstretch. CARTE BLANCHE chased from inside but gave way
with three furlongs left. BLAZEN ROAD was soon well back, eventually pulled up and was walked off.

Footnotes
SMILE LIKE KYLE soon had the advantage between rivals, moved clear on the backstretch, was let out some on the second turn, lengthened command
when asked at the top of the lane and maintained full control while kept to task until nearing the wire. JUSTICEONEMORETIME jostled with RED ROIL just
after the break, advanced between rivals, found himself boxed in midway on the backstretch, altered inside after a half mile, again waited for room on the
second turn, got through just outside SMILE LIKE KYLE entering the stretch, could not close the gap on the lead but gradually pulled away for the place.
ANUNKA pressed from outside, was three wide taking the second bend, ran evenly through the lane and was unchallenged for the show. RED ROIL jostled
with JUSTICEONEMORETIME just after the start and forced into TOWN CRIER, was settled just off the inside, gradually angled out from between horses to
commence his bid on the second turn, came five wide into the lane, his rider lost his riding crop midstretch and only made up minor ground inside the final
furlong. DRAGGING MAIN was prominent between rivals but faded four wide on the second bend. CHARLIE'S BEACH failed to menace in a wide trip. HE
GOES FOREVER showed little in a ground-saving trip. TOWN CRIER bumped from the rear shortly after the start, raced in contention from inside, gave
way after a half mile, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
STROPE urged early to stay close, waited for a clear path along the rail on the turn, got through from inside entering the stretch, moved clear inside the last
furlong and held sway. MAMAS FIRE chased from outside, lost ground widest through the bend and found best stride too late deep stretch. ON THE
MONEY RED without early speed, came into contention three wide on the turn, vied for the lead four wide upper stretch, could not stay with STROPE inside
the last eighth, edged ahead for second but was outfinished for the place. TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS hustled early to stay close, went for the lead just
outside XPRESSIR on the turn but gradually wore down inside the final furlong. WESLAN was a factor between rivals from the start, found himself boxed in
just off the rail on the bend, angled out five wide upper stretch for a clear path then leveled off in the late going. XPRESSIR set a pressured pace just off the
inside, was challenged from both sides in the stretch and flattened out the last furlong.

Footnotes
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY was bumped shortly after the break, angled to the outside and kept in hand, commenced his bid after two furlongs, stayed in paths
three or four taking the turn, gradually angled inside those vying for the lead in the lane and got up in time under a well-measured ride. SPANISH
DOUBLOON vied for the lead between horses from the beginning, moved ahead three wide on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch, was
challenged from outside, edged ahead in the waning yards but was outfinished in the final strides. SWAGGY GEORGE pressed from outside, was four then
five wide through the turn, brushed repeatedly with WILDWOOD RUBEN as he battled for the lead in the lane and needed more from between rivals nearing
the wire. WILDWOOD RUBEN rated off the pace while just off the rail, angled out five wide nearing the end of a half mile, came six wide into the stretch,
brushed repeatedly with SWAGGY GEORGE as he dueled on the front end and also did not have enough late. RUNNINGFORCASH chased from inside,
angled out upper stretch and passed a couple tired rivals. LOOKIN FOR BALA bumped GIRLOLAMO'GLORY shortly after the start, contested the pace
between horses, did not keep up two wide on the bend and gave way through the stretch. BASEBALL POLITICS displayed early speed from inside but
began to fade before finishing four furlongs.

Footnotes
SHIP IT shared the lead from between rivals, came three wide into the stretch, moved clear inside the last furlong and kept JULYNNE at bay. JULYNNE
pressed from outside, was jostled briefly nearing the half mile marker, advanced just outside SHIP IT on the turn, took over second inside the final furlong
and rallied belatedly deep stretch. CANTOO hesitated at the break, advanced from outside, lost ground four then five wide through the bend and also found
best stride too late deep stretch. GHALY POSSE bumped with PADDY GAL at the start, vied for the lead from between horses, gained the rail nearing the
turn, battled in the lane but began to shorten her stride inside the last furlong. PADDY GAL bumped with GHALY POSSE at the break, displayed early
speed from inside, was steadied as her path narrowed nearing the bend, angled out through the turn, came six wide into the lane and had no late rally.
JAMAICAN TRAFFIC moved to the inside early on and was never a factor. JERSEY GOLD chased just outside JAMAICAN TRAFFIC and failed to menace.
BETTY'S SECRET was a contender while toward the outside on the backstretch but faded while widest on the turn. ELENA MAE was sent to contest the
pace between rivals early, retreated from a narrowing path midway on the backstretch, altered out approaching the half mile pole, jostled briefly with
JULYNNE then gave way on the bend.
