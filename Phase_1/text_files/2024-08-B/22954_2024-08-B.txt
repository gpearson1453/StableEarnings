Footnotes
FABER was tucked in on the rail, nestled behind the engaged duo in the early going, was nudged on for more in the two path with horses on both sides at
the five sixteenths pole, inched closer through the turn, shifted out four wide for the stretch run, was encouraged right handed at the furlong pole, quickly
began to lengthen stride and was full of run late to get up for the win under a well-timed surge in the final jump. NITROGEN sat outside the winner, watching
the contesting pair up front, moved in to prompt the issue three deep at the five eighths pole for a moment, tracked through the far turn, bid for the lead
outside rivals in the three path straightening out for home, edged away for the lead from the early speed foes at the sixteenth pole but could not fend off the
winner in the final few strides. ACCELERANDO was eager in the beginning, pressing the pace outside in the first turn, shadowed the pacesetter outside
down the back straight, took control between foes in the two path with five sixteenths to go, dueled between rivals in upper stretch clinging to the lead, could
not go with the top two runners in the last sixteenth but did stay on to be a clear third at the finish line. SLUGGERNAUT had a stalking position outside a
rival in the early stages, made little headway travelling three wide around the final bend, angled out widest in the five-path for the stretch drive and finished
up mildly to capture a minor role in the end. WATSONVILLE RED stalked on the fence in the third flight, made an early move, running in hand on the rail at
the seven sixteenths marker to close the gap on the leaders, could not match strides with others around the far turn, trailed turning for home and passed the
fading early frontrunner in deep stretch. SPIRITUAL MAN seized command from the start on the rail, dictated the pace inside while hounded along the
backstretch, gave way up top with five sixteenths from home, tried to fight back briefly on the fence in upper stretch but folded in the last furlong.

Footnotes
I'M TENACIOUS was off a step slow to be near the back on the fence at the start, was patiently allowed to gather herself along the backside at the rear,
shifted outside to the two path with three eighths remaining, started to gather momentum turning for home six wide, moved in under left handed urging to bid
outside at the furlong pole and went on past with ease in the final sixteenth for the score. LADY WELLINGTON broke out on the start, was content to watch
the pacesetter outside early on, edged closer, measuring the frontrunner around the bend, bid for the lead in the four-path at the quarter pole, was urged
right-handed dueling between horses for the front with a furlong to go but was no match for the winner in deep stretch. JUST ON TIME assumed command
on the rail down the backstretch, continued to set the pace throughout the turn, was collared outside in upper stretch, fought on determinedly on the fence to
the wire, could not threaten the top pair late but did hold on to save for the show money. SECRET GIZMO travelled four deep on the outside tracking the
leader down the backstretch, moved in closer three wide on the turn, was in range in the four path straightening out for home, battled for the minors and
resurged late outside to settle on the fringes. LADY XI settled in midfield with five furlongs from the wire, saved ground through the turn keeping pace with
others, skimmed the fence turning for home, dueled for the minor share to the wire but was just out gamed at the finish line. CHICAGO TYPHOON was
situated between foes, having a tracking role in the two path down the backside, was roused, but made little impact through the turn, had a chance in the
three path for a share at the top of the lane, could not find more and yielded at the furlong marker. HYPER AWAKENING was unhurried to trail outside in the
beginning, could see the field while travelling four wide around the bend, began to go around rivals outside at the five sixteenths marker, swung outside in
the seven path for the stretch running but had little to offer through the lane. EGBERT J tracked on the rail in the early stages, could not close on the leaders
when scrubbed on for more with three furlongs from the prize, and faltered in the two path with three sixteenths from the wire between runners. APRIL DE
VELP stalked near the rear three wide along the backside, backed away around the far turn losing touch with the field and cantered home through the
stretch to cross the wire.

Footnotes
IT'S A FLUKE moved through inside to the lead after a sixteenth, set the pace from off the rail, moved clear, was encouraged along near the quarter pole,
was more strongly urged in upper stretch, drifted out in mid- to late-stretch, was kept busy to the wire and lasted. MOON OVER EGBERT bumped the outer
rival at the start, stalked from outside a foe into the turn two to three wide, moved out five wide coming past the quarter pole, drifted several more paths in
upper stretch, gained steadily but slowly and got the nod for place over an outside foe while not enough to reach the winner. MO TOURIST was bumped at
the start, settled off the pace mid-pack, swung nine wide for the drive, closed willingly but needed more and just missed the nod for second. STORMIN
DAVE was up close early chasing the eventual winner about three wide, came out further for the stretch run and went evenly while lacking the needed late
kick. FOREST STAR settled at the back inside, came out ten wide in the stretch, was never near enough to threaten but finished well. DREAM ON BABY
settled outside foes at the back, came out eleven deep in the stretch, failed to menace but finished well. TOWN'S WARRIOR broke just a bit awkwardly,
advanced between foes off the fence to be mid-pack turning for home, was brushed repeatedly by a rival in the stretch and did not threaten.
PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ angled in early, tracked inside, was guided out four wide turning into upper stretch, brushed an outside rival repeatedly, failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
MAD DOG N JOE assumed a clear lead, emerging from the pack up top at the five-furlong pole, continued to move well setting the pace with no pressure
around the turn, was coaxed for more run holding onto the lead in the four path in upper stretch and was set down with an eighth to run to stubbornly prevail,
fending off all comers at the wire. SMALL TALK tracked between horses in the three-path down the backside, was on heels in tight behind the leader at the
five-furlong pole, angled to the rail finally settling down behind the pacesetter through out the turn, shifted out five wide at the top of the stretch to be in the
hunt up front, moved inwards under a drive to the rail by the furlong pole but could only chase the winner in vain to the wire. EXECUTIVE SEARCH tracked
four deep outside a rival down the backside, pursued the frontrunning winner outside around the turn, bid for the lead in the six-path at the quarter pole,
could not threaten the leader down the stretch then lost the battle for the runners up share late. JAMIESTA trailed on the fence down the backside, still could
see the field but was starting to rally around the turn, swung out widest for clear run ten wide for the drive and had a solid late kick to close in for a minor role
while not beaten all that far for higher placings in the end. SALVATOR MUNDI travelled in mid-division between foes down the backstretch, kept pace with
the leaders while on the rail throughout the turn, angled to the seven path at the top of the lane and finished up willingly, gaining on the leaders late but
could not threaten at the finish line. JIMMIES BIG DAY travelled in midfield three deep down the back straight, improved to track the lead trio around the
turn, shifted out to the six-path straightening out for the drive, was in range for a piece of the prize three wide by the furlong marker but flattened out in deep
stretch. PROVEN STRATEGIES settled inside rivals in mid-pack down the backside, made a brief run commencing at the three-furlong pole while three
wide, was fanned out eight wide by the quarter pole, could not continue on with others and wilted at the furlong marker. SWAGGISH settled on the rail just
behind the winner down the backstretch, was steadied sharply at the five-furlong pole to be shuffled back many lengths to be near the back of the pack,
saved ground through the turn and had no finish to offer while travelling on the rail in the stretch. SOUPER RIVER was near the rear between runners in the
early going, made little progression three wide outside foes around the bend, angled to the six-path turning for home but failed to fire down the lane. BLAME
J D stalked three wide near the rear along the backside, made no impression with rivals on both sides while running in the two-path throughout the turn and
failed to menace in the stretch drive. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 SWAGGISH AGAINST #6 SMALL TALK AND STEWARDS INQUIRY AT THE FIVE

Footnotes
DIAL A CLICHE broke out numerous paths, advanced outside four to five wide on the turn, took aim on the leader under stout urging, drifted out from six to
twelve wide through the length of the stretch and struck the lead a sixteenth out before driving clear. PRACTICAL GIZMO broke outwardly, chased near the
inside, moved out leaving the turn and under a ride, rallied four to five wide in the stretch to get up for place. LILLZ HOPE attended and pressed the pace
from outside, struck the lead just past the five-sixteenths, moved clear by upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. TATOOSONMYSOUL broke inwardly,
settled at the rear off the rail but inside foes, gained mildly in the stretch. KRYPTO GAINS bumped with the inside rival at the start, moved forward up the
backstretch chasing from off the inside, moved out five wide coming past the quarter pole, swung wider still to be eight deep in upper stretch, ran on. DIXIE
MORNING settled off the pace outside, was six wide past the quarter pole, wider for the drive racing outside a foe but needed more late. HEKLA'S AURA
bumped with a foe at the start then was in tight and squeezed back to last, angled in near the rail, ridden strongly by the five-sixteenths but was never near
enough to threaten. HAYEK was quick to take the lead, set the pace near the rail, faltered and faded. FIRST ROUND PICK was outside a runner at the rear
and never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
ECSTASY shadowed the frontrunner from the onset, continued to keep a close eye outside of the pacesetter through the turn, bid for the lead in the three
path outside in upper stretch, poked her head in front by the eighth pole and edged away in deep stretch for the victory. LOVE TO SHOP broke out on the
start, set the pace while prompted outside down the backstretch, dictated terms while still flanked by the eventual winner throughout the turn, was headed
outside by upper stretch, dueled stubbornly in the lane, gave way to the winner grudgingly with seventy yards to go but did manage to save the place share
in a photo at the wire. PERSONAL PURSUIT tracked in the second flight outside for the early parts of the race, loomed boldly four wide turning for home,
laid in down the entire stretch even while under left-handed encouragement, rider did all he could do to try to straighten her out and ride to the wire but just
could get her to focus late, still wasn't beaten all that far for the win while being nosed out for the place share with her head cocked at the finish line.
GOLDEN GHOST (GB) rated kindly on the fence in the second tier, tracking the front pair in the early stages, was in the mix on the rail in upper stretch well
within the leaders, but needed more in the late running to pose a threat in the final sixteenth and settled on the fringes in the end. PEMBERLEY stalked near
the rear outside a rival down the back straight, made little improvement through the turn, had a chance for a share in the five-path turning for home but
evened out at the furlong marker and could not be a presence in deep stretch. SARATOGA VISION was allowed to settle on the fence at the back of the
pack along the backside, continued to see the field running around the bend, angled out six wide for the stretch drive but could not get into contention
running to the finish line.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S ROMANCE co-trailed on the outside to start, galloped along in last down the backside but was taking closer order by the three-furlong pole,
waited for the cue to go through the final bend, took the overland route seven wide at the top of the stretch, was reaching for more ground with every stride
in the lane and got up under a well-timed late surge to win the bob at the wire. BIJOU BABY stalked close to the back of the pack in the two-path into the
first of two turns, settled in midfield on the fence down the backstretch, waited patiently in hand just behind the lead foursome in the final bend, pounced
when a seam opened up two wide at the furlong pole to have the lead with a sixteenth left to run but just missed out holding for the win by a nod at the finish
line. MIZZEN ASH co-trailed on the rail, was ahead of only one horse down the backside who just happened to be the eventual winner, had a good spot
sitting behind the embattled quartet in the final bend while two wide, shifted out to be in the six-path turning for home and had a good stretch rally to close in
late to capture third money. STREGA seized command from the start, rolled along up top down the backside, was headed outside by a few rivals with three
furlongs remaining, fought on the rail through the far turn to still be clinging onto the lead in upper stretch, had little left to give by the furlong pole and faded
in the last sixteenth to be a fringe player at the wire. ASHBURY tracked outside in the beginning, continued to keep tabs on the frontrunner outside down the
back straight, moved in to be in the mix for the lead three wide with three furlongs left to go and weakened in the four-path between challengers in the final
eighth. UMNEYAAT had a tracking position on the inside in the first turn, still was on the fence settling behind the pacesetter along the backside, shifted just
outside in the two path to force the pace between foes at the three-eighths marker and had little left for the drive and retreated with horses on both sides at
the furlong marker. DIOSA CATRINA stalked near the rear while going four wide on the first turn, improved three wide outside to be in the second flight
down the backside, watched the contesting foursome while sitting just behind them around the far turn, was floated out widest, in the eight-path for the drive
and could not be a factor in the stretch running. VOICE FROM ABOVE travelled between horses in midfield in the early stages, took closer order to be
involved four deep on the outside in the fray up front at the three-furlong pole, dueled through the far turn, could not continue on five wide by the top of the
lane and stopped in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
ONDINE LADY patiently settled into stride while near the back of the pack outside foes down the back straight, started to mount a rally seven wide turning
for home, brushed an inside foe that appeared to be drifting out with three sixteenths to run, closed in smartly by the furlong marker to be in the mix up top
fighting for the lead and drew away when asked in the final sixteenth for the win. NEW PLAY broke out on the start, settled in midfield along the backside,
kept pace with the leaders while still in mid-division between horses throughout the turn, rallied two wide in upper stretch, burst through in the two path to
battle for the lead by the eighth pole, could not match strides with the winner late but bested the rest with that game effort. WHISKEY N ICE was antsy in the
stall prior to the start, broke sharp though to lead the field down the back straight, set a brisk pace while unopposed through the turn, was collared outside
while on the rail when passing the furlong pole and stayed on willingly for the show award at the wire. PRETTY GOOD JOKE chased the pacesetter in the
early stages, took aim on the leader and moved in four wide in upper stretch, dueled for the lead while between rivals at the furlong marker, could not keep
up with the others up front late and was outrun in deep stretch to settle on the fringes. REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY stalked in the third tier while three deep
on the outside of horses, took closer order to track the lead pair while on the outside of a rival through the turn, turning for home in the six path was in the
hunt for a share when brushed outside by the eventual winner going by at the three sixteenths pole, shifted inwards for a while, returned to the five path with
a sixteenth to run but finished up evenly and could not pose a threat late. LINDA'S OPAL broke with the field to begin, was then shuffled back on the fence
to settle in mid-pack with five-eighths remaining, was going in the wrong direction around the turn, angled out looking for a seam in upper stretch, found a
clear lane five wide with three sixteenths to go but could not offer a finish and was one paced in the last furlong. SECRET BUTTERFLY was tucked in on the
rail behind the pacesetter down the back straight, took the shortest way around throughout the turn but was losing positions to others, was checked on the
fence in upper stretch and could not get involved afterwards. LADY WITH ATTITUDE veered in sharply on the start, had to be taken up briefly and trailed
along the backside, still could see the pack but was closing in on rivals around the bend, angled out nine wide outside foes for the drive and passed a
couple of weary foes at the furlong marker. PRINCESSONAMISSION was brushed inside at the break, stalked between horses in the third tier down the
backside, took closer order to track the front pair while inside a rival around the bend, was in range for a piece of the prize four wide straightening out for
home but wilted on the rail by the furlong marker. TRUSTMYDADDYISSUES stalked near the rear four deep outside foes down the back straight, made a
brief run four wide around some rivals at the three-furlong pole, shifted out in the eight-path for the drive to the wire but had no finish to give in the stretch.
