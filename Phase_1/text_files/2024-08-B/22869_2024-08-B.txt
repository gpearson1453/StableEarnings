Footnotes
ONTARIO HOLIDAY had a nice set up three wide, watching the contesting pair down the back straight, cruised around foes in the turn to assume command
by the quarter pole and under mild urging was going away from the field when crossing the finish line. PANYARD TAP was allowed to settle down the
backstretch to see the field at the half, began to go around, picking up runners three wide at the quarter pole, burst between rivals sharply finding a seam in
the three path with an eighth to run and finished up well to best the rest at the wire. GLORIOUS REVENGE broke sharp for the early lead, was then content
to track outside at the half, chased the lead duo through the turn, shifted out four wide straightening out for home, drifted out under left handed
encouragement in mid-stretch, straightened out late and won third money between foes in a three way photo for the minor placings. GOLD BONANZA
travelled in mid-pack down the backside, kept pace while three wide outside rivals on the turn, was nudged for more at the quarter pole to be in the mix six
wide turning for home but was on the losing end of the three way battle for the place share in the end. DESROCHERS veered out on the break, settled four
deep in midfield along the backside, offered a brief run two wide outside while in pursuit of the front pair around the bend, angled five wide at the top of the
lane but gave way at the furlong marker. CHEAP SPEED stalked near the rear between horses, continued to have runners on both sides while in the third
flight making little improvement throughout the turn, entered the stretch in the two path but lacked a rally down the lane and could not factor late.
HURRICANE DESHAMBO was unhurried to trail on the fence early on, improved mildly on the fence at the half, was under a snug hold being forced to wait
behind a rival at the three furlong marker, shifted out in the four path for the drive to the line and could on pass the stopping early lead in deep stretch. LEFT
IN MY DUST emerged from the pack to have a clear lead on the rail by the half, set the fractions while shadowed outside around the bend, was collared
outside by the winner at the quarter pole and faltered on the fence in the final sixteenth of a mile.

Footnotes
VEERY broke out to begin, challenged the pacesetter outside in the backstretch for the lead, assumed control travelling easily around the turn while
unopposed, had no contenders around her when set down at the furlong marker and cruised home for the score. SPIDER BELLE was ahead of only one
rival while stalking on the rail, edged closer in the two path around the turn, rallied smartly when finding a seam in the two path at the three sixteenths
marker and ran on well to be a non threatening but clear second at the finish line. CLEOMENES was all alone in midfield in the early going, closed the gap
around the bend, posed the main threat in the seven path at the top of the stretch and finished up mildly to move in and capture the show award. LOIS LEN
tracked outside along the backstretch, pursued the frontrunning winner three wide through the turn, angled out slightly to be in the four path straightening
out for home, drifted inwards for a moment when asked right-handed in upper stretch and stayed on willingly for a minor role in the end. HARD TO
CAPTURE had a tracking role on the fence to begin, chased the winner in the two path between rivals on the bend, shifted to the three path turning for
home but was one paced down the lane. GABBY SQUARED was brushed at the start, settled in last down the back straight, continued at the rear but was
making up ground around the bend, swung out widest in the eight path for the stretch running and managed to only pass a couple of tired foes at the furlong
pole. BLAZING SKY stalked near the rear on the outside, made little impact when roused throughout the turn shifted out six wide at the top of the stretch but
fail to menace in the drive to the wire. LADY EVA dueled on the rail for the early lead down the back straight, could not quicken with others up front, backing
away some on the fence through the turn and had nothing to offer on the fence in the stretch drive.

READY FOR A FIGHT pressed the pace on the rail early on, was then reined in to track the pacesetter at the seven sixteenths marker, shifted outside under
confident handling in midturn taking aim on the leader, bid for the lead between foes three wide in upper stretch and prevailed inside dueling to the finish for
the win. LEGAL ATTACK (GB) had a tracking position on the outside in the beginning, was nudged three wide, taking closer order through the bend, loomed
boldly in the four path turning for home, dueled outside to the wire but was denied in a photo at the finish line. HE'S FULLY LOADED had a slim lead on the
outside down the backstretch, opened up to be loose on the lead around the turn, was headed outside by upper stretch, was no match for the top two at the
furlong pole but did hold on for the show money at the wire. COMMANDER JOE was shuffled a round between horses on the start to be ahead of only one
rival down the back straight, made little headway three wide on the turn and finished with intent in the five path down the stretch to settle on the fringes. JMR
SPEEDY ESCAPE travelled in the third flight inside runners in the backstretch, ran evenly between foes around the bend, shifted out to be four wide
entering the stretch, dueled for a minor share in the lane but lost the fight in deep stretch. LUCYS CHILD veered in on the break, stalked outside through the
turn making little impact, angled to the six path straightening out for the drive but fail to be a presence down the lane. BANKER'S HOURS watched from the
rail the front pair contest the pace along the backside, was shuffled back some positions on the fence with seven sixteenths from home, made no progress
on the fence in the turn, had a brief rally inside when turning for home but stalled at the furlong marker. YORKVILLE was bumped on the start, stalked
outside in the third flight, kept pace while three wide outside foes in the turn, angled out six wide but failed to reach contention in the stretch running.
ALWAYS A WAY was uninterested after the break while roused to stay involved down the backstretch, could not offer a run and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WAR IN CHARGE was very lightly brushed at the start, gained forward position moving in stalking two wide behind the leaders, bid coming to the top of the
stretch, took charge and drove clear then held safe. PATROLMAN settled outside at the rear, moved swiftly outside foes while shifting out from four to seven
wide on the far turn, was clearly second best while no threat to the winner. SILVER SMOKE broke inwardly lightly brushing a rival, quickly made the lead
and moved clear, set the pace near the inside, was collared in upper stretch and had no extra but kept on well enough to preserve show honors.
FABELMAN broke through the gate, settled off the pace, was mostly two to three wide throughout, caught between foes on the far turn, ran on off the fence
but inside foes in the stretch to improve but was only one-paced in the effort. BEARING DOWN hopped just slightly at the start, settled off the leaders inside
moving out just off the fence, was in a bit tight between runners entering the far turn, shifted five wide past the quarter pole and ran on. SMART ALMASTY
was well-placed stalking three to four wide, carried six deep turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. CALUSA DONNIE settled off the pace inside
early, was off the rail on the far turn, failed to rally. MATICULANT switched out off the inside heading into the first turn, stalked within range from the three to
four path, faded in the stretch. UNDER SURVEILLANCE saved ground to no avail. SUGAR IT'S ELI broke in just a bit, was caught outside four to five wide
early, failed to menace.

Footnotes
DEWOLF rated kindly, alone, watching front pair along the backside, closed in while in hand two wide outside at the three furlong marker, cruised to the lead
six wide when entering the stretch and was kept to the task to win comfortably in the end in an impressive debut. UNBRIDLED WEATHER was pinched
between runners at the start, recovered quickly to take this field down the backstretch, continued to freewheel it on the front end around the bend, was
collared outside by a couple of challengers in upper stretch, gave way to the top two with a furlong remaining but gallantly re-bid late to come on and regain
the runners up share. MOBULA was content to sit behind the pacesetter, began to reel in the frontrunner inside at the three furlong pole, bid for the lead
with rivals on both sides in the three path straightening out for the drive, drifted in to be on the rail chasing the winner at the furlong pole and was caught late
losing the place share. GOLDEN TEST broke out on the start, was ahead of only one foe on the backside, had to wait behind a wall of runners at the three
furlong pole, bullied his way through horses in the five path turning for home and finished up on the fringes with a willing effort in the stretch. DROP YOUR
GLOVES was bumped at the start, settled between rivals in the four path near the back of the pack, was pushed out nine wide at the top of the lane, rallied
with three sixteenths to go and pass a few runners down the stretch. SAINT GRAAL CHEVAL was away slowly to begin, regrouped to the front trio on the
fence along the backstretch, was urged for more on the rail in the turn but could not improve on the leaders and faded inside with a furlong remaining.
GLINTINDADDYSEYE was situated between runners in mid-division down the backside, could not gain on the lead three when roused at the three furlong
marker and weakened in the three path at the furlong pole. COMMANDER WORSLEY could see the field by the half mile pole, angled out to the eight path
at the top of the lane, was checked losing its path at the quarter pole and had no finish to offer in the stretch drive. COMPTON was in the three path in
mid-pack in the beginning, travelled three wide around the turn in the third flight making little impression, was bumped soundly inside being forced out by a
rival in upper stretch and was not persevered with in the final furlong. HUNDRED PERCENT stalked near the rear five deep down the backside, continued a
wide trip in the five path making little gain around the bend, was fanned out in the ten path for the drive but emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FRENCH LAUNDRY (GB) was coaxed forward inside to make the lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace on or just off the rail, was thoroughly
pressured engaging in a duel on the far turn, kicked free near mid-stretch and held under steady handling. PAINTED GLORY settled inside at the back, was
off the fence two wide up the backstretch, swung out eight deep for the drive, was gaining strongly but too late. MIDSUMMER MO briefly had the early lead
heading up the stretch the first turn, ceded that position and tucked in behind the new leaders tracking from inside saving ground, came out six to seven
wide for the drive still just back of the leaders, ran on evenly but needed more. CATCH THE DRIFT pressed from between runners then prompted merely
outside the leader, dueled with that one contending for the lead just a short head back, weakened a furlong from home. BEAUTIFUL SKY settled between
foes two wide into the first turn, edged a bit nearer up the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, needed more in the stretch. WHY EM SEA AY was
caught three wide through the first turn, shifted in and rode the rail into upper stretch, failed to menace. LILLZ STAR veered outwardly at the start, was
mildly encouraged forward outside, gained position attending four wide, steadily retreated from near the half-mile and was distanced.

Footnotes
WINTERBERRY was all alone moving well down the backstretch up top, continued along unchallenged through the turn, was set down in mid-stretch when
a rival appeared to be closing in, took off immediately to open up at will at the furlong pole and coasted home in the end. FOXTASTIC tracked the front duo
two wide with four furlongs left to run, moved in three wide by midturn, loomed the only threat in the three path turning for home but was no match for the
winner who had something left in the tank for the stretch run. NORTH YORK was shuffled back a few spots on the fence at the half, burst between foes
when finding a seam in the two path at the three furlong pole to be in the hunt four wide in upper stretch, found another gear in deep stretch and got up just
before the wire to capture third money. WELLNESS followed the winner for the early stages on the rail, was in range of the leader for a piece of the prize in
upper stretch, could not threaten the top two in the stretch running and faded some late to be caught at the wire for the show award. DREXEL HILL stalked
outside foes in the beginning, started to make a rally three wide between horses at the quarter pole, angled four wide for the drive to the finish line and
finished up mildly trying to get a minor role down the lane. AFLEET FLATTER was brushed at the break, had a stalking role inside down the back straight,
was roused for more but could not make any progression around the bend and played no role in the stretch running. NICKI IS A BREEZE stalked in the third
flight between foes three wide in the backstretch, lost positioning through the turn, was fanned out seven wide at the top of the lane and could not get
involved. NO TIME was steadied sharply on the fence when the field tightened up at the half, had to wait behind runners throughout the turn and while in the
three path turning for home lacked a rally down the stretch. JUST LIKE THAT advanced from the tracking group at the half to chase the frontrunning winner
around the turn, was hard ridden when rivals went by on both sides at the quarter pole, had no more to offer in the stretch and yielded two wide at the eighth
pole. ARCTIC VELOCITY was away slowly to trail by many after the start, improved to be ahead of some runners on the fence by the half, saved ground,
keeping pace on the turn but folded on the fence at the furlong marker. MY CASH FACTOR broke out on the start, tracked the front pair four deep at the
half, was under a ride four wide but was going the wrong way on the turn and emptied out in the six path in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
RETAIL THERAPIST was lightly bumped at the start, tracked from inside, came out leaving the turn with aim on the leader, bid at the three-sixteenths taking
a narrow lead, gradually edged away through a prolonged drive. STRIKE A CHORD bumped the outer rival lightly at the start, soon sped clear, set the pace,
came out turning for home to engage the aforementioned, was headed by that one but fought on gamely to the wire while proving no match.
FOURFIFTYFOUR settled at the back near but off the inside racing two to three wide into the turn, waited briefly for room at various points from the half to
the five-sixteenths at which point was guided in nearer the rail cutting the corner and advancing inside foes, came out a bit in the stretch, was best of the
rest. BLAMELESS GHOST was in just a hair tight at the start, made a mild advance outside foes five to six wide on the turn and into upper stretch, went
evenly thereafter. EMPTY GESTURE stalked the pace from off the rail, failed to rally. CLASSY IMAGE came out just a bit at the start, settled off the pace,
was outside a foe at the rear and in a bit of traffic near the half early on the turn, raced four to five wide on that bend, failed to menace. RED ELEANOR
made a mild advance between foes three to four wide from the three-eighths, was within striking distance coming to the top of the stretch, came out further
in upper stretch while weakening and faded. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) shifted in bringing up the rear, raced in behind and inside runners into the turn,
faced mild traffic at the half in about the three path, continued three to four deep and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
HIGH HANDED (IRE) was squeezed at the start to trail, settled into stride still seeing the field along the backside, began to go by runners three wide at the
three furlong marker, had a quick turn of foot when asked four wide, swooping around the field at the quarter pole, bid for the lead in the five path in upper
stretch, switched lead when asked right handed at the furlong marker and drew off convincingly to be much the best at the finish line. NANTUCKETS DAY
broke out to begin, had a tracking position on the fence in the early stages, waited patiently behind a wall of runners midway on the final bend, surged up the
fence in upper stretch to bid for the lead, could not keep up to the winner at the furlong marker and easily bested the rest at the wire. SHAKSHUKA cleared
to the rail from the outside post to take the field into the first turn, rolled along up top with no pressure from rivals down the back straight, was collared on
both sides by mid-stretch, could not match strides with the top two runners late and held on the be a clear third in the end. STOLEN VALOUR broke in on
the start, tracked outside in the first of two turns, continued to watch the frontrunner along the backside with rivals on either side, moved in to vie for the lead
in the far turn, could not accelerate with others in upper stretch and faded between foes, three wide at the eighth pole. GO WITH GUSTO was forced in on
the break, settled three wide outside horses in the third flight in the first turn, improved down the backstretch to track three deep at the half, shadowed the
pacesetter three wide around the far turn, angled four wide turning for home but stalled in the final furlong. SELEMENE travelled between foes in the third
tier into the first turn, stalked two wide outside a rival along the backstretch, kept pace three wide in the final turn, shifted inwards to the rail in the stretch
drive by the furlong marker but had no run to offer in deep stretch. HELIOCENTRIC stalked in the third flight on the rail in the early going, could not keep up
with the field by the three furlong pole travelling on the fence around the far turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TICKER TAPE HOME tracked in behind the leaders, waited from just off the fence nearing the quarter pole seeking room, found it between foes in
mid-stretch and was put to stout urging, drove to the front inside the final seventy yards to prevail. GAL IN A RUSH was forced out just a bit at the start,
settled mid-pack outside, advanced four to five wide on the turn, bid five to six deep at the top of the stretch taking a narrow lead, moved clear by
mid-stretch, drifted out a bit in late stretch and was just collared nearing the wire. QUEEN MACHA broke out a bit, settled toward the rear racing wide, was
forced five to six deep on the turn, came out further for the stretch run drifting from seven to nine wide and under all-out urging, kept on well but was not
enough. METAPHYSICAL was in a bit tight at the break, unhurriedly brought up the rear, fanned seven wide turning for home, came in a bit in the stretch
and gained mildly late. SWALL stalked mostly three to four wide, took closer order to reach contention past the seven-sixteenths, drew even making a bid
for the lead at the quarter pole, flattened out in the lane. TIME PASSAGE dueled for the early lead then eased off a rival just prompting, moved forward
again late up the backstretch to force the issue, bid while drawing even at the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. TITO'S CALLING came in a bit in the
early going racing two wide and at the back up the backstretch, was still unhurried into the turn, swung out eight to nine wide by the stretch run, passed tired
foes. PLEASURE'S GOLD pursued from mid-pack two to three wide between runners on the turn coming out just a bit more for the drive, was one-paced.
NOM DE PLUME was three to four wide between runners into the turn, moved out a bit in upper stretch still with much to do, ran on one-paced. TALK TO
YA LATER was forced in a bit in the early going, saved ground racing inside till the stretch, came out a bit in the lane, was never near enough to threaten.
OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE dueled inside a foe early, took a narrow lead after the opening quarter, faced renewed pressure soon after, faltered and faded.

DARE TO BE KING travelled outside horses near the rear having only two rivals beaten down the backside, began to circle the field five wide at the quarter
pole, was full of run swinging out for clear running room in the eight path at the top of the lane, was encouraged left handed at the furlong marker, switched
leads and preceded to seize command at the seventy yard pole to edge away late for the victory. EMPIRE'S TREAT was checked at the start, co-trailed on
the rail in the early stages, waited while angling outside through the far turn, shifted inwards from the five path finding a seam three wide at the furlong
marker, rallied late in the final furlong but could not get there in time. PARADISE PERFECT tracked four wide into the first turn, stalked three deep in the
third flight in the backstraight, moved closer three wide by the quarter pole, seized control inside at the furlong marker but could not fend off the closing
rivals late and settled for the show money at the wire. FIGHTING IRISH settled in midfield three wide down the backstretch, began to mount a rally four wide
around foes at the three eighths pole, was in range in the six path for a share turning for home but was one paced the final furlong to settle on the fringes in
the end. BLUE MONTJEU co-trailed on the outside in the beginning, was alone at the back of the pack down the backside and around the final bend, swung
out widest in the eight path for the drive and had good late energy to pass many runners outside in the final furlong. VINI VIDI VICI settled on the fence,
stalking near the rear, offered a mild run three wide between runners three furlongs out, angled just outside to be four wide straightening for home, lost his
path and had to be steadied at the furlong pole and could not regroup in time to be a factor. QUANDALE settled between runners in midfield, made little
progress in the two path with runners on both side around the far turn, shifted to the three path for the drive, lugged in briefly and had to checked of an
inside rival at the sixteenth pole, lost momentum and could not pose a threat in deep stretch. BLONDINA'S BOY prompted the pace three wide between
rivals in the beginning, stalked inside in the third flight down the backstretch, was in tight keeping pace with rivals in the two path through the far turn, was
steadied sharply when on heels at the eighth pole and could not recoup to factor afterwards. WHISKEY ROW tracked three wide in the beginning, settled
outside a rival watching the frontrunner down the backstretch, chased the leader outside through the turn, had no more to offer in the two path by upper
stretch and folded at the furlong marker. FROST BITTEN broke in on the start, forced the pace outside foes under the wire for the first time, was headstrong
taking control around the first turn, continued to roll along, very eager setting a quick pace along the backside, was still up top but was clinging onto the lead
by upper stretch, ran out of gas by the furlong marker and was engulfed by runners outside in the final sixteenth. CATHOLIC JACKIE broke out to begin,
had the early lead on the rail, sat behind the loose frontrunner down the back straight, chased in vain on the rail around the final bend and backed up on the
fence in upper stretch.
