Footnotes
BENZODINI pressed pace from four to two wide then engaged the leader at the three furlong marker and took command in mid turn, inched away and drew
clear to prove best. CONTRABANDISTA stalked the pace from off the rail then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker, tipped out to four wide in
upper stretch but couldn't run down the winner and was clearly second best. LE COOP raced near the back to the turn then made a mild four wide bid at the
three furlong marker while moving up, showed the late kick to rally for the show. COME ON COME ON chased the leaders while moving between horses at
the half mile marker but failed to menace. COUNTRY CUT trailed the field through the turn then tipped out to three wide in upper stretch and gave a late
kick and passed tired ones. PERFECT STRIKE vied for the lead from three wide for the first furlong then faded. HEXCEL rushed up to a pressured lead
down the backstretch then was headed at the three furlong marker and matched strides inside of BENZODINI to near the half mile marker and gave way.
ROULETTE was reluctant to load then was hustled along to vied for the lead from the inside to the half mile marker and retreated.

Footnotes
MY GOLDEN BLING sprinted away to a clear lead to the top of the stretch then was engaged by COUNTRY LADY on the outside and battled down the
stretch, dug in late to prevail. COUNTRY LADY rushed up and split horses midway through the turn and battled down the stretch but was outkicked.
TENACIOUS LADY showed no early speed then slipped through going into the stretch and moved up the rail but was no match for the top two.
HURRICANE TIZWAY vied for the lead from three wide to the turn and dropped back. HAPPY SAILOR raced off the pace from two to four wide but was not
a factor. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GOLDEN QUALITY raced off the pace down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker and took a narrow lead at the quarter
pole and battled down the stretch outside of TAYSOM to the wire under a determined drive. TAYSOM rushed up between horses to co-lead outside of
STOMPING HOTROD to the quarter pole then battled down the stretch inside of GOLDEN QUALITY to the wire and gave way grudgingly. BIG ROJO raced
near the back through the turn, angled out to five wide in upper stretch to make the late rally for the show. STOMPING HOTROD hustled along to co-lead
inside of TAYSOM to the quarter pole and tired. AWE SHACKLE vied for the early lead from three wide to the half mile marker and flattened out. FAST
VERDICT had an awkward start then stalked the pace from five wide to the turn but never made a serious bid. MAX PANDOWDY showed no early speed
and was not a threat. UNCLE BRAD was away alertly then vied for the early lead from four wide to midway down the backstretch and gave way.

CERTIFIED GEM stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then made a bid at the three furlong marker to take command midway through the
final turn and pulled away going into the stretch and won going away. CUTE DINERO QUEEN went to the front to set the pace for the first half then was
headed near the three furlong marker, kept on but was no match for the winner and was a clear second. ANITA'S VISION bumped DREWSILLA leaving the
gate then trailed the field through the final turn, shifted inside to make a rail bid and passed tiring ones. MISS KENNEDY saved ground while racing off the
pace down the backstretch then moved up to vie for the lead to midway through the final turn and weakened. DREWSILLA was bumped by ANITA'S
VISION leaving the gate then raced in the middle of the pack and was never a threat. TINCANDANCE bumped with ANITA'S VISION leaving the gate then
raced near the back down the backstretch, launched a four wide bid at the half mile marker through the turn but failed to sustain that bid and tired.

BET ALL THE GOLD rushed up to go to a pressured lead to quarter pole then inched away in early stretch to prove best. A G'S GEM sprinted away to press
the pace from two wide to the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner but held the place. SPOONMAN chased the leaders throughout and made
a late gain of the place. DARIO was forwardly placed down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker but couldn't catch the top
two and weakened. PAINTED SUNDAY saved ground down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn but flattened out. CHIEF HARLAN broke well
then settled in the middle of the pack and failed to menace. A TRUE TARGET trailed the field to the turn then moved up going three wide at the quarter pole
and improve position. BOSTON ROSCOE was unruly behind the gate then raced near the back and passed tiring rivals. MYTURNTODEAL raced in the
middle of the pack from three or four wide and was not a threat. IBENDLIEDTO was off slow then moved to contention before the turn but was used up and
gave way.
