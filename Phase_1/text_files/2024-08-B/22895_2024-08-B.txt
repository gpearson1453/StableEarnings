BREEZIN BRIANNE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, repelled
a challenge by SOMEDAY LADY entering the final turn, and drew clear late to prove best under confident handling. SOMEDAY LADY away well and
tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, loomed a threat while commencing her bid two wide entering the final turn, was no
match for the pacesetter late, while finishing willingly two wide in the drive to prove easily second best. WHY NOTS A WYNNER stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while under snug restraint, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to hold on for a
share. ZENARI unhurried early while dropping well behind the field entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the rail entering
the final turn, and found her best stride late while closing at the rail in the drive. ANSTRUTHER broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, struggled to keep pace with the top pair entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

MOUNT DOOM broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of CHICK COMMAND entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in
the run down the backside, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, assumed control leaving the turn, and drew clear late to prove best.
CHICK COMMAND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and
into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, but finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to prove second best.
MAKENA'S JOY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final
turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive to get up for a share. COUNTER CAT was fractious prior to the start, and settled off the early
pacesetters while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to
make a serious late impact. RONDELITO away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, advanced smartly
midway down the backside and engaged the leaders three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain that bid through the turn, and weakened
over the final furlong.

ANNIKA'S SONG vied for the early lead while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, got the better of her pace rival entering the lane, and just failed to last. NU BLEND tracked the dueling leaders from along the rail
entering the backstretch, tipped three wide to commence her bid nearing the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three out from the rail in the
drive. FEBRUARY broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to hold her position in the run to
the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. DUKE GIRLS away well and stalked the contested early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run
down the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the drive when called upon.
SAILINGFORTHESTARS away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of ANNIKA'S SONG entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue
two wide into the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late while holding on for a share. BABY I'M A STAR unhurried early while dropping well behind the field
entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, shifted two wide in mid stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail.

AIR FORCE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the stretch the first time, and
maintained that advantage in the run down the backside, held her advantage into the lane, and was never seriously threatened late to prove best. MATSQUI
settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, began to advance from along the inside midway down the
backside, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place. DREAMING D'ORO
away alertly and stalked the pacesetter three wide through the stretch the first time, advanced two out from the rail midway down the backstretch to loom a
threat approaching the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive to prove much the best of the rest. EBONY EYES
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and passed a tiring rival late while finishing one out from the rail in the
drive. EDDIE'S GIRL away well and stalked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to chase the leader in
the run down the backstretch, but weakened over the final furlong, and had nothing left for the drive.

STILETTOS ONLY away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two wide, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn,
assumed command entering the lane, and drew clear while finishing three out from the rail in the drive. CHABI away well and stalked the pacesetter into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to get up for
the place in the final strides. DELTA SUNRISE broke sharply and rushed to a clear lead entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and just failed to hold the place. NUMAANY'S CANDY broke inwards and bumped with a
rival to his inside at the start, settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and
finished evenly one out from the rail in the drive. A LITTLE MERCY NOW settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, rallied
one out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SWEET LILY stalked the leader into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, began to drop back in the run to the final turn, trailed the field into the turn, and was eased in the late stages.

VECTOR broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace through the second turn and in the
run down the backside, shook clear of his pace rival entering the final turn, and widened his advantage in the lane to prove best. SNAP TO IT away well and
settled at the back of the pack while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backside,
rallied along the inside through the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to get up for the place. DEAL EM rushed up through the turn to force the issue
from the outside of VECTOR entering the stretch the first time, continued to press the leader two wide in the run down the backside, struggled to keep tabs
on his pace rival entering the final turn, and was outfinished late while finishing three wide in the drive. GO LENT GO away alertly and stalked the leaders

LUCKY FORCE stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backside,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to prove best. SHOCK THE HOUSE broke sharply and raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BAK TO LIBERTY in the run through the second turn and down the
backside, continued to save ground through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late while proving second best. DIOCLES away alertly and was taken in
hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the
backside, tipped three wide entering the final turn before angling back inside through the turn, and closed two wide in the drive to get up for a share.
WHAT'S SHAKIN was slow into stride, and settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued with a
three wide trip in the run down the backside, was forced wide into the final turn, before angling in to save ground, shifted three wide in mid stretch and
finished with late interest. COUNTERACT tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. BAK TO LIBERTY away well and pressed the pace from the outside of SHOCK THE HOUSE through the
stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive.

EXTRA INNINGS away alertly and raced to the lead entering the first turn, controlled the pace on an uncontested lead through the second turn and into the
backside, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and continued to widen his advantage through the lane as much the best. DIVAANY stalked the
leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained a stalking trip in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT tracked the pacesetter through the lane
the first time while racing one out from the rail, held his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along
the inside in the drive and just failed to hold the place. CRYPTO MUNNY settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch
the first time, began to advance in the run down the run down the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn, shifted four wide midway through the turn,
and finished with late interest one out from the rail in the drive. CHAMPIOSA settled off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first
time, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. KARDINAL
ROSE tracked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground while tracking the pacesetter in the
run down the backside, saved ground through the final turn, but had little to offer late while finishing three wide in the drive. DAPPER DON broke sharply
and settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, raced wide throughout, and failed to make a late impact.
ACCORDINGLY away well and tracked the leader through the stretch while racing two out from the rail, held a stalking trip into the backstretch, was called
upon for run midway down the backstretch, but failed to respond. EH TEE EM trailed throughout.
