CANT KEEP ME DOWN stalked the pace inside, bid outside of the leader at the three-eighths pole and was clear late under a strong drive. PEACOCK
ROAD stalked the pace inside, shifted to the three path at the eighth pole and bid late for the place. HERE'S THE SPIDER raced in the two path, bid in the
five path in early stretch and missed the place. SUMMERINTAHOE bore out at the start, was clear early but couldn't hold off the closers. PSYCHEDELIC
was bumped at the start, stalked the pace in the three path and lacked a late bid. YARBOROUGH raced unrushed in the two path.
