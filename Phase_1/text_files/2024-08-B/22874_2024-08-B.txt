Footnotes
SHOWERS vied inside rivals into the first turn, took a stalking position around the bend, challenged the leader from inside at the five-sixteenths pole, took
over at the quarter pole then cleared shortly after, drew away in upper stretch under hand urging, asked left handed at the eighth pole, switched to the right
hand one time at the sixteenth pole and ridden out to the wire. LEE'S BABY GIRL vied between rivals in the two path then cleared and moved inside around
the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged by outer rival at the three-eighths pole, maintained a short lead before getting
confronted by SHOWERS to the inside at the five-sixteenths marker, lost command outside the quarter pole, chased the new leader into the lane and held
off RIO DEL SOL to save the place honors. RIO DEL SOL had brief speed three deep between rivals, stalked three then two wide on the first turn, put in a
mild bid from outside with three furlongs remaining, chased three deep at the quarter pole, followed in tandem with LEE'S BABY GIRL through the lane and
could not get by that rival for second. POWER CONNECTION broke out, fought four deep into the first turn, dropped back off the leader and moved into the
three path, raced outside a rival in the middle stages, trailed three wide on the far turn and passed a tired rival in the lane. TWO BAR showed early foot
between rivals then was taken back approaching the clubhouse turn, traveled three wide early on the bend then started to climb and was guided to the
inside, tracked a bit off the rail into the second bend, came under a ride while finding the rail on the turn but began to weaken and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
C'MON MAN coaxed along early near the back, moved closer outside rivals up the backstretch, gained while angling from the five path down to the three
path around the turn, drew alongside YES HE CAN in upper stretch, cleared midstretch and remained strong to the wire. WORTH LOOKING brushed with
inner rival early, coaxed along off the pace at the half-mile pole, had to pause behind rivals from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, steered
out into the clear, came six wide into the lane, rallied and gained second. YES HE CAN away quickly to take control, showed the way under pressure early
then cleared leaving the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn, confronted by the winner outside the eighth pole, yielded midstretch and churned on
to save third. SMARTY NOSE tracked four deep into the turn, chased between foes then asked left handed in the two path approaching the stretch, angled
in at the eight pole, shifted back out at the sixteenth pole and could not get by YES HE CAN for third. CALL MY BANKER coaxed along off the pace and
moved inside, angled out past the five-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the drive and failed to threaten. ROYAL HALO brushed early, raced near the
back on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and improved position. SLEW'S JOY broke well, lost her path and became a bit rank
early, lost ground leaving the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, steered out to the five path around the bend and could not rally. VICENTE'S
SHADOW lacked early speed and trailed early, went five wide into the turn, moved down to the three path then came back out and entered the lane six wide
but was never a factor. ALEXIS S stalked off the rail, went three wide into the turn, angled down to the inside and tired. MARKS HIP pressed the leader from
outside, chased leaving the backstretch, started to weaken two then three wide on the turn and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
CAPITAL OUTLAY sped clear quickly and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch from the rail, remained unchallenged into deep stretch
under right then left handed urging and held off the late run from DESERT ROCKET in the final strides. DESERT ROCKET unhurried in the early going and
steered to the inside, coaxed along around the bend, cornered nicely into the lane, moved out and closed well, drew alongside the winner late but ran out of
time. DANZING FOREST chased three deep to the turn, was closest in pursuit two wide around the bend, followed the leader within striking distance
through the lane but finished evenly. AFTERNOON NAP off slow in the beginning, moved up and tracked just of range from inside, went between rivals earl
on the turn, shied from rival who shifted out past the five-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into the lane and kept on for a minor award. THE SCENT stalked
between rivals into the turn, moved over to the inside around the bend and could not produce a bid when needed. RED ON SUNDAY stalked the pacesetter
inside a pair of rivals, got crowded along the fence to lost ground early on the turn, shifted out to bother AFTERNOON NAP past the five-sixteenths pole,
tipped out in the drive and failed to rally. MAKE IT A LARGE rubbed the gate and broke inward to spot the field a few lengths, trailed along the inside to the
stretch and passed tired rivals. DRIVE FOR SHOW sat off the pace outside a rival, traveled two wide on the turn, angled out into the lane and could not
make an impact. WHO IS PAVEL tracked outside a rival early, three deep early on the turn, got forced out past the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the
lane and weakened.

Footnotes
DON'T TELL TAMMO away quickly to take the front, set the pace outside GRACIE'S BIG DAY up the backstretch, pressured by rivals on both sides early
on the turn then dueled inside ZOE'S CANDY past the five-sixteenth pole, lost command with a quarter mile remaining, kept the pressure on from inside into
the final furlong, drew on even terms once again with a sixteenth remaining and dug in late to overtake the runner-up. ZOE'S CANDY stalked the top pair
from outside, bid three deep at the three-eighths pole, dueled outside DON'T TELL TAMMO and took over at the quarter pole, carried a short lead into the
final furlong, headed entering deep stretch and got outfinished by the winner. SHE'S MY FLAME brushed with outer rival leaving the gate, chased three
deep into the turn, continued three wide to the stretch and bested the rest. GRACIE'S BIG DAY broke out and bumped, went up to force the pace from
inside, lost touch with the top pair at the five-sixteenths pole, lost ground leaving the bend and faded in the drive. SKYLIGHT RIDE broke a step slow then
had a clear path taken away leaving the gate, trailed on the inside then passed a tired rival while moving a bit off the rail into the turn, angled out to pass a
pair of rivals around the bend, moved back into the two path approaching the stretch and kept on to improve placing. STANFORD HOLIDAY bumped
leaving the gate, chased four deep into the turn, rounded the bend outside a rival in the four path and weakened. EMPRESS LORRAYNE chased off the rail
then between rivals into the turn, weakened two wide around the bend and tired. UNBRIDLED BRIDE off slow and lost her pat at the start, traveled three
then four wide around the bend and was never a factor. JUST A LITTLE CYNN stalked along the rail inside a trio of rivals, weakened around the bend and
tired down the lane.

Footnotes
IRISH ROYALTY coaxed along early while dropping off the ace, angled to the inside, raced near the back to the stretch, ran into traffic in upper stretch,
gained a clear path and started to move splitting rivals midstretch, came with a late rush inside the top pair and got up. DOUBLE JAB away quickly then
pressed ZIP OM from outside up the backstretch and around the turn, lost touch with that rival in upper stretch but remained close, came back on late but
was outfinished by the winner. ZIP OM broke a bit slow, rushed up along the inside to take control from DOUBLE JAB, set the pace under pressure from
that rival, raced a bit greenly late on the bend, shook free in upper stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth, grew weary late and was overtaken from
both sides in the end. SUPERNAL coaxed along near the back outside a rival, took the turn two then three wide, angled widest in the drive and summoned a
mild rally to round out the superfecta. JOE DON LOONEY traveled in mid-pack outside a rival, rounded the bend two then three wide, moved out in the drive
and finished willingly to whittle the gap. BELLY UP also raced mid-pack in the early going and moved inside, chased two wide leaving the bend, went
between rivals in upper stretch and kept trying to the wire despite needing to find more. CHICK'S DIG IT sat off the pace along the inside, tipped out at the
top of the lane then altered back inside and also needed to find more late. MCGREGOR LAKE off slow spotting the field a few lengths, reserved along the
inside at the back, tipped out approaching the quarter pole and failed to menace. GALLAND DE BESOS raced outside a rival at the rear, traveled three wide
at the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, found traffic in the late but finished with late run when gaining a clear path. IMPEACHALOT stalked the
speed outside a rival, drifted out at the five-sixteenths pole, straightened course then drifted out again leaving the bend and flattened out. DONNIE THE
CHIRO stalked the top pair from inside, ridden along around the bend, moved out in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
WE'LL DO IT LIVE closest in pursuit of the leader from outside up the backstretch, challenged with a quarter mile remaining, dueled into the final furlong
and drew clear in the final sixteenth. PERFECT IN GRAY sped clear and set the pace up the backstretch, led along the inside around the turn, met the bid
from WE'LL DO IT LIVE late on the bend, dueled into the final furlong and yielded in deep stretch. PRINCESS IS OLIVIA stalked three deep then outside a
rival in the early going, traveled three wide then four wide into the lane, drifted inward in the final furlong and kept on to retain third. BEAU SOLEIL fractious
in the gate, off slow in the beginning, chased three wide into the turn, angled out and exited the bend in the six path, offered a mild response and rounded
out the superfecta. BELLA VIENNA bumped repeatedly with outer rival at the start, traveled in mid-pack early, went two wide into the turn, steered out and
entered the lane five wide but failed to rally when needed. UR IN TROUBLE tracked two wide into the turn, moved to the rail and saved ground to the
stretch, then weakened in the drive. ANNA'S WISH chased from inside off the pace, went between rivals on the turn then came two wide into the drive,
tipped out and failed to menace. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST exchanged bumps with inner rival at the start, lacked early speed, moved to the inside, raced a bit
off the rail into the lane and never got involved. SKY SAILING fractious in the gate, chased along the rail then moved to the two path on the turn and tired.
ROSE OF JERICHO coaxed from the gate, trailed up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, drifted out at the three-eighths pole, came three wide into
the lane and was always outrun.

Footnotes
HANDY DANDY stalked from inside, roused while tipping out leaving the far turn, headed BEE CATCHER at the eighth pole, took over shortly after and
drove clear. BEE CATCHER stepped to the front and moved inside, pressured a bit in the middle stages, led clear through the far turn, collared by HANDY
DANDY outside the eighth pole, lost command midstretch and stayed on for second best. HURRICANE CLOUD (GB) rank along the inside early, pulled up
the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch, finished with a mild rally and nosed out MOODY JIM (IRE) for third. MOODY JIM (IRE) bumped leaving the
gate, settled inside, ridden along on the far turn but found traffic behind a wall of rivals, cut the corner into the lane, moved off the fence in the drive, lacked
the needed late punch and was edged for third. SPIRIT MAKER hard to ride along the inside and bumped outer rival entering the stretch for the first turn,
continued rank to the first turn, rounded the far turn in the two path and offered a mild response to improve placings down the stretch. SYDNEY STREET
(GB) broke out and bumped rival, settled in the two path, got bumped hard and took up briefly entering the stretch for the first time, traveled two wide near
the back, bothered by SPIRIT MAKER again early on the far turn, trailed on the inside into the lane, moved out and kept trying to the wire. VANZZY was
closest in pursuit from the two path, applied some pressure on the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the far turn and weakened. RECKLESS
SPIRIT raced two wide off the pace, moved up quickly three deep leaving the backstretch bumped got knocked into inner rival entering the far turn, angled
five wide into the lane and failed to menace. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR tucked inside at the rear then moved off the rail first time in the stretch, traveled in the two
path then steered out and advanced three, four, then five deep in the middle stages, shifted in and bumped rival nearing the three-eighths pole, ridden along
four deep on the far turn, exited that bend five wide and flattened out. FLY THE SKY tracked in the two path, crept closer three deep into the far turn and
took a bump near the three-eighths pole, entered the lane in the four path and ran into traffic late.

Footnotes
SWEET AZTECA got bumped from inside at the start, cleared quickly and set the pace up the backstretch, led in the two path entering the turn then moved
inside, came off the rail a bit leaving the bend, drew away when tapped on the shoulder at the top of the stretch and widened through the final furlong under
mild urging. CHISMOSA bobbled a bit leaving the gate, raced off the pace and steered to the outside, drew closer leaving the backstretch, navigated the
turn five then four wide, drifted in and brushed ANYWHO in the late stages and edged that rival for second. ANYWHO was closest in pursuit up the
backstretch, chased two to three wide on the turn, drifted out a bit midstretch, brushed with CHISMOSA late and missed second. IRISH WAHINE brushed in
the beginning, tracked the lone leader from off the rail, went four then three wide around the bend and failed to respond when called upon. TOM'S REGRET
ducked in and took up to avoid the rail early, trailed on the inside into the turn, angled four wide on the turn and could not make an impact. VITALERA (CHI)
broke out and bumped SWEET AZTECA, stalked up the backstretch, came under a ride when starting to lose ground along the rail around the turn and had
little left for the stretch run. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN AND AFTER A REVIEW RULED THAT ALTHOUGH
CHISMOSA DID DRIFT IN AND MAKE SLIGHT CONTACT WITH ANYWHO LATE, IT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
BIG JUANITO reserved then tugged a bit along the inside, tipped out and went between rivals on the far turn, spun three wide into the lane, reeled in the
leader past the sixteenth pole and drove clear. QUALITY WINS raced outside a rival off the pace, angled five wide around the far turn, moved out widest in
the drive and closed well to pass NUCLEAR for second in the final moments. NUCLEAR chased briefly, pressed three deep into the first turn then outside
the leader leaving the bend, took over at the five-eighths pole, put away inner rival leaving the backstretch, drew when roused on the far turn, asked right
handed entering the lane, carried a diminishing lead into deep stretch, yielded to the winner and lost second. THE OLD NINE (IRE) traveled two wide well
off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, lacked room in traffic in upper stretch, went between rivals at the eighth pole, put in a
mild late bid and earned a minor award. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES stalked three deep early, traveled outside a rival on the backstretch, between foes into the
far turn, chased outside a pair of rivals into the lane, raced within striking distance with a furlong left to run but could not summon the needed late kick.
CARIBBEAN KING reserved along the inside out of range, crept closer in the middle stages, lacked room from the five-sixteenths pole to upper stretch,
roused when gaining a clear path outside the eight pole and could not rally. TRAVAIL tracked in the two path then outside a rival, moved to the three path
on the far turn then came back to the two path late on the bend, moved out in the lane and produced a mild rally. MYSTERIOUS HUSBAND saved ground
near the back, came off the fence in the lane and improved placings. SIR MAXIMUS away quickly to take control and steered to the inside, led under
pressure from NUCLEAR, relinquished the lead to that rival at the five-eighths pole and now switched roles to press the pace up the backstretch, could not
keep up with the new leader past the seven-sixteenths pole, chased along the fence to the stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. QUINTECENTS
had early speed between rivals then took a stalking position in the two path around the clubhouse turn, traveled between runners in the middle stages,
continued in the two path on the far turn, put to left handed urging in the upper stretch but weakened in the late stages. LEGITIMATE TARGET (GB) pulled
two wide between rivals early then three wide into the backstretch, traveled four wide in the middle stages, chased three deep then four wide into the lane,
tired and was not persevered with in the late.
