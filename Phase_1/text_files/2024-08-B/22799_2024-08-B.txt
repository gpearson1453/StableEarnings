best of the rest. PRECIOUS GRACE mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and closed well for the
show. HOPE SHE COMES unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, evened and gained a share. SUNSET

and drew off late under steady pressure. UP FOR THE CHANCE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled
out for clear racing room, made a steady gain edged up for the place. OSBIN sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the

and got up for a share. NAVY PIER mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong.

RAISE YOUR GAME tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then split foes and drew off under
steady pressure. WILD LOOKER unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, drifted in slightly under left
hand urging and closed well for the place. CHEROKEE CHATTER well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into
the stretch, flattened late and got up for the show. WATERLOO SUNSET stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid
outside the leader into the stretch, flattened the final furlong and held a share. ULTIMATE BARONESS passed tiring rivals. EMERALD CITADELLE set the
pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded late. SCENIC VIEW was no factor. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) never far
back, held position three and four wide through the turn, then fanned widest and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT DANCER stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, dueled with DECLARED and edged ahead of that one in the final strides. DECLARED tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, raced
boxed through the second turn, waited, came through inside the leader, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then dueled and was outfinished.
EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE unhurried, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch, closed fast and missed the place.
DOWAGIAC CHIEF showed little. SHANTY SHACK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the
final furlong.

Footnotes
CHIPS LEGACY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure.
FAST LEARNER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and lacked the needed late kick.
CROWNING PRINCE led in the early going, rated outside the leader, angled in and saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and
closed well for the show. MR. IMPATIENT unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and closed for a
share. CHEERFUL TROUT well placed, gained a striking position two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and flattened the
final furlong. GRUIT passed tiring rivals. DUKE OF SICILY stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the turn. LAST POST tracked the pace, saved
ground on the two path gaining position through the turn, bid between rivals and faded into the stretch. OVERTIME CHARLIE was a brief factor, outside.
