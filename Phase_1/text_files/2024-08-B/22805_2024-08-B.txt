Footnotes
YOUMAKEMECHARLIE tracked the leaders from a clear pocket along the rail through the turn, cut the corner at the top of the lane saving all the ground,
tipped out in upper stretch to engage the tiring pacesetter and pulled clear to the wire holding the closers safe. CONQUERTHOSEWECAN reserved off the
early pace, commenced a four wide rally midway on the turn and finished well as second best unable to gain on the winner. SOUPER UPGRADE unhurried
in the early going to be near the rear of the field, angled out nine wide at the head of the lane with a steady rally and was best of the rest. DELICATE sped to
the lead down the backstretch, opened a clear lead on the bend and weakened in upper stretch. KUKU stalked the pace from three wide to be well placed
turning for home and flattened out in the stretch. SPICE GAL slow early to be the distant trailer and passed tiring rivals coming home. CA BAM chased the
pace from five wide to midway on the turn and tired. SHOW' EM NOLA prompted the early pace and came up empty.

Footnotes
WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER stalked the pace along the rail just off the dueling pacesetters, rallied turning for home, closed well to engage the leader inside the
eighth pole and pulled clear late the beneficiary of a perfect trip. GOLDEN CAN took command while well in hand early, was challenged after the first eighth
to duel on the lead to the top of the lane, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and could not hold the closing winner off late, while clearly second best.
A GIRL NAMED JAC tracked the leader from three wide through the turn and rallied mildly to be along for the show. LOVIELEE broke a bit slow, rushed up
to duel on the lead to the head of the stretch and weakened. SUN STREAMING trailed most of the way and never posed a threat. UNCAPTURED RUBY
chased the leaders to midway on the turn and had no response when called upon dropping out of contention on the turn. This race had a timing discrepancy
or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SCHRADER set the pace under mild pressure to the top of the lane, drifted out to the six-path turning for home while in the clear, continued to drift slightly
under right hand urging in upper stretch, corrected to be straightened out while driving in the seven path and finished determinedly repelling all challengers
in a game effort. ALL THE LUCK stalked the pace through the turn, rallied from the seven path at the head of the lane around the drifting pacesetter, was
bumped hard by AMY'S MUSIC in upper stretch after leaning out on that one, was taken up off heels of the winner when knocked off stride, was well
handled to be straightened away and kept-on willingly to gain the place. AMY'S MUSIC tracked the leaders to the quarter pole rallied nine wide, came in
bumping ALL THE LUCK in upper stretch and finished willingly to hold the show. VOLT was well placed in striking distance from the rail and failed to mount
a rally in the lane. BRAVE WORDS failed to menace going one-paced. RYDER trailed to upper stretch and passed weakened rivals down the lane.
PROBALE TEN was not a factor. RUN JODY showed early speed pressing the pace and came up empty tiring on the turn. THE RIDER OF ALL THE LUCK
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

CREATE TROUBLE set the pace under mild pressure while well rated, responded nearing the quarter pole to repel the bid from the presser and drew off
convincingly. OISHI tracked the leaders from the fence through the far turn, cut the corner turning for home and closed well as second best. FINGAL
reserved off the pace while hard held down the backside, rallied at the top of the stretch and finished willingly with a mild bid to be along for the show.
MAGIC HEART stalked the pace from three wide to be well positioned on the final bend and had no response when called upon nearing the quarter pole
and finished evenly. DR. HYDE slow early to be the trailer, remained at the back to deep stretch and passed a tried rival in the lane having never posed a
threat. ST JAMES THE GREAT prompted the pace to the far turn, mounted a bid on the bend, was repelled turning for home and gave way in the lane.

BALENCIAGA BETTY rated off the leaders to the turn, coasted up from three wide to easily take command on the bend, and drew off in the lane as much
best while kept to task. LADYS CHANT reserved off the pace along the rail to midway on the turn, was set to an early drive and steadily advanced to be
second best. DIVA DE ORO tracked the leaders from four wide through the turn and ground her way through the stretch to be along for the show. BACK
OFF ME raced along the fence in contention down the backside, was shuffled back nearing the turn, steadied at the three-eighths pole to drop back near the
rear of the field when caught in tight quarters and re-rallied showing some late interest in the stretch. LADY TOURIST raced near the rear of the field early
and made a steady gain without impact. AUTUMN IN VERMONT pressed the pace from the inside to midway on the turn and faded. GREYGRAZIE broke
way wide to be slow early and was never a threat. DOGWOODS JUNE dueled on the lead to the turn and steadily gave way. LAZY ACES broke slow and
was outrun.

REPO ROCKS reserved in hand at the rear of the field in striking distance throughout, rallied turning for home angling five wide and closed well wearing the
pacesetters down inside the sixteenth pole to be clear in deep stretch. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY set a pressured pace from the fence, responded in upper
stretch to open a clear advantage and dug-in through the lane but was unable to hold off the winner late in a game effort. COUNT DE MONET pressed the
pace from two wide to the quarter pole, was repelled by the leader turning for home and kept-on willingly chasing the pacesetter to the wire. NICO stalked
the leaders from three wide to be well placed on the turn and lacked a closing response in the drive.

ACTIVE stalked the leaders from the fence down the backside, angled out three wide turning for home to engage the leaders in upper stretch, finished well
to pull clear midway down the lane and was unchallenged late. RAGTIME LADY unhurried while well in hand at the back of the field for the first half, steadily
advanced circling the field and finished well to be up for the place in deep stretch. DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT rated off the pace along the rail down the
backside, waited through the turn for racing room against the rail, and finished willingly up the fence through the lane. VENOMOUS VIXEN was in tight
quarter shortly away from the gate to be taken in hand dropping to the rear, steadily made up ground down the backside, angled out five wide at the top of
the stretch and rallied mildly from between rivals in the lane. DETERMIND PRINCESS prompted the pace for the first half, rallied on the turn to threaten
turning for home and weakened in the stretch. HOT BOTTOM GIRL set the pace under mild pressure while well rated and lacked a closing response when
engaged in upper stretch. CANDY DOLL tracked the leaders for a half mile and flattened out on the far turn.

Footnotes
MAYA PRINCE tracked the leaders from the rail through the turn while well in hand, waited in upper stretch for racing room, angled out to the clear in
mid-stretch and closed well to be going away in a better than looked effort. S S SINATRA reserved off the pace near the rear of the field to the turn, was
urged on the bend to gain ground, circled six wide at the top ofthe lane and finished willingly to be up for the place. CLOUDY stalked the pace from three
wide to midway on the turn, rallied to take the lead in mid-stretch and was outkicked in the drive. RUDDY BUDDY unhurried in the early going to trail while
still in striking distance and rallied mildly passed tiring rivals in the lane. JUST SAY WHEN dueled on the lead from the rail, dug-in turning for home to
respond to new challenger and finally weakened late in the lane. A G DIAMOND pressed the pace from two wide to the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
ATMIDNIGHT was reserved early between rivals, remained between rivals on the turn, swung out five wide for racing room and closed well on the outside to
edge away late under a drive. SOLVING PROGRESS tracked the pace three wide early, then made a two wide bid off the turn and took over to be clear
leaving the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner while saving the place award. GLOSSAMER crossed over while in front and clear into the first
turn, then was hard held and rated back on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and finished willingly. SAVE THE
FLAG was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn and had a mild late kick. AWARD TOUR (IRE) was
reserved on the inside, came two wide off the turn and made a mild bid but needed more late. HEARTBURN vied for the lead two wide entering the first
turn, then went on to set the pace while clear and move to the inside, then was headed leaving the trun and weakened in the final furlong. LUNAR UNIT was
allowed to settle on the inside, eased out on the far turn and came three wide into the lane and had no rally. SEAFARER was reserved three wide and came
four wide off the turn and never threatened. RUN RUN RABBIT was settled two wide early, moved to the inside on the far turn and tired.
