Footnotes
HOT GOBLIN tracked early pace between rivals, was well placed while in pursuit two wide nearing the quarter marker, roused into the stretch, closed
determinedly and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, took command past mid-stretch, kept to task into the final sixteenth and held in a drive in the late
stages. GALLO DEL CIELO allowed to settle while never far back, improved position two wide nearing the quarter marker, closed willingly into the stretch,
pressured the winner into the final sixteenth but could not reel in HOT GOBLIN and was clear of the rest for second. AUTISM MIND sent away from the
start, set the moderate pace from the inside entering the turn, maintained a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, was confronted into the stretch, met the
bid of HOT GOBLIN nearing the furlong marker, was overtaken and gave way into the final sixteenth. BEAR ENCOUNTER broke in at the start and was
away a bit slowly, lacked early speed and trailed into the turn, was guided three wide to the quarter pole, four wide into the stretch and lacked a late
response. TOP WOLF bumped by a neighboring rival at the start, chased the decent early pace from the inside, ran in pursuit while saving ground into the
turn, tired in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
PENNYPATTER broke well and rushed to the front to join RUNNIN ON PROMISES to duel for the early lead, drifted out slightly turning for home then
ducked in sharply at the top of the stretch under right handed urging, almost hitting the rail, raced greenly down the stretch then ducked out sharply knocking
RUNNIN ON PROMISES off-stride and held on to the finish. RUNNIN ON PROMISES broke broke best and was hustled to the lead, dueled with
PENNYPATTER to the inside with the rider taking a bit of a hold then was set down approaching the quarter pole, was floated out on the turn for home by
that foe, was kept to task down the stretch under steady handling and intermittent urging, took hard bump from PENNYPATTER near the wire and was well
clear of the next horse. SMILING RAPPER was outrun from the start, came under a ride early, hooked up with stablemate RYTHEM GIRL on the turn, came
into the stretch together with that one then outlasted the rest for third. STAY WICKED chased the top pair through the early going from several lengths back,
began to weaken near the three furlong marker and finished evenly the rest of the way, getting passed for third mid-stretch. RYTHEM GIRL was rank exiting
the gate, fought the rider and veered out sharply to the outside, settled down, raced wide down the backstretch, hooked in with SMILING RAPPER midway
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch but did not produce a closing kick. LA' MOMINA was reluctant to load, had no speed from the break was
outrun and never a threat. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED
THAT PENNYPATTER IMPEDED RUNNIN ON PROMISES IN THE STRETCH AND WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.
THERE WAS ALSO A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RUNNIN ON PROMISES AGAINST THE RIDER OF PENNYPATTER,
WHICH WAS UPHELD. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ALMANERA (IRE) sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, was well handled along the bend
and set a pressured pace while off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, shook free and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the
final sixteenth, dug in in deep stretch and held in a drive for the win. HANDSOME GARY settled off of the decent early pace, raced two wide into the turn,
shifted three then four wide and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was widest into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker, could not
reel in the winner in deep stretch and was a clear second. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD took back off of the decent early pace, tracked between runners heading
to the half-mile pole, ran in pursuit two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked at mid-stretch, stayed on into the final sixteenth and
outfinished OUR EXPECTATION for show honors. OUR EXPECTATION broke awkwardly leaving the start, rushed up outside of rivals in the early going,
chased the pace three to four wide into the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, was repelled in upper stretch, faded in the drive and was
outfinished for third in deep stretch. PAUL VINCENTS POEM chased the decent early pace from the inside inside, was well placed into the turn and stalked
the pacesetter while saving ground nearing the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch, weakened in the final furlong and could not muster a late rally.
CONTINENTAL UNION fractious in the starting gate, took back off the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and lacked a late response. GORDY'S
BOY was a step slow away from the start, settled off of the decent early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and did not have an impact in the stretch
drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
HONORABLE GAL was allowed to settle into stride from the break and was near the rear of the pack through the early going, stayed in three path through
the turn and started to run on with three furlongs to go, came five wide into the stretch, produced a strong rally and was along in time. LADY'S SERMON
broke well and pressed the pace inside of KEEP YOUR COIL, dropped off the pace when A ROUSING BABE took up the challenge on the outside and took
a stalking position behind those two, re-bid coming two wide into the stretch and finished up well under strong handling and intermittent urging. KEEP YOUR
COIL was pushed on to gain early position and was joined by LADY'S SERMON before a furlong, kept a head in front of that one then was taken on by A
ROUSING BABE near the half-mile pole, fought back when the field bunched up in upper stretch and kept on with good courage. CODE RIBBON was taken
in hand from the break and was kept outside and under a firm hold for the run down the backstretch, took a four to five wide path through the turn then went
about seven wide into the stretch, finished well under steady handling but came up short. A ROUSING BABE broke a step slow then rushed up towards the
leaders, got even with KEEP YOUR COIL near the half-mile marker and dueled with that foe into the stretch, turned for home four wide as the whole field
fanned out across the track at the three sixteenths, had every chance but was outfinished in the final furlong. CANAM GAL steadied slightly near the five
and a half furlong marker, was close up on the inside through the early stages then dropped back some on the turn, kept to the inside path through the turn
and was still with a chance as the field fanned out but was unable to match strides, drifted out mid-stretch and was outkicked to the finish. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

to four wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, took command past mid-stretch, drew clear
into the final sixteenth and held sway in deep stretch. UNION COACH allowed to settle away from the start, raced outside of runners entering the turn and
was three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five to six wide into the stretch, closed fast into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in
deep stretch and held well in the late stages for second. SUPER ELLIE unhurried away from the start, was content to trail approaching the turn, saved
ground along the bend and into upper stretch, closed willingly in the stretch drive and got up up for show honors in the final strides. HOT JAMMIES was a
step slow leaving the start, was hard sent away from the gate and assumed early command ,showed good speed and set a decent pace heading to the
half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn and raced on a clear lead nearing the quarter pole, led into the stretch, was overtaken at the furlong marker,
gave way in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the minor awards. GREATFUL ATTITUDE hustled away from the start, was prominent in the early
going and stalked the decent pace from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, shifted outside of HOT JAMMIES entering the turn and chased two to
three wide nearing the quarter marker, ran in pursuit while between rivals into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep
stretch. READY TO GIG was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the decent early pace between runners heading to the half-mile marker, shifted
to inside entering the turn and chased from the rail heading to the quarter pole, saved ground into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, angled
out at mid-stretch and could not muster a late response. PATSY MONTANA forwardly placed away from the start, chased the decent early pace between
rivals heading to the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit while between runners entering the turn and went two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, shifted
four wide into upper stretch and finished evenly in the drive. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY took back off of the decent early pace, went two to three wide into
the turn, lost position at the quarter marker and lacked a response in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WHAT A DUDE seized the early lead and was pressed through solid fractions by CROWN MAGIC to the outside, got the best of that foe at the head of the
stretch then repelled a strong challenge by UNCLE WALT down the stretch to prevail. UNCLE WALT was allowed to settle and secured a good tracking
position along the rail, saved ground to the far turn, then responded when given the cue to go on after passing the three furlong pole, swung three wide for
the stretch run, lugged in while failing to change leads at the top of the stretch, hung, and was unable to get past the winner. CROWN MAGIC pressed the
pace to the outside of WHAT A DUDE for six furlongs, began to weaken in upper stretch but held on well to hold the third placing. LIBERTY WOLF went
three to four wide through the first turn and settled near the rear of the field, took an inside path through the far turn, did not quicken but was kept to task
and finished one-paced to hold position. APLOMBADO three wide through the first turn, got a tracking position just behind the leaders for the run down the
backstretch, went four wide through the far turn then five wide into the stretch, was unable to find another gear when needed and could not improve.
WINTER SOLDIER came away in good order, then became rank approaching the first turn, fought the rider and was wrangled back to the rear of the field
and steered to the outside, moved into a contending position but still last going into the far turn, then came under pressure near the quarter pole and offered
nothing in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CANTILEVER allowed to settle away from the start, tracked the decent pace from between runners approaching the half-mile marker, was well placed
heading to the far turn, chased two wide nearing the quarter pole, split rivals into upper stretch and mounted a three wide rally at the furlong marker, closed
determinedly into the final sixteenth, wore down BEGIN AGAIN in deep stretch and held in a drive in the final strides. BEGIN AGAIN broke alertly, ceded the
early lead to BEAUTY IN AUTISM and stalked outside of that rival entering the first turn, attended to the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, took
command past the half-mile pole and led into the second turn, drew to a clear lead into the stretch and was kept to task into the final sixteenth, all out in
deep stretch, was tagged for the win in the final strides and was clear of the rest for second. RED RAJ was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the
early pace outside of an inner rival and went two to three wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked outside of runners
heading to the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the second turn, could not match strides with the leading pair in the stretch drive, stayed on
into the final sixteenth and held safely for third. FRANK THE CAT was squeezed at the start and broke a step slowly, recovered to race close up to the
decent early pace, stalked from the inside into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, split rivals into the far turn
and mounted a two to three wide bid at the quarter pole, chased BEGIN AGAIN into the stretch, could not sustain his rally past mid-stretch and flattened out
in the late stages. MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY settled leaving the start, raced three then two wide into the first turn, shifted outside of rivals along the backstretch
run and advanced at the half-mile, was guided back to the inside and saved ground into the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch drive, could not muster
the needed response in the late stages but improved position in the final sixteenth. BRUISER took back off of the early pace, checked and was jostled by
the loose horse entering the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run and trailed to the half-mile pole, guided two to three wide into the second
turn, ran evenly into the stretch and did not threaten in the late stages. BEAUTY IN AUTISM sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set the
pace into the first turn, pulled on the rider and opened a clear lead heading into the backstretch run, set a moderate pace approaching the half-mile pole,
lost the lead past the half-mile marker and chased BEGIN AGAIN into the far turn, dropped back approaching the quarter pole and stopped in upper stretch,
was eased through the final furlong and walked off under his own power. SCIENCE RULES allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the first
turn, lost position along the backstretch run, lost contact with the rest along the second turn, was pulled up in upper stretch and walked off under his own
power. RINGTONE allowed to settle leaving the start, Antongeorgi's saddle had broken equipment then the rider was unseated heading into the first turn,
ran loose through the race, was apprehended following the race and walked off under his own power. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
VELOCIOUS broke a beat slow but was quickly up on the pace to contest the early lead between horses, pulled clear heading into the turn, extended the
lead turning into the stretch and won geared down in the final yards. CANDY LITZ outrun in the early going, was put into a drive early, kept to the outside,
started to make forward progress through the turn, found clear run down the middle of the stretch and finished best to gain second. MAXWELL ST BLUES
always prominent while racing four wide, remained wide through the turn, attempted to launch a rally approaching the quarter pole, came four to five wide
into the stretch, flattened out a bit but managed to hold third. COIFFEUR got bumped by CANDYINTHEMORNING after the break, steadied, then chased
the field while saving ground through the turn, went five wide into the stretch with some momentum, altered course to the two path just past the furlong
marker and continued to improve in the final stages. IT IS WRITTEN broke on top and vied for the early lead but ceded the lead to VELOCIOUS after a
furlong, was unable to match strides when that one pulled away from the field near the quarter pole, but kept on well to mid-stretch, then tired.
CANDYINTHEMORNING broke outward and bumped COIFFEUR after the break then raced well behind the field in the early going, made a sustained run
from the three furlong marker, was still last at the top of the stretch, improved position but was much too late. C'MON LETS SWITCH was pushed to get
forward position and contested the early pace, dropped out of it after passing the three furlong marker, then was kept to task but unable to improve in the
stretch. WHISKEY OUTLAW was not involved in the early fray but raced close up in the three path, got boxed in a little heading into the turn then came
under pressure from the quarter pole and had little to offer for the stretch run. AMMARA raced close up inside, stayed close up until just past the three
furlong pole, started to drop out of it at that point and was outrun late. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive
at the most accurate time.
