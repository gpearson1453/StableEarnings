OUT RUN'M raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane. CITRUS
BAY chased the leader up the backstretch, led the way from the two path coming around the turn, dueled in the lane and chased the winner home late. MY
CRAZY NEIGHBOR raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the four path and kept on to the
finish. REEF'S DESTINY trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and showed no kick. BLUESKIESANDANGELS raced off
the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. TACTICAL ATTACK led the way up the backstretch, dropped back quickly
while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to tire from there, eased in late stretch.
