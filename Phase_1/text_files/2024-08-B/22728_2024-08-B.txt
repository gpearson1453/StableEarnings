Footnotes
CIGARS N CARS broke sharp, eased back, moved up leaving the turn, angled inward down the stretch, rallied from the inside and proved the best.
FACTOR OF TIME vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for second. SMALL TOWN
HEROINE brushed at the start, showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout and missed the place position. GIVIN OFF SPARKS lacked early speed,
showed late interest, but was no factor. CRAWFISH BURL brushed at the start, raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and faded. ARMALEESE dueled
on the front end and was finished early. HOT BLAST raced within striking distance and dropped back. DREAMCHASER JEWELS brushed at the start,
always raced near the back and showed little.

EASY ACES pressed the pace, raced close throughout, drifted in down the home stretch and drove clear before the wire. ZOSIAS SHIP broke out, went to
the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn, drifted out down the home stretch, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second.
STARTINI raced near the back in the early going, came around the first turn on the outside, moved up on the inside down the home stretch, proved no
match for the top two, but was a clear third. MONTANA'S ANGEL pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. ALESSANDE bumped at the start,
lacked early speed and was never a threat. PURSUIT L'HARMONIE showed early speed, raced outside around the final turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
ROSIE'S ANGUS unhurried in the early going, racing outside around the first turn, moved up on the inside around the final turn, checked, bobbled, getting in
tight quarters, angled out down the stretch, split rivals and was just up. BE A BANDIT sprinted to the front, drove clear, dueled to the wire and was caught
late for the win. BOSTON PAULETTE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished by the top two. NEW DESTINY broke sharply,
outward, raced within contention and was outfinished, lacked a late kick. MS. CAJUN QUEEN unhurried in the beginning, racing near the back, came
around the final turn on the inside, swung to the outside down the lane, made a mild bid, but was no factor. AKIANE'S SOLDIER lacked early speed,
finished wide and was no threat. MSCHITCHATTOUR always raced near the back and showed little. LOVERS NEVER SAY raced within contention,
dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
NODAH unhurried in the beginning, racing near the back, moved up on the outside around the turn, entered the stretch six wide, rallied and was going away
at the end. GROUND CONTROL pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. OVERCAST
broke out, raced within contention, eased back, made a wide bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. MOLTO VINO lacked early speed
and passed tired ones. A MISS DEAMEANOR had an awkward start, racing in the rear, moved up, racing within contention, faded and was no threat late.
UNDERCOVER GIRL raced within striking distance, faded and was no threat late. MADELYN'S HIT shot to the front, drove clear, saved ground and tired.
DIAMOND DEAL raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.
