Footnotes
SWINGING MANDY took command leading the field while setting a soft opening quarter into the first turn, was unchallenged while quickening the pace
along the backside, spurted away when coaxed for more at the top of the stretch and under left handed encouragement at the furlong pole found more to
comfortably hold safe at the wire. SILENT SKY had a tracking role on the rail in the early going, continued to sit behind the frontrunner down the back
straight, edged closer on the fence by the quarter pole, chased the winner in vain through the entire stretch and stubbornly held for the place share at the
finish. FORTYFIVESEVENTY settled all alone in mid-pack, was content to lope along still in midfield down the backstretch, closed the gap on the leaders
when roused with five sixteenths to go, angled out to the four path for the drive and was gaining steadily through the stretch but could not reel in the top two
at the finish line. MORAL TURPITUDE was reluctant to load before the start, broke outwards when the gates opened up to trail in the early stages, made no
headway on the final turn and found some late energy to pass a couple of runners outside in deep stretch for a minor share in the end. RETAIL THERAPIST
tracked outside into the first turn, continued to watch the loose pacesetter outside a rival down the backstretch, was roused for more at the quarter pole,
offered little response and failed to fire down the lane. DOMER ALLURE was bumped inside on the start, stalked near the rear three wide into the first turn,
shifted to the rail making little progress along the backside and had no finish to offer on the fence down the stretch.

Footnotes
THE NEW MAYBE stalked in the third flight four deep in the backstretch, moved closer to the pacesetter three wide with three furlongs left to go, took over
control outside in upper stretch, switched leads at the furlong pole to open up briefly and had enough to the wire to hold for the win. CABERNAYDO was
unhurried to trail the field in the early going, began to pass rivals three wide outside nearing the half, came under a ride in the turn just keeping pace with
others, found his best stride late in the seven path, closed in sharply late but did not have enough time to reel in the winner at the finish. REBEL FAITH
broke out, bumping the outside foe soon after the start, was under a tight hold between rivals in midfield down the backside, co-trailed on the outside with
three furlongs to run, could see the pack when angling out widest in the eight path turning for home and finished up quite strongly to close in late to capture
the show award at the wire. CONNOR was away alertly to lead the field down the backstretch, continued to set the pace but by a diminishing margin on the
turn, was collared outside by the winner at the quarter pole, fought on inside until the furlong marker but faded late to just lose out on saving the show
money. HAPPY QUAD settled just behind the frontrunner in the third tier down the backside, was encouraged left handed midway on the turn trying to keep
up with the top two runners and finished up mildly in the stretch but failed to reach contention. FRACEN MACHO settled in midfield with rivals on both sides,
was hard ridden while travelling evenly three wide around the bend and was one paced in the five path through the lane. PIN BOY was fractious prior to the
start, trailed the field at the half, made little improvement on the fence throughout the turn but could not make a presence inside runners in the stretch drive.
STRETCH PASS was under a snug hold stalking on the fence along the backside, inched closer to the leaders on the rail by the half, offered a mild run,
shifting out three wide between horses at the quarter pole to be in range for a share in upper stretch but could not sustain the rally and folded at the seventy
yard marker. HANLAN chased outside down the backstretch, was asked right-handed to keep up in midturn, had nothing more to offer by the three
sixteenths pole and backed away between runners in the three path at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
ONEJABTOOMANY tracked four deep in the beginning, prompted the pace three wide outside foes on the turn, poked his head in front at the quarter pole
and determinedly dueled in the stretch to prevail from a pesky foe at the wire. TOP OF D MOUNTAIN kept a close eye on the leader while three wide with
horses on both sides, vied for the lead in the two path around the turn, battled stubbornly inside down the lane but just could not go by the winner at the
finish line. ROSE OF SHARON was bumped inside on the start, tracked the pacesetter in the two path, part of the quartet behind the lone speed along the
backside, sat three wide behind the engaged trio around the turn and finished up willingly to close in and capture the show award in deep stretch.
WEGOTTATALK drifted out while trying to keep a straight path at the start, opened up to be loose on the lead at the half, set the pace but was hounded
outside by a couple of rivals throughout the turn, was finally collared by the quarter pole, could not go with the front duo by mid-stretch and faded on the rail
to settle for a minor role in the end. HELANA was forced out on the break, settled on the rail part of the foursome watching the loose leader down the back
straight, saved ground but was going the wrong way around the bend and could not get involved on the fence down the lane. HOODLESS broke with the
field but soon afterwards trailed the pack, made a brief move, closing the gap three wide on the outsdie through the turn, emptied out quickly by upper
stretch and galloped to the wire.

Footnotes
FORTY N FIVE broke out on the start, was content on the fence sitting behind the pacesetter down the backside, waited to move nestled on the rail in the
turn, shifted outside when asked three wide at the quarter pole and was relentless between rivals in the stretch to get up just before the wire for the score.
SPECIAL SESSION hopped slightly on the break, stalked near the rear outside foes in the beginning, started to mount a rally three wide, going around foes
at the three furlong marker, loomed boldly gathering more momentum in the five path turning for home and closed in smartly but just missed getting there at
the finish. GROOT took command from the onset, continued to dictate terms loose up front around the turn, moved well straightening out for the drive,
switched back to the wrong lead at the furlong pole and was caught in the final few strides before the wire to settle for third money in the end. NIIGON'S
LAW traded bumps with the inside foe on the break, travelled on the rail in mid-pack down the backstretch, edged closer on the fence around the turn to be
in the mix inside turning for home and finished up mildly on the inside of runners to be a fringe player when crossing the wire. SCUDERIA settled close to
the back of the pack ahead of a few runners down the backside, slipped up the fence running past rivals at the quarter pole, could not continue the
sustained run and evened out by mid-stretch. WAGSTAFF veered in on the start, tracked three wide on the outside down the backstretch, was ridden for
more while chasing the frontrunner through the turn, had little left for the drive and wilted in the three path by upper stretch. WAR WARRIOR exchanged
bumps with the outside rival on the break, settled in mid-pack on the outside down the backstretch, was roused for more in the two path between horses but
could not match strides with others midway on the turn and lacked a finishing kick in the stretch. EMPOWER was scrubbed on to stay interested when well
behind the field at the half, made no impression at the back around the bend, angled to the five path at the top of the lane and passed a couple of weary
foes in mid-stretch. ASHLEY'S ARCHER was bounced around between horses on the break, settled near the rear inside foes along the back straight, made
no progress taking the short way around through the turn and failed to menace inside foes down the lane. DOADSTER tracked three deep outside foes
along the backside, was hard ridden in the two path but was engulfed by runners on both sides that were making a move midturn, angled to the four path for
the stretch run but had little to offer for the drive.

Footnotes
DADDY HAS DIAMONDS broke outwardly, advanced outside four to five wide on the turn under stout urging by the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch, drew
clear in the final sixteenth under continued encouragement. LASTING SILENCE quickly moved clear, set the pace from off the inside, was challenged in
upper stretch, fought back then yielded grudgingly the final sixteenth. LONNY'S GAMBLE chased within range mostly two to three wide into the turn, was
ridden along about the five-sixteenths, kept on in the stretch to hold show honors. OUT N OUT DISGRACE was bumped at the start, chased from off the
inside between foes mostly in the three to four path, ran on. OK SPEEDY broke a step slowly, was urged along moving forward between foes, chased from
inside rivals just off the fence, was ridden along early, went evenly late. MAD CHATTER bumped the outer rival at the start, stalked within range three to five
wide, weakened. GEE POWER chased from inside, dropped back at the half, failed to rally. WESTMORE was ridden along early racing two to three wide,
was never a threat. WOODGLEN COURT veered out at the start, was not a factor.

Footnotes
MI CORAZON bumped lightly with a foe at the start, moved forward to mid-pack inside, tracked the leaders near the rail on the turn, rallied inside in the
stretch, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and edged clear late. ALLISTON bumped a rival lightly at the start, was forwardly-positioned pressing
briefly early up the backstretch then eased back content to stalk from outside about three wide into the turn, was encouraged late on that bend, came out six
wide for the drive, kept on in late stretch to get the place. MISS ROBERTS (GB) was bumped lightly at the start, stalked mid-pack, made a swift early move
from the five-sixteenths to take the lead in the vicinity of the quarter pole, was outkicked. GLORIANNIA settled outside at the back, came out seven wide,
was flying in the end but too late. MARIAN CROSS (GB) was quickly clear, fought the rider's restraint while headstrong early, finally settled down with the
lead later up the backstretch, was off the rail when meeting a challenger late on the turn, weakened through the stretch. FISH MOONEY exchanged a light
bump at the start, was inside at the back and never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
SEATTLE CAUSEWAY took control from the onset, was let out a notch when pressed mildly on the outside at the seven sixteenths marker, rationed out her
speed smartly to open up midway on the final bend, switched leads when set down by mid-stretch to finally repel the chasing foe and drew away decisively
in the late stages for an impressive front-end score. MAKAYLA was allowed to settle into stride, trailing the compact field in the early going, began to pass
foes on the rail at the half mile marker, continued to mount a rally when switched out to the four path to go by another rival at the furlong marker, continued
to run on and got up in the final seventy yards to best the rest at the finish line. FEW REGRETS shadowed the pacesetter on the outside into the first turn,
was content to sit just off the leader's flank in the backstretch, moved closer to the frontrunner with seven sixteenths from home, chased the winner around
the final bend, closed in briefly at the head of the lane but was quickly repelled by the furlong pole and faded a touch late losing the place share nearing the
wireHYPER AWAKENING had a tracking position outside another runner in the beginning, was content to sit outside watching the front duo down the
backstretch, could not close the gap on the lead pair throughout the final turn and faded at the furlong marker to settle for a minor placing at the wire.
FEDALINE tracked on the rail in the early stages, was roused at the seven sixteenths pole but could not keep up to others around the far turn and failed to
reach contention on the fence in the stretch running.

Footnotes
THE GREAT OZ dueled inside at the start, sat behind the pacesetter when reined back midway along the backstretch, had a quick turn of foot when shifting
outside in the four path at the quarter pole, loomed a menacing presence at the top of the lane and found another gear in the final seventy yards to go by
rivals for the win. CRUMLIN LAD had a nice set up, tracking the contested pair after the start, moved closer at the half to maintain forward position down the
backside, closed in when coaxed around the bend, had a slim advantage inside a rival straightening out for home, inched away from that foe to increase the
lead at the sixteenth pole but just could not hold off the winner who was full of run in deep stretch. INDIAN PEAK travelled between runners in mid-pack,
was checked on the backstretch at the nine sixteenths marker, re-rallied, circling three wide around horses in the turn, bid for the lead in the four path
turning for home but was outfinished in deep stretch to settle for the show award when crossing the finish line. FOREST BUZZ settled on the rail in
mid-division, saved ground but could see the field around the turn, shifted outside off a tiring foe in the three path with an eighth remaining and offered a
good late finish to only get a minor share but was not beaten all that much in the end. SOCIETY'S THUNDER was unhurried to trail outside of runners down
the backstretch, stalked outside near the rear into the turn, offered a mild run when asked five wide at the quarter pole, shifted to be in the six path for the
drive but lacked a bid running to the finish line. PRIMO TOUCH dueled outside after the start, set the pace alone up top midway on the backstretch, was
collared outside with five sixteenths to go, dug in on the fence until the top of the stretch and yielded on the rail in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RIDE FOR THE PURSE exchanged a bump at the start and was forced in bumping with another rival and getting squeezed back, moved out and forward a
bit, raced toward the rear off the rail, waited briefly near the quarter pole, angled out eight wide in upper stretch, was flying in a sustained late effort to get up
in time. MY BOY BRUCE switched out heading up the backstretch stalking the leader, advanced on that one three wide on the turn taking the lead by the
quarter pole, kicked clear by upper stretch but was outfinished. ADAPTED bumped with a rival at the start and was forced in, was thereupon put to some
urging, gained closer position into the turn three to four wide, was ridden along more from the three-eighths, moved out six wide at the top of the stretch,
kept on evenly. MOHAYMEN DIAMOND was bumped inwards after the break, chased near but off the rail, came out a bit for the drive, ran on well but
needed more. PUNKIN BOY came in at the start and was in tight quarters, was off the leaders four to five wide, went evenly. CAPTIVATING NAME broke
on top, ceded the lead stalking from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. AIM DON'T MISS chased from mid-pack inside,
faded. DARK THOUGHTS broke a bit awkwardly, went five to six wide on the turn, failed to menace. ZONE CONTROL broke inwardly but was then
encouraged forward, quickly moved to the lead and clear, set the pace from off the rail, faltered.

Footnotes
GO GIFFEN was bumped inside on the break, trailing the field down the backside, closed the gap confidently while gaining on the runners in hand through
the turn, angled out five wide in the stretch drive and flew home in the last sixteenth under right handed encouragement for the late rally win. IN AWE
travelled on the fence in midfield along the backside, tracked the engaged pair outside measuring the duo around the turn, angled out to the four path
gaining steadily on the leader in the lane, dueled for the lead with rivals on either side at the seventy yard pole could not match strides with the winner just
before the finish line. MRS. C hounded the pace outside under a snug hold, battled outside for the lead around the bend, edged clear from the early speed
foe by upper stretch for the lead but was outkicked by the top two runners on the outside nearing the wire. SILENT AND SINFUL travelled on the rail in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch, waited behind the contesting pair on the fence through the turn, shifted out three wide finding a seam between
foes in upper stretch, was in the thick of things down the lane but could not finish as quickly as the top three rivals in the final sixteenth and settled on the
fringes. QUEST TO BE PROUD had a stalking position near the rear having only the eventual winner beaten down the back straight, made little headway
while under a vigorous ride in the three path around the turn, was fanned out widest in the six path turning for home and finished up with intent late to just
miss the battle for a minor share. SAUCY NAME broke out on the start, assumed command while under a tight rein inside a runner down the backstretch,
dueled inside throughout the turn, could not go on by the furlong marker and flattened out on the fence in deep stretch.
