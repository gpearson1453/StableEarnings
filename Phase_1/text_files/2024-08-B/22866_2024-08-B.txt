Footnotes
GEOPOLITICS established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand four then three wide given a notch to work with and shaking away from
the field with five-sixteenths to run, swung five wide into upper stretch and was placed to a drive straightened away, went clear under a drive and was
geared down inside the final seventy yards to the wire to prevail comfortably on the line. EMPIRE MAGIC four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with
seven-sixteenths to go, went seven wide into upper stretch and proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. PAULAS
STAR SISTER bobbled at the break, chased four then three wide down the backstretch coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, went five wide through
the turn and then three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened while along well clear for the show honors. TIZALLMINE got bumped between foes at
the start, chased three then two wide under prolonged coaxing from the nine-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed a pair of tired rivals
to the finish. CALLING AN AUDIBLE broke out a step at the start bumping the aforementioned foe in tandem with STEAL THE RHYTHM, chased three then
two wide before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and tired in the stretch. STEAL
THE RHYTHM hard to load prior to the start requiring the rider to dismount, bobbled at the start and recovered into TIZALLMINE bumping that rival in
concert with CALLING AN AUDIBLE, tipped out directly after the start to chase five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
DONEGAL MOMENTUM bobbled awkwardly just after the start, was taken under a snug hold early then tucked in over heels nearing the first turn, rounded
that bend in the two path, was rated off the pace, shifted from the two path to the four path while roused on the far turn, rallied to make a bid at the
quarter-pole, came in two paths while taking the lead near the three-sixteenths then straightened just before brushing with the runner-up as that foe came
out some to meet him, dueled outside that foe while rubbing saddles, was bumped twice by the runner-up in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed.
GREEN LIGHT went to the front, traveled around the opening bend in the two path, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two
path on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, came out a bit under a left-handed crop near the three-sixteenths pole then brushed with the winner
while losing the lead, dueled inside of that foe while rubbing saddles, came out twice in the final sixteenth and bumped with the winner then just missed.
VESTING (IRE) was keen off heels while under restraint passing the seven-eighths pole, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced
inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, gained on the top two into the final sixteenth, altered out
behind those opponents late and was too late but clear for the show. SPIRIT PRINCE saved ground while well placed towards the front, was given his cue
on the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, chased the vanguard in the drive and lacked the needed kick. CRYSTAL QUEST was hustled from the
gate then taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, moved from the hedge to the three
path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path and failed to threaten. TIFAREEH dropped back after the start, went around the first turn in the
two path, settled off the pace, was asked while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. CINDER BLOCK
raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked near the seven-sixteenths pole, chased in the three path on the far turn
and tired. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF GREEN LIGHT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
LORD FLINTSHIRE broke out at the start bumping KEROUAC, tracked the pace along the inside and then just off the inside through the second turn before
heading back to the rail, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied and came under a left handed crop
and shied out three paths when it was applied just outside the eighth pole, dug in under a drive taking command just inside the sixteenth marker and edged
away to the finish to prevail. WRITE OFF JERRY settled along the inside in mid pack, tipped to the two path down the backstretch and came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors dueling through the final eighth with TOPIC
CHANGER to his inside to the finish. TOPIC CHANGER two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on knocking heads with the aforementioned foe through the final furlong but was ultimately just bested on the
wire for the place honors while safe for the show. KEROUAC got bumped at the start by LORD FLINTSHIRE, who broke outwards, showed the way in hand
along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive edging away to the eighth pole,
dug in under threat and was collared just inside the sixteenth marker and kept on to the end. AMERICAN GRANT struck the near side stall at the start,
saved ground at the tail of the field until tipped three wide nearing the three-eighths pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DEBATE saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch and offered no response. ADDICTED TO YOU broke out at the start brushing FRONT MAN, and then got forced to steady when pinched
out after the break, chased three tor four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick.

the initial time and through the second turn before tipping three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path inside the seven-sixteenths, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish. IMPULSIVE SPENDING coaxed from the gate,
raced three wide through the first turn and chased two to three wide early on until tucked to the rail six and a half furlongs from home, chased inside
thereafter coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and made no impact. PAYNTER'S PRODIGY broke out at the start, raced four wide through the first
turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
ARRO SMASH bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front while in the two path on the first turn then strode clear, showed the way down the
backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the far turn, was asked in the three path at the quarter-pole, switched to the proper lead when pulled in
by the rider inside the three-sixteenths pole, was headed outside the furlong marker, fought back under vigorous urging to regain the lead before the
sixteenth-pole and proved best. COSTA TERRA went around the first turn in the two path, settled under some coaxing, moved out around the five-eighths
pole, chased in the four path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, made a bid near the three-sixteenths pole, battled outside of two foes in
the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. CAN'T HUSH THIS was carried out from the five path to the six path on the turn then
dropped back to the five path, moved up and tracked the pace, chased in the three path on the far turn, gained in the four path into the stretch, made a bid
near the three-sixteenths pole, took a short lead outside the furlong marker, lost the advantage back to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was
out-kicked while well clear for the show. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER was hustled from the gate, dropped from five to three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was urged two to three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. STRAVA broke out and hit the gate then bumped with a foe, saved ground while
well placed towards the front, chased inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and came up empty. JACE'S ROAD dropped from the four
path to the two path on the first turn, settled between horses, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and had nothing left. BANISHING bore out
badly on the first turn, continued to bear out severely on the backstretch and was pulled up then transported off the track via equine ambulance.

Footnotes
PAPIAMENTO went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, saved ground while drafting behind the leader on the far turn, was
asked near the quarter-pole then shifted to the three path into the stretch, moved out in pursuit of the leader near the furlong marker, rallied to get the lead
just inside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. THUNDER ROLL was carried in at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn,
stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, took the lead in the four path into upper stretch, swapped leads back and forth
under a drive, led into the final sixteenth then was overtaken while just able to hold the place. HANDS OF TIME was taken under a tight hold early then
became rank, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved under a snug hold, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, bumped with a foe and steadied
outside the quarter-pole, was roused four wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show.
INSUBORDINATION (IRE) went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked along the rail
on the far turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. MORTAL LOCK broke a step slow then was carried
in, went three to four wide on the turns, drifted inward in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BOLT TO RUN dropped back after the start, settled
on the inside, moved up under urging midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and came up empty. DEW broke in at the start, went four
then three wide on the first turn, was rated towards the front, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, bumped with a rival outside the
quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. STRATEGIST settled towards the rear on the inside, moved to the three path late on the
far turn and was no factor. CHANTICLEER was carried in at the start then moved in early, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused
four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. ZUNIGA broke out at the start then moved in early, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
urged three then two wide on the far turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
TIP TOP THOMAS coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace of ROOKIE CARD from the outside two and then three wide, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied taking narrow command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive and
gamely fended off that rival brushing with him nearing the sixteenth pole and then had to rebuff another rival outside when between foes through the final
sixteenth to the finish. ROOKIE CARD broke in at the start taking over the space left vacated by FREAKY, cut the pace along the inside under pressure
from the aforementioned foe to the outside, took to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, got headed for the front at the three-sixteenths, dug in fighting on gamely to the finish coming out and brushing with his main rival near the
sixteenth marker and preserved the place honors on the wire by a nostril, the innermost of a trio to hit the line together. KEEWAYDIN three wide in pursuit
just off the top pair down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive rallying to latch on the top pair a sixteenth from home and just missed at the end. SOVEREIGNTY coaxed from the gate, chased three
wide under encouragement from the five-sixteenths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch, closed well to the finish to secure the last major share.
SHOT IN THE DARK broke in brushing the near side stall at the start and then bumped MIZZOU, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then
two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. C K
WONDER broke in at the start trading a bump with DISCOTHEQUE, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went six wide
into upper stretch and offered no response. MIZZOU got bumped at the start by SHOT IN THE DARK, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. FREAKY broke a beat slow and lost his lane to ROOKIE CARD and conceded four to five
lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. OUTTA
MONEY chased four to five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, gave way, and was eased home to the
finish. DISCOTHEQUE broke out at the start trading a bump with C K WONDER, chased three to four wide, grew a bit choppy gaited and was placed to a
protective hold near the seven-sixteenths and guided outside and steadily eased up before being expertly pulled up near the five-sixteenths and was
subsequently transported off the course via equine ambulance.

CLEAR CONSCIENCE was well placed just off the pace on the inside, shifted to the three path on the far turn, was asked late on that bend, gained to make
a bid in upper stretch, held a short lead into the final furlong, battled gamely with multiple foes to the finish and prevailed under strong urging.
SLAPINTHEFACE broke out and with a foe then was bumped soundly from the inside, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked near
the seven-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the far turn, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker, swapped leads back and forth while battling
for the lead, fought with multiple rivals to the finish and missed while narrowly able to get the place. RHETORICAL tossed his head while rank along the
hedge on the first turn, was reserved at the back, angled from the hedge to the five path on the far turn, rallied outside to make a bid near the furlong
marker, fought outside of multiple foes to the finish and missed while able to get the show. WILLINTORISKITALL bumped with rivals on both sides at the
start, settled in the two path, was urged along on the far turn, chased under a drive in upper stretch, made a bid between horses around the furlong marker,
battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. RABAJA dropped from the three path to the two path early on the first turn, stalked the pace
on the outside, engaged the leader in the two path on the far turn, took the advantage into upper stretch, lost the lead near the furlong marker, fought on into
the final sixteenth but was outfinished. WHISTLER'S HONOR settled on the inside, moved to the two path on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper
stretch and failed to threaten. SONIC SPEED went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn and lacked the
needed kick. YOUR MISSION went two to three wide on the turns, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MIRACLE MIKE broke
out and bumped soundly with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back on the outside, moved from the two path to the five path on the
far turn, dropped to the four path near the quarter-pole and was no factor. TETA'S TROTTER bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled to the lead,
dropped from the two path to the hedge on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead into
upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. FINAL DENILE bobbled at the start, tugged keenly on the bit under restraint into the first turn,
was rated under a tight hold along the hedge, moved forward when let out outside the five-eighths pole then came under urging, saved ground on the far
turn and had nothing left.

FAR BRIDGE established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, remained on hold safely clear until placed to light coaxing near
the three-eighths marker, took the inside route into upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in under threat to the outside and held stubbornly, rebuffing the
challenge to inch away inside the final sixteenth and prevail. MEASURED TIME (GB) tracked the pace along the inside settled in the pocket and under a
light hold using the cover of the leader, remained on hold along the inside until tipped out three wide near the three-eighths marker nudging GRAND
SONATA to the four path and into daylight, advanced at the five-sixteenths under urging into prominence and swung four then three wide straightened away
into upper stretch, rallied to offer up a bid latching on the leader a furlong out, dug in under a drive and was repelled inside the final sixteenth to the finish
while clear of the rest for the place honors. SILVER KNOTT (GB) settled tracking the leader in closest aim from the two path under a rating hold and in the
clear, remained patiently handled until called upon spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages while
preserving the show honors at the finish. PIONEERING SPIRIT saved ground at the tail of the tightly bunched field, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths
to run, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no late headway. GRAND SONATA settled tracking just off the inside behind the cover of SILVER
KNOT under a light hold until tipped three wide inside seven-sixteenths placed to urging, got nudged four wide near the three-eighths by MEASURED TIME
tipping out to his inside, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
SOCIETY switched outside the pacesetter nearing the three-quarter pole, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the three path on the turn, made a
bid outside the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, was asked in the four path into the stretch, responded well when put to a
right-handed crop at the furlong marker, had the rider put the crop away outside the sixteenth-pole and extended the advantage under a strong hand-ride to
the finish. SCYLLA settled comfortably on the outside, raced in the three path early on the turn, shifted to the four path while roused near the five-sixteenths
pole, pursued the winner in the five path into the stretch, chased that foe under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place.
VAHVA broke alertly and established a good position just off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
pursued the top two into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. POSITANO SUNSET settled off the pace, saved ground while
ridden along on the turn, came out at the quarter-pole then moved further out and lacked the needed response. SHIDABHUTI was urged along well off the
pace, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch in the five path then drifted out and was no factor. CHI TOWN LADY stumbled at the start
and was off a bit slow, settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path under urging on the turn, swung out to the six path into the stretch then drifted
out and never reached contention. MUNNYS GOLD came away in good order, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch,
vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole and faded.

MULLIKIN established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from ANGKOR to the outside through swift
splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. GUN
PILOT chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route at the quarter pole and tipped out four wide into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to clearly secure the place honors. ANGKOR pressed the pace of MULLIKIN from the outside four
then three wide coming under urging with five-sixteenths to go, tipped out five wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and weakened in the
drive. CAGLIOSTRO stumbled at the start pecking the ground for a few paws of the dirt before up-righting himself but conceded four to five lengths to the
front before doing so, chased four then three wide from the tail of the field down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. FULL SCREEN broke out at the start bumping
BABY YODA, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch.
BABY YODA got bumped at the start by FULL SCREEN, who broke outwards, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. TWISTED RIDE coaxed from the gate, chased briefly just off the inside before tipping out
five paths off the rail six and a half furlongs from home, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing with three furlongs remaining, went seven
wide into upper stretch and tired.

DOMESTIC PRODUCT settled well off the pace, moved closer while between horses late on the backstretch, was roused in the two then three path on the
turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to make a bid outside the furlong marker, gained a short lead near the sixteenth-pole, fought with the
runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. PRINCE OF MONACO bumped with a rival at the start, settled nicely off the pace, was
roused three then four wide on the turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive until just before the sixteenth-pole then was headed by the
winner, battled with that rival to the finish and just missed but earned the place. BOOK'EM DANNO was ridden along well back in the field, went around the
turn in the three then two path, gained in the four path into the stretch, moved in behind the leaders nearing the furlong marker, pursued the top two to the
finish and willingly earned the show. TIMBERLAKE bumped with rivals on both sides while bobbling at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and weakened. REYNOLDS CHANNEL was urged along towards the
rear, went around the turn in the two then three path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. WORLD RECORD was sent hard to the front then
set the pace through fast fractions, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. JEFFERSON
STREET was urged along at the rear on the outside, rounded the turn in the three then four path, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
VETTRIANO chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn and capitulated. SPEAK EASY was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground
on the turn and had nothing left. OTTO THE CONQUEROR bumped with a rival at the start, moved in while coaxed along towards the front, chased inside
on the turn and also tired. LITTLE NI was urged along on the outside, traveled around the turn in the five path, turned into the stretch in the six path and also
failed to respond.

FIERCENESS broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, raced four paths off the rail past the stands the initial time before tucking three wide through
the turn settling just off the pace but in close aim, tipped to be four wide down the backstretch and was given a nudge by the rider with half a mile to go and
advanced to stack outside the top pair nearing the five-sixteenths coming under brief coaxing at that station, seized command outside the quarter pole once
more on pause and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, got set down near the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug
in bracing for a challenge near the sixteenth marker and got one, shied out under a left handed crop two paths late and gamely held on over a late surging
rival. THORPEDO ANNA brushed the near side stall at the start, tracked the pace along the inside in close range past the stands and through the first turn,
remained inside until tipped out to the two path with six furlongs to run taking up some cover behind the leader, remained on hold just off the rail into the far
turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths angling three wide at that station to take direct aim on the front, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive rallying to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and got herded out a path late and just missed on the wire. SIERRA LEONE chased along
the inside early on and was bumped one mile from home by CORPORATE POWER when that rival came under some pressure and was bumped by
HONOR MARIE, who came in slightly from the three path, tipped two to three wide down the backstretch settled near the rear of the field, continued two to
three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and offered up a mild
kick to secure the show honors. DORNOCH forwardly placed three wide, went three wide through the first turn and down the backstretch in closest aim of
the leader, tucked to the two path half a mile from home and steadily increased the pressure on the leader getting on near even terms three furlongs from
home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BATTEN DOWN a bit fractious
in the gate prior to the start, got hustled from the gate and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under some pressure from DORNOCH to his
outside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing in tandem with DORNOCH just outside the five-sixteenths as that rival
got on near even terms, yielded the front inside that station and cut the corner into upper stretch under a drive and weakened through to the finish.
CORPORATE POWER a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke in a step at the start bumping UNMATCHED WISDOM, raced just off the inside and
was bumped by HONOR MARIE into SIERRA LEONE near the mile marker into the first turn, chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tucking
back inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. UNMATCHED WISDOM got
bumped at the start by CORPORATE POWER and then just after the start by that rival again but due to pressure from BATTEN DOWN tucking over, raced
just off the inside past the stands and through the first turn pulling a bit eager and under a hard hold with six and a half furlongs to go, tipped out three to
four wide down the backstretch, had a wrap come loose from the right hind leg with five and a half furlongs to run and and dragged that behind him three to
four wide into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. HONOR MARIE three wide through
the stretch the first turn, went three wide into the first turn but came in slightly bumping CORPORATE POWER into SIERRA LEONE, tipped four to five
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch and trailed.
