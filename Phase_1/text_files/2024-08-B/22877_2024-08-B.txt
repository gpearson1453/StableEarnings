Footnotes
LAST BABY was hustled from the break and won the race to the first turn, opened up a couple of lengths on the field heading down the backstretch,
maintained the margin through the last turn, was finishing well then began to weaken in the final yards but was able to hold off a late bid by the fast closing
CARDINAL TRICK to prevail. CARDINAL TRICK was allowed to settle from the break, settled well behind the field, began a run from just before the quarter
pole, finished well and was rapidly cutting into the margin of the winner but ran out of time. SMOKENSILVER was close up early contesting the early pace,
settled behind LAST BABY and allowed that one to dictate the pace, was pushed to keep up but unable to do so heading into the last turn, raced on the left
lead for the whole of the stretch run and was passed mid-stretch for the second spot. APLOMBADO lost the rider and ran off in the warmup, was quickly
caught and remounted, then bobbled at the start of the race and was off slowly, trailed well behind the field to the second turn, managed to rally late to
improve position but was never a threat. PRIME TIME PORTA broke best but was beaten to the first turn, held inside and tracked LAST BABY early, started
to lose ground on the backstretch run and came under a ride early, struggled to keep up and was no factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
SPORTS FOR WOMEN settled behind the runaway pacesetter for the first circuit then pulled even with a half-mile to run, took command on the backstretch
run, opened up a two length lead and maintained the margin to the finish. SASSY EINSTEIN was content to settle far behind the runaway leader racing on
the rail in tandem with CLICKING through the first half mile, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole with that rival moving as well, got the best of that
foe in the stretch but was unable to reel in the winner. CLICKING settled two wide mid-pack along with SASSY EINSTEIN through the first three furlongs,
started to move forward together with that rival near the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch run but was able to hold third. HAPPY IS lunged at the break
then was rank and got away very poorly, spotted the field several lengths head start, chased for five furlongs then got close heading down the backstretch
for the second time, kept to task and finished evenly. LILY PAD LAKE went well clear of the others for the first half mile, stayed even when SPORTS FOR
WOMEN challenged at the half-mile mark, then started to fade after passing the quarter pole and was no factor thereafter.

SPANISH CHANNEL tracked behind BLUEBERRY MUFFIN to the quarter pole, took over at that point and dueled MADAME CAUSEWAY the rest of the
trip, gained the lead inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed. MADAME CAUSEWAY tracked BLUEBERRY MUFFIN two wide in tandem with SPANISH
CHANNEL, moved with that one to take over the lead near the quarter pole as the pair pulled clear of the rest but was outfinished for the win in a good
effort. DISTINCTIVE DEB took up after the break when BLUEBERRY MUFFIN took the path, made some contact with MADAME CAUSEWAY then looked
to get over to the rail, dropped back well behind the field then launched a rally from the quarter pole, kept to the inside through the last turn and was gaining
on the top two but came up short. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke in and put DISTINCTIVE DEB in tight after the start, then set out for the lead, opened up on
the field then was overtaken passing the quarter pole and finished evenly from that point. HER PERFECT VISION reared at the start and was off poorly,
chased the field then got close on the last turn but could not sustain the bid and tired in the stretch.

TOO MUCH INFO took a bump from STRETCH RUN at the break and was slow to get going, was allowed to settle and content to race near the rear while
saving ground, was put into a drive from the three sixteenths pole, came two wide into the stretch and responded to strong handling with a big run in the
final yards to win clear. STRETCH RUN broke outward after the break and caused a traffic jam to the three adjacent starters, was sent to the front with the
rest left to sort out the mess, the got hooked into a duel with BIG BAD BRIAN heading into the first bend then soon joined by HAY JUAN to the inside, vied
between horses to the far turn, dropped a length behind at the top of the stretch and was kept to task, gained the lead at the sixteenth pole but could not
hold off the fast closing winner. HAKUNUI tracked the three contesting the early pace, made a forward move through the far turn and was finishing well up
the rail but flattened out in the late stages. HAY JUAN came away well and showed good speed to vie for the early lead with STRETCH RUN and BIG BAD
BRIAN, took a short lead approaching the top of the stretch with only the former still contending, then tired and had little response in the last sixteenth.
GENERAL THAYER was pinched back at the start and was slow to get going, regained contact with the pack before the first turn then raced between a trio
of horses well behind the other trio contesting the pace, tried to go on after passing the quarter pole but had nothing to offer and was not involved in the final
outcome. BIG BAD BRIAN hustled to the front and dueled two wide with STRETCH RUN into the first turn, raced three wide as part of the trio into the
backstretch then dropped off the pace near the quarter pole and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
MADAME GAZELLE tracked mid-pack three wide, advanced into contention down the backstretch, loomed at the top of the stretch, finished well and was
along in time. TAKES A VILLAGE stalked HYPHY two wide to the quarter pole, took command at that point, had the lead in the stretch, finished well but
could not hold off the winner in a solid effort. LILA AT THE BEACH was not involved in the early pace, saved all the ground to the last turn, went three wide,
rallied in the stretch and was gaining but lacked the winning punch. MATCHLESS raced near the rear of the field early, stayed to the inside and finished
evenly. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY bobbled and broke out at the start, spotted the field a couple of lengths head start, raced three wide throughout and was
never produced a rally. HYPHY hustled for the early lead, led the field to the quarter pole, gave way and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
DRUIDIC got bumped on both sides at the break but otherwise came away well, rushed up to the lead and was joined by HOT CHICKS ONLY, dueled into
the first bend and was left alone when that foe took a wide trip, was allowed to dictate fractions while getting some light pressure from FALSELY ACCUSED,
opened up a bit on the last turn then finished up well under steady handling and intermittent urging to hold clear. FALSELY ACCUSED took a bump from
HOT CHICKS only after the start, moved up to stalk DRUIDIC just off the pace then had to be pushed on to keep close down the backstretch the second
time, let the latter rival get first run on the last turn, chased down the stretch but could not quite get there in time in a good effort. TRINIDAD never far back,
kept to the two or three path throughout, never mounted a threat but ran evenly, holding position the entire race. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) bobbled slightly
at the start and was slow into stride, was put into a drive with a half mile to run, produced a steady, grinding rally racing two wide through the last turn,
tipped out into the three path for the stretch run but was unable crack the top three . HONOS MAN came away awkwardly from the gate and took up, was
last early by several lengths, bided time for a half-mile then was put into a drive with about three furlongs to run, finished well but had too much ground to
make up in the end. WESTERN CAPE outrun from the break and lagged through the early going, raced mostly near the rear of the field throughout and was
never a threat. HOT CHICKS ONLY broke outward and bumped FALSELY ACCUSED after the break, rushed up to grab a share of the lead then bolted on
the far turn the first time through, lost position, continued to race near the outside fence into the stretch for the first time, regained contact with the field past
the stands for the first time then went four wide through the second turn, dropped to last and was only able to pass the fading CHARMING ROY before the
finish line. CHARMING ROY raced up close through the early stages then started to back up going down the backstretch for the second time and was not a
factor thereafter.

Footnotes
HOT JOURNEY settled mid-pack, waited until the second time down the backstretch to make a move, advanced into and through the last turn, emerged
three wide into the stretch and finished best to prevail. DANZ TILL TEN was up close then went wide through the first turn, dropped to last, raced three wide
through the next turn but was able to save some ground through the final turn and rallied to get up for second. CLASSY was sent to the front and dueled
with CHELSIESDANZIGLITE through the first five furlongs, got the better of that rival approaching the quarter pole, led into the stretch but could not hold on.
LIBERTY WOLF lacked early speed, raced at the rear of the field through two turns, tried to launch a bid going into the last turn, came five or six wide into
the stretch and was able to improve. CONEJO MALO was hustled from the break and was up with the leaders then became rank and hard to place through
the first turn, appeared to settle down through the stretch for the first time and raced up close to the pace, was being ridden down the backstretch the
second time and moved inot contention before the final turn, loomed a big threat at the top of the stretch but flattened out. GATO NEGRO was slow into
stride and was last through the early going, moved to the rail when clear and was put into a drive from the three furlong marker, made some forward
progress but was unable to sustain the bid at the top of the stretch could not improve. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke well and dueled with CLASSY for five
furlongs, dropped off the pace on the last turn and hand nothing left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
BEAU BRUME stumbled badly then hit the side of the gate at the start, was held up far behind the field to allow the rider to reset his lost left iron, regained
contact with the field passing the stands for the first time racing in the two path then made a big forward move down the backstretch to gain contention,
steadied midway through the last turn, then tipped out for clear run in the stretch, had trouble changing leads and lugged in but finished the job under steady
handling and intermittent urging. CRAZY STORM broke well and was sent for the lead from the break, dueled with THIRSTY LOV through the first two turns,
put that rival away before the quarter pole, opened on the field through the turn with BEAU BRUME now in hot pursuit, battled to the sixteenth pole then
steadied late but was able to hold second. MR MAKUNOUCHI came away from the gate a bit awkwardly, settled three wide and well behind the pace, kept
to the inside and made a mild rally late. TRIANGLE came away well and was up with the leaders early, held the rail then steadied in traffic on the first turn,
raced forwardly throughout, finished well but was not quite good enough. BIG ATTITUDE lacked early speed but seemed content to settle at the rear of the
field, lost contact with the rest through the second turn was far back then mounted a furious five to six wide rally on the last turn, sustained into the stretch
and improved position while racing in the middle of the track. TOP WOLF was hustled from the gate and vied for the early lead, checked hard in traffic going
into the first turn but was able to maintain a tracking position, was alternating leads in the stretch the first time around, then had to be ridden on the
backstretch to keep pace, was unable to do so and had nothing for the stretch run. ONLY ALLEGED broke well then became hard to place heading into the
first turn, settled down passing the stands the first time while racing three wide, was under pressure to keep up approaching the three furlong marker, had a
mild response down the backstretch then did not have anything to offer in the stretch. THIRSTY LOV dueled for the lead with CRAZY STORM through two
turns, started to weaken passing the quarter pole then took up near the five sixteenths and could not recover.
