the pace inside, bid between rivals at the eighth pole and proved second best. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL led inside and yielded late. BEST CUPCAKE pressed
the pace in the four path and yielded at the eighth pole. TIMELESS ROSE settled inside and launched a belated bid between rivals. GET N TIPSY raced in
the three path with no late bid. CRICKENBERGER was unrushed inside, saved ground and improved her position late to finish on even terms with BUMBLE
OF LOVE who raced in the five path with a mild late bid. HEAVENLY RICH pressed the pace outside of the leader and gave way in the stretch. THREE
COATS saved ground. ITZFOREVER raced early in the three path, angled to the rail at the five-eighths pole but had no bid. FOREVER PINK was through
