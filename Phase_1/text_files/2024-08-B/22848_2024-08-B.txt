Footnotes
LA CREMA was void of any early speed, advanced six wide through the second turn, was gaining steadily, took control late and surged clear. HONORABLE
CHILL set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn, kept on, couldn't match strides with winner late and held for second. SISTER NELL was
taken back early, raced five wide through the second turn, was closing through the stretch, was out footed by the winner and finished a game third. BOSSY
BOOTS was reserved early, angled out to the six path in early stretch, followed winner home offering a mild late rally. CANNY LAND was unhurried early,
angled out to the seven path in early stretch, passed rivals and finished belatedly. ARROGATES DREAM followed the early pace from the inside, angled out
into the home turn and gave way. SHE'SALLATWITTER was outrun early while racing on the inside into the home turn and offered no late rally. FIRE AT
MIDNIGHT raced in mid pack early, went to the four path in the drive and gave way. TURBO MILLIE was reserved off the pace, raced between rivals and
never fired. LITTLE NUTTER stalked the early pace, saved ground and tired. ZIFFY BUG was allowed to settle early from between rivals and was no factor.
RED RIVER SUSI was taken back, raced four wide into second turn and was never a threat.

HAPPY CAT trailed the field into the far turn, picked up the tempo and shifted through traffic around the second bend, took an outside path leaving the
quarter pole, kicked into gear in upper stretch, and finished off a determined rally with the win. UNCLE TRULY tracked the pace from the three path, inched
into contention rounding the far turn, four deep and under a drive in upper stretch, battled gamely to the wire, lost the bob. GO TAKE CHARGE saved
ground around the first turn and for the run down the backside, steadied in traffic around the second bend, regained momentum in upper stretch, rallied
between runners leaving the furlong marker, then steadied once more in deep stretch. K'S PICK tracked the pace from along the inside, shifted out leaving
the three eighths marker, battled into upper stretch, and finished willingly to the wire. HIS RIGHTS slow into stride, raced four deep and mid pack to far turn,
loomed a threat nearing the quarter pole, and faded to the wire. HUSBAND MATERIAL was hard to load, chased mid pack down the backside, under a drive
leaving the three eights pole, had no late response. BROTHER SHOWTYME was slow into stride, settled in towards the rear into far turn, made a quick
sweeping move leaving the three eighths, and weakened to the wire. CODE NAME BRODY clean break, vied inside around the first turn and down the
backside, retreated quickly around the second bend. THE COLORA KID very slow start, trailed through out. MAYBE IT'S TIME sent away from the gate,
vied in the two path around the first turn and down the backside, gave way leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG DREAMER broke very sharp, took the lead into the bend, felt outside pressure leaving the quarter pole, under a drive kicked away from the rival to be
clear under the wire. WISE MISS tracked the pace from the three path, under a full head of steam engaged the front runner leaving the quarter pole, loomed
the only threat in upper stretch, was outkicked to the wire. SPENCER TIARA sent soon after the start to vie between runners into the turn, lost ground
leaving the quarter pole, racing on her left lead faded to the wire. DANCING DIANA slow into stride, chased four wide into upper stretch, had no late kick.
HONOR CAT broke a step slow, had a clean run to challenge along the inside into the turn, gave way leaving the furlong marker. STILL GAME ground
saving trip, under urging inside around the bend, never threatened to the wire.
