Footnotes
SHAMAN SEZ pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and dueled to the wire to hold the win.
HEAVENLYCONVEYANCE chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, challenged with a furlong to go
and dueled to the wire to narrowly miss. GOOD GRIEF CLAUDE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the bend from the three path
and chased on to the finish. CAT ON THE PROWL led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and faded in the
stretch. BEARS' D raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began to move up from the four path coming around the turn and flattened out in
the lane. SWEET BODEMEISTER trailed the field throughout, raced in the three path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CHASENTHEONE saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and dug in gamely
in the lane to just hold the win. FURTHER EVIDENCE raced in the middle of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, continued around the
far turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to just miss. MORE MONEY MO raced in the three path around the
first bend, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and gained ground
late from there. P R CALL ME MAYBE saved ground early, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, continued to save ground
around the far bend and kept on to the wire. PROFESSIONAL GRADE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the two path around the
first turn, stalked the leader on the outside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and weakened in the lane. LUCKY SUPER
NOVA hopped up leaving the gate and broke sideways, raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the
run up the backstretch, continued around the second turn still in the three path and made no bid. UKRAINE STRONG chased the leader on the inside
through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded in the stretch. D BUCKAROO bumped with the horses to either side at the
break, raced in the two path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, dropped back further while saving ground around the far turn and was never a factor.
