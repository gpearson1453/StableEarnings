ROCKIN BOOTS vied for the lead around the first turn, continued to duel inside of SKALKAHO into the final turn, shook clear approaching the furlong
marker, widened advantage and held late under confident handling. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL tracked the top trio into the backstretch, was ridden along
three wide around the final turn, sustained a steady three wide bid into the lane, gathered some late momentum but needed more to reach the winner.
SKALKAHO vied for the lead around the first turn and continued to battle for command around the far turn, could not move on with the eventual winner
approaching the furlong marker and weakened to show. STROLLER BOY was forwardly placed around the first turn then moved up to engage rivals
entering the backstretch, vied between then weakened off the top flight entering the final turn, saved ground turning for home and ran on evenly.

Footnotes
KANOJO sped to the lead at the start then vied inside of VICTORIAN SECRET in opening stages and continued into the turn, cleared the lead still
unleashed approaching the quarter pole, came two wide into upper stretch and remained clear under a hand ride. ESKENFORARAISE settled off the top
trio in early stages, saved ground around the turn, edged closer along the rail in upper stretch, appeared to be entering tight quarters, altered out a path,
sustained a steady bid and secured second best. MISS CONTROL FREAK tracked the top pair into the turn, hustled along three wide going by the quarter
pole, sustained a three wide bid through the lane and cleared show. TRACIANA raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, hustled along two
wide into upper stretch, angled back to the inside, edged closer then ran on evenly. VICTORIAN SECRET vied outside of KANOJO in opening stages and
continued near equal terms into the turn, could not move on with eventual winner approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SHUT UP MAN was well placed sitting just off the top pair up the backstretch, edged a bit closer late on the turn, given cue three wide upper stretch,
responded willingly and kicked clear. SMART N INTUITIVE rated off the clear to trio in the opening quarter, chased two wide around the turn, swung four
wide into upper stretch, sustained bid down the lane and captured place. SECRET BLARNEY was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground around
the turn, shifted out four wide turning for home and finished with good response. KNIGHT COMMANDER moved up the inside and took over the lead in
opening stages, set the pace and held firm around the turn, came under a ride two wide entering the upper stretch, got overtaken by the winner approaching
the furlong marker and gave way. TAP THE BRAKES raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide around the turn, came five wide into upper
stretch and failed to threaten. TIN BADGE was forwardly placed racing just behind the early leader, chased after KNIGHT COMMANDER late on the turn,
ran on into upper stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
COMFORTS JAZEL saved ground around the first turn and raced in range along the inside, picked up the pace two wide around the far turn, sustained a bid
in the three path in the stretch, found more in reserve in final stages and got up in time. I GOT A NAME held a slim lead around the first turn then set the
pace up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, saved ground turning for home, remained clear into the final furlong then got edged out in final
strides. KANTIRUN was off to a good start and raced just off the leader heading into the turn then was taken under a slight hold to settle off the early pace,
continued unhurried up the backstretch, picked up the tempo three wide late on the final turn, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and finished with
good response. SOPHIE'S STAR tracked the pace three deep in the flight sitting just off the early leader, edged closer and raced in striking distance near
the quarter pole, ran on into upper stretch then evened out late. SNUGGLE BUNNY sat back off the early pace, was ridden along three wide around the far
turn, ran on two wide in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MRS. SPEAKER was forwardly placed racing between rivals, weakened mid-way around the far
turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
I AM LOWKEY tracked the pace along the inside, waited briefly then tipped two to three wide late on the turn, took over the lead at the head of the lane and
finished going away. SANGRIA SKY was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground, cut the corner entering upper stretch, angled out a path for clear
racing room, responded under pressure and cleared second best. HOOKED ON DREAMS raced off the early pace, crept closer along the outside late on
the turn, given cue four wide entering upper stretch, ran on with response and got up late for show. MC COUGAR set a pressured pace then held clear
going by the quarter pole, got overtaken by the eventual winner at the head of the lane and steadily weakened. MADETHEDEAN'SLIST tracked the early
pace, moved up closer near the quarter pole, chased three wide to mid-stretch then flattened out. KILLIAN was not far back two to three wide mid-way
around the turn, ran on into upper stretch and failed to kick on. TAP ON BY vied for the lead up the backstretch, came up empty mid-way around the final
turn and retreated.

C'MON LUCKY stalked the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, edged closer late on the final turn, given cue entering upper stretch, took a
slim lead a furlong out and edged away. QUIET I'M NOT was unhurried and raced off the pace, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and finished with
good response. SIMMERING was forwardly placed around the first turn, tracked the pace up the backstretch, took over the lead entering the far turn, held
clear into upper stretch, got collared at the eighth pole, weakened and just lasted for show. SHEZAWILDSTORM rated off the early pace saving ground,
was ridden along two wide around the final turn and into the lane, ran on and just missed show. SHE'S SOLID SILVER rated off the top trio up the
backstretch, chased three to four wide around the far turn then gave way. ESPRIT ROUGE failed to move into contention. MY HEART'S ON FIRE sprinted
to the lead out of the gate, quickly widened to a clear advantage, got collared late backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
MILTON STREET settled through early stages then edged closer along the rail around the turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, took over the
lead in the final furlong and finished going away. MAHOMES dueled for the early lead, battled on around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, got
overtaken by the winner in the final furlong and just lasted for place. CHINLEE rated off the early pace, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, got nipped
for place and captured show by a nose. LUCKY LOUIE tracked the pace in the opening quarter, chased three to four wide around the turn, kept on in the
lane and just missed out on runner up spots. SIR ELI raced in the second flight up the backstretch, briefly gained closer contention along the inside to the
furlong marker then flattened out. SARAH'S BOY BLUE raced off the early pace, saved ground, chased along the inside into the lane and failed to threaten.
FRANKLYGREAT dueled for the lead up the backstretch and around the turn then tired in the drive.
