Footnotes
GABRIELLA ATTACK bumped with BRIANA HARPER at the start, was checked behind traffic just after entering the main track, advanced inside on the
bend, swung three wide for the stretch run and drew off the final sixteenth. STARSOVERPARADISE pressed HEAVENLY SCENT from inside, angled out
nearing the turn, rallied to gain the advantage nearing the eighth pole, was no match for GABRIELLA ATTACK the last sixteenth but prove easily second
best. BRIANA HARPER chased from outside, was just off the rail on the turn, angled out some for the drive, altered in a bit when near the loose horse
midstretch and drew away for third in the late going. SILVER EYES altered out midway on the backstretch to get clear of the loose horse, was forced to stay
wide by FERGIE ATTACK through the turn and into the lane and had no late bid. HEAVENLY SCENT broke alertly, set the pace just off the inside, moved
to the rail nearing the bend, widened her lead but gave way for the stretch run. FERGIE ATTACK was reluctant to load, unruly in the gate, swiped the gate
on her leaving and lost the rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into FERGIE ATTACK'S start but no action taken after their review.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA MOON prominent toward the outside, circled rivals when allowed four wide on the turn, drew off in the stretch, began to wear down in the late
going but dug in and held sway. AFTER MY BROTHER forwardly placed inside, tried to angle out on the turn, found himself boxed in, got through four wide
into the lane, dueled for second as he closed the gap on the leader inside the last eighth, came up short for the win but edged ahead in time for the place.
DRAMA CRITIC vied for the lead from outside, did not keep up three wide on the turn, moved ahead for second from between rivals in the stretch, fought
gamely as he also closed the gap on the leader in the late going but had to settle for easily best of the others. INSIDE THE CIRCLE contested the pace from
inside but retreated on the bend and had no significant stretch bid. MAJESTIC ATTACK made a small leap from the gate at the start, reached contention
four wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and also had no late bid. MOCOWBELL displayed early speed while in tight between rivals on the
backstretch, did not stay with MINNESOTA MOON on the turn and flattened out the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
BIKINI MARTINI in the second flight just off the rail, went for the lead two wide on the bend, moved clear inside the last furlong and held on under steady
handling. COOLTHING hesitated then was forced inward at the break, chased from off the rail, swung out widest for the stretch run, rallied, lugged in
nearing the wire but got up for second. FAITH HOPE N LOVE reluctant to load, broke on top but inward, showed the way from inside, was challenged on the
turn and slowly wore down for the drive. TRY helped prompt the early speed from outside, did not keep up four wide on the turn and leveled off through the
stretch. COALY prominent between horses, retreated three wide on the bend and failed to have a significant stretch bid. STEVE chased from midpack, had
the rail on the turn, fanned out some for the drive but had little to offer. SOMETHINTOBELIEVEN also hesitated at the break, altered in some trying to keep
a clear path and showed little in a ground-saving trip. STORMY ATTACK was hesitant as well at the start, somewhat awkward to find his stride, stayed well
off the inside and showed little.

WINGING WAYS shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead two wide on the turn, was clear entering the lane, took the rail and maintained control
under urging. ONE WAY HOME broke on top, was soon overtaken, came again three wide on the bend, also angled in some for the drive, lacked the extra
needed in the late going but moved ahead for the place. BAM BAM CAM void of speed, though hustled along, picked up his pace after a quarter mile, lost
ground widest through the turn, surged the last furlong, was too late but swept past LIMA ZULU nearing the wire to gain thirc. LIMA ZULU forwardly placed
just outside ONE WAY HOME, threatened four wide on the turn then gradually wore down between horses the final furlong. ROAD GAME well placed
inside, saved ground taking the turn, angled out four wide upper stretch and failed to have a serious bid. BOURBON DELIGHT raced in contention off the
rail on the backstretch but faded three wide on the turn. DEVIL'S RULE was a factor from inside, came off the rail some on the bend but gave way for the
drive.

Footnotes
HAND OVER MY HEART moved clear midway on the backstretch, was let out some on the bend then drew off under mild urging in stretch.
DIAMONDONICE lost ground as he advanced five wide on the turn, rallied belated the final furlong but moved clear for second the last sixteenth. RUN THE
TABLE broke on top, was soon chasing HAND OVER MY HEART from between rivals, three then four wide taking the turn and slowly wore down deep
stretch. LATE BLACKSMITH pressed the pace just outside RUN THE TABLE, angled in some nearing the quarter pole, battled to hold second in the stretch
but also did not have enough left in the late going. SPAN raced in contention from outside, progressed four wide on the bend but began to yield into the
lane. STANCE bumped hard twice with TRUIST at the start, was without early speed, three then four wide taking the turn and had no late bid. TRUIST
bumped hard twice with STANCE at the break, was an early factor but faded from inside on the bend. OSCAR NOMINEE was forwardly placed toward the
outside but gave way two wide on the turn. BEST MAN SPEECH bumped twice with GRAYHOP at the start, swung out seven wide for the stretch run and
had little to offer. GRAYHOP bumped twice with BEST MAN SPEECH at the break, stayed outside the latter and showed little.

Footnotes
E J WON THE CUP broke on top, showed the way in hand just off the rail, was let out some on the second turn, asked at the top of the lane then drew away
as much the best under mild urging. NEXT LEVEL prominent outside REAL MEN VIOLIN while in path three nearly all the way and drew off for second
inside the last furlong. REAL MEN VIOLIN well placed from inside, was no match for E J WON THE CUP when set down for the drive and wore down inside
the final eighth. CASCADE CRUISER soon trailed, saved ground, swung out leaving the second turn and only passed a tired rivals late. KING ANTHONY
faded from contention just off the inside on the backstretch and was empty for the stretch run. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GRAPHENE CASSOCK rated between horses, progressed four wide on the turn, vied for the lead in the lane, edged ahead nearing the eighth pole,
gradually lugged in but managed to hold off the late bid from SUPER SILVER. The latter was soon well back, moved out widest after the first eighth, lost
considerable ground five wide on the bend, floated out further into the stretch, lugged in some as he rallied, came up short but caught STAR OF KODIAK for
second. STAR OF KODIAK gradually angled in on the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, vied for the lead in the stretch but slowly wore down in
the late going. MODAZZLE a step slow at the break, saved ground taking the bend, started to move off the rail at the top of the lane for a clear path, altered
back to the rail when STAR OF KODIAK took his path upper stretch then came off the rail again for a clear path in the waning yards. MAPACHE G in
midpack early toward the outside, retreated two wide on the bend, angled out to path six upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late. WARNING
LABEL pressed the early speed from just outside, floated out some into the lane and gradually yielded between rivals. R H SMOAKEM displayed early
speed from inside, moved clear on the turn, floated out some leaving the bend, was challenged from both sides in the stretch and gave way the last eighth.
FEROCITY broke alertly, was soon chasing R H SMOAKEM and WARNING LABEL from outside and began fading three wide on the turn.

Footnotes
LELAND JOHN rated off the early speed, came into the lane from path four, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure but edged ahead of SPEEDY
OWENS nearing the wire. SPEEDY OWENS was hustled to a clear early lead, stayed just off the inside, was under urging again in the stretch, did not have
enough left to hold back LELAND JOHN in the late going but proved easily second best. CUTADAY chased from outside, improved position widest through
the turn, moved clear for third upper stretch and could only make up minor ground on the top pair late. HALF THE BATTLE gradually angled in on the
backstretch, was just off the rail taking the bend then improved position in the lane without threatening. CARNACK ON TOUR chased from off the rail, was
four wide on the turn, angled in some for the stretch run and flattened out. PLAY THE BLUES moved to the inside early on, angled to the outside at the top
of the lane and had little to offer. MARK'S BUDDY JACIN steadily faded from inside after three furlongs.
