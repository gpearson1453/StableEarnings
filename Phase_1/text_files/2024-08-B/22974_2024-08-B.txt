Footnotes
MAMAN JOON (IRE) broke a step slow, settled off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, commenced a
strong rally outside, charged to the front at the sixteenth marker, kicked clear under urging and coasted the final yards. BEACH BOMB (SAF) stalked two
wide, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane moving with the winner, could not go with that rival in midstretch, then closed well late to get
second. DAMASO pulled some in the early stages while setting the pace on the inside, showed the way on the backside, dueled on the far turn, shook free,
dug in and stayed on well for the show spot. CECILE stalked two wide, bid on the far turn, dueled and weakened. BLOOD ORANGE tracked on the inside,
chased on the far turn and faded. THE CLASSY ONE was outrun.

Footnotes
CRAZY FRAZY stalked three wide, bid three wide entering the far turn, took over, then hooked up with GLOBAL LEGEND, dueled with that rival into the
stretch, held a short lead passing the furlong marker, dug in gamely outside through a long stretch drive and maintained a winning edge. GLOBAL LEGEND
tracked on the inside, made a rail bid on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely inside of CRAZY FRAZY and battled determinedly in the final
sixteenth to the wire. ROXTON pulled and was steadied early, then raced off the rail, off the pace, chased three or four wide on the far turn and bested the
others. SWEET FANTASY was bumped after the start, vied two wide for the lead, dueled three wide on the far turn and tired. MAJORITY OPINION was
bumped after the start, vied inside for the lead, dueled between rivals on the far turn and gave way. TRULY LEGIT trailed on the inside and did not factor.
JOEY MUSCLES bobbled at the break, stalked two wide, chased and gave way.
