Footnotes
ONLY REPUTATION broke a step slow, settled early and moved inside, angled off the fence at the quarter pole, rallied to the front midstretch and drove
clear. NATURALLY BLONDE stalked the top pair in hand, had to take a shorter left rein when trying to get out through the turn, chased two wide into the
lane, finished well in the late stages and gained second. LOVELY IDAHO pressed the pace from outside, remained alongside through the turn, gained the
advantage in upper stretch, was overtaken in midstretch and lost second. BESSIE COLEMAN traveled near the back off the rail, went two to three wide
around the bend, steered out in the lane and offered a mild resonse. THE FENCE broke a step slow then went up to take control and set the pace under
pressure from outer rival, showed the way along the rail to the stretch, lost command approaching the eighth pole and weakened. ANNABELLE'S SMILE
broke a step slow, trailed up the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and failed to menace. CHASING KAT stalked off the rail then between rivals,
rounded the bend two wide before getting floated out with a quarter mile remaining, spun five wide into the lane and weakened. HALLELUJAH HIGH stalked
three deep to the turn, got floated out to the five path at the quarter pole, came back to the four path leaving the bend and had little left for the drive.

after the top pair in the three path early on the turn, moved into the two path then over to the rail approaching the stretch, churned on down the stretch and
lost second. PRINCESS DADDY hit the gate to break a bit slow, challenged four deep in the early going, chased after the leaders four then three wide to the
stretch and weakened. PROMISE ME KAT stumbled and broke out to bumped a rival, fought inside a trio of contenders up the backstretch, dueled inside

Footnotes
TERRY'S BOY raced in ranged between rivals, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, challenged in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole, put away
inner rivals with a sixteenth remaining and held over the late run from GIVE ME THE LUTE in the closing moments. GIVE ME THE LUTE sat off the pace
outside a rival, traveled three then two wide on the turn, came out and bumped rival entering the lane, closed well from outside but could not get by the
winner. COMMANDER (FR) settled off the pace and steered to the inside, shifted to the two path past the quarter pole, rallied between rivals in upper
stretch, bumped with HOT BOX twice near the eighth pole, kept to task to gain the show while lacking room behind TERRY'S BOY in the final strides. HOT
BOX prompted the pace from outside, fought between in upper stretch, bumped with COMMANDER (FR) twice near the eighth pole and got outfinished in
the late stages. HELLADIC coaxed to the front and showed the way early with HOT BOX alongside, roused approaching the quarter pole, led along the rail
into the lane, clung to a narrow lead at the eight pole, was overtaken shortly after and weakened late. RACHEL'S COACH stalked the leader outside a pair
of rivals, raced four deep late on the bend, got bumped outward entering the drive and could not rally. MISTER ICEMAN stalked the top pair inside a pair of
rivals, lacked room from upper to midstretch and weakened once in the clear. SANTOS TO WILSON off slow in the beginning, trailed on the inside to the
stretch and was never involved. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN TERRY'S BOY, HOT BOX AND
COMMANDER (FR). FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT HOT BOX INITIATED THE CONTACT WITH COMMANDER (FR) AND
SINCE HOT BOX FINISHED BEHIND COMMANDER (FR) THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
ANNIE'S HOPE bumped leaving the gate, stepped to the front from off the rail then moved inside, ridden along the rail into the stretch while being asked
right handed, remained unchallenged into the final sixteenth and held well over the runner-up. GIRLCANTHELPIT hesitated leaving the gate, traveled three
then two wide around the first turn, advanced between rivals then tipped four wide exiting the bend, closed well from outside in the final moments but was
too late. IN YOUR LIFE forwardly placed four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, stalked three deep in the middle stages, chased three then two
wide on the far turn, followed within striking distance through the lane, finished evenly but managed to edge PIPPA PHILIPA for the show honors. PIPPA
PHILIPA well placed near the fence through the early going, was closest in pursuit of the leader and roused at the five-sixteenths pole, put to left handed
urging in upper stretch, could not summon the needed late kick and got edged for third. STORMY GAL stumbled and broke out to bump rival, sat off the
pace on the inside, moved out in the middle stages, rounded the far turn three then four wide and lacked a rally. PANCHO BARNES bumped with outer rival
in the beginning, climbed on the first turn while moving from the four path down to the two path around the bend, roused into the far turn from inside, under a
drive entering the lane, asked left handed in upper stretch and failed to respond. ROUND IN CIRCLES hit the gate then lunged forward while bumping with
outer rival, was hard to ride trailing early, remained at the back to the far turn, came seven wide into the lane and was never involved. QUEEN BERKELEY
chased four wide early, traveled in mid-pack on the backstretch, chased four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, exited the bend three wide and weakened.
HOLLYWOOD PENNY raced up close three to four wide early, stalked to the far turn, dropped back around the bend, eased in the lane and was transported
off the track via equine ambulance.

Footnotes
BATTLE CALL showed speed inside a pair of rivals leaving the chute then cleared first time in the stretch, opened up around the clubhouse turn, padded the
lead on the backstretch, held a diminished lead still well clear through the far turn, shied a bit from right handed urging at the eight pole, drifted in past the
sixteenth pole and was kept busy to the wire to win convincingly. MEGA MOON raced up close between rivals leaving the backstretch then took a stalking
position on the inside, roused on the far turn but had to pause briefly behind a rival at the quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch and bested the rest.
YACOWLEF (IRE) settled off the rail then in the two path, remained two wide to the stretch and secure the show honors. INCREDIBLE SHOT traveled three
deep at the back leaving the chute, tracked three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, went two then three wide around the second bend, steered out
in the lane and could not get by YACOWLEF (IRE) for third. FERRARIANO prominent early outside a pair of rivals entering the stretch for the first time,
ceded command and moved inside to stalk the pace, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, roused midway around the far turn, chased between past the
eighth pole and could not rally. FLINT STROLL moved into the two path settling at the back, tipped three wide late on the far turn and failed to menace.
KIMMER tucked inside at the rear, pushed on while saving ground through the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and was never a factor. TOM AND JAZZY
pulled early racing two wide, continued to fight the rider who had to steady on the clubhouse turn, raced two wide into the lane and could not make an
impact. JOHN DUNBAR unhurried in the opening stages along the inside, continued well off the pace into the second bend and was always outrun.

Footnotes
AIR FORCE RED took control early and set the tone from inside, pressured around the far turn, cleared again in upper stretch and was kept to task. PACKS
A WAHLOP closest in pursuit a bit off the rail early, flanked the leader into the far turn, challenged around the bend, could not stayed with the winner in
upper stretch and stayed on well to secure second. CABO SPIRIT reserved in the early going and steered to the inside, moved into range, waited behind
the top pair on the far turn, roused at the top of the stretch and finished willingly for third. SUMTER tracked two wide, moved closer in the middle stages,
spun three wide into the lane and went evenly late. MI HERMANO RAMON pulled when reserved in the early going, traveled along the inside then two wide
on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and needed to find more late. ESCAPE ARTIST trailed early from inside, went outside a rival on the backstretch,
moved back inside on the far turn and was not a factor. WATSONVILLE settled in the two path, moved into range while angling out to the four path on the
far turn, drifted in midstretch and flattened out.

Footnotes
RUNAMILEINMYSHOES dueled from inside into the first turn then inched ahead around the bend, cleared outer rival on the backstretch, drew away at the
quarter pole, roused and padded the lead in upper stretch, asked left handed in the furlong grounds and held safely. STOP DIGGING stalked from the two
path in the early going, found the rail on the far turn, finished determinedly down the stretch but could only whittle the gap on the winner late. NOTHING IS
FOREVER bothered a bit by inner rival approaching the first turn, angled to the rail quickly on the bend, went between rivals then moved back inside in the
middle stages, driven two wide into the lane, moved out in the drive, summoned a mild rally and earned the show honors. MIZ CLUBCALI stalked the speed
from inside, ridden along the fence then in the two path exiting that bend and weakened down the lane. TECUMSEH CAROLINE dropped back off the pace
while angling from the five path down to the three path around the clubhouse turn, chased three then two wide on the second bend and improved position.
PROFESSORS' PRIDE dueled outside the winner into the first turn then pressed around the bend, took a stalking position on the backstretch, started to
lose ground on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. SMILING LADY tracked in the four path early, moved up close outside the top pair on the
backstretch, rounded the far turn three to four wide and weakened. DENDERA went three wide into the first turn then angled to the rail while settling off the
pace, saved ground through the far turn and failed to menace. WHIMSICAL HEIR raced in the five path entering the clubhouse turn then moved down a few
paths around the bend, traveled three deep leaving the backstretch, entered the lane four wide and came up empty. BLAZING BARDOT received a shoe
repair in the paddock, unhurried in the beginning, took the first turn four then three wide, stayed off the rail up the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane
and tired.
