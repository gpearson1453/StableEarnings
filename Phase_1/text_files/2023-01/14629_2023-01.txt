I AM FREAKY FAST was bumped repeatedly at the start, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the
fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off with complete authority. I'M NOBLE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with
good energy. SIX SHOTS OF T broke out to bump rival, opened a clear margin soon after, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the
final sixteenth. FLASHIN ACES was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached a striking position
and failed to gain late. THE RONALD was off slow, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. BURNIN VERNON lagged early,
raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GRAZE STONE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. AIR
JOCK chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE
COMING OUT AND BUMPING RIVALS OF SIX SHOTS OF T AT THE BREAK, AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED
SIX SHOTS OF T HAD CAUSED A CHAIN REACTION AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
TIM'S BUDDY tracked the pace of FIRECRACKER STAND from the inside, responded when set down for the drive and wore that rival down in the closing
yards to be going away late. FIRECRACKER STAND opened a clear lead soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, drifted out nearing
the quarter and could not match strides with the winner late. JAZZ TOWN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and
failed to gain in the drive. DIAMOND WILLOW was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. FIGHT
ME settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. D K'S CROWN showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out
into the lane and did not threaten. FOREVER GOLD was pinched back at the start, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a
bid.

Footnotes
KALINE was reserved just off the leaders early, angled out into the lane and wore down THEMANBEHINGTHEMAN in the closing yards to be going away
late. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the half, remained in control through mid-stretch and
yielded to the winner late. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. REALLY
SLOW showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and failed to gain late. NORTHERN QUEST settled off the leaders from the inside,
angled out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. LINEMANS CHECK was forwardly placed early, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-eighths
marker, steadied soon after and gave way in the drive. FINAL FINAL lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. TALKIN
MALICE raced four-wide through the first turn, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
RESPECT THE UNION broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with MAFIOSO, disposed of that rival with a furlong to run, quickly opened a clear
lead and held sway to the wire.. THE GOLDEN EGG was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, could not reach the winner in the
drive but finished well to be clearly second best. MONGOLIAN APPLE was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn, angled in with a sixteenth to
run and finished with good late energy. DEBS WILD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late
response. MISTER MAFIOSO disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. CAPIAT was off slow,
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. SMOKIN' GOOD TIME bobbled at the
start, raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. OUR BOY ROY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch and did not threaten. REIGN OF SPEED raced off the leaders throughout and gradually weakened.

BUMPY CUP sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and held off the closing ROCKED by a
diminishing margin. ROCKED was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, rallied late and just missed. RAVINA LANE was
void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. BALI STAR was forwardly placed early, moved
five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. TRUTH TO POWER showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated
bid. MUSICAL GEM was never far back while racing along the inside, angled out into the stretch and weakened. FULL OF LIFE chased the leaders while
racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. KOVACS lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. TRIBUTE TO
