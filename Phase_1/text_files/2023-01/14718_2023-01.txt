CARIBBEAN BREEZE five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the duel, tucked three wide into the turn advancing to issue a challenge
midway on that bend, knocked heads with BERNT AGAIN from the five-sixteenths and spun three wide for home, dueled through the stretch to the finish in
game fashion and just got a nostril on the wire over her main rival. BERNT AGAIN coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with DASHING DELLA to
her outside, tucked inside through the turn and was in the midst of shaking off her main pace rival when put to coaxing at the three-eighths when confronted
by the top one, dueled once more, now with a new rival and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads through the stretch to the
finish gamely clinging to the front but was ultimately bested in the very last bob on the line. FOLLOW THE FED three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. DASHING DELLA coaxed from the start, dueled from the four path down the backstretch
with BERNT AGAIN to her inside, tucked to the two path into the turn and came under coaxing three furlongs out when being shaken off by the top one,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and faltered in the drive. NEVER PERSONAL four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path through the turn under urging from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home, made no impact, then was reported to
have bled. FRANKIE KNOWS BEST chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, trailed.

AWESOME NATIVE four then three wide in pursuit, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths and went clear in
hand to the finish to prevail. JOEY LOOSE LIPS got bumped at the start by FORTY TWO ACE and in turn bumped ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY, chased two to
three wide until tucked inside through the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors while never threatening the
winner. FORTY TWO ACE broke out at the start bumping JOEY LOOSE LIPS into ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY, came under coaxing and prompted the leader
from the outside three wide before advancing tucked to the two path through the turn to duel with that rival, took over narrow and brief command spinning
four then three wide into upper stretch, got overhauled with three-sixteenths to go and weakened in the late stages. MAJOR SPIN coaxed from the start,
showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and had that rival
advance, got engaged in head to head combat through the turn yielding the front nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired. BUSTIN THE RULES chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ITSALITTLEBITFUNNY got bumped at the start by JOEY LOOSE LIPS due to pressure
from FORTY TWO ACE, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, angled six to seven wide for home and was
eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
HENRYTHETHIRD traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, drafted in the two path around the far turn, dropped to the rail while
asked outside the quarter-pole, rallied inside to make a bid coming to the furlong marker, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, fought inside of
the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. REGALITY stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, was asked leaving the
backstretch, took the lead while roused for more at the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the
sixteenth-pole, fought on with that foe to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. DONTBELATE went to the front, showed the way in the two path,
was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the lead to the runner-up at the five-sixteenths, fought under a drive into the final furlong then weakened but held
the show. JADE'S DREAM tracked the pace on the outside in the four path, was given his cue on the far turn, chased outside into the the final furlong and
tired. ALITE was rated inside around the first turn then well placed down the backstretch, dropped back under urging while saving ground on the far turn,
moved to the two path late on that bend and had nothing left. VOLIERO stumbled badly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, quickly
angled out, went five wide on both turns, spun six wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CLUBHOUSE coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that rival to poke a head in front at the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home shaking away, went clear under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish, the outcome in no doubt.
POWER IN NUMBERS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path put to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four
wide into upper stretch, proved no match and ran on to chase the winner home while along clear for the place honors. RIDE UP chased along the inside
down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and improved position to secure
the show honors. MY IMAGINATION coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. MARTY'S MAGIC chased four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, tired. VENGE chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled
four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. SWAY'SINMYDNA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighth, angled five wide into upper
stretch, tired. GOLDEN BIRD FOREST coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under pressure and was placed to coaxing
when displaced from command at the three-eighths narrowly by the eventual winner, tipped two to three wide for home in retreat and folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN MISCHIEF broke very alertly then showed the way early, lost the lead inside the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path around the turn, took
the advantage in upper stretch then dropped in some while kicking clear and powered away under steady urging to prove much the best in a nice debut.
SWEET LIBERTY was rated just off the pace, chased in the two path after being let out near the seven-sixteenths, pursued the leader into upper stretch and
proved no match while able to get the place. WEEKEND RAGS bumped soundly with a rival at the start, showed good speed, took the lead inside the
nine-sixteenths, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and weakened while well clear for the show. MY ANGEL bumped
soundly with an opponent at the start, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. DEBBIE DARLING was urged
along on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn and tired. SPERSS lunged inward at the start and was off last but one, raced off the pace under
urging, traveled around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch then angled out and was no factor. PINSTRIPEPIZZO chased the pace on
the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. BUSTINROXY was off slow
then sent hard, steadied briefly outside the five-eighths, raced towards the rear under urging, saved ground on the turn and fatlered.

JAKE ROCKS three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
steadily gaining on the leader to take command seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish to score. IKIGAI showed the way in hand just off
the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, kicked clear to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught
seventy yards from the finish while clear of the rest for the place honors. UPPER LEVEL chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. BLINDING LIGHT chased along the inside under a ride
from three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. CLASH A. J. three then two wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. LORD GATLING four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along

the seven-sixteenths, swung six to seven wide for home and made no impact.

OCCULT bumped with a rival just after the start then was hustled, moved from the two to three path early on the first turn, tracked outside down the
backstretch, was asked in the three path on the far turn, gained the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and proved much
the best under steady urging. GAMBLING GIRL bumped with a rival just after the break, settled in the two path, was asked late on the far turn, shifted four
wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no threat to the winner. AFFIRMATIVE LADY went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on
the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased four wide around the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. SWEETEST PRINCESS
was hustled to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead coming to the quarter-pole and gave way. ANISTON
dropped well behind early, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear and was eased in the stretch but walked off.
