Footnotes
FIRE KING went to the front, was well rated while setting a moderate pace, dictated terms while inside to the two path around the turn, responded well when
set down into upper stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. TWO CHUCKLES broke in and brushed with a foe, settled on the outside,
chased four then three wide around the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and was second best. CONNECT THE BROCKS veered in at the start, was
taken under a tight hold early then settled, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, dropped back while inside under urging early on the turn then moved to
the two to three path, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out around the three-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead in the drive and secured
the show. LAUREL VALLEY was rated just off the pace, dropped back in the two path around the turn and came up empty. CAMPBELITO lost his footing at
the start and was off slow, dropped well behind under urging, went around the turn in the three path and was no factor. SOMAMA BEACH was brushed by a
rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside under a very tight hold, was let out late on the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
HANG TIGHT settled on the inside, moved closer outside the five-eighths, chased inside early on the far turn, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths,
gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole, fought with the runner-up to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT was hustled from
the gate, went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace, moved closer outside the five-eighths, chased three then four wide on the far turn,
made a bid at the quarter-pole, dueled with the winner to the wire and missed while able to get the place. STRONG LIGHT broke out and was last to
commence, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the far turn, chased the leading duo outside in the
stretch, gained into the final sixteenth but missed while clear for the show. MAILMAN'S A FLYER had a shoe repaired in the paddock then had his saddle
adjusted behind the gate, went two to three wide around the first turn, settled off the pace, came under intermittent urging late on the backstretch, fell to the
rear while moving from the two path to the rail around the far turn and lacked the needed response. KONG LOVES A FIGHT dropped from the two path to
near the rail under restraint around the opening bend, was reserved off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths, was roused while three then two wide on
the final turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MOONSHININGBRIGHT was hustled to the front, showed the way in the two
path with a clear advantage, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way.

OUR SON JAKE pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead leaving the backstretch, shook clear in the two path around the turn, cruised into upper
stretch under his own power, responded well when asked near the furlong marker, came under a right-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole and
maintained a safe advantage. MAKART settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path around the turn, remained on his
inside lead in the stretch and secured the place. TYRANNOSAURUS REX was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, moved from three to
five wide around the turn and came up empty while best of the rest. BRENNAN'S WAR moved out then settled on the outside, was urged along late on the
backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and tired. DEVIL'S EDGE set the pace under pressure to his outside, lost the lead while inside into the turn
and faded.

HYDRA settled off the pace, drafted three wide around the turn, turned into the stretch behind foes, altered to the five path at the three-sixteenths, rallied
into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong urging. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE broke a half-step slow

horses coming to the quarter-pole, altered to the six path at the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid alongside the
winner into the final sixteenth but missed while able to get the place. BABA was away alertly then guided in while in front, showed the way down the
backstretch, was asked in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken
while clear for the show. GAME THEORY lost her footing slightly at the start, moved up then pressed the pace between horses, vied in the three path
around the turn and tired. BLUE PAYNT was hustled from the gate, moved up to press the pace on the outside, vied four wide on the turn and weakened.

WARRIORS REVENGE broke in then was hustled, had the rider lose his left iron briefly before reaching down to regain footing, pressed the pace on the
outside then in the three path around the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging.
WRITER'S REGRET broke in at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide around the turn and narrowly earned the place while no match
for the winner. ZIRCON was sent hard to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened then lost the place while able to hold the show. UNO was urged along off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND broke out and hit the gate, settled off the pace, was urged four then five wide on the
turn and lacked the needed response. SAFALOW'S MISSION was hustled from the gate but lacked speed, angled in near the five-eighths, saved ground
around the turn, came out into the stretch, moved further out around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. DEE BO broke awkwardly and was off a bit
slow, settled off the pace, dropped back three wide on the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
WUDDA U THINK NOW was hustled from the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well under
pressure while off the rail in the stretch and held gamely under strong urging. MARKET ALERT was reluctant to load, pressed the pace on the outside, drew
even leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the stretch and narrowly earned the place. BANKIT
tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, made an outside bid in upper stretch, battled outside the top two in the final furlong and just
missed the place while clear for the show. MY BOY TATE settled under some urging, was roused in the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch
and lacked the needed response. REGGAE MUSIC MAN broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, was off a step slow,
was urged along at the rear, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
CHEEKY TICO broke in and hit gate, was well placed in third position, went three wide on the turn, was roused coming to the five-sixteenths, rallied four
wide into the stretch, closed well to take the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. DADS GOOD RUNNER was forced in at
the start, pressed the pace on the outside, was urged along in the two path around the turn, gained the lead outside the furlong marker, fought with NAKED
AND FAMOUS in upper stretch, bumped with that foe near the furlong marker, fought with the winner into the final sixteenth and missed while clear for the
place. NAKED AND FAMOUS was hustled from the gate, set the pace under pressure, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole,
fought on in upper stretch, bumped with a rival nearing the eighth-pole and weakened but held the show. PAPI ON ICE bumped with a rival shortly after the
start, was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and gained ground but failed to impact.
DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, came out at the quarter-pole and
failed to rally. GOLDEN PURCHASE bumped with a rival just after the start, was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch, raced between foes into the final furlong and failed to threaten.
