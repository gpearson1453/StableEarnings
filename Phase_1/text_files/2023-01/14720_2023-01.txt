Footnotes
ASHLEY'S GIRL went to the front to lead throughout, edged away at the three eighths pole and drew clear proving much the best. BABY LOCKOUT broke
in at the start then settled in the middle of the pack racing three to four wide and was no match for the winner. TENPINS TEMPEST was off a step slow then
raced in the middle of the pack between rivals, made a bid on the final turn but didn't gain on the winner. MAYWON pressed the pace from the two path to
the three eighths and weakened. JIVIN ASTRO was in the middle of the pack and not a factor. LUCKY CAJUN was five wide into the first turn then raced
back around the final turn went five to six wide into upper stretch but was never a threat. MUCHO MACHO BABY was unsettled in the gate then tracked the
leaders around the first turn then challenged the leaders at the seven sixteenths pole and stopped.

BAYOU BEAUX chased the leader early then engaged leader at the quarter pole to duel into deep stretch and cleared late. MAD GOLD broke out and
bumped FULL POWER at the start, saved ground around the turn then drifted out and was up late for the place. TARGET PRACTICE broke out at the start
then raced in the middle of the pack and got up for the show. JUSTIN SPEIGHT shot to a clear lead, was headed at the quarter pole then dueled to the
sixteenths pole and tired. FULL POWER raced near the back early then moved up from three wide at the three eighths pole then slipped through on the rail
in upper stretch to rally but was no enough. SILKY'S DANCE broke in and bumped FULL POWER at the start then tracked the leaders from the two path but
had no response in the drive. WYMAN was always back. CLERIC had no speed and was outrun.

ANOTHER HOT MESS was placed off the pace in the two path to the final turn then was asked at the three sixteenths and slipped through on the rail and
drew off. CYBER SNEAKER pressed the early pace then dueled to the quarter pole and edged away, floated out into the stretch and held second.
ABSOLUTELY saved ground while racing near the back followed the winner into the stretch and just missed the place. GIMME CANDY was fractious in the
gate then was move up to be in contention around the first turn, moved out to four wide in upper stretch but couldn't gain on leaders. BROKEN PROPOSAL
was forwardly placed in the two path to the half pole and dropped back. BURNING DESIRE went to an early pressured lead from the two path then dueled

at the five sixteenths pole to take the lead at the quarter pole and fought gamely for the place. ZEATRICAL stalked the pace from the three path moved out
