MONEYFORNOTHING stalked the dueling pair along the inside down the backstretch around the far turn, swung out four wide into the upper stretch and
finished well to just get up under strong handling. WESRIGHT dueled for the early lead while racing from the outside of Danny's Winkster and kept on
gamely to the wire to just miss. DANNY'S WINKSTER dueled for the early inside of rival and gave way grudgingly late. TIZNOW TIME dropped back to race
off the early pace, raced three wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. SUPER DREAMER settled to the back of the pack early, saved ground and never
threatened.

JEFFERSON SECURITY pressed the early pace from the outside of foe and finished well to edge clear late under strong pressure. BOO TOO vied for the
early lead from the inside of foe, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. MONKEY WRENCH chased the early pace, raced
five wide into the upper stretch and made a late gain. ALLEGHENY HERO raced off the early pace setters, was near the inside around the far turn, angled
out to race four to five deep and raced evenly with no closing run. CHARTERED COURSE was void of early speed, raced five to six wide into the upper lane
and lacked a bid. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE raced two to three wide around the far turn and never was a factor. SWEET T chased the pace from the inside and
faded.

RAISE A SPEIGHTS pressed the pace from the outside of foe, took command into the far turn and was well clear while being kept to pressure in the drive.
AUTS REVOLUTION showed good early foot from the inside and was no match for the winner. CHARITABLE VISIT stalked the early pace setters, raced
three wide in the drive and kept on to the wire. ROYAL CRUSADER settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and raced evenly
with no rally. MINE TO HOLD settled off the early pace, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. UNCLE JEROME was off slowly, saved ground and never
threatened. THE IRON BANK dropped back early and failed to respond. RESPECT FOR ALL stalked the pace along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
VEGAS PRINCESS showed good early speed to set the early pace and held safe to prove best under steady handling. IMINCHARGENOW chased the
early pace, raced two to three deep in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. SWISS HORIZON raced mid pack early on, made a four to five wide
bid and kept on to the wire. BANK CARD raced off the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn, swung six wide into the upper stretch and made
a good late bid. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE dropped back early, raced near the inside around the far turn, shifted four wide and raced evenly with no closing
run. LAURA'S GRAND stalked the pace, raced four to five wide and had no late gain. WEAVINYOUINTHEDUST hustled along, raced five deep in the lane
and lacked a bid. LITTLE O LITTLE E hustled to lay up close and faded along the inside. GATTOLOTTASPARKLE saved ground and never threatened.
KNOBIESMAGICSONDE stumbled at the break and unseated his jockey. HALF-MILE FRACTION PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.
