outkicked to the wire. IN LIEU between horses to quarter pole, rallied four wide in the drive for show. FRADY chased leader to turn, bid late stretch, bumped
and weakened late. YES POINT inside chase to turn, flattened out in the stretch run. LET IT RIDE CLYDE failed to menace. INVASIVE raced evenly along
throughout with no late response in the stretch run. LEESBURG broke slow, never menaced thereafter. CRACK THE MOON quick to the front outside
bumped into stretch, fading late going. ROYALLY BITTER unruly behind gate with an awkward start, always outrun. NEOKING antsy in the gate, never a
factor. LOOKIN' AT TURK had a terrible start with no chance thereafter.
