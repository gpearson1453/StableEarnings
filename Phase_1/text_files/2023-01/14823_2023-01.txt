Footnotes
GOLDEN SUN DROPS pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command inside the eighth pole and held off the closing HIGH GUNNER
to prevail. HIGH GUNNER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn but could not get by the winner late. KNIGHT EYES
broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with I'LL TAKE THE SOUP, vied with that rival into mid-stretch and gave way. I'LL TAKE THE SOUP was
away in good order to dispute the pace with KNIGHT EYES while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. FIRST POINT settled off the
leaders early, angled out nearing the quarter, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. GOLDEN HALO was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not menace. KEEPMEINPOWER lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE BIG CAKE was void of
early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. TIMES PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

MR. WHO sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his advantage into the lane and held safely to the wire. FAMILY BIZ lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. BLAME IT ON KITTY settled off the
leaders from the inside, moved up for a contending position but failed to gain in the drive. CATS TOUCH raced off the pacesetters early from between foes,
moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. STALKING SHADOW chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going
three-quarters. BLUE AZUL chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gave way through the final furlong. NEW EAGLE showed brief speed and

Footnotes
SHORT RIB was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. MARK
YE WELL lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled in with a sixteenth to run and rallied late. FAMOUS ROCK STAR was away in good
order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by RINGS OF SATURN nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a
clear lead with a furlong to run but could not hold off the winner late. ETU BABOU settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished
with good late interest. RINGS OF SATURN broke sharply to press the pace of FAMOUS ROCK STAR from the inside, moved up to engage that foe
nearing the three-eighths marker and gave way through the final furlong. GLENROY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not
a factor. ALPINE HYPNOSIS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. GOLDEN COWBOY showed brief speed and
weakened. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
MYOPIC was away alertly then hustled along to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged with a furlong to run but T BONES TRICK and drew
clear of that rival through the closing yards. T BONES TRICK tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run but could not
match strides with the winner late. BAROSSA lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and failed to
gain late. FALSELY ACCUSED pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. EL NOBLE raced four-wide through both turns,
showed no early speed, angled out nearing the quarter and was not a factor. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
AMAAZA sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. TOTHEMOONANDBACK
chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to gain on the winner in the drive. BEAU ROCKS was void of early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. MEAN SHARON settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn and failed to gain late. ORATORY GLORY showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the
stretch and finished with a belated bid. TIZ TENACIOUS raced off the pacesetters throughout and gradually gave way. CHICKS DIG MUNNY was void of
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. MY EXPRESSION lacked early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. MOUNTAIN PASS chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. TIMES CHANGED

through the turn and finished evenly. KOVACS pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to take a brief lead nearing the quarter and gave way through

through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was not urged late. DOUBLE THE GOLD pressed the pace while racing five-wide and weakened after
