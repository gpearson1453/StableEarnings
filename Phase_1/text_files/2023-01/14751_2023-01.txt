Footnotes
SUNNY SAN LEON was allowed to settled inside on the backstretch then rallied and was three wide in upper stretch, closed willingly to be best in the end.
TRIPLE L'S CUTTER pressed the pace while two wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn to take command, was in a long drive but could not last in
late stretch. NICE NEIGHBOR broke slowly from the gate then was settled, started a run into the far turn and swung out to be five wide in upper stretch and
closed willing in the stretch. RAISE THE PRAISE was allowed to settled while two wide on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn but was no
menace. ARTISTIC VISION set a pressured pace from the inside, was in a long drive then faltered in the stretch drive. RUBMEFORLUCK raced four wide
on the backstretch, was used up then gave way. LUCKY DEPUTY was well placed while three wide on the backstretch, was used up and gave way.
