Footnotes
SHOCKING GREY stumbled leaving the gate, settled in the three path early, ranged up four deep on the far turn, took over in upper stretch and drew clear
under hand urging. SMART MONIQUE was off a bit slow in the beginning, stalked three wide early, challenged three deep on the far turn and into the
stretch, fought with SHOCKING GREY in upper stretch but was outkicked in the final furlong while finishing determinedly for a clear second. TIZ MY
PRINCESS broke a step slow, moved to the inside then off the rail around the first turn, angled four wide into the stretch and rallied to best the rest.
ELEGANCE CODE was off a bit slow to begin, got put in tight between rivals early, tracked in the two path then went between rivals, moved out in the lane
and kept on for a minor award. OAT MILK LATTE rated in the two path outside the speed in the early going, bid between foes on the far turn, fought to
upper stretch then weakened. BLURSDAY stepped to the front from inside, showed the way to the far turn, vied with a trio of rivals on the far turn and into
the lane, lost command in upper stretch, drifted in midstretch and weakened. AMERICAN CONQUEST was off slow and lost his path at the start, trailed on
the inside into the lane, moved out but found traffic in upper stretch, altered in at the eighth pole but only found more traffic late and never could make a run.
CANDY ON TOP stalked the pace on the inside, waited behind the leader on the far turn, remained inside to the stretch and never found room behind a
weakening BLURSDAY. TAPIT ROCKS broke out a bit, started to pull and became rank into the first turn, continued to tug around the bend, settled inside
on the backstretch, tipped out in the lane but lacked room and was forced to check hard late.

Footnotes
BRUTTO sped to the front and moved inside, set the pace under pressure into the turn, held a short lead around the bend and into the stretch, maintained
command over FIREMAN DAN through the drive and was all out to prevail. FIREMAN DAN chased between rivals then went up to press BRUTTO from
outside on the backstretch, stayed alongside through the turn, kept the pressure on through the stretch run but could not find the needed late kick to get by
in the final sixteenth. NOLO CONTESTO stalked the top pair on the inside to the stretch, stayed along the fence in the drive and finished evenly in the late
stages. SEATTLE BREAKOUT tracked the speed four wide into the turn, exited the bend three wide and failed to rally in the lane. BIG SPLASH climbed a
bit early and dropped back, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. DERBY STORM raced outside a rival at the back into
the turn, spun three wide into the lane and could not make an impact. WINK AND A DREAM stalked three deep early then outside a rival, coaxed along into
the turn, angled inward around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
KATONAH brushed the gate, stalked the speed from outside, asked right handed nearing the quarter pole and ranged up four deep into the stretch, reached
the front midstretch and held over DISTORTED MATH in the closing moments. DISTORTED MATH brushed lightly leaving the gate, showed speed three
deep but was keen early when ceding command, chased three wide into the turn, bid three deep around the bend, took over leaving the turn, lost command
midstretch but fought back gamely to the wire and missed. EL POTENTE vied for the lead from inside, inched ahead early on the turn, lost command while
two wide into the stretch, stayed on to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. FAMOUS STAR vied between foes for command, got crowded a bit and suffered
a mild shuffle near the seven-sixteenths pole, angled to the inside and commenced a rail bid around the bend, fought to midstretch then flattened in the late
stages. TENTH STREET DON was off slow, brushed and lost his path at the start, lagged behind up the backstretch, traveled near the inside into the turn,
moved out and raced three wide into the lane and failed to menace. HYDRO FROST broke inward, vied four deep early then dueled outside EL POTENTE
into the turn, dropped back to last around the bend, tired and eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MY SUMMER DREAM got crowded between rivals early, stalked off the rail then angled to the inside, saved ground through the turn, tipped outside the
leader at the top of the stretch, took over outside the eighth pole and kicked clear under a tap of right handed urging and strong handling. COMMANDER
(FR) shifted out and bumped rival at the start, settled off the pace, traveled along the rail moved to the two path on the turn, had to wait behind rivals leaving
the bend, steered down to the inside then back out in upper stretch, finished well to gain second but could not threaten the winner. MANITOWISH sent early
and vied between rivals for command then chased the leader leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide, brushed with outer rival in upper stretch
and finished willingly for the show honors. MESUT got bumped back at the start, raced along the rail into the turn at the back of the field, saved ground to
the stretch, then moved off the fence and finished with a mild rally to round out the superfecta. KANDEREL sat off the pace early on, entered the turn along
the rail, eased out three wide around the bend, found traffic behind rivals in upper stretch, then moved to a clear path and went between foes to improve
position. REBEL POSSE chased four wide into the turn, moved out widest in the lane and lacked further response. MONGOLIAN MEMORY vied for the
lead three deep then chased the speed leaving the backstretch, continued in the three path outside foes around the bend, brushed with inner rival in upper
stretch and flattened out. GIVE ME THE LUTE sent for the lead and vied with rivals from inside, took control and showed the way into and around the turn,
lost command near the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong. HEMBREE broke in and brushed rival, raced outside a rival at the back of the pack,
traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch, moved out and never made an impact. RACE ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED, TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
BIG SHAMROCK bobbled leaving the gate but recovered quickly, went up to press the pace inside a pair of rivals, dueled into and around the turn, fought
with FEELING GRAZEFUL to upper stretch, then shook free with a furlong left to run and drew off. FEELING GRAZEFUL set the pace between rivals early,
dueled with BIG SHAMROCK into and around the bend, lost contact with a furlong left to run but stayed on for a clear second. SHANGHAI SUNRISE threw
his head and off slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and outfinished ROSE HARBOR for the show. ROSE HARBOR
broke a few lengths slow, moved into range while steering to the inside, chased two wide into the drive, flattened in the furlong grounds and lost the show.
VEGAN stalked off the rail early, between rivals on the turn then three wide into the stretch and weakened. QUEEN MOLOTOV bobbled a bit leaving the
gate, went up to press the pace three deep, dropped back around the bend, came four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
STELLA NOIR chased on the inside into and around the bend, angled out in the lane, reeled in the leader past the sixteenth pole and drove past. XMAS
SURPRISE chased two wide off the pace, angled out crossing over the dirt, closed well through the lane and earned the place honors. SECRETS TOLD
closest in pursuit from inside, eased off the rail around the turn and took aim three wide into the stretch, gained command and clear into the final furlong but
was overtaken by the top pair late. FOUNDER'S DAY dropped back early, raced three deep into the turn, four wide crossing the dirt, angled inward in the
lane and showed a mild rally for a minor award. PHENOM showed early speed then ceded command, stalked in the two path, moved out leaving the bend
and lacked a late bid. GOLD FOR KITTEN bumped leaving the gate, raced two wide between rivals into the turn, trailed into the stretch and failed to
menace. ANGELCENTS bumped leaving the gate, sped clear early, showed the way two wide down the hill, lost command in upper stretch and weakened.
AQUA SEAFORM SHAME settled on the inside early, came two wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
IRISH WAHINE broke a step slow, settled along the fence at the back, passed rivals on the turn then angled out around the bend, drew alongside the top
pair with a furlong left to run and proved best in the end. GLORIOUS SPRING settled off the pace, closed in around the turn and ran up into a tight spot
exiting the bend, tipped out and split foes at the top of the lane to take control but got outkicked by IRISH WAHINE in the final sixteenth. STARSHIP
DEFIANT sent early while drifting out, ceded control to GIANNA'S WILD CAT and was closest in pursuit to the turn, bid three deep at the top of the lane but
flattened in deep stretch. VELLA bothered in the early stages, raced three deep near the back, angled in on the turn and never threatened. ROMAN
EMPRESS had her path taken early, raced at the back early on, traveled two to three wide around the bend and failed to menace. GIANNA'S WILD CAT
sent for the lead from outside, cleared STARSHIP DEFIANT and opened up a comfortable lead, showed the way along the inside through the turn and into
the stretch, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CONSTERNATION (IRE) got floated out six wide on the first turn, tugged forward while angling to the three path, raced outside the top pair then dueled for
command up the backstretch, battled through the far turn, fought head to head down the stretch and dug in late inch ahead from BALI DANCER. BALI
DANCER sped to the front and moved inside, vied with rivals then dueled up the backstretch, fought through the far turn and into the stretch, battled down
the lane and yielded grudgingly late. ICE QUEEN came in and bumped rival early, raced up close outside the leader then between foes into the backstretch,
chased the top pair past the half-mile pole, between foes on the far turn, tipped three wide into the lane and finished willingly for the show. WITCH MOON
checked while rank along the inside early, trailed along the inside, stayed along the fence in the drive and summoned a mild rally. CHEERFUL CHARM was
taken back early, steadied and drifted a bit on the first turn, went three deep into the backstretch, traveled in mid-pack entering the far turn, spun four wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. A CROWN FOR KITTEN pulled along the inside early, coaxed along on the backstretch, had to pause near the
seven-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide into the lane, checked between rivals at the eighth pole and could not threaten after. SWEET HEIDELBERG
stumbled leaving the gate, pulled early and drifted into the first turn, stalked from inside, was driven along the rail into the stretch, moved out in the drive and
flattened out. DOLLY MAY (IRE) bumped with inner rival early, got floated out into the first turn, moved into the three path and bumped inner rival, stalked
three deep in the middle stages, asked around the far turn and weakened down the lane. BEACHGRASS bumped leaving the gate, got floated out on the
first turn, went four deep then five wide on the far turn and was not a factor. NOBLE HEARTED bumped leaving the gate then again with outer rival early,
chased been then was forced to steady two times on the clubhouse turn, got boxed in three deep on the second bend, spun three wide into the lane, moved
out in the drive but lacked room in deep stretch. LIZY D bumped leaving the gate, lost her path and steadied into the first turn while floated out, got bumped
from outside around that bend, tracked between to the stretch and faded.
