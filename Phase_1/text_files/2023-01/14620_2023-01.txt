Footnotes
METAROSE was away in good order to press the pace o NO PEOPLE while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore down
FEARLESS FACTOR in the closing yards to be clear late. FEARLESS FACTOR pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
three-eighths marker, opened a clear lead into the stretch and gave way to the winner late. NO PEOPLE set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and
gave way to FEARLESS FACTOR after going six furlongs. JAZZY EINSTEIN was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and was not a factor. WORKIN NINETOFIVE raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second
turn and failed to offer a bid. LOVE YA MOST raced four-wide through both turns, lacked early speed and did not reach contention.

late. WILD ARCH was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. LARIMAR settled off the leaders early, moved

going a half. LUTES LIL GIFT was off a step slow, raced off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. RED VENUS lagged early, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. APPRECIABLE pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
KEBA LUCKY DAY tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. SOLA sprinted clear at once,
raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control into the stretch and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. YOUONLYLIVETWICE
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. IT'S CURLIN TIME was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. KEEP IT ROLLIN lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MY
CLASSY WIFE raced off the leaders from the inside and gradually gave way. BIGMONEYHUNNY bobbled at the start, showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. OLD WEST was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
INDY'S STAR dueled for the lead from the inside with SMILING THUNDER, disposed of that rival after going three-quarters and drew off through the lane
as the handiest of winners. TALES OF MAKENNA lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the
winner, but finished well to gain the place. SMILING THUNDER broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way
after going three-quarters. SHE'S MY RIDE lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. BACK TO BUSINESS
settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. REALREALGOOD lagged early, raced four-wide through the
second turn and did not menace. LATER DAYS raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. FLASH FLOOD
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
NEW EVERY MORNING sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off as a handy winner. ROUGE SUNSET lacked early
foot, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. PROFOUND ONE chased the leaders from
the inside and gave way in the drive. OUR EMPIRE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing
response. TENACIOUS LION settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SQUARE ROOT was forwardly placed
early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. ROYAL TAP was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and did not threaten. VIRGHAZI lagged far back early, raced six-wide through the turn and did not menace. MINDSHARE broke in the air, raced
six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
