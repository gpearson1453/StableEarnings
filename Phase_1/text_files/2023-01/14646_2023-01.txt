Footnotes
WINTER POOL went three wide around the first turn, was well placed behind the leading duo, was asked in the four path early on the far turn, pounced on
the leaders to take the lead at the three-eighths, dropped to the three path while moving clear into the stretch, extended the advantage under the crop to the
eighth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride while much the best. KUMAR was sent hard from the gate, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the
first turn, showed the way under pressure to his outside, lost the lead near the nine-sixteenths, was urged along while inside on the far turn, lost touch with
the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and clearly secured the place.
SCOTTY saved ground on the first turn, dropped back early on the backstretch, was urged along near the rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path
and got up for the show while no threat to the top two. GOLDINI went four then three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, took the
advantage near the nine-sixteenths, was asked in the three path on the final turn, dropped back late on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch and tired.
ICY STORM broke out at the start, went five then four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, raced inside to
the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. SUPPLY CHAIN was carried out at the start, went five wide while rated under restraint around the first
turn, was reserved on the outside, raced three wide under urging on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. FOREVER WICKED
dropped back early, saved ground on the first turn, was urged along at the rear, moved out around the nine-sixteenths, went three to four wide on the far
turn and was no factor.

one tap of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and widened under a solid hand-ride to prove much the best. DISARMED broke out and bumped

WILL E SUTTON was rated just off the pace, came through along the rail to take the lead with three furlongs to run, shook clear when set down into upper
stretch, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and held sway. BLU GROTTO dropped well behind while showing no speed under urging, raced
inside early on the turn, moved out late on that bend, reached the four path around the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch, rallied on the far
outside while remaining on his inside lead and closed well but was too late while clear for the place. CHARGER moved up to set the pace under pressure
from his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead coming to the three-eighths, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened but held the
show. SKYLANDER pressed the pace between horses, vied in the four path around the turn and tired. SEANAN settled towards the rear, was urged in the
two path for most of the turn, dropped to the rail under a strong drive outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. JONNY QUIST stalked the
pace on the outside, vied in the five path around the turn and also tired. HOLEY MATRIMONY showed speed then pressed the pace between horses, vied

TODAY'S FLAVOR bumped lightly with a foe at the start, showed speed then disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path around the turn,
shook clear late on that bend, responded well when set down in upper stretch, extended the advantage under a hand-ride into the final furlong and proved
much the best while kept to the task under mild hand urging. BOLD JOURNEY unseated his rider during the warm-up, bumped lightly with a rival at the start
and was off a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, angled out in upper stretch and earned the place. SCILLY CAY
dropped back under urging, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and missed the place while well clear for the show. BREW PUB was sent
hard from the start then hard ridden on the outside, went four wide around the turn, had the rider lost his crop at the quarter-pole and tired. WINNERS
LAUGH was away awkwardly, went five wide around the turn and was no factor. FOOLISH GHOST bumped with a rival at the start, disputed the pace on
the outside, vied in the three path around the turn and faded. PHANTOM SMOKE bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed then chased the pace,
dropped back late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
COMPLETE AGENDA was urged along at the rear, moved out on the turn, reached the five path inside the three-eighths, rallied seven wide into the stretch,
closed strongly in the middle of the course to get the lead coming to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. AFJAN settled off the pace,
was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, raced inside to the two path around the turn, came out into the stretch and finished willingly for the place.
DOCTOR LOVE broke out at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased five wide on the turn, made a bid late on that bend, took the lead into
upper stretch, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while just able to hold the show. COLLOQUY was last to commence then brushed with a
foe early, moved up to be well placed just off the pace, chased four wide on the turn, made a bid nearing the five-sixteenths, fought with the runner-up into
the final furlong and weakened then missed the show. RUSSIAN TO WIN settled off the pace, was coaxed in the two path early on the turn, drafted behind
horses late on that bend, shifted five wide into the stretch then tipped out, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick.
ACHILLES HEEL brushed with a rival early, settled off the pace, was urged three to four wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted in near
the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. UNION LIGHTS settled off the pace, dropped back outside the five-eighths, went three to four wide on
the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FROMANOTHAMUTHA pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the three path under
urging on the turn and weakened. SWIFT TAP went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, lost the
lead at the quarter-pole and gave way.

SENIOR PRANK disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, responded well under a drive in the stretch and held under strong
urging. SPELTERINI was fractious in the gate, bumped twice with a foe at the start, raced inside a foe early then moved out around the five-eighths, chased
three then two wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner to the wire and earned the place. FABULOUSLY FUNNY lost
her footing and stumbled some at the start, settled just off the pace, steadied while shuffled back badly from the half-mile pole to the seven--sixteenths, was
roused along the rail shortly thereafter, moved to the three path later on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out around the
sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage for the show. RISK FREE was fractious in the gate, bumped with foes on both sides at the start, raced on the
outside, made a bid near the half-mile pole, vied in the four path around the turn, fought with the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened.
BALENTINA was fractious in the gate, bumped lightly with an opponent at the start then was hustled, contested the pace between horses, vied along the rail
on the turn and tired. TRYINMYHEARTOUT was fractious in the gate, raced just off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, climbed some late on that
bend and lacked the needed response. MACHIAVELLIQUE was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of rivals, dropped back abruptly in
the two path leaving the backstretch and retreated. GRACEFUL settled towards the rear, was shuffled back behind another foe who was being shuffled late
on the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn and was no factor. BOUNTY KILLAH was fractious in the gate, bumped with
foes on both sides at the start then was taken up, went four then five wide around the turn and was no factor.

along while moving from the rail to the three path around the final turn, came five wide into the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner.
THOMAS SHELBY went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the far turn, took the lead inside the
three-eighths, lost the advantage to the winner inside the five-sixteenths and weakened but held the show. BOURBONIC bumped with a rival at the start,
went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, moved from three to five wide under urging on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. SEA FOAM was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead under urging inside the three-eighths and tired. PLOT
THE DOTS went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came
up empty. UNBRIDLED BOMBER moved from the two path to the four path around the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the
far turn and was no factor. SHOOGER RAY TOO was fractious in the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, dropped back early on the backstretch, fell
back into the far turn and faltered. FOREWARNED saved ground at the rear, came out into the stretch and was no factor. DOUBLE CROWN stumbled
outward at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along outside the half-mile pole, went three to four wide on the final
turn and faltered.

Footnotes
FUNNY HOW was well placed just off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, chased the runner-up into the final sixteenth,
gained on that foe late and got up under good handling. DAME CINCO pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, took the lead
near five-sixteenths, responded well under pressure into the final furlong, drifted out in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole, led to near the wire but was denied
while clear for the place. CAPTAINSDAUGHTER was urged along near the back, advanced while moving from three to five wide around the turn, made a
bid into upper stretch, battled outside of the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. I'M BUZZY chased the pace on
the outside then four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and tired. CAIRONI was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path
and failed to threaten. YO CUZ set the pace under pressure, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead passing the five-sixteenths and gave way. MY GLORY
was last to commence, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn and was no factor. FIRING CAROL settled on the outside then came under
urging around the five-eighths, advanced while moving from four to six wide around the turn, suffered an injury turning into upper stretch and was pulled up
then vanned off.
