Footnotes
SERENDIPITOUS stalked the pace three then four wide into the turn, rallied to make the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run under a strong
hand ride to win going away. TAMMY'S TOY never far back, rallied along the inside through the turn to make the lead near the quarter pole, maintained his
advantage until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. THANKSDAD close up from the start, swung wide and went evenly. TEQUILA FLATS failed
to menace. PLAYING BALL dueled in the two path for a half then gave way. WHO CAN WIN pressed the pace two then three wide into the turn, checked
nearing the quarter pole and dropped out of it. DAVIS HAT trailed. THE RIDER OF WHO CAN WIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

furlong. WELLMAN had speed from the start, dug in three wide and gamely gained second. CENTSOFWANDER never far back, finished with good courage
between horses two wide. CINDY'S STORM led early, prompted the pace along the inside into the stretch and faded late. BAD LITTLE BEAST wide early,
failed to menace. ATLANTIC FIRESTORM was restless in the gate, settled within striking distance in the four path then lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
YOUVESAIDITALL stalked the pace for six furlongs, slipped through along the inside to make the lead entering the stretch, battled the balance of the trip
and wore down rivals in a game effort. PERFETTO pressed the pace two wide, gained a narrow lead before a half, set the pace into the stretch, gave up the
lead to the winner, fought back gamely and just missed. BLAME IT ON EDDIE trailed early and rallied determinedly through the stretch three wide to be
narrowly beaten. TIP SHEET never far back, finished with good courage five wide. LUCKY JUNIOR stalked the early pace, loomed boldly four wide into the
far turn then was outfinished. IMTHEPRINCE was no factor. ALGORIX raced wide and lacked the needed response. PONT DU GARD broke in front, set the
pace for nearly a half then was used up.

Footnotes
COSMIC TREASURE chased the pace into the stretch, made the lead then widened the balance of the trip under strong handling to win as much the best.
CHASING VINNY bumped at the start, stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in inside rivals and got up for second. GET HAMMERED sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. GEH SCHNELL close up along the inside, angled out at the top of the
stretch and finished determinedly three wide. PHARAOH'S PROPHECY bumped at the start and failed to menace. GOTSOMEMOJO void of early speed,
passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. DETERMINATOR close up along the inside, angled out on the far turn to the four path then came up empty. AMERICAN
FLEET was no factor. NOBLE BEHAVIOR well placed three wide, weakened in the lane. GRANDGRAN raced wide and was outrun. LEVANTO (ARG)
settled widest and was no threat.

up some ground and was gaining on the top pair late. LA ROSA chased the winner into the stretch, loomed boldly two wide before the furlong marker then
was outfinished. ANGEL WINGS failed to menace. LUCKY PENNY ROSE trailed early, moved up along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. SPICE ICE
