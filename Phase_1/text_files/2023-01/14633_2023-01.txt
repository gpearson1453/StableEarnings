HERE COMES LOVIE was placed off the pace in the two path down the backstretch then engaged the leader at the quarter pole and took command at the
three sixteenths pole, drew off and proved best. START WELL raced near the back around the first turn then made a three wide bid around the three
eighths pole but was no match for the winner. ANN'S STORM was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved between horses on the final turn to
prove best of the rest. JULIO CHOICE raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground around the first turn, moved up the rail on the backstretch,
dropped back on the final turn and passed tiring rivals. MYLIES STAR saved ground from the middle of the pack made mild bid on the backstretch moved
out to three to four wide in upper stretch but was never a threat. KATIE'S C was hustled to a clear lead to the quarter pole and weakened. OVERLY SWEET
reared as the gates opened and was not a factor. SHE'S TAKIN OVER tracked the leaders to the three eighths pole and gave way.

MUFFIN NUTS was placed off the pace in the two path down the backstretch then made a bid at the quarter pole and engaged the leader at the three
sixteenths pole and drew off. PARALISSFRMANALYSS went to the clear lead down the backstretch, was headed at the three sixteenths pole and tired in
the stretch. SPHEROID raced in the middle of the pack from the two path through the final turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally.
JOEBOY saved ground throughout, moved up the rail on the final turn but faltered. OPTIMISTIC tracked the leaders from the three path down the
backstretch and retreated on the final turn and finished evenly. TRAELEE was not a factor. LIAM SKYE was four wide in the first turn but was never a threat.

Footnotes
MY DESTINY tracked the leader from off the pace on the inside to early stretch then dueled for a sixteenth but prove best. SWEET TEMPERAMENT went
to a clear lead to early stretch then had a stretch battle and gave way grudgingly. SASSY BEAST dueled from the inside in the second flight then pulled
away at the eighth pole to be a game third. TIPSY GAL had no early speed then moved out to five wide at the three sixteenth pole and went six wide in
upper stretch for a late rally. KELA'S TURN dueled from the two path in the second flight to the eighth pole and faded. MY FRIEND AMY dueled in the
second flight from the four path to upper stretch and weakened. IMA DISCREET LADY dueled from the three path in the second flight through the turn and
tired. BOSSY MAMA was always back.
