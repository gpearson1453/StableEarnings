ESTILO ELEGANTE unhurried while saving ground through the far turn, swung out to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch, closed with a rush
under mild left handed urging and got up in the final strides. SCOOP THERE IT IS stalked the early pace, rallied two wide to make the lead in upper stretch,
set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. MUSICAL RIDE away alertly, set the pace off the rail into the stretch then
was outfinished. PEACH BELLINI passed tiring rivals. LADY MECHANIC pressed the pace two wide and gave way on the far turn. PRINCESS MORO was
no threat. HALOFIED was through after a half. TIMES ADDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

INCESSANT stalked the pace into the stretch rallied in the five path three wide to make the lead at the furlong marker and edged clear late under strong
handling. POLISHED GEM set the pace for nearly five furlongs, was headed, fought back to regain command near the quarter pole, maintained a slight
advantage nearing the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. STARSHIP MACYS was in tight nearing the first turn, boxed in along the inside for
six furlongs, loomed boldly when the leader drifted to the four path in upper stretch then came up empty. FLAXEN was squeezed between rivals entering the
clubhouse turn, trailed until deep stretch then passed tiring rivals. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL pressed the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, gained
a slight lead then weakened in the stretch. WICKED ECSTASY was through after a half.

CHACO SPIRIT trailed down the backstretch, circled his field at will to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win as
much the best while in hand late. AIN'T STRAIGHT chased the pace two wide for a half, gained a narrow lead momentarily then couldn't handle the winner.
NOT A GAME close up three wide, dropped back on the turn, came on again along the inside, drifted out to the five path entering the stretch then was
outfinished. MASTER vied for the lead four then three wide and was through after a half. ICON rushed to lead inside rivals before a quarter, set the pace for
a half then was used up.

Footnotes
GILES never far back, closed willingly four wide through the far turn, made the lead in upper stretch and drew off under brisk handling. SEMINOLE
JUSTICE pressed the early pace along the inside, shifted outside the leader entering the far turn, came on again near mid track and finished clear for
second. KING OF THE RING trailed into the stretch, swung wide, angled in late and was steadily gaining ground six wide. KLAATU battled for the early lead
two wide, remained a sharp threat into the far turn, dropped back then passed tiring rivals in the middle of the racetrack. ARTEMUS EAGLE moved up two
wide into the stretch then came up empty. DEBDURITE failed to menace. ADANO broke slowly and was no threat. PROFESSIONAL surged to the front
three wide after a quarter, set the pace to the top of the stretch then stopped.
