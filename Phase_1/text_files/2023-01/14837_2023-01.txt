Footnotes
MOSTLY HARMLESS broke out and brushed with a foe then was corrected, was taken in hand when the pacesetter crossed in front early then moved out,
tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path around the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, spun five wide into the stretch then
drifted further out while shaking clear, extended the advantage under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was given one pop of the crop outside the
sixteenth-pole then was placed back under a brisk hand-ride while much the best. AFILADA was last to commence then dropped back, settled on the
outside, moved up late on the backstretch, was asked in the four path around the turn, chased six wide into the stretch then moved further out in pursuit of
the winner and proved no match while able to hold the place. GRACEFULLY WILD bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back early then was taken back
before angling in outside the five-eighths, went three wide around the turn, shifted six wide coming to the quarter-pole, dropped in behind horses in upper
stretch and missed the place while well clear for the show. CAIAROSSA showed speed then was taken in hand, raced just off the pace, drafted inside
around the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and came up empty. BECAUSEOFTHEBRAVE broke in and bumped with a foe, moved in while
going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path around the turn, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole and
faded. SARAH'S PRIDE was coaxed along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, came out some into upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MACH ONE chased along the inside early on until tipped to the three path half a mile from home, raced outside the leader through the turn four wide and
was floated briefly five wide three furlongs from home, advanced to take command near the quarter pole and went six wide into upper stretch, then drew
clear under a drive to prevail. HATCH broke in a step at the start tightening up the lane of BERT BERT BERT in tandem with MACH ONE, prompted the
leader from the inside in the two path, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and weakened in the late stages while
along for the place honors. MAURITIUS showed the way in hand five then four wide under prompting to the inside, tucked three wide into the turn, floated
four wide midway carrying MACH ONE briefly five wide, got displaced from command and went four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive.
BERT BERT BERT got his lane tightened up at the start when HATCH broke in a step, grew detached at the tail of the field saving ground when devoid of
speed, remained along the inside through the turn and into upper stretch, made some headway on the top trio while trailing throughout.

Footnotes
CURLINS CHOIR went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, dueled inside of the runner-up in the stretch,
disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. SICILIAN GRANDMA chased the pace on the outside, gained in the four
path around the turn, made a bid while dropping to the three path outside the quarter-pole, came inward in upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up to
the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS bumped twice with a rival at the start, was urged along off the
pace, went around most of the turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response while best of the rest. AUDIT COMMITTEE bumped twice with an opponent at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the
turn, spun six wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and capitulated then was not urged from outside the sixteenth-pole to the wire. JESSICA'S
RACE was urged along at the rear, raced inside to the three path around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LADY QUINN broke
through the front of the gate prior to the start and sat down on her hindquarters at the same time, was deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, pressed
the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole and
faltered.

MAJESTIC TIGER coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide advancing on the front midway on the turn to take command when placed to coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled in spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail and was geared down in the late stages.
JADE'S DREAM chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four then three wide for home, proved no match for the top
one, dug in knocking heads to the finish with PRINCE OF JOY and ultimately bested that foe in the final jumps to procure the place honors. PRINCE OF
JOY chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, proved no
match for the top one, dug in head to head to the finish but was bested at the end and forced to settle for the show honors. EL MAYOR showed the way in
hand three then two wide coming under pressure when put to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, yielded command at that station, spun three then two wide
into upper stretch and weakened. EXXTOP chased two to three wide, came under coaxing three to four wide at the three-eighths, went five wide into upper

Footnotes
DR. KRAFT chased the pace down the backstretch, went two then three wide around the turn, dropped to the rail at the quarter-pole, pursued the leader
against the fence in upper stretch, was guided out over the heels of that foe into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up under strong
urging. LAUNCH CONTROL broke in and bumped with a foe then was hustled to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the three
then two path around the turn, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. ELECTRIC STUFF settled off the pace while
showing some dislike of the kickback, was urged three to four wide around the turn, pursued the top two in the stretch and finished willingly for the show.
CHALKY CAT was bumped at the start and forced in then taken up while in tight, spotted the front several lengths, moved up on the outside under urging,
chased in the five path around the turn and weakened. GEM MINT TEN was fractious behind the gate, showed good speed then disputed the pace, dropped
back near the half-mile pole, chased inside around the turn, came out into upper stretch then was carried inward and tired. AWESOME FORCE climbed
some outside the five-eighths, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. FERRIS MULER broke in and hit the gate,
settled under some urging, moved out leaving the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn and was no factor. BINGOOD TO
KNOWYA chased the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, came up empty in the two path on the turn and retreated.

PRISONER coaxed from the gate, showed the way from the two path until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in drifting out in the final sixteenth while holding well to the finish.
LAFITTE'S FLEET coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, offered
up a mild kick to chase the winner home closing in a bit in the late stages. PRINCE JAMES hustled from the gate, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out four wide into upper stretch, was placed back in hand when unable to match the top pair straightened away
and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
TIMELESS JOURNEY went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths,
came through a rail opening to make a bid approaching the quarter-pole, took over into upper stretch, drifted out outside the furlong marker, responded well
into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. MOMMASGOTTARUN rounded the first turn in the two path, prompted the pace down the backstretch,
steadied then dropped back in crowded quarters leaving the backstretch, came under intermittent urging in the two path around the far turn, was roused for
more at the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch then quickly moved to the six path, swapped back to her inside lead inside the furlong marker
and finished willingly for the place. LET HER INSPIRE U was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made
a bid in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the
show. FAR AWAY LOVE (ARG) went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the far
turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and gave way. ICE PRINCESS dropped back shortly after the start, went two then three wide
around the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged three wide early on the far turn then shifted five wide, remained five wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. SOFIA'S SECRET was rated four then three wide on the first turn, settled outside down the backstretch, chased four wide around the far turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and faltered.
