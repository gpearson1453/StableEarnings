Footnotes
HELLO HANDSOME dueled for the lead from the inside with FULL DRAW, disposed of that rival with a furlong to run, opened a clear advantage and was
fully extended to hold off the closing CHROME KING by a diminishing margin. CHROME KING settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out
approaching the stretch, rallied late and was gaining on the winner. STRAUS'S PLACE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn,
angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. FULL DRAW disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
BREXTON was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. AUTISM SAVANT lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
JUST PICK IT UP sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and was ridden out to the wire to be kept to task. HIGH FLYIN
TIGER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and was up for the place. ALPHABETICAL chased the leaders from the
inside, angled out into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well. LAZARUS COME FORTH settled off the leaders early, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MORE ACTION lagged early, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. LOVER BOY TOM
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

SHOE GAME tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage nearing the quarter, vied and edged away in the closing yards. REIGN OF FIRE was
away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied with that rival but
could not match strides late. TIZ TENACIOUS was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but lacked the
needed late response. SHEZ A GRINDER was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly. AND I KNOW settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. BONITA RAPIDS showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
APRILINTHEPINES chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened. FUN PADDY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and did not offer a bid.
