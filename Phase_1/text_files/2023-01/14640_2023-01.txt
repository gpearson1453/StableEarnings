Footnotes
CARPE HORSESHOE broke alertly, cleared with minimal effort soon after, showed the way into and through the turn toward the inside, shrugged off
nearest pursuer turning for home, drew out through the lane under steady handling. ESSENTIAL BELLA broke with the winner, chased that one from the
outside into the turn, crept closer late in the bend then proved no match in the run to the wire. JODEAN lacked early foot, dropped inside late in the turn
when making a mild advance, had little for the top two in the drive, saved the show. JERI DAWN in the second flight along the inside, shuffled back along
the rail early in the turn, continued to save ground into the stretch then went evenly to the wire. GUEST IN MY HEART behind the leaders three wide, had
little left for the drive to be outkicked for the show. CRYSTAL CRESCENT last to leave, was never a factor while racing four wide through the turn. BIG ON
BROADWAY was always outrun. TORCH OF HONOR in mid pack early, stopped after a half and finished well back.

Footnotes
SHAKEDOWN STREET forwardly placed early along the inside, steadied just inside the leader when in tight along the rail late in the bend, regrouped, rail
bid past the furlong marker, drove clear. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO prompted the issue from between rivals for a half, roused three wide in upper stretch,
outside bid a furlong out, no match late. SHOTGUN UP bobbled slightly at the break, lacked early foot, swung five wide turning for home, rallied for the
show while no real threat to the top two. DRAG MALIBU forwardly placed between foes and immediately behind the early leader, continued in some traffic
late turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. KRUSIN ROCKET broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch just off the
inside, kept the winner in tight exiting the turn, vied past the furlong marker between the two two and faltered. TEQUILA REVOLUTION went one paced
while racing just off the inside. JOE BILL main body, four wide in some traffic far turn, weakened through the stretch. PIKACHU last to leave, was never
involved. KOSELIO within striking distance well wide, was five wide into the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
RICHNESS never far bac off the inside, pressed the leader in the two path into the turn, challenged midway between horses midway on the bend, narrowly
showed the way into the stretch then drew off under mostly her own courage to win ridden out. TRULY A ROCKET prompted the issue up the backstretch
while widest, four wide into the turn, challenged three wide soon after, vied outside the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one in the run to the
wire, clear for the place. TAILORBESWIFT broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, raced on equal terms with the top two turning
for home, finished up best of the rest. PROUD VICTORIA settled off the pace in the two path, continued one paced through the turn and finished up evenly
in lacking a closing punch. FIVE QUEENS lacked early foot just off the inside, improved position slightly while racing just off the inside.
FLOWERSFORSHANTELL broke back, raced back and inside, picked off some tiring rivals while not a threat. COURTNEY FAY off a step slow, trailed, also
picked off a couple of tiring foes while also never a threat. HALE'S ANGEL hesitated at the break, moved up to mid pack soon after, tired through the
stretch. WICKED STREET pressed the issue three wide and between the top two into the turn, began to give way soon after.

COLOR FIELD stalked the lead pack up the backstretch toward the inside, swung out four wide into the lane, closed with good resolve under firm handling
to be in time. STORM APPROACHING with the pace from the start following an alert start, vied between horses into and through the turn, narrowly showed
the way into the lane, drifted out a bit just inside the furlong grounds, shook clear of the other speed soon after but could not contain the winner. G T FIVE
HUNDRED with the leaders while racing outside, contested the issue three wide through the turn, briefly dueled outside the winner into the lane, bothered
slightly when beginning to tire and when that one drifted out slightly with just less than a furlong remained. SPARKIN off a step slow, raced well behind the
pace in the two path, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. FLOOR IT off a bit slow, trailed early as a result, moved out three wide midway
on the turn, improved a bit while never a real threat. MALORIE'S BIG BOY settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, failed to
muster a rally. UPTOWN SOCIAL with the pace along the inside, first to blink turning for home. BLAME IT broke back, was finished early.

Footnotes
RELEASED forwardly placed early off the inside, evenly paced through the turn, four wide for the drive bid, wore down foes under firm handling. CRIMSON
ZIP prompted the pace three wide, closer three wide turn, bid midstretch three wide, gave ground grudgingly. TRUMPENCE dueled inside for a half closest
to the inside for a half, headed when straightened for home, battled back to earn the show while also proving stubborn until the waning strides. NORTH
SIDE dueled up front in the two path, put a head in front briefly turning for home, weakened the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. ANALYZER dwelt
at the start to spot field a few lengths, trailed early, four wide midway on the turn, three path into the lane, improved with a mild rally. COOL RUNNINGS off
a step slow, lacked speed, improved position through traffic, not a serious threat. EVEN THUNDER broke out, was straightened to race with the main body
while widest up the backstretch, four to six wide turn, made little impact through the stretch in finishing up evenly. SAHM TEQUILA off a step slow, failed to
menace. POP'S BISCUIT in mid pack and three wide, four wide into the stretch, failed to rally. SHANGHAI POINT in the second flight while racing outside,
faded. ROCK N JUNE BUG stopped early, fell far back and then jogged in.

CONGRESSMAN off a step slow, steered out to be four wide when beginning to advance midway on the turn, came five wide for the drive, finished willingly
and with good determination to prove best while widest of the first flight at the wife. ULTIMATE settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide and inside
the winner turning for home, rallied with that one to the wire, outkicked in the final strides while between horses at the wire. MISTER MMMMM took
command soon after the start, clear into the turn off the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage while under pressure stretch, caught in the late going
while inside the top two. MUMAYAZ chased early inside, in tight, brief wait with four furlongs to run, got through, closest to the leader through the turn, came
up empty for the stretch drive. DON'T FORGET in mid pack just off the inside, dropped to the rail midway on the turn, had little left for the final furlong to
lose a couple of positions. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK broke back, lacked speed, made little impact while improving slightly. TAPIT'S SPIRIT in the second
flight while in the three path, weakened in the drive. CLASSIC MOMENT broke out, bumped with PEACEFUL STREET, moved up to race in mid pace,
faded. PEACEFUL STREET bumped at the break, quickly recovered to chase the leader early, stopped late in the turn.

Footnotes
BOLT ABOVE broke well, never far back off rail, challenged three wide late in the turn, slowly edged clear under firm handling. MOON CONNECTION
closest to the leader up the backstretch, challenged between foes and inside the winner late in the bend, raced briefly with that one into the stretch then
could not match strides, clear for the place. SIX WHIPS away in good order inside the winner, edged clear of that one before a quarter, responded when
challenged in the turn, could not match the top two late, remained clear of the others. TEXAS TED hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of
lengths, remained back turn, dropped to the inside turning for home, improved position with some belated interest. BRILLIANT COLORS in mid pack while
racing inside for a half, came in the two path for the drive, continued evenly through the lane while losing crop with a furlong to run. SANTINO'S FANTASY
raced back and outside, four wide for the drive, made little impact to the wire. THINKINGNDRINKING off a step slow, tired. PRINCE OF ROSES steadily
faded while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
GOLDEN HORNET took command just after the start inside, continued to show the way into the turn through some lively fractions, headed turning for home,
regained the advantage soon after, kicked clear under firm handling in a sharp effort. KNOCKER DOWN pressed the winner from the outside for almost four
furlongs, briefly put a head in front exiting the turn, lost the advantage to that same rival when straightened for home then could not keep up, clearly second
best. EMPERADOR outrun early just off the inside, steered three wide turning for home, rallied for the show, no threat to the top three. IGNITIS fell well
back to trail after the start, three wide into the stretch, improved position the final furlong without posing a serious threat. VULCAN off a step slow, in the
second flight along the inside, had little left for the drive. TIZHOTNDUSTY broke with the leaders, settled in the second flight up the backstretch, also came
up empty for the stretch run. DIAMOND CITY in the second flight outside, pulled in the run up the backstretch, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
TEJANO TWIST off a step slow, moved to the rail by midway on the turn, steered out three wide for room entering the stretch, rallied from between horses
past the furlong marker and closed with good energy to be up in time. TUT'S REVENGE lacked early speed while racing off the inside, three wide much of
turn, angled four wide into the lane, finished willingly while outside the winner, narrowly got up for the second spot. NOBODY LISTENS broke sharp, set the
pace up the backstretch toward the inside, given a bit of a breather through the turn, continued to lead late, could not contain the winner while holding sway
for the place in the final strides. SEVEN NATION ARMY settled off the pace and inside, rode the rail into the lane, late bid for the place inside, missed the
show. KAVOD closest to the early leader off the inside, three path into lane, had little left in the late going. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER bothered slightly just
after the start, raced back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, failed to fire to finish up evenly. LYKAN void of speed, fanned five wide out of
the turn, remained back in also lacking a closing response. CANADIAN PRIDE forwardly placed up the backstretch and three wide, began a steady fade
before a half. CHATTALOT prompted the pace while racing four wide, stopped.
