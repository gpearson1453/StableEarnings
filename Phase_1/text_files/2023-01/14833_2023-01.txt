TERMSOFENGAGEMENT was well placed along the inside, angled out leaving the three sixteenths for aim on the front runner, then closed well to get up in
time, driving. HIGH STRIKE set the pace while in the two path, drew clear leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker but was caught late to be
denied. ROCK ANNA ROLL stalked the pace three wide and weakened, bested rest. DON'T QUESTION ME lacked a solid rally. RECKLESS JONES failed
to menace. SHARP STYLE was not a factor. GREATEST WARRIOR was off slowly and raced far back.

CRIMSON LILLE was well placed early on the inside, made a inside bid to duel for command on the turn, then drew clear nearing the furlong marker and
kicked away to prove best, driving. MS KAYS COWGIRL was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn and then had a late rally to gain the place
award. HUSHEMUP set the pace while racing off the rail, then dueled for the lead three wide on the turn and weakened the final furlong, lost place late,
bested rest. SKIPOVER was reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn and came three wide into the lane and had no rally. CEETA chased the pace
four wide and tired. LET UR LIGHT SHINE was void of early speed and wide on the backstretch and was not a threat. DREAMERS BELONG tracked the
pace and was three to four wide on the backstretch and stopped.
