Footnotes
DEE'S SPEEDSTRE showed good speed, contested the pace between foes while in hand, was let out in the two path early on the turn then asked while
inside a foe at the three-eighths, led past the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up coming to the quarter-pole, responded well while tussling
with that foe in upper stretch, regained a slim advantage into the final furlong, fought on gamely to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. WEST STAR
broke a bit slow with the rider losing his balance a bit in the saddle, was hard ridden early then chased the pace on the outside, went four wide around the
turn, gained to make a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead approaching the quarter-pole, battled outside of the winner while remaining on his inside lead
in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead just before the furlong marker then was headed, fought on to the wire but missed in a good effort while in a
different zip-code then the third place finisher. FAST STUDY contested the pace on the outside of two foes, was asked in the three path on the turn, raced
between foes passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back at the quarter-pole and tired while able to hold the show. SCREEN DOOR broke out and bumped
with an opponent, was rated early then came under urging near the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the turn and capitulated. LIOTTA was
bumped at the start then stumbled awkwardly and nearly unseated the rider, was taken up some while the rider regained centering in the saddle, spotted the
front a few lengths, was urged early then settled off the pace, dropped back four wide around the turn and had nothing left. EXCALIBRATE leaned out at the
start, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, dropped back early on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
HAMMERIN AAMER coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and steadied briefly half a mile from home when LIL
COMMISSIONER came outwards from his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong from home, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. LIL COMMISSIONER chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. RUNABOUT four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, took over narrow and brief command
with three-sixteenths to go, got collared near the eighth pole and ran on to preserve the show honors. MOUNT TRAVERS showed the way early on in hand
four then three wide before being displaced on the front by KUMAR five and a half furlongs from home, tracked that leader in closest aim advancing once
more tucked to the two path into the turn to take back the front with seven-sixteenths to run, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch under threat from a trio, got collared with three-sixteenths to go and weakened in the late stages. CASH NOW chased three to four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, tired. KUMAR hustled from the gate, chased along the inside before advancing
to take over command five and a half furlongs from home, showed the way until displaced with seven-sixteenths remaining, faded under urging through the
turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

Footnotes
SIGHT UNSEEN stalked the pace on the outside, was asked late on the backstretch, chased in the four path around the turn, was driven five wide into the
stretch, gained on his left lead to take the advantage coming to the furlong marker and edged clear under steady handling. GHOSTLYPRINCE moved out
some outside the five-eighths after the pacesetter crossed in front, advanced to press the leader on the outside, took a short advantage in the three path
midway through the turn, led in the four path into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner while swapping to the proper lead approaching the furlong
marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. ROMANOATSEE settled just off the pace on the outside, was coaxed along passing the
nine-sixteenths, came under stronger encouragement in the five path on the turn, chased outside under the crop while remaining on his inside lead in the
stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. RAW COURAGE stumbled badly at the start and was last to commence, was rated at the
rear, went around the turn in the two path while roused, spun three wide into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. NICHOLAS JAMES was
hustled from the outside post, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked along the rail while under threat early on
the turn, lost the advantage midway through that bend and tired.

Footnotes
NAKED AND FAMOUS hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift early splits before being engaged in head to head
combat by SUPER QUALITY to the outside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive and
was headed for the front a furlong out, drifted out growing leg weary in tandem with his main pace disputer and came again to take command near the
sixteenth pole, then lasted on the wire. SUPER QUALITY five paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest range of the leader, tucked to the two path
advancing to duel through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four to five wide for home, dug in under a drive continuing the fracas
through the stretch taking command a furlong out, got headed near the sixteenth marker drifting in concert with his main foe growing leg weary as a pair and
was ultimately bested at the end. THREETHIRTYTHREE broke out at the start awkwardly and was corrected, chased four paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, kept on
under a drive gaining ground aided by the embattled top pair and missed at the end. GROWTH MINDSET six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish.
PAPI ON ICE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, made no impact.
MR. BUSTA coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home, tired. RED JET
lunged at the break, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
ASSET PURCHASE was away awkwardly but with the field, tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the four path around the turn, took over
outside the quarter-pole, shook clear into upper stretch then was set down, drew off under a strong hand-ride until outside the sixteenth-pole then was
eased up while much the best. RISK FREE broke out then bobbled hard, settled off the pace, was urged three wide early on the turn then angled five wide
and safely secured the place. LIAM'S CHAMP was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced off the pace under urging, moved in around the
nine-sixteenths, went three wide early on the turn, bumped soundly with WONDER GIRL inside the three-eighths then steadied, lacked room behind a wall
of horses while racing with her head cocked to the inside from that point into upper stretch, finally found room and was asked nearing the furlong marker
then improved for the show in a tough trip. WONDER GIRL broke a step slow, settled on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, bumped soundly
with LIAM'S CHAMP inside the three-eighths, moved out over heels in upper stretch and came up empty. MAYHEM MISS showed speed on the inside,
dropped back near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and tired. NOW SHOWING showed good speed on the outside of a foe, moved to a solo
advantage with a half-mile to run, was challenged in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the winner outside the quarter-pole and gave way.
HERECOMES SCARLETT settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn and failed to respond. LENDHERCREDIT was hustled from the gate,
chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths and retreated in the two path.

BEAUTIFUL KAREN got bumped at the start by SURCHARGE, who broke outwards, settled prompting the leader from the outside in the three path under a
rating hold, intensified the pressure on that rival through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole when taking over command, swung three wide
into upper stretch shaking away, edged clear under a drive to prevail. MOVIE MOXY tossed her head at the start getting away in a tangle, chased just off
the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. GAGLIANO coaxed from
the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the
show honors. INFRINGEMENT coaxed from the start, chased inside briefly before tipping out four wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five wide for home and stayed on one paced to the finish. FANTAIL (GB) coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some
pressure by BEAUTIFUL KAREN to the outside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the front near the quarter pole and went two to three
wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. RACING COLORS stumbled at the start, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no headway. SURCHARGE broke out at the start bumping BEAUTIFUL KAREN, chased along
the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

on even terms with the runner-up, disposed of that foe into the final furlong, drew off under urging into the final forty yards then was eased up while much
the best. LONDON GOLD was taken in hand early then moved out, stalked the leader on the outside, turned up the pressure while four then three wide
around the turn, was driven into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled with the winner to the furlong marker and proved no match while just able
to get the place. CARLY HUSTLE settled towards the rear, was urged in the two path around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved to just

PLAY established a good position just off the pace, was asked while two then three wide on the turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. BELLS
ON HER TOES was last to commence, settled at the rear, saved ground around the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor. HIGH SCHOOL
CRUSH moved out while settling well off the pace, was urged four wide around the turn then came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
VILLAREGGIA angled in while settling off the pace, saved ground under urging around the turn and came up empty. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS

Footnotes
HOT FUDGE tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, made a bid late on that bend, dueled inside of the runner-up in the
stretch, brushed with that foe late and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. KITTEN'S APPEAL bumped with a rival while breaking near the back, moved
up under coaxing, was asked four wide on the turn, made a bid near the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch, brushed with that rival late
and just missed while clear for the place. CAPTAINSDAUGHTER was coaxed along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the
stretch and improved to just get the show. I'M BUZZY bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and just missed the show. WESTERN LANE moved out while urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to
threaten. LADY MILAGRO displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, lost the advantage into
upper stretch and gave way. CHAMPAGNE POETRY was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. RUVIES IN TIME was
positioned towards the front down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and came up empty. BABA was well placed just off the pace, chased
inside around the turn and capitulated. CHASING CARA was away awkwardly, raced off the pace under urging, went four wide on the turn, spun six wide
into the stretch and failed to respond.
