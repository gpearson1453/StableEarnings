Footnotes
BEAUTY QUIST chased the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and pulled clear in the final furlong.
PARISIAN VIBE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the bend and chased the winner home late. HAPPY RIDE
pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the two path around the turn and kept on to the wire. ALEXA'S DREAM
trailed the field early, began to improve position while racing in the two path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. MOAM reared in the gate prior to
the race, broke well and settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and never threatened.
EPIC QUEEN raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. BAZZARINA
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the lane.

the far bend still in the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and pulled clear on the rail. A RING THING raced in the two path early, pressed
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second turn and kept on to the finish. ASTERS D'ORO bumped with the
horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the rail around
the far turn and weakened late. AZIZA saved ground early, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three
path and finished evenly. MISS Z saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two
path and gained ground mildly in the stretch. SUMMER AT THE SPA saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, began a bid from the four path coming off the far turn and was outfinished late. ENTWINE (IRE) brushed with the horse to her inside at
the break, settled off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in the three path and was empty in the stretch. KEKE
KIMONO bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field while saving ground early, dropped back after a half mile had
