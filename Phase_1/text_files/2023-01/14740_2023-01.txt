Footnotes
ALWAYS ANGELS close up early inside, allowed the leader to clear before a quarter, chased that one in the two path through the bend, engaged that same
foe from the outside when straightened for home, took over by the furlong marker and drove well clear. MISS ADDIE LYNN off a step slow, raced back off
the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, roused upper stretch, finished willingly up the rail to be in time for the place, not a serious threat to the
winner. SALTWATER GYPSY cleared toward the inside before a quarter after breaking in good order, continued to show the way through the turn, offered
brief resistance to the winner when that one challenged approaching midstretch, no match the final furlong, nipped late for the place. SANTANGELO lacked
early foot outside, three to four wide through the turn, improved position slightly through the lane while not a serious threat to the top three. TATTERED
HEART in mid pack while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive. BIZZY GAL within striking distance along the inside, came in the two path for the
drive, caved in to trail home late.

Footnotes
RIGHT TRAPPE in the second flight off the inside, made a good move to take over in the three path far turn, clear into the stretch, maintained daylight to the
wire under steady handling. MOHAYLADY in mid pack off the inside,continued in the two path into the final turn, steered out three wide around the two tiring
leaders soon after, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. DERBY QUEST behind the pace while inside the runner up, lost contact
with that one in some minor traffic late final turn, moved out into the two path for the drive, along for the show while not a threat to the top pair. WEST SIDE
GIRL void of early foot, four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally while not a serious threat. XYLOPHONE four wide in the first turn while back, continued to
lack speed up the backstretch, four to five wide second bend, improved position while also not posing a significant threat. SIMONA'S CHOICE dueled up
front along the inside, gave way second turn. RELIANT in the second flight while off the inside, tired through the stretch. STYLIN N PROFILIN three wide
most of the way, four wide midway on the final turn, had little left for the stretch run. BID FOR POWER moved up to duel in the two path, stopped second
turn.

Footnotes
GINSBURNED away in good order, dueled from the outside in the two path, showed way into stretch, headed a furlong out, spirited run to the wire, narrowly
gained the nod at the wire. COLD AS HELL broke on top, alternated while along the inside for the lead up the backstretch, continued on equal terms with
the winner into the stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, continued to lead late, outnodded at the wire. OLLIEMEISTER in the main
group while racing outside, four wide through the turn, advanced on the top two inside the furlong marker, slow gain late, not enough.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE in the second flight while racing between horses, continued out in the strip for the drive, lacked a closing punch. PISTOL OR
SHOTGUN last to leave, trailed early, came three wide for the drive, improved a bit while not posing a serious threat. BRAWNDO chased the dueling
leaders up the backstretch and into the turn, saved ground into the lane, had little left. OUT RUN'M finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
CHAPEL BARN behind the leaders for a half inside, angled out turning into the lane, collared that pair just inside the furlong grounds, drew clear under
steady urging. HOT PASTRAMI lacked speed while racing outside, four to five wide turning for home, roused, finished willingly down the middle of the strip
to be up for the place. HERD IMMUNITY off a step slow, back off the pace toward the rail, dropped to the rail in the turn, finished with interest while
continuing inside, narrowly missed the place. COLTONS DREAM chased the early leader off the inside, moved closet to that one late in the turn, continued
to apply pressure upper stretch, outfinished the early leader while being overrun late by the top three. LOVE MY JIMMY broke outward a bit but alertly,
quickly clear, showed the way through a lively opening quarter, attempted to be given a breather in the turn, dueled past the furlong marker and faltered.
DR. FORMAN back off the pace and the inside, three wide exiting the turn, failed to muster a closing response. ANALYZER settled off the pace and the
inside, four down to three wide turn, lacked a closing kick. GUARD off a step slow, trailed much of the way just off the inside and was not a factor. BRAVO
BRAVO off step slow, was also always outrun.

Footnotes
MIRI A COINCIDENCE broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, continued to vie upper stretch, kicked clear the final furlong under firm handling.
HARDSCRABBLE away well, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, continued to hold a slight advantage through upper stretch then
could not match strides with the winner, remained well clear of the others. FOUR DICE void of any early foot, continued to lag turn while in the three path,
came five wide for the drive and closed with good energy down the middle of the strip to earn the show. WICKED PRINCE bothered to be away slowly, was
used a bit to move up to mid pack outside, four to five wide turn, improved, outkicked late for the show spot while between horses. WESTOVER in mid pack
while racing three wide,moved closer through the turn then failed to sustain that advance in the drive to finish up flatly. JUST BECAUSE off slowly, raced
back early, improved the middle part off the inside then hung the final furlong. MY KINDA TETON behind the pace toward the inside, angled three wide
turning into the stretch, came up empty for the drive. MR WORKS lugged out soon after the start, back, closer turn, got out again to be extremely wide into
the lane, evenly to the wire while far out in the strip. K J'S LEGACY broke back, lacked speed, in some traffic in tight quarters late in the turn, no response
stretch when clear. SALTY JONES in mid pack inside, tired in the drive. PREACHER'S PET forwardly placed and three wide, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
HARTLEY stalked the early leader in the two path, moved to challenge between rivals midway on the turn, clear into the lane, extended that advantage by
midstretch then had enough left to comfortably hold the runner up safe late. SHELL SHOCK bobbled at the start, recovered to race behind the pace toward
the inside, steered out three wide turning for home, roused, displayed good late energy to be getting to the winner late. CHAI TEA last to leave after being
bothered and when put in tight, trailed early as a result, came in the two path for the drive, up late for the show with some mild late interest, no threat to the
top two. SO IT WOULD SEEM within striking distance in the three path, crept closer late in the turn then lacked further response stretch. BIG JAVA brush,
devoid of early foot, trailed through the turn, four to five wide turning into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. COST A FORTUNE broke out, bothered outer
rival, sprinted clear, continued to show the way into the turn inside, faltered midway on the bend when headed by the winner.

Footnotes
GREATHEART settled firmly in hand off the pace, continued unhurried up the backstretch, swept up four wide to challenge midway on the second turn,
showed the way into the lane, late duel, proved best under firm handling. RIGHT TONE back off the pace while toward the inside for five furlongs, steered
out four wide when moving into a forward position by late in the final turn, challenged outside the winner past the furlong marker, dueled, outkicked for the
win, clearly second best. MR CREED behind the first flight, moved a bit closer to the lead pack by late in the final turn, waited behind that wall of horses in
the two path entering the stretch, altered course to the outside past the furlong marker, up late for the show. GET THROUGH void of speed for five furlongs,
swung out 5w and behind the runner up turning for home, failed to match that one's late run while still managing to improve position. UNIFIED DREAMS
pressed the leader from the two path, weakened in the drive. CONSPIRACY FACT took control just after the start, continued to set the pace in the run up
the backstretch, faltered when headed by the winner late in the final bend, continued to weaken stretch. QUICK TO BLAME prompted the pace while three
wide for six furlongs, gave way in the drive. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR in the second flight toward the inside, had nothing left for the drive. QUALITY RUN
trailed well back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. CHROME'S RIGHT in mid pack early inside, saved ground to no avail in staging a
steady retreat. SHINNECOCK HILLS broke back, improved slightly before a half then showed little.

Footnotes
FULL AUTHORITY moved up to duel along the inside, larger lead into the lane, edged clear under a firm hand ride. FORE LEFT broke on top, showed the
way off the inside, dueled into and through the turn, could not match the winner in the drive, remained clear for the runner up position. DIGITAL in the main
group off the inside, three wide through the turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, remained clear of the others. CHIEF RON off slow and
steadied, trailed early, four wide turning into the stretch, displayed some mild interest while not a menace to the top trio. WHISKEY DOUBLE back off the
pace toward the inside, steered out to be three wide for the drive, improved slightly while not a serious threat. DEFLATER closest to the dueling top two for
three furlongs and began to fade. RIBBONS AND MEDALS in the second flight off the inside, continued to pursue in the two path far turn, backed up
through the stretch. JERRY'S EIGHTY was outrun while three out to four wide turn.

Footnotes
MISSIN CURFEW broke out, bumped foe but was still sharply away, clear before a furlong along the inside, pressured into the lane, headed, battled back in
game fashion to prove best. BACKSIDE BUZZ broke sharp, fell back to stalk the pace off the inside, engaged the leader in the two path turning for home,
put a head in front when straightened for home, dueled to the wire, outgamed in the late going, clearly second best. FUNNY UNCLE in mid pack while
racing off the inside, two path into the lane, dropped to the rail for the stretch, up for the show late, no threat to the top pair. BOLD D'ORO back off the pace
while racing outside, three to four wide into the stretch, closest to the top pair past the furlong marker, outfinished for the show late. PERMAFROST broke
back, lacked speed while remaining out in the strip, came five wide for the drive, improved with a mild rally. PROCHARGER bumped at the break, recovered
to chase the winner up the backstretch just off the inside, remained forward through the bend then faded through the lane. FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER last to
leave, lagged well back off the inside, displayed some late energy up the inside to improve position. DISCOVERY PEAK lacked speed, in some traffic
midway on the turn, went evenly when clear for the drive. OUTLAW RUN bumped, in tight at the break, failed to menace. GOLDEN BANDIT forwardly
placed early outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, gave way through the stretch. CONSTITUTION DAY broke in, bumped with foe, 2nd flight,
through early.
