trailed early, moved closer into the far turn off the inside, angled out three to four wide exiting the final bend, steadily getting to the winner late while up for
the place in the final strides. MO'S MOJO vied up front while between horses, continued to force the issue the middle half, put a head in front turning for
home, raced on equal terms with the winner upper stretch then began to weaken with a furlong to run, continued to falter and was caught late for the second
spot. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) broke sharp, showed the way into the first turn while clearing to the inside, vied the middle four furlongs closest to the rail,
gave way late in the second turn. THUNDERSHOOK moved up to press the issue three wide and between foes, continued to apply pressure from the three
path in the run up the backstretch. PRINCIPE GUILHERME off the pace inside, in some traffic first turn, continued to save ground though the second bend,
came up empty for the drive. MYSTERY MO tucked behind lead pack into the first turn, stalked up the backstretch toward the inside, crept slightly closer
late in the final bend, traffic, little left when clear. PEEKACHO forced the pace four wide first turn, continued outside, four wide again into the far turn, three
wide exiting when tiring. DIAL IN FOR LUTE fell back to trail before a half, continued sluggish into the far turn, distanced through the stretch.

Footnotes
LI'L GRAZEN raced well back off the pace, three to four wide turning into the lane, roused, closed with good energy outside to win going away. VIOLENT
POINT broke sharp, cleared to the inside before a furlong, showed way into the turn, shrugged off a couple of foes entering the stretch to be clear again
when straightened for home, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. SILVIA in the second flight outside, moved closer three wide late in the
turn, failed to sustain that advance through the lane, lasted for the show. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH behind the pace along the inside, continued to save
ground turn, lacked a closing kick. TAP N SWAY in mid pack toward the rail, eased out to be three wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick.
EVERYOTHERWON back off the pace outside, four wide into the lane, also came up empty for the stretch run. CADEAU DE PAIX chased the runner up
toward the inside, closer late in the turn, gave way in the drive. HOPING FOR A RING remained back throughout and was not a factor. A GIRL LIKE ME
brush the gate to be off step slow, trailed.

Footnotes
MIDSUMMER SOIREE closest to the leader up the backstretch, continued to chase that rival into an through the turn from the two path, collared that same
foe with a sixteenth remaining to gain the advantage, enough left late to last. MOR HAPPY HOURS off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn,
set down for the drive, finished willingly to be in time for the place while getting to the winner in the waning strides. JUMPIN JUDY broke on top, soon
sprinted clear, pace, responded when challenged late, gave ground grudgingly to the top two in the final strides. HER NAME WAS LOLA bothered soon
after the start when NAUGHTY MADAM came out, void of speed for a half when trailing, swung out four wide into the lane, improved position with some
mild interest, not a threat to the top three. STAY FABULOUS off a step slow, raced back off the pace, made little impact in the drive. NAUGHTY MADAM
came out early to bother an outer rival, raced forwardly placed early, began a steady fade before a half. I GOT A NAME was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
BELLAMYS ROAN bumped into the first turn, settled in the second flight up the backstretch, four wide advance, challenged turning for home, long drive to
the wire, proved best while fully extended. ALLO ENRY vied up front while between horses, hooked up with the winner turning for home, spirited run to the
wire, proved stubborn to the end. BUDDY REAUX pulled while in some traffic behind the leader first turn, continued to race restrained up the backstretch,
moved out three wide while just inside the winner turning for home, steered out a bit with a furlong to run, mild rally to prove best of the rest. AFLEET SKY
forwardly placed while racing outside, three wide the middle half when forcing the pace, came up empty when called on for the drive. TOPF ROAD RULES
early pace into the first turn, vied while remaining closest to the rail the middle half, weakened in the drive. SMOKIN BOOTS broke back, lacked speed,
three wide into the lane, improved position while not posing a serious threat. HAMAZING WISDOM bumped into the first turn, raced in mid pack off the
inside, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. JACKS SPRING BREAK void of speed while four wide and outside, picked off a couple of tiring
rivals in upper stretch while not a factor. MORNING DRIVE off a step slow, remained always back. GHOST STRATEGY was also always outrun. THE HEAT
IS ON five wide down to four first turn, main body outside, tired.

Footnotes
SIDETOWN broke on top, angled toward the inside when clear, continued to show the way by daylight through the turn while in the two path, remained clear
through the stretch under steady handling. DRILL'S LI'L MAN in the second flight off the inside, came three wide for the drive, chased the winner past the
furlong marker, could do little with that one the final furlong, clearly second best. CALIFORNIA STREET in mid pack while well wide in the run up the
backstretch, five path into the turn, four wide exiting, proved no match for for the top two in the drive, held sway for the show. GENERATOR within striking
distance inside, continued to save ground through the turn, came up empty for the drive. CABOT lacked speed inside, continued to save ground into the
stretch, improved upper stretch, no late gain. GAME DAY PLAY devoid of any early speed, three wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to improve position.
CARL G off a step slow, in some traffic into the turn, four wide entering the stretch, lacked a closing response. HOME BASE one paced well out in the strip,
five wide through much of the turn, lacked a response drive. NATE'S WAY behind the pace out in the strip, four wide turn, failed to mount a bid through the
lane. WIPE THE SLATE chased the winner early, began a steady retreat before a half. FIRST LINE broke back and was never close.

Footnotes
JOKING WAY never far back while racing outside, ranged up to challenge three wide by late in the turn, put a head in front into the stretch, shook clear
when straightened for home and held that advantage to the wire under steady handling. WILD MULE settled in the second group while between horses,
came three wide for the drive, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, game for the place. MO'S TREASURE void of early foot inside, continued to
save ground through the turn, rallied up the inside to annex the show, not enough for the place. COFFEE CALIENTE in the second group inside, remained
close in some traffic midway on the turn, two path into the lane, shifted out, long drive for the place, outkicked. CHOCTAW ZIP last to leave, raced back and
outside, came four wide for the drive, improved position a bit without posing a serious threat. ELI'S PROMISE set or forced the pace off the inside, gave way
in the drive. WESTHEIMER STREET was always outrun. STRAIGHT LUCK broke on top, dueled up front for a half closest to the inside, gave way in the
drive.

Footnotes
OSBOURNE moved up early into a forward position into the turn, advanced and challenged outside the leader into the stretch, drove well clear the final
furlong under a right handed crop. SKELLY dueled early closest to the inside through some quick fractions, shook off the other speed turn, responded when
the winner came alongside turning for home, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, held sway for the place. EFFICIENCY came out early to
bother SPARTY SENSE, was straightened to race in mid pack, three wide into the lane when going one paced, slowly getting to the runner up while also
proving no match for the winner. IGNITIS last to leave, raced back, improved position while not a serious threat. SINNER'S SIN broke well, dueled up front
closest to the inside, began to weakened before a half, continued to fade through the stretch. DEUS EX MACHINA remained back throughout and was
never a factor. SPARTY SENSE floated out early, finished well beaten.

Footnotes
TOWHEAD tracked the pace from along the inside, continued to save ground, boxed in along the rail 2nd turn, steered out three wide into the lane, brush
when angled out a bit furlong, closed with good resolve to be well clear at the end. BOSS LADY BAILEY lacked early foot, second flight while between
horses into the far turn, floated out by the winner inside the furlong marker, brushed with that foe then proved no match while narrowly gaining the nod for
the place. DEAR LADY in the second flight outside, three wide when moving closer in the second turn, took over into the lane, briefly clear past the furlong
marker, proved no match for the winner late, narrowly missed the nod for the place. DEMI off a step slow, lagged in trailing for five furlongs, swung four wide
turning for home, steadily drifted in under a right handed crop through the stretch, mild improvement. UNIFYING forwardly placed off the inside, had little left
for the drive. GOLDBLOODED sprinted clear into the first turn, set the pace toward the inside, gave way when headed exiting the final turn. JET SETTING
never menaced while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
YACHT ROCK (IRE) tracked the leaders in hand off the inside, moved at will to challenge three wide late turn, floated out four wide into the lane, gained
command into the stretch, drifted in past the furlong marker, kept to task late with a brisk left handed crop. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL off slowly, raced well
back early as a result, angled out from three to five wide in some traffic under clever handling late in the turn, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to
be a clear second, no real threat to the winner. EL MONGO broke well, set the pace inside, dueled turn, gradually weakened, finished clear for the show.
RANSAM PAYNTER pressed the issue early outside, dueled turn, came out to float the winner out turning for home, weakened through the lane.
SANTINO'S FANTASY lacked early foot, two path turn, improved a bit into the lane inside of horses, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing punch.
MALORIE'S BIG BOY in the second flight outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. BRILLIANT COLORS saved ground to no avail in
also failing to muster a rally. THINKINGNDRINKING dwelt at the start, trailed most of the way,picked off a couple of tiring foes after the issue had been
decided. CHOWMEIN was finished early, back. MATTFOLEYVANMAN behind the pace three wide, began a steady fade before a half.
