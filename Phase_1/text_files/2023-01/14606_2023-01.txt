PHARAOH'S PROPHECY quickly made the lead from the inside, was nicely rated on the front end, led throughout and remained clear late under firm
handling. BIG FRANK tracked three wide, rallied at the quarter pole and was up for place. STRIKE A BEAT chased the winner throughout and finished
willingly. NATES HEARTTHROB was never far back, rallied five wide in the stretch, lugged in mid stretch and could not gain. JUST CHITU was well placed
and lacked a late response. CAPE MARCO DRIVE was no factor. GET ALONG contended early and tired on the far turn.
