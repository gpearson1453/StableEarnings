ALEXA'S DREAM raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and edged
clear in the lane. PLANE JANE led the field on the outside up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path racing around the bend and was
caught in the final strides. HOT FOOT SUSIE chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and
finished evenly. GALLEY HEAD was fractious in the gate, broke well and trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend, swung
wide into the stretch and never threatened. LIVELY REMARK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, improved position from the four path
coming around the turn and flattened out in the lane.

lane, no match for the winner. TEDDY'S HONOR raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the bend in the three path and finished
