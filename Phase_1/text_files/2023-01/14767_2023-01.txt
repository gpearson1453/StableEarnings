back down the backstretch then made a bid at the quarter pole to improve position in the stretch drive. R T'S GEM saved ground throughout and failed to
menace. EASY ACT was allowed to settled around the first turn then made a mild rail bid down the backstretch and tired. TECHE SOLUTION was never

Footnotes
MASTERLY tracked the leaders down the backstretch from the two path then went three wide at the quarter pole and drew clear late. SUCH was placed off
the pace in the three path then moved to engage the leader and fought gamely to be second best. MORRICONE sprinted to the lead to the quarter pole and
battle to the final sixteenth and weakened. LIKEN IT raced in the middle of the pack from the two path through the final turn and gave a late effort in the
stretch. OPTIMISTIC was forwardly placed while saving ground throughout to no avail. GOLD BEAR settled in the middle of the pack on the inside and
raced evenly. LUNAR LIGHT was allowed to settle but was not a threat. SHAE'S DAY was unhurried and not a factor.

PRESUMPTIVE CLOSER went to a pressured lead to the final turn then was headed by outside rival, dueled to mid stretch but dug in and drew clear.
BELLA'S GATSBY saved ground to the final turn then moved up the rail on the turn then angled out to three wide in upper stretch to prove second best.
MIDNIGHT OIL was bumped by T D Z HI COURT at the start then was placed off the pace in the three path to the final turn, engaged the leader around the
three sixteenths pole and dueled to mid stretch and weakened. ELIJAH'S MOVE was allowed to settle to the final turn then made a rail bid at the quarter
pole, moved out to three to four wide in upper stretch for a late rally but was not enough. SHOETRICK raced near the back down the backstretch then made
a rail bid around the final turn but flattened out. NEPHI was rushed to contention in the early stages from four wide, held that position to the quarter pole and
tired. R T'S IRON MAN stalked the pace from the two path to the final turn and gave way. T D Z HI COURT broke out and bumped MIDNIGHT OIL at the
break then was hustled along to press the pace from the two path to the three eighths pole and stopped.

turn then moved up on the backstretch, was coaxed at the three sixteenths pole and proved second best. TEMPRANO tracked the leaders from the two
path around the first turn then made a bid at the three eighths but was no match for the top two but held on to the show. MIAS MOONBEAM was unhurried
down the backstretch then made a bid from three wide at the quarter pole but was empty late. GETCHA was five wide into the first turn then stalked the
pace down the backstretch and passed tiring rivals. HOLY EMPEROR sprinted to the lead around the first turn then was headed at the five sixteenths pole
and gave way grudgingly. ALWAYS A CATCH was allowed to settle while saving ground to no avail. SOUTHPINE GIFT was close up in the three path in

Footnotes
SCARLETT O'HARA pressed the pace from the two path then took the lead at the five sixteenths pole and held sway. GOLDEN SMILES dueled in the
second flight from the two path to the quarter pole, inched away and moved up on the turn but was no match for the winner. DIAMOND INDY SKIES was
void of speed, made a two to three wide bid on the turn then moved out the three to four wide in upper stretch for a late rally and was just up for the show.
OLIVIAN rushed up to contention from the three path and tired in the drive and just missed the show. TUGBOAT dueled in the second flight from the four
path to the quarter pole and flattened out. BIND ON EARTH dueled in the second flight from the three path to the three eighths pole and finished evenly.
FISH N CHICK dueled in the second flight from the inside to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. JUS MY IMAGINATION went to an early pressured lead
then retreated. SAVANNAH'S HERE dueled in the second flight from the five path to the three eighths pole and gave way.

ICE went to a clear lead around the first turn then was headed at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled around the final turn and weakened. DREWMAZING
failed to menace. THUNDERTAKESDALEAD was unhurried to the final turn made a rail advance on the final turn but was not a factor. UN OJO was allowed
to settle around the first turn and was never a threat. LIFE IS A BANQUET was forwardly placed in the two path and engaged the leader and dueled to the

made a three wide bid at the quarter pole and only passed tiring rivals. RACE DAY MAE had no early speed made a four wide bid at the three eighths pole
and faltered. MY LITTLE GUERA raced in the middle of the pack and was not a factor. LA LA LATTE was not a threat. TALTY was hustled along to press
