Footnotes
JOEY THE FISH got bumped at the start by UKRAINIAN PRINCESS, who recovered outwards from a bobble, grew detached at the tail of the field when
devoid of speed early on chasing three to four paths off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the three-eighths, spun three
wide for home making headway, rallied with choppy action in behind in her hind legs and was up in the last jumps to prevail. UKRAINIAN PRINCESS
bobbled at the start recovering outwards and bumping the aforementioned foe, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four
wide for home, rallied to take command three-sixteenths out, dug in under a drive and was caught in the final strides to the finish. MAIZE LOVED LAFFY
showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from a pair early on before shaking those foes off placed to coaxing near the three-eighths,
got confronted by MY GORGEOUS and was headed for command at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch taking back narrow
command, got headed at the three-sixteenths for good and weakened to the finish. MY GORGEOUS chased along the inside and then just off the inside into
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advancing to take command at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home relinquishing the
front and weakened in the stretch. REIGN OF THUNDER chased three to four wide in aim of the front early on, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and
faded, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and folded. FRANKIE KNOWS BEST chased two to three wide prompting the pace early on before settling
in range of the leader, came under coaxing from the three-eighths and began to retreat, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MELTING SNOW went to the front, showed the way under pressure to her inside, was asked under threat in the two path around the turn, responded well
under strong urging in the stretch and proved best. MON PETIT CHOU pressed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, reached
even terms for the lead at the five-sixteenths, battled inside the winner under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished while clear for the place. DIVA
BANKER settled off the pace, chased three wide around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened while just able to get the show. ROYAL MEGHAN leaned out at the start, settled at the rear on the outside, was roused four wide on
the turn, moved out into upper stretch and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. BLUE PAYNT was well placed towards the front,
dropped back late on the backstretch, moved from the inside to the two path around the turn and came up empty. TRIPLE P settled near the back, was
urged two then three wide around the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VAX dueled inside of SWEET LIBERTY from the get go coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, continued to
battle head to head through the stretch to the finish drifting out late and gamely held on to prevail. SWEET LIBERTY dueled from the two path with VAX to
her inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting gamely in head to head
combat through to the wire but was ultimately denied at the end. GOOD ACCELEBRATE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three
wide down the backstretch before tucking to the inside seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, continued in the inside route
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. GRACEFULNESS broke out at the start and was corrected, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and improved position for the last major share. CUT THE CHECK three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, tipped three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. SNOWY EVENING away to an awkward beginning, chased along the inside under
a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BANDULU QUEEN chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking three then two wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide at the head of the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
PATRICK THE GREAT went to the front then shook clear early, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two path around the turn,
responded well under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, disposed of the runner-up inside that
marker, drew off under a drive to near the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride while much the best. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS followed the solo
leader down the backstretch, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, gained late on the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn, made a
bid outside the quarter-pole, fought outside of the winner to the furlong marker then proved no match while clear for the place. REUNION TOUR acted-up
just before the start and was last to commence but broke with the rest of the field, was urged along off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths,
chased in the four path around the turn and tired while able to get the show. BERNARDINO was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace,
rounded the turn in the two path, angled out while still on his inside lead in upper stretch then swapped to the proper lead and failed to threaten.
BOINTHEBACK dropped back near the three-quarter pole, went two then three wide around the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor.
TYRANNOSAURUS REX settled on the outside, was roused late on the backstretch, went four wide under urging on the turn and failed to respond. TIZA
BROWN settled on the inside, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path under the crop and faltered. TIMES WERE
ADDED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW.

Footnotes
STORIED FELLA bobbled at the start but broke near the front, was sent hard to the lead, moved to a solo advantage inside the three-quarter pole, dictated
terms while inside around the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage into upper stretch, drew off under the crop until the
sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best. CHEEKY TICO stalked the pace down the backstretch, chased in
the three path around the turn, jostled with an opponent into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. MO REWARDS
tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn, jostled with a foe into upper stretch and weakened but just earned the show.
CENTAVO settled just off the pace then dropped back, was urged while moving from three to five wide around the turn and just missed the show. STRONG
LIGHT stumbled very awkwardly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front many lengths, saved ground around the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and improved position. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS showed speed on the outside of the winner, dropped back inside the three-quarter pole then
chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, spun four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SALUTE TO AMERICA settled just off the pace,
was asked late on the backstretch, dropped back into the turn, moved from the rail to the two path around that bend and faltered.

CEES GET DEGREES dueled three then two wide before taking to the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and shaking off his
main rival nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. LIFE CHANGER five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild kick. RYAN'S CAT broke in at the start bumping GASLIGHT in tandem with CATCHYASOON, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. GASLIGHT got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his
way, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went six wide
into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. HANDSOME CAT coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, continued
in the inside route into upper stretch, weakened. BEZOS dueled four then three wide, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths and was
shaken off nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home and tired. CATCHYASOON broke out at the start bumping GASLIGHT in concert with
RYAN'S CAT, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide at the top of the stretch, tired.
DIGITAL FUTURE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
angled out five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
EAST COAST GIRL was away awkwardly then hustled to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, dictated terms while inside around the turn, drew
off under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. TUNNEL VISION was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down
the backstretch, went two then three wide around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. P
MONEY broke in then hit the gate and was off a step slow, settled on the far outside, was urged four wide on the turn and missed the place while clear for
the show. HELICOPTER MONEY was sent hard from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path and tired.
VOLCKER RULES broke a step slow then dropped well behind under urging while showing no speed, saved ground around the turn and was no factor.
GARTH ROAD was away alertly, dropped back under urging, went three to five wide around the turn and faltered then pulled up injured after the race and
was vanned off.
