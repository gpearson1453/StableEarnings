Footnotes
NORDIC LIGHT never far back with a rail run, angled out around the far turn, rallied in the stretch run and drove clear. LEAD ACTOR unhurried to the half,
circled field past quarter pole to run on for place spot. COMMAND CENTRAL never far back, rallied far turn four wide into stretch for the show dough.
SHERLOCKED pressed, tracked leader to far turn, gained a narrow lead but weakened in the late stages. BAD JOKE WOKE FOLK trailed to the half,
passed some tired ones while never a real threat. TIGERITO rail speed to the front, stayed game to stretch but folded late. OVER CALENDARED lunged at
the start, lost best chance, raced up inside to far turn but used up and faded back. MIGHTY RIOT tried to keep up for a half but gave way willingly and faded
from far turn. B G LEE could not keep up to far turn, gave way past quarter pole to wire.
