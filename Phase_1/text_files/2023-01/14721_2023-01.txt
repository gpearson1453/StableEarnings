Footnotes
B B GUN BULLSEYE set the pace, showed the way from a trio of outer pressers around the turn, inched narrowly clear at the quarter pole, and held sway.
ANSLIE'S GUMDROP broke through the gate pre-race, but remained in the grasps of the assistant starter, quickly reloaded without further incident, pressed
the leader from the outside, then from between rivals around the turn, briefly failed to keep pace with that one entering the lane, and chased her home well.
MY ROYAL PRINCESS raced forwardly four wide, pressed around the turn, but yielded leaving the quarter pole, gave way while hanging on her left lead,
yet saved show from an inner rival at the wire. EASY ACES laid off of the pace two wide, tucked entering the turn, saved ground, sustained a rail chase to
bid for show in the closing stages, but narrowly missed. SADIE'S PORT lacked speed in the three path around the turn, fanned to the seven path in upper
stretch, and moved up willingly. BLESS D'SOUTH tracked from the two path, chased from the between horses nearing midstretch while giving way.
HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT broke a step slow while last away from the gates, rushed between horses to stalk three wide, but came under a stiff drive while
among foes into the turn, and weakened turning for home. GRACE'S VISION took a mild brush from an inner rival in the early stages, and was outrun
thereafter.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE STAR laid close up along the inside of the pace setter, backed off to stalk nearing the turn, shifted course outside of that rival soon after, but
failed to keep pace while drifting to the three path entering the lane, yet recovered quickly, sustained a chase, closed in as the leader tired in the final
furlong, ranged up to her entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. RUBY BEGONIA emerged from between horses to set the pace two wide, cleared her
inner counterpart entering the turn, maneuvered to the rail soon after, inched further clear of her chasing challenger entering the lane, but hung on her left
lead through midstretch, began to tire entering the final furlong, was collared while changing over at the sixteenth pole, and was bested late. JUST
ANOTHER WIN broke a beat slow, trailed, and rallied along the rail to gain show at the furlong grounds. SWEET VIDALIA was slow into stride early on
while mildly shying from an inner rival, laid off of the pace four wide, came into the lane in the five path, and ran on willingly. WHY WAIT chased from
midpack along the inside, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, and yielded between horses. MRS. NECAISE stalked three wide, but faded around the
turn. REALITOS broke step slow, lacked speed three wide despite constant all-out urging from the rider into the turn, and faded.

edged clear in the late stages. THE BOSS SOSS vied for the lead outside of the pace setter while remaining a path away from that rival, which allowed for Z
RESURRECTION to bid between them at the nine sixteenths pole, sparred with that foe after tucking two wide into the far turn, drew clear entering the lane,
but was challenged by an outer bidder leaving the furlong pole, and failed to keep pace in the final sixteenth. GOBOT laid off of the pace in the three to two
paths, shifted to the four path to chase in upper stretch, and ran on while one-paced. STIFF DRINK got keen when taking back behind rivals crossing the
wire for the first time, trailed, improved in the three to four paths around the far turn, fanned to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. Z
RESURRECTION hopped slightly while breaking a step slow, tugged while stalking behind the top pair around the first turn, split them to bid with seven
sixteenths to go, dueled with an outer rival while tucking to the rail into the far turn, but weakened nearing the lane. MY LIL DUDE vied for the lead inside of
a sparring rival, met another foe's challenge nearing the far turn, and weakened entering it.

Footnotes
QUICK MUNNY cleared early on, opened up while well in hand around the turn, then steadily drifted out through the final furlong, yet lasted safely from an
inner chaser. READY FOR CHANGE gained place from outer rivals with nine sixteenths to go, chased the clear leader from the rail around the turn, then
pursued on her left lead through the lane to prove second best. DONYA KNOW IT settled off of the pace, took the turn in the four path while outside of foes,
and moved up entering the lane. O'BABE tracked two wide and between horses through the opening quarter mile, but failed to sustain that position nearing
the turn, and failed to factor thereafter. ONAMARGARITADAY chased in the three path, and tired.

Footnotes
CHARRIERE set the pace inside of a vying rival while a bit off of the rail, shook free entering the lane, and drew further away with good energy. BLAME
DAY stalked in the four path, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader while gaining place in upper stretch, and chased that foe well through the final
furlong. LADY DREAMER stalked along the inside, chased through midstretch, but yielded through the final furlong, and dead-heated for show.
MARGOINABUBBLEBATH bumped the inner part of the gate causing her to bobble a bit at the start, then was herded into inner rivals soon after, tracked
two wide under firm restraint, shifted out to the five path leaving the five sixteenths pole, vied for minor placings while hanging on her left lead through upper
stretch, but lost momentum when drifting in while changing leads inside the final three sixteenths, evened out thereafter, and dead-heated for show. BELLA
PALOMA settled off of the pace in the two path, then lacked the needed kick while just missing reaching show between horses late. WAIT ON ME was
bumped between horses and put to crowded quarters soon after the start, lacked speed in the four to five paths, came into the lane in the six path, and
failed to factor. ROLL GYPSY ROLL was squeezed back between horses soon after the start, trailed in the four path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and
made little impact. DIVINA DULCE came out at the start and bumped a rival into other foes, vied for the lead outside of the pace setter and from the three
path, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole. SMART IZZY was bumped by rivals on both sides while put to tight quarters in the early
stages, and got outrun along the inside.

BIG BLUE LINE stalked along the inside, pursued the top pair from the pocket around the far turn, tipped outside of them leaving the quarter pole, bid in
upper stretch, and drove clear through the final furlong. NELSON AVENUE stalked outside of the pace setter, pressed into the far turn, vied turning for
home and through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder nearing the furlong grounds, and secured place from his inner counterpart in the final
sixteenth. TREASURY set the pace, dug in turning for home as an outer rival bid, fought on gamely inside of a pair of foes in upper stretch once the
eventual winner joined the fray, but was outkicked by that one at the furlong grounds, and yielded. BEAVER HAT tracked three wide, but faded after being
floated four wide entering the lane. CAPTIVATING MOON trailed, improved in the four path turning for home, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and
failed to factor. NEPOTISM laid off of the pace in the two path, but faded.

Footnotes
OEUVRE stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of CHARLIE T turning for home and sparked a duel, sparred through upper stretch while drifting out,
wrestled an advantage entering the final furlong, flopped back to her left lead nearing the final sixteenth, and edged away from her inner counterpart in the
closing stages. CHARLIE T broke out at the start, set the pace along the inside, dug in turning for home as an outer OEUVRE menaced, gamely clung to an
advantage through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds, fought on, but gave way in the final sixteenth. ASTUTE was brushed by an inner
rival into an outer foe before checking from crowded quarters in the early stages, laid off of the pace three wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, and
rallied willingly. ABOUKIR BAY lagged behind around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, and rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to reach
a minor placing late. EVE'S DELIGHT chased two wide and between horses, but steadily yielded through the lane. NEW BOSS brushed an outer rival in the
early stages while achieving inside tracking position, but only managed to chase through upper stretch before fading. TOUCH OF CLASS brushed with
rivals on both sides while being put to crowded quarters in early staged, saved ground off of the pace, then lacked a bid between horses in the final furlong.
VIOLENZA took brushes from an inner rival early on, tracked three wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but yielded between rivals at the furlong
grounds.

Footnotes
BOSS' DIALIN IN took back from uncomfortable quarters between horses early on, raced at the rear four wide into the turn, knifed through the field three to
two wide around the bend, tipped four wide entering the lane, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch bid at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear.
TRUMPTASTIC lacked speed, tucked two wide and between horses entering the turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach
place at the wire. TIM TAL broke out and bumped a rival, prompted the pace three wide, led at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear entering the lane, but
offered little resistance to the eventual winner's bid at the furlong grounds, gave way, and was caught at the wire for place. BOURBON DAY took a bump
from an inner rival at the start, chased from midpack in the five path, floated to the seven path in upper stretch by an inner rival, and stayed on along with
that foe late. OVERANALYTICAL saved ground off of the pace, bumped an outer rival while shifting three wide and between horses in midstretch, but
lacked a bid. WAR ROOM tracked in the four path around the turn, got bumped by an inner rival in midstretch, and made little impact. CLOUD WITHOUT
REIN set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals into the turn, but failed to keep pace with his widest counterpart turning for home, and caved.
TRYSTINTHENITEAWAY was briefly keen between horses early on, then never got involved thereafter. G'S MILLION vied for the lead two wide and
between horses, but weakened while hanging on his left lead. LITTLE MAN CAN raced far back in the four path into the turn, and showed little.
