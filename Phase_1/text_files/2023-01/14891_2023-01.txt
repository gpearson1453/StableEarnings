Footnotes
CHLOE'S CROWN stalked the pace from inside, ran up behind the leader on the far turn and had to pause momentarily, tipped off the rail in the lane, drew
alongside the runner-up late and drove past. SAREEHA (IRE) came out in the beginning, went up to take control while keen early racing first time through
the stretch, controlled the pace to the far turn, roused with a quarter mile left to run, put to left handed urging in the furlong grounds and while still clear, then
got run down by CHLOE'S CROWN in the final strides. EXIT SOUL hopped slightly at the start, was closest in pursuit outside the leader in the two path to
the far turn, chased between rivals into the drive, lost momentum in the furlong grounds and churned on to hold the show. INFINITE EMPIRE got floated out
by SAREEHA (IRE) at the start, steadied behind that rival then started to pull and became rank, stalked the pace outside a rival, took aim three deep into
the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. TALENTED LADY hit the gate and came away slow, lagged behind under coaxing, eased off the rail and
came three wide into the stretch and failed to menace. TIZ MY PRINCESS settled on the inside, angled three wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
HAVNAMELTDOWN sped to the front from inside, coaxed along on the turn, urged left handed in upper stretch, continued clear into the final sixteenth while
switching to the right hand and held safely under steady handling late. FAUSTIN brushed with FORT WARREN leaving the chute, stalked the pacesetter on
the inside into the turn, roused on the turn while moving to the two path, chased the winner through the lane and whittle the gap late while clearly second
best. FORT WARREN brushed with FAUSTIN leaving the chute, moved out into the clear then raced a bit green with his head turned up the backstretch,
angled down to the rail around the bend and was along for the show. MAN CHILD raced up close to the outside of the winner, chased outside FAUSTIN on
the turn, three wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
GEAUX ROCKET RIDE vied for the lead from inside then inched ahead to take control, set the pace under pressure to the turn, shook free at the
five-sixteenths pole, then widened under left handed urging. SONORAN pressed the winner from outside, could not keep pace at the five-sixteenths pole,
chased two wide into the lane and bested the rest. EVER A REBEL showed early speed then chased outside the top pair, spun three wide into the lane and
lacked a bid while holding third. UNCLE JAKE broke slow and inward, coaxed along to get into range then rushed up and had to steady behind rivals at the
half-mile pole, chased along the rail through the turn and flattened out in the drive. SPEED OF THE NILE tracked off the rail, started to weaken three wide
on the turn and had little left for the drive. TAPIT DOWN was off slow to begin, dropped far back early, took the turn four wide and showed little.

GOLDEN AGAIN bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, stalked out of range early on, rounded the bend two wide, challenged from outside with a furlong
remaining, took over and cleared MISS BELLIMBUSTO and held safely over the runner-up. GRAZED MY HEART unhurried in the beginning, went two wide
into the turn, moved to the rail then went between runners around the bend, moved out then drifted out a bit in the stretch, corrected with the right hand and
finished determinedly but was too late. MISS BELLIMBUSTO vied three deep then dueled from outside up the backstretch, cleared inner rival at the
five-sixteenths pole, showed the way two wide into the stretch, challenged at the eighth pole and relinquished the lead in midstretch, then flattened to third.
BALENCIAGA BETTY was off a bit slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch, went two wide around the bend, moved out in the lane and summoned a mild
rally. DADDY CLASSY DILL bobbled crossing over the dirt, steadied briefly behind a rival nearing the half-mile pole, took the turn three then four wide and
improved position. HIALEAH HOTTIE went up to vie for the lead inside a pair of rivals then dueled with MISS BELLIMBUSTO up the backstretch, lost touch
with that rival at the five-sixteenths pole and retreated. BLACKENED broke a step slow, bumped and had her path taken at the start, chased on the inside
off the pace, eased off the rail around the bend, moved out in the lane and weakened. BYE BYE BUGGSY hopped a bit at the start, traveled in mid-pack
two wide, came three wide into the stretch, drifted to the rail and failed to menace. SMOKEM FOR YOU vied between then ceded control and moved inside
to chase, dropped back along the rail on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
HIGH HEATER pulled between rivals on the first turn, pressed from outside on the backstretch and far turn, took over at the top of the lane, cleared with a
furlong left to run and held well in the end. NEXT REVOLT stalked the pace along the inside, angled out leaving the far turn and into the stretch, finished
willingly outside the winner late but needed to find more. NO HANG CHARLIE dueled for the lead two wide into the first turn then moved inside and cleared
leaving the bend, set the pace under pressure from HIGH HEATER on the backstretch, maintained a short lead through the far turn, lost command at the
top of the lane and flattened to third. BIG BUZZ tracked three in the three path early on, navigated the far turn four then five wide and could not rally.
MONGOLIAN FORD dueled three wide outside NO HANGE CHARLIE into the first turn, ceded command around the bend, stalked three deep in the middle
stages, came four wide into the stretch, weakened.

Footnotes
EL POTENTE set the pace inside a rival up the backstretch, maintained a short lead around the bend, shook free nearing the stretch, powered away when
asked with the right handed and coasted in hand late. DEVIL MOON tracked three deep early, moved up outside the top pair on the turn, spun three wide
into the lane, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on to prove second best. GREENBOW was off slow to begin, was a bit rank crossing over
the dirt, advanced three wide around the turn and kept on to earn the show honors. BELMONT BILL was off a bit slow, was keen early tugging along
stalking the pace, hit the rail and had the rider lose his right iron at the five-sixteenths pole, regained a footing at the top of the stretch and kept on for a
minor award. STORMING CHROME pressed the pace in hand from outside, remained alongside around the bend then lost touch into the stretch and
weakened. UPRIGHT was off a bit slow in the beginning, steadied crossing the dirt, steadied again at the three-eighths pole, tipped three wide, angled out
further in the lane and lacked a rally. HONEYMOON SUITE settled inside, moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. ANDROS stalked off the rail then
suffered a mild shuffle into the turn, went two wide around the bend and weakened. NAUGHTY NIKO broke out and bumped rival, got crowded between
rivals early, went three wide around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LANE WAY forwardly placed outside the top pair early on, bid three deep at the half-mile pole, dueled across the dirt, took over and kicked clear in upper
stretch and drew away. MOTORIOUS (GB) got bumped and crowded leaving the gate, bumped with COULTHARD (IRE) in the early going, settled inside
and saved ground to the stretch, tipped out and rallied between rivals midstretch and gained the place. RESPECT THE CODE bobbled and bumped with
rival at the start, stalked off the rail then moved inside on the turn, steered out at the top of the stretch and got outfinished for second. YENG AGAIN bumped
leaving the gate, stepped to the front inside pair of rivals, showed the way down the hill, dueled across the dirt, could not kick on with the winner in upper
stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. NERO raced three deep at the back, four wide into the lane and could not rally. LAMBEAU stumbled and
bumped inner rival in the beginning, raced up close outside the pacesetter then between foes on the turn, chased the top pair two then three wide leaving
the bend and weakened. COULTHARD (IRE) was off a bit slow and lost his path in the beginning, bumped early then became rank between rivals early,
continued to give chase between foes around the turn, angled to the inside in the stretch and failed to menace.

THIRSTY sped clear and crossed over into the two path, moved to the rail around the bend while still confidently ridden, given his cue in upper stretch,
urged right handed once midstretch and widened under steady handling. REGULATION DAZED bumped leaving the gate, drifted in and bumped LOGON
TO WIN early, stalked two wide into the turn, asked three wide into the lane and bested the rest. LOGON TO WIN bumped with REGULATION DAZED at
the start, was bumped again and crowded by that rival, from the five-eighths pole to the nine-sixteenths marker, chased near the inside then two wide into
the stretch and was along the for the show. CHAOKOON was closest in pursuit outside to the outside of THIRSTY in the early going, chased two wide
through the turn and into the lane and flattened between rivals to fourth. EXTRA INNINGS bobbled leaving the gate, stalked the pace on the inside, cut the
corner into the lane and weakened. BIG DRINKER was off slow in the beginning, moved into range four deep, started the turn five wide, exited the bend four
wide and weakened. VINCE'S CORNER hit the gate, got shuffled back early, trailed to the stretch, angled out in the lane and was not a factor. UNCLE
WALT was off a bit slow from inside, angled out and went between rivals, took the turn four then three wide, shifted ground in upper stretch and weakened.
