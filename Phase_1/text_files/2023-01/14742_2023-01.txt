Footnotes
HEJAZI broke a step slow then went up to take control from inside, set the pace under pressure from SULLY, shook free into the stretch and held safely
under hand urging. WORCESTER broke well and settled into a stalking position off the rail, went two wide into the turn, moved out and took aim three wide
into the lane, finished determinedly through the lane and closed the gap on the winner while proving second best. SULLY brushed the gate but still came
away quickly, pressed HEJAZI from outside into and around the turn, lost touch with that rival into the stretch and flattened to third. I DON'T GET IT hit the
gate to come away a bit slow, had to steady early, steered to the inside and moved into range, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane and lacked a late bid.
TIZ TOK settled off the pace, rounded the bend two wide and could not rally. SPEED OF THE NILE was off slow and bobbled at the start, split foes through
a tight spot early, chased three deep into the turn, continued three wide into the lane and weakened. THE LAST ONE PERK threw his head at the start and
bobbled a bit to come away slow, lagged behind up the backstretch off the rail, angled to the inside around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
A BROKEN BREEZE stalked in the two path, moved out and went four wide into the far turn, ranged up outside the top pair at the quarter pole, took over in
upper stretch, drew clear and at the eighth pole and was kept to task to the wire. SACRED BEAUTY stalked along the inside through both turns, asked right
handed into the stretch and gained the place. SHVERE ARBETER vied for the lead from inside then took control around the clubhouse turn then cleared,
got pressured by SECRET SQUARE in the middle stages, put away that rival nearing the quarter pole but was soon challenged by A BROKEN BREEZE,
fought with that rival into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third in the late stages. CHAO MAR broke a step slow, trailed three wide
early, rounded the far turn in the two path and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. SECRET SQUARE led two wide into the first turn then lost
command around the bend, chased briefly then went up to press the pace from outside on the backstretch, stayed alongside then failed to keep up with a
quarter mile left to run and weakened in the lane. HOT ON THE TRAIL chased three wide early, lost ground around the second bend, came four wide into
the stretch and also weakened.

over into the far turn and cleared outer rival, met the challenge from HOLDEN THE LUTE past the five-sixteenths pole, moved clear again in upper stretch

LOW EXPECTATIONS bumped inner rival early, dueled for the lead outside a rival four wide into the first turn, cleared and moved into the two path around
the bend, pressured from outside at the half-mile pole, inched ahead again, challenged from inside at the three-eighths pole but quickly cleared that rival
again, engaged by LOOKS RARE with a quarter mile remaining, maintained a short advantage through the lane and gamely prevailed. LOOKS RARE away
quickly from inside then drifted out prior to the first turn, dueled three wide into the bend, angled to the rail and ceded control to LOW EXPECTATIONS,
switched to the outside of that rival, applied pressure at the half-mile pole, lost tough briefly then re-engaged the leader at the quarter pole, fought through
the lane from outside but could not get by. RUSSELLS HUSTLE lost his path early and steered to the inside to stalk the pace, put in a mild bid at the
three-eighths pole but could not keep up around the far turn, moved off the rail in the stretch and held the show. DEEP RIVER got shuffled back between
rivals early, chased off the rail and steadied when LOOKS RARE angled out on the first turn, tracked four wide into the second bend, angled down to the
two path and lacked a rally. GLENDALE had his path taken and clipped heels in the beginning, trailed on the inside, came two wide into the stretch and
failed to menace. DONTTESTYOURLUCK got shuffled between rivals early, chased five then four wide on the first turn, remained wide into the second
bend, moved down to the two path, came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. REIGN OVER ME bumped and checked between foes
early, chased six then five wide early on, entered the far turn six wide, moved down to the three path, came four wide into the drive and failed to menace.

MY HARBORS DREAM chased outside a rival then was closest in pursuit into the turn, bid from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, took over with a quarter
mile left to run, put away SAWASDEE past the eighth pole and widened in deep stretch. SONIC BREES chased three deep into the turn, asked three wide
into the lane and edged SAWASDEE for the place honors. SAWASDEE sprinted clear and crossed over, led along the rail into the turn, challenged from
outside at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command at the quarter pole, fought on to the eighth pole then could not go on with the winner and got edged for the
place. JOKER BOY hopped and came away slow, angled down to the inside giving chase near the back, steered out on the turn and entered the lane four
wide, kept on for a minor award but failed to threaten. MIGHTY MATT chased from off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, angled out into the
stretch and lacked further response. PAUL VINCENTS POEM stalked from inside into the turn, raced two wide into the lane and weakened. SITTIN ON GO
bumped with BIG BAD GARY at the start, chased three deep near the back leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide around the turn, got floated out
into the stretch and was not persevered with late. BIG BAD GARY bumped with inner rival and became rank at the start, trailed four wide leaving the
backstretch, angled to the inside on the turn and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
TRAEGAR stalked the leaders from outside early, bid three deep around the bend, dueled outside HOPKINS in the stretch, put in nose in front entering the
final sixteenth and dug in late to prevail. HOPKINS pressed the pace from inside then moved up to duel leaving the backstretch, took over and vied with
rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, held a short lead over TRAEGAR entering the final furlong, lost the lead outside the sixteenth pole but fought back
gamely to the wire. CLEM LABINE dropped back early, trailed two wide into the turn, angled out leaving the bend and into the stretch, summoned a mild
rally and gained the show. MCLAREN VALE broke a step slow, was coaxed to a forward position early, raced in the two path nearing the turn then angled to
the inside, saved ground to the stretch while being asked and failed to offer the needed response. I GOT NO MUNNY stalked from inside early then shifted
to the two path nearing the turn, steered out and came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. TOOK CHARGE set the pace outside HOPKINS then
dueled with that rival leaving the backstretch, vied between foes past the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with those rivals into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
KIRSTENBOSCH coaxed early chasing from along the rail, ridden along into the far turn, asked around right handed around the bend, took aim two to three
wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane, drew alongside GANADORA in the final sixteenth, took a bump from that rival and got up at the wire.
GANADORA was antsy in the gate, broke out and bumped rival, sped to the front in the two path then cleared inner rival and moved inside, took pressure
from outside up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and lost command at the quarter pole, fought back from inside and regained the lead in upper
stretch, shook free past the eighth pole, challenged by KIRSTENBOSCH with a sixteenth remaining, drifted out and bumped that rival and was nailed on the
line. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH hopped slightly and got bumped by GANADORA at the start, tucked inside at the back early, passed a few rivals then gained
ground through the far turn, tipped out into the stretch and edged ANGEL NADESHIKO for the show honors. ANGEL NADESHIKO was antsy in the gate,
raced up close on the inside then ceded control to GANADORA, switched to the outside and went up to press the pace, dueled on the far turn and took over
at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, flattened in the late stages and lost the show. UNDER THE STARS chased three wide early,
asked nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, weakened on the far turn, eased through the stretch and walked off. NATURAL COLOUR (GB) was antsy in the
gate, stalked outside a rival early, dropped back to last leaving the backstretch, tired on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
RECALL AND RELOAD was off a bit slow from outside, chased widest up the backstretch, bid four deep on the turn, drifted in a bit in the lane, put a head in
front past the sixteenth pole and inched ahead to prove best. ANARCHIST stalked the speed from inside into the turn, waited for room leaving the bend,
lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch, found room midstretch, finished gamely inside rivals and got up for second. GOT THUNDER chased three wide
into the turn, engaged the top pair from outside around the bend, gained the lead outside the eighth pole, carried a short lead into the final sixteenth and
yielded grudgingly late. AUGUSTA MELODY dueled for the lead inside THALES, held a short lead over a trio of runners to the outside leaving the far turn,
lost command in upper stretch and weakened late. THALES dueled outside AUGUSTA MELODY early, vied between rivals past the quarter pole, fought to
the eighth pole and weakened. REDLINE lacked early speed then moved into range up the backstretch, trailed two wide around the bend, angled out in
upper stretch and failed to threaten.
