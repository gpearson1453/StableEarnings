Footnotes
DR. FLASH DANCER broke in a bit at the start and crowded AFFIRM CHIEF, showed early speed and dictated terms to the turn, well handled while carving
moderate fractions to the quarter marker, extended the lead into upper stretch and drew away under hand urging in the final sixteenth. TRIPLE E forwardly
placed in the early stages,stalked the moderate pace to the quarter marker, lost ground to the winner in upper stretch, could not make headway in the final
sixteenth and stayed on to be second best. AFFIRM CHIEF crowded by DR. FLASH DANCER at the start, was green in the early stages, chased the
moderate early pace from the rail, finished evenly in the drive and was well clear in the end for third. MANY AMBITIONS took back in the early stages,
advanced three wide on the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and did not mount a late rally. THECHIEFHASTRICKS lunged at the start and was off slowly,
settled off of the moderate early pace, dropped back on the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MR NAVIGATOR rated off of the fast early pace, tracked the dueling pacesetters to the second turn, assumed command leaving the quarter marker,
extended the lead in upper stretch and was set down for the drive, felt late pressure from HANS GRUBER, determinedly dug in in deep stretch and held that
foe at bay in the final strides to prevail. HANS GRUBER allowed to settle, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch run, came within aim of MR
NAVIGATOR inside of the furlong marker, battled the winner to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides, while clear of the rest for second.
SPEED GRAZY unhurried in the early stages, roused four then five wide into the stretch run, closed well in the late stages and was up for third in the final
strides. NIGHT PROOF settled in the second flight, advanced on the second turn, angled three wide for the stretch drive, finished evenly in the final furlong
and was outfinished for third. BORKAN sent to the early lead, set fast fractions while pressed by SUMO to the half-mile marker, was overtaken by MR
NAVIGATOR leaving the quarter pole and faded in the stretch. SUMO hustled to be prominent in the early going, engaged with BORKAN and pressed that
rival through fast fractions to the far turn, could not keep pace leaving the quarter marker and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
IRISH ROYALTY tracked the early pace, advanced while four wide or three deep nearing the turn, pressed the pace outside of ALTITUDE on the turn,
assumed command leaving the quarter marker, switched leads nearing the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. BIG STICK crowded
by ALTITUDE soon after the break, chased from the second flight, raced two wide to the quarter marker, tipped three wide for the drive, bumped ALTITUDE
nearing the furlong grounds, made a good late rally inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in IRISH ROYALTY in the final stages and held safely for
place. ALMONT broke in good order and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while racing in the two path to the quarter marker, lost the lead to
IRISH ROYALTY nearing the top of the lane, chased that foe to mid-stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was clear for third in the late stages. LOKI OF
ASGARD crowded soon after the break, showed good early speed and raced close to the pace heading to the turn, lost ground on the turn and lacked a late
response. SUN AND SURF chased the early pace, was outrun on the turn, ran evenly in the stretch run and did not threaten in the late stages. ALTITUDE
drifted in soon after the break and crowded LOKI OF ASGARD and BIG STICK, recovered and was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the pace
between rivals to the quarter marker, was bumped by BIG STICK nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final furlong. UPDRAFT chased the early
pace, lost contact on the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
DRUIDIC crowded at the start by CORK MASTER, was unhurried in the early stages, trailed to the quarter marker, circled five wide for the drive, advanced
nearing the furlong marker, mounted a bold late rally, overtook the top pair inside of the sixteenth-marker and edged away in the final strides. GROSS
PROFIT forwardly placed in the early stages, prompted the modest pace to the second turn, battled with EYESA SPECIAL to mid-stretch, bumped with that
rival nearing the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by DRUIDIC in deep stretch and held safely in the end for place. EYESA SPECIAL sent from the inside
leaving the break, set pedestrian fractions through the backstretch run, confronted by GROSS PROFIT nearing the top of the lane, battled with that foe to
mid-stretch, could not keep pace inside of the furlong marker and weakened, while clear of the rest for show. START THEM UP allowed to settle, well
positioned through the backstretch run, roused four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that effort in the drive and flattened in the late stages.
LIBERTY WOLF a bit keen while in tight quarters on the first turn, tracked the modest pace while well placed through the backstretch run, slipped to the rail
along the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. MIQUEAS forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the modest fractions to
the second turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, asked for run in mid-stretch and lacked a late response. CORK MASTER hopped leaving the start,
impeded DRUIDIC and was away a step slowly, unhurried in the early stages, checked while in tight quarters nearing the far turn, lacked room approaching
the top of the lane and tired in the final stages. PASSION OF JOE'S stalked the modest early pace, raced three wide to the half-mile marker, maintained
position to the three-sixteenths marker and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
BOB'S VAI off a half-step slowly then sent along the inside to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, confronted by A ROUSING
BABE in upper stretch, quickened when challenged by that rival nearing the furlong marker, determinedly held in deep stretch and kept to task in the final
strides to prevail. A ROUSING BABE crowded by DANIELLE'S SECRET at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the moderate early pace, advanced
two wide on the turn, confronted BOB'S VAI in upper stretch, lost a bit of ground to that rival nearing the furlong pole, re-rallied in deep stretch for one last
attempt and could not get by the determined winner in the final strides, while besting the rest. PATSY MONTANA allowed to settle in the early stages, saved
ground on the turn, advanced nearing the furlong marker, finished well in the final sixteenth and was up for third in the final strides. YODERANDO chased
the moderate early pace, lost ground while four wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker and just missed for show in
the final strides. LOVE LOST unhurried in the early stages, swung widest for the stretch drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and showed good late interest, while
unable to impact the leaders. DANIELLE'S SECRET broke out and crowded A ROUSING BABE at the start, chased the moderate early pace, saved ground
on the turn, advanced nearing the furlong marker and lacked a final kick in deep stretch. BET DE VRON broke alertly, ceded the early lead to BOB'S VAI
and tracked that rival to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
BETTOR TRIP NICK off a step slow then hustled to the front, set an uncontested lead to the quarter pole, repelled a challenge from WINDRIBBON at the
top of the stretch, ran on well under aggressive handling and held off all late challengers. PAPAPIFAS broke well but did not engage for the early lead,
saved all the ground into the turn, came under a ride from the five-sixteenths pole, gained on the leader despite racing on the wrong lead, swung out a path
near the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the winner but ran out of ground. AWESOME DUDE came under a snug early hold and tracked the field from the
rear of the compact field, was asked in earnest with a quarter mile to run, swung four wide into the stretch, was still last with a furlong to go but closed fast in
deep stretch and gained the show. FOREIGN PROTOCOL tracked three wide under restraint down the backstretch, lost some ground near the half mile
pole but rallied in the turn, continued to run on well through the stretch but was unable to improve position. WINDRIBBON tracked the early leader under
restraint, moved to challenge on the turn, got to the flank of the leader approaching the eighth pole then tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SUGAR BEETS settled in the second flight in the early going, raced between rivals while advancing nearing the half-mile marker, gained ground on the
second turn, swung four then five wide for the drive, continued to rally in mid-stretch, closed determinedly in deep stretch, outfinished COOLCROSS in the
late stages and prevailed in a drive in the final strides. COOLCROSS tracked the pace from the second flight in the early stages, saved ground while
advancing on the second turn, made a three wide bid into the stretch run, chased THEYREMINISCEOVERU to mid-stretch, vied for the lead nearing the
sixteenth-marker, met the bid of SUGAR BEETS in deep stretch and was gamely bested by that rival in the final strides, while holding safely in the end for
second. THEYREMINISCEOVERU raced closest to the loose leader in the early stages, tracked DIAMOND BLITZ to the half-mile marker, vied for the lead
while two wide nearing the quarter pole, assumed command in upper stretch and led to the furlong marker, could not keep pace in deep stretch and was
outfinished for second, while holding for third. MAGIC TIGER threw his head at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, trailed
into the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, lacked room in mid-stretch, found his best stride late and just missed for third. WELLSWORT (IRE) allowed
to settle, made a steady gain on the backstretch and into the far turn, came in tight in upper stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response.
POUR ON THE COLE took back off of the early pace and tracked from the second flight, advanced on the backstretch run, loomed three wide on the
second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. ON RAGLAN ROAD broke in the air and was away awkwardly, unhurried in the
early stages, advanced while outside of rivals on the far turn, was outrun in upper stretch and did not threaten in the stretch. DIAMOND BLITZ away in good
order and assumed command into the first turn, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker,
overtaken leaving the far turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
THUNDER OF ZION crowded at the start by DIAMOND RANGER and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide on the turn while
improving position, angled four wide for the stretch run, closed willingly in the drive, responded to steady urging in deep stretch and offered a good late kick
to prevail. DIAMOND RANGER bumped at the start by MIKE DAD then crowded THUNDER OF ZION and was off a step slowly, showed early speed and
dictated terms to the turn, set pressured fractions to the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, could not hold off THUNDER OF ZION inside of
the sixteenth-marker and held for second in the late stages. MY DOMINATOR chased the early quick pace from the second flight, advanced while saving
ground on the turn, came in tight in upper stretch, was unable to find room while along the rail to the furlong grounds, found room inside of the furlong
marker, was outkicked in deep stretch and held for show in the final strides. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE rated off of the solid early pace, was carried five to six
wide nearing the quarter marker, regrouped in upper stretch, shifted out nearing the sixteenth-marker while rallying, finished well in the final stages and just
missed for show. MIKE DAD broke out at the start and bumped DIAMOND RANGER, was hit in the head by an errant shoe in the early stages while chasing
the pace, contested the pace to the outside of DIAMOND RANGER while two deep on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive.
HEAT N REHEAT chased the solid early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. ROYAL JESTER
raced close to the early pace while outside of rivals, disputed the pace four then three wide on the turn, battled to mid-stretch and gave way in the final
furlong. CINDERELLAS PRINCE showed early speed, chased the fast early pace between rivals, lost position into the turn, drifted out on the turn and
carried out MAGICISTHEMOONLITE nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SIGNORINA MERISI (GB) broke alertly, was content to track the pace to the turn, awaited room, got clear running at the top of the stretch, quickened once
clear and drew away under intermittent urging. ASCENDANCY angled towards to the three path after the break, tracked wide and from the rear of the field
to the far turn, began a sustained run from the three furlong pole, swung six wide into the stretch, finished well and was second best in the end. VRONSKY
FEINT broke well, was wide through both turns, swing five wide into the stretch and finished well to grab third. WORTHY OF MAGIC away best from the
gate, set comfortable fractions alone on the lead, opened up some at the top of the stretch then weakened passing the eighth pole. NAUGHTY NADINE
(GB) up close early, raced in tight quarters going into the clubhouse turn, settled into a tracking position three wide down the backstretch, made a strong bid
to challenge for the lead in the stretch but stalled while racing on the wrong lead. TWILIGHT EMPIRE stumbled slightly then bumped with GRAZEN IN THE
SUN at the break, lost momentum and spotted the field several lengths head start, made some forward progress while six wide down the backstretch, was
hard ridden for more near the seven sixteenths pole, could not make up any ground but was ridden out and managed to pass a few stragglers in the end.
ROSE DAWSON broke well but was not sent after the early pace, was content to lag behind the field to the far turn, was asked to pick it on on the turn but
did not respond. ZELAIA was sent hard from the inside post to gain early position along the rail, stayed close while saving ground, was put into a drive past
the three furlong pole, briefly loomed a threat then tired in the final furlong. GRAZEN IN THE SUN broke out and bumped with TWILIGHT EMPIRE at the
break, was keen and hard to place going into the first turn, stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, was asked for more near the quarter pole but had nothing
left and dropped back through the field.
