Footnotes
TALES OF MAKENNA lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down A THOUSAND
DREAMS in the closing yards. A THOUSAND DREAMS was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter,
reached the fore with a furlong to run, opened a clear margin but could not resist the winner late. DIPLOMATICA broke sharply to set a pressured pace
while racing along the inside and gave way through the final furlong. TOP REFERENCES lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not
a factor. CURIOUS INJI was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. LOW DOSE pressed
the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
METAROSE was away in good order to track the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with LILA'S LUCKY LADY
through a vigorous drive and edged away late. LILA'S LUCKY LADY pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
three-eighths marker, vied with the winner but could not match strides with that rival late. AND I KNOW was off slow then allowed to settle, raced three-wide
through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and finished evenly. SUPERSTAR BEA pressed the pace from between foes and gave way after
going five furlongs. PIPER ROSE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. SEVEN POINTS
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. CANTERBURY GOLD set a pressured pace early, checked nearing the
five-eighths marker and weakened.

Footnotes
TAINO HOUSE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. TEXAS
LONG BOW settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. HERBIE lacked early foot, saved ground
through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with a late bid. SOLEROCKER was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside and
gave way through the final sixteenth. STARZAN chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gradually gave way. CHUCK NAZTY was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EPIC DRAMA disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final
furlong. LOST THE MINISTER raced off the pacesetters while racing three-wide and gradually weakened. ALBANY FRONT showed no early speed, raced
six-wide through the turn and did not threaten. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

N. K. ROCKET MAN sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, increased his advantage into the lane and was fully extended to hold
MONGOL ALTAI safe late. MONGOL ALTAI settled off the leaders from between foes, moved inside for the drive and finished with good late energy. IN
THE MIDST was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. BROTHERLY LOVE raced off
the leaders early, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. GALLANT OAK chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened through
the final furlong. WILLTOBELUCKY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. ETU BABOU was void of early speed,
saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. STRAUS'S PLACE lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a
bid. CHROME KING lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. AUTISM SAVANT showed brief speed and
