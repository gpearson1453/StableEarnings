A LOT OF SPUNK dueled for the lead from the inside with MIRACLE OF HOPE, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority.
TIME FOR GOLD was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best.
MIRACLE OF HOPE broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, steadied nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. THE
OWNER OF MIRACLE OF HOPE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST TIME FOR GOLD CONCERING THE STEADYING OF HIS HORSE AT THE
QUARTER AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE. OPENING FRACTION CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

HEART ON THE RUN sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. SUMMEROFTHESAMURAI settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. YATAHEY was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. LE TUB was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with
a belated bid. BELLS AND WHISTLES chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. RAGING LADY settled off the leaders
from the inside and gradually weakened.
