Footnotes
ROCK CHALK bumped mildly with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the
outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and got up for the win late. G. T. OH raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn still in the two path, began a bid approaching the
quarter pole and gained ground late. FISHERMAN OSCAR saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around
the far bend and dug in in the stretch, getting caught late. SICILIANO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came
around the far turn in the two path and improved position in late stretch. DAD'S ON A ROLL raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up
the backstretch, challenged on the outside coming around the second bend and kept on to the finish. NOBLE AND KIND raced in the two path early, stalked
the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the far turn and finished evenly. DON CINCO raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the final
furlong. FRENCHY DEPARTED bumped lightly with the horse to his outside at the start, blew the first turn, drifting out to the six path, continued up the
backstretch well off the pace, navigated the far turn from the two path and never threatened. DYNAMIC STORM saved ground around the first turn, tracked
the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and tired in the lane. MIRO was away from the gate slowly, trailed
the field throughout, saved ground and was never a factor. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED. FINAL TIME
CHANGED AND FRACTIONS ADDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
YEGUITA QUEEN tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three and four path coming around the turn and drew off in the
lane. DIA DE SOL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three and four path, began a bid approaching the quarter
pole and gained ground late while never threatening the winner. WIN OR CELLAR was fractious in the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up
the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and improved position in the lane. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED pressed the pace between horses through the
opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the two path around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. R D BLESSING bumped with the horse to his inside
at the break, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and showed no kick. LA BRODY bumped with the
horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace early, navigated the turn from the four and five path and never fired. CANT BEAT THE KATZ led the
way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and tired in the lane. MS MAGGIE stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the field
up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid.

GO GREEN led the way on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and held that margin to
the wire. TUMIGA raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the
five path coming around the far bend and gained ground late. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS tracked the leader on the inside through the opening half mile,
raced in the two path around the far turn and kept on to the wire. CORE FACTOR hopped up leaving the gate, raced in middle traffic in the two path around
the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn turn and improved position mildly in the
lane. AWESOME HONOR raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the four path and finished evenly. HOP AND SCOTCH raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around
the far bend still in the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane. PERSONAL FINANCE raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and faded in the stretch. HE'S CONNECTED saved ground around the first
turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, dropped back while racing on the rail around the second bend and continued to tire from
there. SLOW YOUR ROLE hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground through the first three quarters of a mile and made no bid.
ICETECA raced in the two path at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and
was empty in the stretch.
