Footnotes
BET ON BOURBON came out a few paths at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a bit off of the rail, shifted outwardly while inching clear
leaving the quarter pole, lugged outwardly coming to the furlong grounds, continued to wander about while an inner rival challenged, yet held sway through
the late stages. RESPOSADO pressed outside of the leader early on, chased around the turn, attempted to vie entering the lane, but failed to keep pace
with the leader while altering course inside of that drifting foe inside the quarter pole, kept on to threaten inside of the leader in the final furlong, but was kept
at bay. THE MISSING PIECE pursued from midpack two wide and between horses while requiring strong left hand restraint from the rider to keep from
lugging out, but bore to the eight path entering the lane once outside of foes, yet ran on for a minor share. BEAUTIFULANDWILD laid off of the pace along
the inside, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick between horses. ENOUGH HEART took a brush from an inner rival at the start, stalked along
the inside, but lacked a bid before fading. ALLSTAR MAGIC chased from midpack three wide, but yielded in the five path in upper stretch. EYESEEMONEY
bumped the inner part of the gate after it rebounded back into her path when it sprung, then lagged behind and was outrun. THE RIDER OF RESPOSADO
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OFBET ON BOURBON FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS
DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
SHANIAH broke out at the start, stalked three wide, loomed a danger turning for home, bid in the four path entering the lane, wrestled an advantage before
kicking clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway from an inner rival. SWEET BEAUTY broke half a beat slow at the start, tracked along the inside,
surpassed an inner rival entering the lane before sustaining a grinding rail charge through the final furlong to reach place a sixteenth from home. DREAM
STREAK took a bump from an inner rival early on, pressed two wide, vied while forging an advantage at the three furlong pole, dug in to resist SHANIAH's
bid entering the lane, but was headed in upper stretch, and yielded at the furlong grounds. JOAN'S WAY chased from midpack four wide, then lacked a bid
in the six path through the lane. MA CHERIE trailed in the five path, came into the lane in the nine path, and hung on her left lead while surpassing an
easing rival. MISS G G shied from an inner rival at the start and bumped an outer foe soon after, vied inside of that rival into the turn, but was headed at the
three furlong pole, weakened entering the lane, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
KYLE BEAUTY set the pace two wide, cruised away in hand around the turn, then widened under intermediate urging before being put to wraps in the final
furlong. PURSUIT L'HARMONIE broke sharp, yet required strong urging from the rider to sustain vying pressure inside of the pace setter down the
backstretch, failed to go on with that rival entering the turn, maintained a clear margin for place through midstretch, but tired late, and just lasted for that
position. ENTITLEMENT raced at the rear from just off the inside, then belatedly split rivals three wide at the furlong grounds, and missed reaching place.
VISIONISTA tracked three wide, but lacked a bid. YOCKEY BETTERFLY took a bump from an inner rival at the start before briefly getting keen behind foes
soon after, raced at the rear in the three path, gradually shifted out in upper stretch while distracted and staring towards the grandstand, came into the final
furlong five wide while hanging on her left lead, and made little impact. BEULAH K chased from midpack along the inside, but faded. DAT GUITAR bumped
an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide, but hung on her left lead, lugged inwardly at the three sixteenths pole, and faltered between horses in the closing
stages. THE FIVE FURLONG FRACTION WAS ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED, BUT CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
ALEBRIJE stalked along the inside tipped outside of the leading pair and to the five path entering the lane, sustained a bid in upper stretch, and drew clear
at the furlong grounds. TANGO CHARLIE broke out, stalked the top pair from the three path, but was floated to the six path while being outkicked by an
inner rival, yet ran on thereafter to gain place in the closing stages. SUMMER SPLASH vied along the inside, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper
stretch, then lost place to an outer rallying rival late while managing show. KENNESAW vied for the lead two wide, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and
gave way. LIGHTNING STRUCK trailed along the inside, and moved up without menacing. SIERRA HOTEL lacked speed in the three path, and tired.

Footnotes
SERMONONTHEMOUNT dueled for the lead two wide, led around the far turn, then drove clear entering the final furlong. TIO BLAS sparred inside of a rival
for the fore, got headed at the three furlong pole, then yielded in midstretch, yet maintained place. MISHKO tracked from midpack in the four path, pursued
the top pair from the three path turning for home, but only managed to chase evenly through the lane. COUNTER OFFER settled off of the pace along the
inside, split foes two wide turning for home, claimed fourth entering the lane, ran on to vie for show inside of MISHKO in the closing stages, but was denied
that position. EAST LEX trailed along the inside, then improved between horses in midstretch. WOMAN WITH A BOOK lacked speed two to four wide, and
made little impact. OVERTHOUGHT tucked from the three to two path while gaining inside stalking position around the first turn, but gave way turning for
home, and weakened. THE GRAY BLUR tracked in the three path while between a pair of rivals, but faded turning for home.

HOORAY AUSTIN settled off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two to three paths before fanning six wide in upper stretch, then offered a
steady rally outside of foes to bid in the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY tracked in the three to four paths, took aim
outside of the leader in upper stretch, struck the front at the furlong grounds, drove clear approaching the final sixteenth, but was worn down by an outer
rival in the closing stagfes. G'WILDCAT leaned out at the start, tugged forward to duel with an outer rival for the lead, got headed by a wider bidder while
sustaining vying position around the turn, then fought on doggedly through the lane, but lacked a re-bid. BINDING AGREEMENT tracked from just off of the
inside, tipped three wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase while one-paced. GRAVY HOUND stalked three wide, vied while forging an
advantage around the turn, led turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and faltered between horses in the final
sixteenth. GOLDEN PALACE lacked speed in the three to four paths, came into the lane in the five path, and failed to factor. MISTER DON was outrun
along the inside. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RUNNINGINTHEMONEY took a bump from an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of outer bidders nearing the
lane, dueled gamely with an outer SUNDAY BREEZE through the final furlong, and was brushed by that foe nearing the wire while prevailing. SUNDAY
BREEZE bumped with an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace three wide, gained four wide approaching the far turn, produced a bid for the lead
outside of the top pair turning for home, dueled while shifting down two wide in midstretch, sparred through the final furlong, but brushed the leader in the
closing stages while failing to gain even terms, and hung. DUVEE bobbled while still breaking on top, pressed three to two wide around the first turn, vied
between horses entering the lane, but yielded to those foes at the three sixteenths pole, and was best of the rest. JAYS HOLIDAY laid off of the pace along
the inside, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to menace. COUYONS CAUSE stalked along the inside, saved ground, shifted course
outwardly in midstretch while chasing, and lacked a bid. SCORING DRIVE stalked two wide, but yielded among foes at the half mile pole, took the far turn in
the four to six paths, and made little impact. TAMBOURINE STAR bumped an outer rival at the start, trailed two wide, then in the four to five paths around
the far turn, and never got involved. BOULDERING bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked in the three path and between horses, chased three wide into
the far turn, but faded.
