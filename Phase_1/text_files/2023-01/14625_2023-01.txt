Footnotes
ARTIFACT (GB) stalked the pace two wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and widened while drifting out under right-handed
urging. TAKE IT SOUTH steadied at the start, saved ground off the early pace, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied outside to gain the place
late. MORGAN'S BLUFF was hard held while pulling the first time through the stretch, raced three wide in midpack, advanced between foes around the far
turn, moved up in upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. BREAKING BULLET led early, rated back inside, tried to re-bid inside of the pacesetter
nearing the far turn but was forced to steady off heels near the three-eighths pole, remained up close inside around most of the far turn, swung three wide
near the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch, angled back to the rail in midstretch and weakened. AMOR SALVAJE was bumped at
the start, raced off the pace two and three wide, angled to the rail midway around the far turn, made some progress in upper stretch but was outkicked.
BLACK ICE failed to menace while racing three and four wide. LIPARI was outrun inside. MISS KRISTY played no factor while racing four wide. LA PALMA
chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. LADY PETAL set the pace two wide around the first turn and along the rail around the
far turn then retreated through the lane. MY GYPSY WITCH was bumped at the start then had only brief speed four wide. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING

NAVAL OFFICER set the pace in the three path, was coaxed when headed early around the turn and floated out to the five path going into the stretch, and
dug in gamely to hold off a pair of outer challengers for the win. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER stalked in the two path, tipped out and ranged up from the five
path under rousing around the turn, swung out to the eight path entering the lane, and ran on to get up for place. FIGHT bumped with CHEVAL DORE at the
start, prompted the pace in the five path, bid from the four path in hand around the turn, was coaxed while being floated out to the seven path going into the
stretch, and hung for show. TOTALLY LIKE MOM tracked in the three path but was never a factor. FORT ATTITUDE had an awkward start, was outrun from
the two path early, and never threatened. CHEVAL DORE bumped with FIGHT at the start, chased in the four path but was no menace.

MANDY GREEN settled off the early pace while racing four wide, cruised up four wide around the far turn, took the lead leaving the five-sixteenths pole,
quickly drew clear then just lasted. ZISISIT (IRE) stalked the pace inside of foes in the two path, angled to the rail turning for home, surged late inside of the
winner and just missed. AMUNET raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied outside for the show. L. E. GRAY set the pace in the two path and
weakened in the lane. CHESS NOT CHECKERS prompted the pace in the three path, bid between foes nearing the five-sixteenths marker but came up
empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ADELIESE'S SMILE tracked along the inside, was coaxed from said position passing the three eighths pole, bid through an opening inside turning into the
stretch, and was driven past a pair of outer foes to win. ANA'S GUN stalked in the two path, was cued to bid passing the quarter pole and was ridden from
the five path into the stretch, ran on and briefly led going into the final furlong but was caught by the winner to place. OKAY FINE bumped with MUTOLA
and was brushed by UNDOUBTEDLY at the start, chased in the five path, moved up under rousing around the turn and took aim from the six path going into
the stretch, but drifted out through the stretch, and finished evenly for show. UNDOUBTEDLY brushed with OKAY FINE leaving the gate, set the pace in the
three path, floated out to the four path under urging turning into the lane, and yielded approaching the eighth pole. MUTOLA bumped with OKAY FINE at the
start, trailed from the three path early and never threatened. MIJA stumbled at the start and was prompted along in the four path, was asked for more
passing the three eighths pole, but failed to respond and was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
LITA settled off the pace outside, raced four wide around the turn, tipped widest in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in the final strides. MUSICAL
DESIGN dueled outside of STAKE A CLAIM in the three path to deep stretch, won that battle but could not withstand the winner in the final strides. STAKE
A CLAIM dueled along the rail to deep stretch and was narrowly outfinished. FELINE raced in range three wide and was one-paced through the lane. RED
TIARA prompted the pace in the four path and faded in the lane. NEVER (IRE) tracked the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. MARTINI'S AMICA
appeared to clip heels nearing the three-eighths pole, raced four wide around the turn and never threatened. EXAGGERATED HUMOR saved ground off
the pace and lacked a closing bid while not urged in the lane.

Footnotes
CHARMED (GB) raced prominently in the four path, was cued to bid while floating out to the eight path going into the lane, took the lead just before the
eighth pole, and drew clear while shifting inwards in the final furlong. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF stalked in the three path, was roused from the six path turning
into the stretch, and ran on to get up for place late. TORETTO set the pace in the two path, was coaxed from the four path turning into the lane, and fought
on before yielding passing the sixteenth pole to show. HE'S IN CHARGE hopped just after leaving the gate, rated in the six path, was driven along while
being floated out to the nine path going into the stretch and was one paced. TOWN OF GOLD had a slow start and chased in the five path, shifted out to the
ten path under urging turning into the stretch, and was no factor. GET SET tracked in the six path but was empty from the eight path going into the stretch.
OLD TOWN ROAD trailed throughout from the two to four paths.

Footnotes
BROADWAY BOOGIE settled in range while racing two wide, tipped three wide and accelerated early on the far turn, seized command near the quarter pole
and drew off under a drive. ELLE EST FORTE saved ground well back, advanced four wide around the far turn and ran on to gain the place. BRAVO
KITTEN saved ground in midpack, bid three wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. LUCKY PERIDOT saved ground off the pace, advanced
between foes around the far turn and lacked the needed stretch rally. RUNNING LEGACY stalked the pace two wide and tired in the lane. SOCIAL
ENGAGEMENT set the pace along the rail and gave way nearing the quarter pole. IN A SPIN tracked the pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane.
INFLUENCING raced off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
COLLABORATE broke out at the start, raced prominently in the three path, waited for an opening around the turn, was cued while being angled out to the
six path in upper stretch, and rallied past a pair of inner foes in the final sixteenth to win. AMERICAN PRINCE prompted the pace in the four path, bid
passing the three eighths pole, took the lead and was cued from the three path entering the lane, was no match for the winner, but dug in to hold on for
place. LUDINGTON stalked in the five path, took aim and was ridden from said position going into the stretch, but hung for show. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY
trailed from the two path, passed a pair of tired rivals around the turn and swung out to the nine path entering the lane, and improved position from the
center. SCAR tracked in the five path, was driven from the seven path into the stretch, but flattened. CELESTIAL GLAZE bumped with SENSEI
LAWRENCE at the start, raced from off the pace in the five path, was coaxed from the two path around the turn, shifted out to the eight path into the stretch,
but faded. SENSEI LAWRENCE bumped with CELESTIAL GLAZE at the start, chased in the three path, was hustled along the rail rounding the turn, tipped
back out to the three path going into the stretch, and was tired. SPEARGUN hopped out of the gate, rated along the inside but was no factor. CREATE
AGAIN bobbled at the start, was wellback in the four path and never menaced. TOP GUN TOMMY set the pace in the two path but gaveway entering the
lane.

backstretch and around the far turn, split rivals in midstretch, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. WORLDS ON HIGH tracked the
pace in the two path early, prompted three wide around the far turn, had aim in upper stretch was outkicked. RUGGED UNION was hustled from the gate,

menace while racing two and three wide. GARMENTO played no factor while racing two wide. GREG'S HONOR was outrun while racing three and four
wide. THE PENINSULA never threatened while racing four wide. DREAM OF A DAY lacked speed while racing two and three wide, swung widest in upper
