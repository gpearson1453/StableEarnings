Footnotes
ALLIE'S PAL was away alertly, set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted out and held. MINDOFMYOWN tracked the early pace, made a
eight wide move through the turn and just missed for the win. LITTLE SAMURAI was reserved early, raced nine wide through the turn and offered a mild late
rally. SATURNCLOUD cased the early pace, raced four wide and tired. BINALLOVERDRINKEN was up close early from the inside and faded. QUICK TO
FUSS raced in mid pack early, raced between rivals and flattened out. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T was void of any early speed, raced seven wide and never
fired. STELLAR WAY was taken back early from between rivals and offered no late rally. ROBTHEQUEEN was unhurried and was no factor. EPWORTH
was outrun early and was no threat.
