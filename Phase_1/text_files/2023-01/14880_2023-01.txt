Footnotes
RAPPORT dueled for the lead from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority. ROYAL JOKER was away in good
order to press the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner but finished well to gain the place. GO LAKER
GO disputed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way to the winner after going a half. BLUE PARADISE settled off the leaders from the inside and
finished with late interest. DEVIL'S OFF DUTY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. BOURBON AND WATER
was forwardly placed early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. BIG PEN TEN showed no early speed, dropped far back and was eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
BARBIE WARS raced unhurried early, advanced six-wide through the second turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards. SECRET
MISTRESS stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid into the lane, vied and just missed. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) tracked the
leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good energy. FAT AND FURIOUS lacked early speed, saved ground
through the second turn, angled out and back inside in mid-stretch and finished willingly. BREAKFAST BALL sprinted clear at once, saved ground while
setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. RODEO ROSE raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through
the second turn and was not a factor. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. TIMES

Footnotes
BEYOND AWESOME sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and held off the closing DON'T
GET PICKLED to prevail. DON'T GET PICKLED lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
with a steady bid. ARIZONA KALEI was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. BANGIE GO was
forwardly placed from the inside and lacked the needed closing response. DADS ESTRELLA settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. BOSS BRIDE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. NATURAL IMMUNITY was void of early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PRINCESS JAYLEEN was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through
the turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
GALLANT OAK stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore down FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR in the
closing yards. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane but could not resist the winner late.
BREXTON showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was up for the show. LAST RENEGADE settled off the leaders early, moved
six-wide through the turn and finished evenly. FIRST COUNT chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. TRACK
BOUND was void of early speed, checked nearing the half, lugged out through the turn and did not offer a bid. CAPTAIN DASHI lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and did not menace. ELUSIVE LOVE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
NORTHRNDANCRSGHOST showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. CLASS PROOF was away in good order to
duel for the lead with FLYINUNDERTHEGRAYDAR while racing three-wide, went wrong nearing the half, was pulled up and vanned off. RIVIERA CHAMP
chased the leaders from the inside, clipped the heels of CLASS PROOF, stumbled, unseated his rider and was walked off.

ARIZONA ANDREW was away in good order to press the pace of BRANDYN while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and
drew off with little need of urging. BRANDYN broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and yielded to the winner through the final furlong.
ACCELERITAS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain on the drive. CHARLIE'S MAN showed no early
speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. JUSTIN AZTECA was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn
and gave way in the drive. LOTSA SKY raced off the leaders from the inside throughout, weakened after going a half and was eased late.

Footnotes
MR. STANG tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. TIGER DAD was away in
good order to press the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, stayed on well in the drive to finish willingly. RAMBLIN'
MAN raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly late. RONAMO was off slow then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the
turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. TACTICAL ATTACK set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the
final furlong. JAZZ HANDS pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. SILVERBULLITBADGER lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. AXEL STEEL raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
STREET SHADOW lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore in tandem with DIRT
FLIRT with a sixteenth to run, vied with that rival and proved best. DIRT FLIRT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
second turn, offered a bid nearing the sixteenth pole, vied with the winner but could not get by that rival late. LOOKIN SO LUCKY lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. IN THE RED was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn,
angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. LOOPY broke sharply to track the leaders from the inside, offered a bid in mid-stretch and gave
way. JOY IN THE BATTLE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened after going six furlongs.
DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. TIME FOR GOLD reared at the start and lagged throughout.
