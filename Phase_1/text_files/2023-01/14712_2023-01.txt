the lane and held the place award. DUST BUNNY was allowed to settle on the inside, angled out in the drive and lacked the needed rally, bested rest.
LET'S GO MO was bumped at the start, then settled early and was between rivals at the half mile marker, then lacked a rally. BABY BLUE was reserved
early, swung out five wide leaving the turn and passed the tiring rivals. SCOREBOARD LILY vied for the early lead between rivals, then stalked the winner
three wide by the quarter pole and then weakened. HOLLI THE DOLLY broke outwardly at the start, chased the pace four wide and then was three wide on

ONCE A GIANT was four wide into the first turn, rated early making way to the inside by the eleven sixteenth, made a inside move on the turn and vied for
command by the quarter pole, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best, driving. BUFF AND SHINE vied for the early lead three wide, then stalked
the pace on the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole but proved to be no match for the winner while
staying on to be second best. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out five wide leaving the
quarter pole, then had no late kick, bested rest. JUMP FREE vied for the early lead and then went on to set the pace while in the two path, then was headed
nearing the quarter pole and weakened. ICHIGO was allowed to settle early on the inside and lacked a rally. BLACK IRISH was reserved early, four wide on
the turn and had no rally. HAYROLL chased the pace four wide, then made a mild bid three wide on the turn but tired. WHATA GUY was reserved early,
dropped to the inside on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
AGGRANDIZE was allowed to settle early two wide, made a inside move nearing the quarter pole, then drew out in the drive to prove much the best,
driving. MONEYONTHELINE was rated along early three wide, made a four wide move on the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly
second best. D'STORM set the pace while in the two path, then was headed leaving the turn and weakened, held show award. MISCHIEVIOUSBUD stalked
the pace three wide and was ridden along on the turn but came up empty, missed show award. DIXIE CANNONBALL was settled early and four wide on the
turn and had no rally. BUSTER BRUNO lacked a rally. GERONIMO failed to menace. NOTORIOUS REY saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
DEE JAY pulled early, split rivals nearing the eleven sixteenths to go on and set the pace while in the two path, drew out on the turn and then drew off in the
stretch to prove much the best while being hand ridden. LTL BEAR SALOON tracked the early pace in between rivals, then chased the winner three wide on
the turn and proved to be no match for that rival while second best. SIR REX was five wide into the first turn, settled in three to four wide, made a mild bid
four wide on the turn but failed to gain in the lane, bested rest. OVER AND THUNDER stalked the pace four wide and weakened. E T'S SUPER STAR
lacked a rally. FED CHAIR set a pressured pace early on the inside, then tracked the winner on the backstretch on the inside and tired. LOUIE'S LAW was
bumped at the start, then failed to menace.
