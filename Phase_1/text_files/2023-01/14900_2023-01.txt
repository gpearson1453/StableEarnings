Footnotes
MUNNINGS TALE was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by IMPECCABLE TASTE nearing
the half, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and held sway to the wire. LOOKINTOGETEVEN tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out
approaching the stretch, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with good energy. FIRST IMPRESSION was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. IMPECCABLE TASTE was taken back early, pulled to vie, offered a bid nearing the
half and weakened after going three-quarters. FINE POINT ASSAY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
REIGN OF FIRE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased her margin into the stretch and was ridden out to the
wire. BRITE TAN chased the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. BIG CYN was forwardly placed
early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. SUE ETTAS GHOST was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and
finished evenly late. CONVINCE was never far back, saved ground through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive.
ATLANTIC PRINCESS lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. AMERICAN ROYALTY showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. SHEZ A GRINDER raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

METAROSE was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew off
with complete authority. LADY NOGUEZ showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was up for the place. FLYING TO THE LINE
sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY was forwardly placed early,
moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. EVEN PANDURA was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was
not a factor. STREAMER showed brief speed and weakened.

inside, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. FIRECRACKER STAND set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and gave way through
the final furlong. KIND OF GALLANT pressed the pace while racing five-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. AUTISM WARRIOR lacked early

Footnotes
HAPI HAPI dueled for the lead with SIR DEPUTY while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and was ridden out through the lane.
SIR DEPUTY was away in good order to duel for the lead with the winner while racing along the inside, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly
second best. PERFECT COME BACK was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. SHOTGUN
RIDER was bumped soon after the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. PALACE
PRINCE settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. PROVOST raced off the pacesetters from the inside
throughout and failed to rally. MAHI MAHI clipped heels and steadied nearing the seven-eighths marker, lagged early, saved ground through the second
turn and did not reach contention. HYDROGEN chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
FLASHIN ACES was away in good order to duel with KNOCKOUT GUY from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and held sway to the wire. MY
SWEET LORD was pushed out through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with
good energy. WESTERBERG was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, moved up for a striking position but failed to gain in the drive.
KNOCKOUT GUY broke sharply to duel for the lead with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. SMOKIN' GOOD TIME
drifted out to bump rival nearing the seven-eighths marker, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed
rally. IGO lagged after the opening quarter and was eased through the lane.
