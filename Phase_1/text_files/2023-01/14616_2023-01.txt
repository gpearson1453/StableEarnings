LITTLE ROO ROO was forced inward and into Kaylee's Spitfire shortly after the start then continued inward and rated a short lead just off the rail, came
under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled through the stretch. TIME TO CHOOSE
stalked from the inside on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but ultimately, had
to settle for second. ZIGGY STARDUST came in shortly after the start and rounded the first turn about the five path, stalked leaving the turn and started a
bid toward the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. HARPERSGONEFISHING saved ground
on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride in the lane. HAZEDNCONFUSED
settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths, left the turn outside and
showed little further. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE was bumped then pinched back shortly after the start and settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and flattened in the lane. TWO ROOM SCHOOL rounded the first turn in the six
path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. HERE'STHEBREADMAN raced well
back in the four and five paths the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP saved ground racing well back.
KING KJARTAN saved ground and weakened after a half mile. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Little Roo Roo for interference
shortly after the start, lodged by the rider of Kaylee's Spitfire, and as a result, disqualified Ziggy Stardust to sixth place for initiating that early contact.

Footnotes
RAVIOLI MAMA entered the opening turn in the four path, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in under
steady handling to take over leaving the sixteenth pole and ran clear under the wire. IRISH SAMURAI stalked the early pace off the rail, bid from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dug in to take second the final yards. TOUGH ONE saved ground off the pace on the first turn,
eased out and gave chase from the half mile pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, finished well and was gaining on the top two. MAYSVILLE
MISS was hustled in early contention then rated the pace into the first turn, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail, was met mid-stretch and flattened later yards. PRETTY SPECTACULAR broke awkwardly and rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. I B NASTY saved ground racing well back, rounded the far turn in
the five path and could only improve her position. BRANDYURAFINEGIRL stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but
weakened in the three path of the far turn. DIVA GAL broke awkwardly and was never a factor. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER raced well back.

Footnotes
ACASHA'S INTUITION raced with the pace through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead
approaching the five sixteenths and was steadily handled to widen. MY PHOENIX gave his rivals several lengths advantage when he dwelt in the gate,
raced at the rail on the first turn then endured a long steady bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, came between horses
near mid-stretch and got up for second the final yards. NICE BUT NAUGHTY rated close inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced at the rail
most of the far turn, eased out leaving the turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY saved ground on the first turn, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, but showed little in the lane. BOBBYS CASE LOAD rounded the first turn in
the four path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and had little left. IRISH FLIGHT rounded the first turn about the six
path, left the turn outside and showed little response. RIVER ROYALE R V F rated a short lead inside, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, gave
up the lead toward the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. IT'S ONLY MONEY settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

TOLLER pressured the pace and contested the turn at a close disadvantage two deep, dug in determinedly through the stretch and took the nod in the final
strides. BAYTOWN JAKESTER was hustled along to set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch
handling but gave up the nod in the final strides. ADIOS SEE YA chased the pace through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, eased slightly out
leaving the turn, angled in toward mid-stretch but brushed the rail and was steadied in late yards. LION OF THE SEA chased through the backstretch, raced
off the rail on the turn and finished well. JAIME JAMEL chased toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened in late stretch. DINNER BELL
chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened the final furlong. WORLD OF FOOLS angled out to give chase, rounded
the turn about the eight path and passed rivals widest. URBAN WARRIOR gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the six path and showed little in the
lane. SCAREDY CAT was not a factor. FOREVER THE BOSS engaged in close early chase but weakened in the three path of the turn and was eased in
the lane.

Footnotes
RED DEVOLUTION took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, widened leaving the first turn, came under pressure toward the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. PLUNK raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, was gaining in later yards but had to settle for second. CRYPTIC CODE rounded the first turn
about the four path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and came along to take third the final strides. SPARKLING
SHIRE settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but flattened in the lane. SMOOZER
raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened.
CHERRYS CROSS showed little response through the backstretch. SHEA D CAPTURE rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the three
eighths pole but flattened in the three path of the far turn. SLOE GIN BIZ steadied off the heels of Smoozer midway on the opening turn, angled out from
that point but showed little further. KLIMT RIDE faded after a half mile.
