Footnotes
LATE NIGHT LARRY , jostled on both sides soon after the break, advanced three deep to challenge for the lead mid way on the far turn, opened a clear
advantage in mid stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and was kept under urging. DOWN COLD chased the pace down the backstretch, gained a short
lead between horses mid way on the far turn, finished willingly but could not match strides with the winner in the stretch. TRASH TALKIN LARRY , three
wide the first turn, was in striking position four deep on the far turn and weakened through the stretch. GHOSTLIGHTER bumped with LATE NIGHT LARRY
soon after the break, raced inside horses to the far turn, was taken outside in upper stretch and failed to be a menace. AUSPICIOUS LAD , quickly clear, set
the pace along the inner rail, was hooked on the far turn then retreated through the stretch. HACHURE bumped with the winner soon after the start and was
not a factor. DREAM BIG DREAMS , three wide on the turns, was not a factor.

Footnotes
IMAGINE A CURE , urged to the front, set a pressured pace inside rivals, was put to a strong ride from the three eighths, emerged in a three way duel soon
into the lane, lost command nearing the eighth pole, battled back under stout left handed asks leaving the sixteenth marker, wandered outward a bit late and
edged away. BUBBA CHROME , perched three wide in hand tracking the leaders, bid three deep in hand leaving the three eighths, dueled outside rival and
then took command nearing the furlong grounds, failed to sustain past the sixteenth pole and was second best. DUKE OF DOOLY bobbled at the break and
brushed with a rival, regrouped and was sent up to attend the pace outside the winner, cut into the margin under a ride into the lane, battled between
runners in mid stretch then faded late. HOPPERNESS , four then three wide pursuing the top three, was under a heavy ask past the five sixteenths but
failed to generate a serious stretch run. POINT US HOME , brushed at the break, dropped off the early pace, raced outside a rival nearing lane and failed to
menace. RUN ROCKY RUN dropped in towards the rail nearing the half mile pole, chased but came up empty. LOVE TALK saved ground off the pace,
failed to go on under pressure around the turn, faded and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
STARDUST ZIGGY dropped in early and was taken to rate, made steady progress in hand past the five eighths, eased out with three furlongs to go and
stalked the leaders, wandered inward when advancing under hand urging nearing mid stretch, put a head in front when put to the left stick a sixteenth out,
hung a bit giving back the lead to DART but was resurgent and wrested command in the final yards to prove best. DART , three wide early, moved up to
take aim of the leader into the far turn, went on the attack past the three eighths, took over with a quarter mile remaining, spurted clear under a drive and
shifted in towards the rail, came back after being headed to lead in deep stretch, fought gamely but just wasn't quite good enough. NOBLE PRENDERGAST
was steadied when floated out nearing the seven eighths, advanced three to four wide under asking past the five sixteenths, chased, got in range near the
sixteenth pole but flattened out late. BONDED came out some early bothering his stable mate, settled off the inside, swung six wide for the drive and rallied.
BLOWN SAVE was taken five wide entering the backstretch, dropped in to gain three wide leaving the far turn, chased but lacked a serious finish.
COMPLETED STORM broke in the air, raced well back through the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, eased out to make a run between rivals
nearing mid stretch but needed more late. JOHNNYFRENCHFRI stumbled at the break but recovered and opened up, set the pace three wide early on,
dropped in nearing the far turn, took pressure past the three eighths, ceded command approaching the lane and tired.

Footnotes
MOSE PERFECT , sent from the gate to get a forward spot, rated off rivals leaving the seven eighths, was caught between runners tracking through the
backstretch, angled out and bid three deep near the five sixteenths, saw BATON get away a bit soon into the lane, found more to come back under left
handed asking in mid stretch, was corrected after wandering near the sixteenth pole, surged under right handed encouragement and got up in the final
yards. BATON was sent up three wide early and stalked RHUMJAR, moved under a ride and attacked near the five sixteenths, secured the lead heading to
the lane, spurted away under a drive in upper stretch, kept on under solid handling past the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted in deep stretch and
gave way grudgingly. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY , urged from the gate, stalked inside, angled out leaving the three sixteenths, dropped back in and moved up
along the rail to loom past mid stretch, failed to kick on with the top pair but kept on with effort. UNDER THE RADAR , off the pace and under asking nearing
the half mile marker, angled out and commenced a run soon after, circled four wide into the lane, made steady progress in mid stretch and churned on.
BRETT'S WORLD , off the pace and removed from the rail, was under coaxing leaving the far turn, made a mild run to the inside of a rival then lacked a
serious finish. MR JEFFERSON , inside off the early pace, failed to respond. RHUMJAR was hard sent and took command nearing the seven eighths,
cleared off then set the pace towards the rail, took pressure past the three eighths, ceded the lead approaching the lane then faltered. ARTISTIC REASON ,
three to four wide outside runners through the backstretch, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
TORCH OF TRUTH , unhurried outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn, gained a short lead outside BOSS LOGIC near
the eighth pole then drove clear. BOSS LOGIC stalked the pace, moved up in the two path to gain the lead leaving the far turn, responded in the drive but
was no match for the winner. MAXIMUM IMPACT lacked speed, raced in the two path entering the far turn, eased out four wide leaving the bend and had a
slight rally. VASARIANO sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and retreated through the stretch. WALK AWAY JOE , kept outside horses
down the backstretch, raced four wide around the far turn and faltered. ONE TWO KID hugged the inner rail chasing the pace, faltered entering the stretch
and was eased late.

Footnotes
VANCE SCHOLARS sped clear early and set the pace towards the rail, was joined by rivals to his outside leaving the three quarter pole, rated back and
allowed a trio to go on, eased out past the three eighths then swung five wide for the drive, came back relentlessly under strong handling and forged past
SOUTHERN DISTRICT in deep stretch to prove best. SOUTHERN DISTRICT was squeezed back soon after the break, recovered and was taken in hand,
advanced within himself while off the rail into the far turn, ranged up four wide outside rivals to take command into the lane, kicked clear under a drive in in
mid stretch, drifted a bit once collared, fought gamely but just could not fend off the winner. IYWAAN , four wide early stalking the pace, edged up three
deep in hand, took command after six furlongs then dueled into the lane, altered in for the final furlong and stayed on well. PRACTICAL COACH bid three
deep early backstretch and attended the pace, sparred between runners leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on with the leaders past the three sixteenths
but continued on with effort. IRISH CORK was steadied and checked along behind rivals through the opening five sixteenths, was under pressure leaving
the far turn and failed to respond. GALERIO was steadied near the seven eighths, sent up between foes to take over heading to the five eighths, gave in to
pressure leaving the three eighths and weakened.
