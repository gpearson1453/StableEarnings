Footnotes
VANTASTIC settled in the two path while in range, was coaxed along but was boxed in on the far turn, found an opening leaving the bend, split foes and
bumped inner rival at the top of the stretch, took over and cleared nearing the eighth pole, widened through the final furlong and was in hand approaching
the wire. BALADI got bumped from inside leaving the gate, was reserved at the back and moved inside, trailed to the far turn, swung out leaving the bend
and top of the stretch, closed well in the drive and bested the rest. READY SOUL broke out and bumped BALADI, raced up close outside the pacesetter,
took aim three wide into the lane, lacked the needed response to threaten the winner but kept on to earn the show honors. IT'S MY HOUSE sped to the
front and took control of the rail, showed the way to the far turn, asked right handed leaving the bend and continued clear three wide into the stretch, was
overtaken and chased VANTASTIC into the final furlong, then flattened and was outfinished for the place and show. NEPTUNE'S STORM stalked the pace
along the rail, cut the corner into the lane, got bumped and crowded by the winner in upper stretch and could not rally after. MOODY JIM (IRE) raced along
the three path stalking the pace early on, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked further response.

Footnotes
SHARED FUTURE away well from inside and chased the leader into the first turn, switched to the outside around the clubhouse turn to stalk, applied
pressure from outside up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and into the lane, put a nose in front in midstretch and dug in to inch ahead late. BIG
SWITCH went up to take the lead from outside and crossed over to the rail on the first turn, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, dueled with
SHARED FUTURE around the far turn, maintained a short lead to the eighth pole, was overtaken shortly after but fought back from inside and stayed on
gamely to the line. TROUVILLE bobbled leaving the gate, took back when crowded briefly between rivals, tucked inside on the first turn, eased out on the far
turn and chased three wide into the drive but could not find the needed late kick in the late stages. MICRO SHARE was off a bit slow to start, trailed three
wide into the first turn, moved a bit closer up the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn and failed to menace. ALOHA KITTEN stumbled leaving the
gate, chased three wide around both turns and weakened. GLORY OF CHROME forwardly placed between rivals then chased two to three wide on the first
turn, dropped back to last on the backstretch, weakened around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
UNWRITTEN CODE hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure from outer rival early, disposed of that foe into the turn, saved ground through the
bend, roused in upper stretch and drew off under mild urging. TRICKLE IN chased the speed outside a rival, rounded the bend in the two path, tipped out at
the top of the stretch and bested the rest. INVINCIBELLA (GB) allowed to settle at the back early, got bumped three deep into the turn, driven two wide into
the stretch, angled out in the stretch and nailed KEEP YOUR COIL for the show honors. KEEP YOUR COIL popped the stall open, was backed out and
reloaded, stalked the top pair up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, failed to find the needed late kick and got nailed for third. MIRACLE OF
HOPE chased at the back off the rail then between rivals leaving the backstretch, got bumped on both sides then put in tight early on the turn, shifted over to
the rail around the bend, altered out from behind a rival in upper stretch and failed to menace. PIAZZETTA was a bit erratic in the early going, went up to
press the pace from outside, could not keep pace and chased the leader into and around the turn from the two path, continued to race a bit erratic in the
lane and weakened between foes. SOARING SKY (IRE) was off a bit slow from inside, tracked along the rail then bumped outer rival and steadied at the
three furlong point, angled out and came three wide into the stretch and could not rally. RACE ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED, TIMES CHANGED

Footnotes
TOM'S X S was off slow in the beginning, steered to the outside chasing the top quartet, challenged four then three deep around the bend, took over
nearing the stretch, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well late. CAROL'S COMIC stalked off the rail, navigated the turn three wide, moved out four wide
in upper stretch, finished determinedly and closed ground late on the winner. MAGNIFICENT RIDE broke a step slow on the outside, went up to vie for the
lead four deep, fought for command three then two wide around the bend, flattened in the drive and walked into the van following the race. SIX FEET vied
between, drifted in and bumped rival early on the turn, fought along the rail to the stretch and weakened. AGADOR SPARTACUS chased off the rail then
climbed a bit and was taken out wider while dropping back to last, took the turn three then four wide and failed to menace. IRONDALE broke a step slow,
went up to press then vied inside a trio of rivals into the turn, got bumped and checked hard nearing three-eighths pole, continued along the fence to the
stretch and was ridden out through the lane. CHIEF COUNCIL vied for the lead three deep up the backstretch, challenged between rivals then started to
weaken around the bend, tired and eased in the final furlong and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SIX FEET
FROM FOURTH TO SIXTH FOR DRIFTING IN AND BUMPING IRONDALE EARLY ON THE TURN, CAUSING THAT RIVAL TO CHECK HARD AND
COST HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

ITZEL sped clear and set the pace up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside around the bend, met the challenge from FOOLISH past the quarter
pole, bumped with that rival in upper stretch, maintained a short lead into the final sixteenth and dug down deep to shake free from the runner-up late.
FOOLISH was off a bit slow and shifted in, had to pause behind a rival then moved out early, was on the move while angling down to the inside then steered
out to bid outside ITZEL past the quarter pole, bumped with that rival in upper stretch, kept the pressure on entering deep stretch but was turned away late.
CALIFORNIA BLING tracked the pace on the inside, steered out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. CASINO ANNIE got crowded between rivals and
steadied early, raced two wide around the bend, angled out into the stretch and missed third. PRINCESS MAGIC broke a step slow, pulled the rider to a
forward position then had to steady at the seven-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide then got floated out to the three path by FOOLISH late on the turn and
weakened in the stretch run. SMART KITTEN broke in and brushed rival, stalked three deep into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened.
ALWAYS CALIFORNIA got brushed leaving the gate, stalked between rivals into the turn, went two then three wide around the turn and weakened. RYLAN
JAYNE brushed at the start, got crowded between rivals early, pulled up on the turn and walked off. RACE ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED, TIMES CHANGED

Footnotes
HEAD START bobbled slightly at the start but still came away quickest, pressed the pace from outside, headed SILENT BEAUTY at the sixteenth pole, put
a nose in front shortly after and inched ahead late. SILENT BEAUTY set the pace under pressure from HEAD START on the outside, held a short lead
through the bend, raced on even terms with a sixteenth to go and yielded grudgingly in the end. NEVER SWAY settled inside, tipped two wide near the
quarter pole, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly to gain third. GALARINA stalked three deep into the turn, continued three wide around the
bend, stayed within striking distance through the lane but finished evenly and lost the show. LUCY L tossed her head and broke slow on the outside,
traveled three wide at the back into the turn, moved out to the four path then got floated out into the stretch and lacked a rally. TWENTYSEVENTROUTS
forwardly placed early and moved to the inside, saved ground into the lane and weakened. SPANISH CHANNEL stalked the top pair in the two path, got
floated out into the stretch and had little left for the stretch run.

moved out in the lane and rallied for a minor award. TROJAN WAY was closest in pursuit near the inside then moved off the rail, chased between rivals on
the far turn then was forced to check past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive. TIZNO'S DILEMMA settled inside, began to pull and became
