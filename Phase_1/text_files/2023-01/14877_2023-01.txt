Footnotes
ALBAYAADER (IRE) stalked the pace from inside, steadied behind the leader at the three-eighths pole, tipped out and bid two wide around the turn, took
over at the eight pole and drove clear. SOUL OF A WARRIOR sped clear and took control of the rail, got pressured around the turn, relinquished the lead
with a furlong remaining and stayed on well for a clear second. REAL FIRE stumbled leaving the gate, became rank nearing the dirt crossing, got brushed
from outside shortly after and was crowded between rivals, went three wide into the turn, got moved out to the four path midway around the bend, asked
three wide leaving the turn, gained the show but could not threaten the top pair and was not persevered with late. JERUSALEMA (IRE) chased on the inside
into the turn, roused leaving the bend and entered the lane two wide, failed to find the needed response and flattened in the final furlong. K P HARRY KITTY
dropped back off the pace, brushed REAL FIRE early, trailed into the turn, saved ground around the bend and was not a factor. MACHO QUEEN was off a
bit slow from outside, bobbled crossing the dirt, traveled two to three wide around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
SHOCKING GREY was off a bit slow and lost his path in the beginning, trailed two wide early then outside a rival, moved to the inside for the far turn,
gained along the rail, steered out in upper stretch and drove past the top pair late in the final sixteenth. ELEUTHERA vied between rivals early then pressed
from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled into the stretch, took over outside the eighth pole, led into deep stretch but got outkicked by the
winner. SUNSHINE BABE steered to the inside and settled early, suffered a mild shuffle early on the far turn, chased two wide then between rivals, angled
out in the stretch and put in late run for the show honors. TRUE PATRIOT got bumped between rivals early, took a stalking position near the fence,
continued inside then moved to the two path on the far turn, steered out four wide in upper stretch and finished willingly. ISSA COURT broke awkwardly
then bumped with TRUE PATRIO shortly after, vied inside a pair of rivals then took control and set the pace under pressure from ELEUTHERA, was headed
by that rival at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled to upper stretch, lost command near the eighth pole and faltered in deep stretch. PRECIOUS BABY broke
inward, vied three deep then ceded command on the first turn, was keen early stalking outside the top pair, started to weaken under coaxing on the far turn
and faded in the lane. LADY MARYANN stalked three wide early then got floated out to the five path around the clubhouse turn, got bothered early on the
backstretch, remained wide on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. IRISH WAHINE drifted four wide around the
first turn, stalked off the rail in hand, dropped back on the far turn and angled to the inside and came up empty.

Footnotes
CORNELIA FORT bumped LUCKY VEGAS in the beginning, stalked the leader along the inside, bid inside foes around the turn and gained command at the
five-sixteenths pole, shook free in midstretch and drew away in the final sixteenth. SWEET HELLO bumped with NOBE early and checked when losing her
path, bid four deep around the bend, fought with inner pair to upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the furlong grounds but outfinished STORM
D'ORO for the place honors. STORM D'ORO pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch, vied three deep around the turn, fought three wide into the
lane, lost touch with the winner in midstretch and got edged for second. LUCKY VEGAS broke a step slow and got bumped hard at the start, tracked on the
inside, saved ground through the turn and kept on to round out the superfecta. NOBE bumped SWEET HELLO early, stalked three deep then moved into
the two path on the turn and lacked further response. SUE GENEROUS coaxed along racing at or near the back well off the rail, navigated the turn four
wide and failed to menace. FREYAS CATZ stalked off the rail, went two wide into the turn, got shuffled back early on the bend and weakened. WINK WISH
AND PARK set the pace under pressure from STORM D'ORO, challenged on both sides and lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into
the drive and faded.

Footnotes
DENIM IN GOLD sprinted to the front, bobbled crossing onto the dirt, set all the pace along the rail to the stretch and remained clear under left handed
urging and steady handling. LUCKY FOR YOU took a bump from outside leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit in the two path then angled over to the rail
on the turn, chased the winner through the lane, could not make any headway but held the place. CUBAN CRISIS (GB) tracked inside a pair of rivals into
the turn, was boxed in around the turn then tipped two wide leaving the bend and finished evenly late. SOCIALLY SMART broke a step slow, tracked
between rivals into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and lacked a late bid. SIDE BY SIDE sat off the pace early on, saved ground around the bend and
never threatened. MYGALSDAWNNLORI broke in and bumped rival, trailed two wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and was not a factor. SNIP
shifted out leaving the gate, tracked three deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
TISQUANTUM chased along the rail inside the top pair into the first turn, got put in a bit tight around the bend, went up to duel on the backstretch and
inched ahead, shook free from MANITOWISH on the far turn, drifted in and was corrected in upper stretch, then drew away in the final furlong.
MANITOWISH led three wide into the first turn, cleared and moved into the two path, dueled outside TISQUANTUM in the middle stages, lost touch with that
rival on the far turn and chased two wide into the lane, stayed on through the final furlong and secured the place. STREET RUCKUS tracked three then four
deep around the first turn, remained wide into the second bend, spun three wide into the lane and held the show. BALLADEER pressed the pace inside the
lead from the two path into the clubhouse turn, ceded the lead and switched to the outside leaving the first turn, chased the top pair to the far turn, angled to
the inside around that bend and could not rally. FINNEUS got bumped between rivals around the first turn, raced outside a rival on the second bend, came
two wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ROYAL ACT brushed leaving the gate, was coaxed along the rail then had to pause when
crowded from outside, tipped out and bumped rival while steadying off heels around the clubhouse turn, angled in on the far turn and weakened.

SPIRITUAL ADVISOR vied 3deep early then chased the leader into the turn, re-engaged MOON ICE with a quarter mile left to run, gained the lead in upper
stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth. MOON ICE broke in and bumped both sides at the start, went up to vie between rivals, inched ahead at the
half-mile pole then cleared leaving the backstretch, challenged again by SPIRITUAL ADVISOR at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead in upper stretch
and stayed on for a clear second. TRANSITORY showed early speed four deep then dropped back to chase and moved inward, rounded the bend two wide,

Footnotes
NEWGRANGE stalked three wide into the first turn, prompted the pace three deep in the middle stages, lost some ground on the far turn and chased the top
pair three wide into the lane, responded to the left hand and rallied three deep into the final sixteenth and dug in to prove best late. HOPPER was off a bit
slow then sped to the front along the rail, set the pace inside PARNELLI AND NEWGRANGE up the backstretch, maintained command through the far turn,
resisted into the final sixteenth but was overtaken by NEWGRANGE late. PARNELLI rated in the two path early then pressed between rivals, pestered
HOPPER through the far turn and into the stretch, fought gamely into deep stretch but lacked the needed late punch. MESSIER chased four in the four path
early, remained wide and traveled four deep on the second turn and finished evenly in the final furlong for a minor award. TRIPOLI stalked the speed from
inside, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to offer the needed response. AMERICAN ADMIRAL was off slow to start, steadied between rivals early,
trailed two wide then moved closer between rivals, entered the lane two wide and could not rally. BREAKFAST RIDE tracked from the three path early,
raced outside a rival at the back into the far turn, entered the lane five wide and also lacked a rally. PERFECT FLIGHT broke a step slow, settled inside,
pushed on while easing off the rail on the second turn, raced three wide into the lane then moved out further but failed to menace. GO ON also broke a step
slow, tracked two wide out of range, got boxed in three deep on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
KITTY KITANA (GB) stalked along the rail inside a rival, roused leaving the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, closed well under right handed
urging, drew alongside HONEY JAR past the sixteenth pole and drove clear near the wire. HONEY JAR sprinted clear and moved inside, opened up on the
clubhouse turn, padded the lead in the middle stages, remained well clear into the final furlong, held a diminishing lead with a sixteenth to go and was run
down by the winner. ANNAGHLASA (IRE) was closest in pursuit near the inside through both turns, came off the rail in the stretch and put in a mild late bid
to whittle the gap late. CONTROL FUNCTION broke a bit slow, bumped and steadied between rivals early, sat off the pace on the inside, cut the corner into
the stretch, asked right handed in the lane and offered a mild response to outkick AGREETODISAGREE for fourth. AGREETODISAGREE bumped with
IMPLOSION in the beginning, raced three wide near the back early on, three deep into the far turn, advanced four wide around the bend and failed to
threaten in the final furlong. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER saved ground to the stretch and improved position. IMPLOSION tossed his head and bumped
leaving the gate, tracked in the two path and weakened in the drive. POP POP'S DREAM raced between rivals at the back early on, traveled two wide on
the second bend, swung out into the lane and failed to menace. HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS bumped with inner rival and steadied briefly early, traveled two in
the two path then angled four wide into the stretch and was not a factor. KARAKATSIE settled inside, moved out and went two wide into the far turn, lacked
room at the quarter pole, gained a clear path in the stretch but had little left to offer. AQUA JULIA went three deep while at the back of the pack into the
clubhouse turn, trailed two wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact.
