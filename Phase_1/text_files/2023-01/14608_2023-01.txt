Footnotes
NYVAN dueled for the lead from outside into the first turn, ceded command to LOVE OUR FAMILY, re-engaged that rival at the five-sixteenths pole, took
over late on the turn, kicked clear under some right handed encouragement and drew away while in hand late. LOVE OUR FAMILY dueled for the lead from
inside then took full control into the backstretch, challenged by NYVAN again at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command past the quarter pole, could not go
on with the winner in upper stretch but kept to task to hold second. GOLDEN TEMPER tracked the pace on the inside, moved to the two path leaving the far
turn, tipped out in the lane and got up for the show honors. SMOOVE AS SILK traveled two wide into the first turn the moved inside, sat off the pace through
the early going, summoned a mild rally in the lane but was outkicked for third. VIOLET CROWN trailed on the inside then moved out two wide, raced near
the back up the backstretch, came out and bumped rival in upper stretch and kept on to improve position. SPEAKING SPANGLISH unhurried on the inside,
trailed up the backstretch, moved out to the two path around the far turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and failed to menace. POINT AND SHOOT hopped
slightly to break a step slow on the outside, went three wide into the first turn, came three wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and lacked further
response. CHERRY CHAOS stalked two wide early then started to pull on the first turn and into the backstretch causing the rider to take hold, settled in the
middle stages, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. TURQUOISE BIKINI became rank three wide on the first turn, raced in range off the inside, lost
ground on the far turn while staying off the rail, got bumped from inside in upper stretch, then lugged in and weakened.

Footnotes
GOOD AS GONE away quickly then stalked FILTHY FAST to the turn, challenged from outside with three furlongs remaining, took over past the quarter
pole, kicked clear under right handed urging and powered away in the final furlong. FILTHY FAST sprinted clear from inside, challenged by GOOD AS
GONE at the three-eighths pole, relinquished the lead past the quarter pole, could not match strides in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the place.
ANYBODY'S CHOICE tossed his head while still breaking with the field, chased three to four wide around the bend, kept on for the show honors but needed
to find more to threaten for the win. MIDNIGHT VOW chased along the inside, came off the rail in the stretch and lacked a bid. LIBERAL LADY hesitated
and came away slow, traveled three wide into the turn, moved over to the two path midway around the bend and could not rally. BALENCIAGA BETTY
dropped back off the pace and steered to the inside, clipped heels behind HALF NELSON past the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the stretch and failed
to make an impact. HALF NELSON settled early tracking the pace, raced between rivals then got shuffled back at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in
the stretch.

Footnotes
CONCH DADDY dueled for the lead briefly from outside then cleared near the half-mile pole and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch
and. CONSTANT CONFLICT bumped in the beginning, dueled inside briefly then ceded control to CONCH DADDY, chased in the two path between rivals
around the bend, finished willingly in the lane and whittled the gap late while gaining second. KIMMER got bumped and lost path leaving the gate, allowed to
settle at the back, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and closed for the show honors. BLAME GEORGE bobbled
crossing onto the turf shortly after the start, raced near the back off the rail, traveled three wide through the turn, tipped out in the lane and rounded out the
superfecta. MISSED CALL broke in and bumped KIMMER, chased three wide into the turn, took at the winner from the two path into the stretch but flattened
out. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) bumped with outer rival at the start, traveled in mid-pack early on, rounded the bend three wide and lacked a rally. TOFINO
BAY chased along the rail into and around the bend and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
TOOTUFFTOSWALLOW broke a step slow, chased five then four wide on the turn, reeled in the leader and took over at the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
SWEET HELLO stalked four wide early, bid four deep around the bend, took over at the quarter pole, kicked clear from inner rivals in upper stretch, led to
midstretch then could not offer any resistance to the winner at the sixteenth pole and held the place. SHES JUST FLUFFY broke out and bumped rival,
traveled in mid-pack on the inside into the turn, moved out to the two path around the bend, steered out in the lane and gained the show. MISS KALINE
tracked just out of range early, traveled along the rail then moved out while inching closer on the turn, came three wide into the lane and flattened in the late
stages. LUCKY VEGAS took a bump from outside to start, settled in mid-pack outside a rival, raced two wide then angled four wide leaving the bend and
failed to threat. MAGIC CAPITAL got bumped back leaving the gate, raced three deep towards the rear early, spun five wide into the lane and showed a
mild response to improve position. JACQUELINE COCHRAN broke a step slow, raced on the inside off the pace, two wide into the stretch, angled out in the
lane and kept on to improve. TIME TOGETHER forwardly placed early, bid three deep around the turn, chased the leader into the stretch and weakened.
SHORT JOURNEY raced near the back early on, went two wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved in some in the drive and failed to
menace. MISS COMMANDER pressed the pace from inside early, vied for command inside a trio of rivals past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened down
the lane. SONG OF SHADOWS bumped inner rival at the start, set the pace outside MISS COMMANDER early, vied between rivals past the five-sixteenths
pole, got put in tight between foes at the top of the stretch and weakened. ONE MO EDDIE was moving around as the gates opened and broke very slow
from outside, angled to the inside trailing early, came two wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

held off rivals from both sides. LUCKY FOR YOU stalked the pace along the rail, moved out to the two path and waited for room behind the leaders, angled
to the rail in upper stretch, finished determinedly along the fence but could not pass REBEL GIRL in the closing moments. LOOKS LIKE MONEY chased off

in upper stretch, then widened in deep stretch. MAGLEV (IRE) was off a bit slow to start, angled to the inside, went two wide into the lane, launched a bid
inside the leaders at the top of the lane but could not match the winner in the final furlong and held the place. COULTHARD (IRE) tracked the pace from
inside, moved out approaching the dirt, lacked room exiting the bend and into the stretch, moved to a clear path and gained the show. RESPECT THE
CODE showed early speed then ceded control to the outside pair, stalked three wide into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the stretch, led briefly
at the top of the lane then was overtaken by the winner and flattened to fourth. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) settled outside a rival early, traveled two wide on the
turn, got floated out and clipped heels crossing the dirt, recovered and kept on through the stretch while unable to threaten. HOT BOX dueled for the lead
the lead from outside, took an awkward step crossing onto the dirt, drifted out a bit into the stretch and weakened. GIVE ME THE LUTE dueled for the lead
inside HOT BOX, entered the lane three wide and gave way. CLASSIER raced three wide at the back into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was
not persevered with.

MR FISK broke out and took the path of ODONATA at the start, stalked the pace from inside, bumped with NAVY MAN near the seven-sixteenths pole,
asked right handed on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, moved out in upper stretch, closed in under the left hand and drove by HARLOCAP in the
final sixteenth. HARLOCAP broke a hair slow then was sent inside to gain a forward position but got put in tight, bumped and had to check into the first turn,
moved up again inside the leaders and took over, cleared up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside into the stretch, remained clear into the final
furlong, then received a challenge from MR FISK in the final sixteenth and could not hold on. FLAT ON vied three deep into the first turn then chased the top
pair four wide around that bend, brushed four deep on the far turn, remained wide to the stretch, moved out in the lane and gained the show. EXCEL
CALCULATOR raced three wide off the pace early, angled five wide into the lane and got outkicked for the show. RIVERSIDE pulled a bit while three wide
around the first turn, tracked three deep and between foes up the backstretch, continued three deep and brushed with outer rival on the far turn and lacked
a rally. NAVY MAN vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals then got bumped into the first turn, dueled around the bend, chased HARLOCAP past the half-mile
pole, bumped with inner rival into the far turn, lost ground around the bend and flattened in the stretch. HABEAS stalked in the two path then between rivals,
dropped back on the far turn, trailed two wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. ODONATA broke a step slow then got impeded by MR FISK at the
start, tucked inside at the back, steered out on the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn, angled six wide into the stretch and was not a factor. BOLT
SUPREMACY vied between rivals then dueled from outside on the first turn, chased past the half-mile pole, took aim two wide around the far turn and
weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
EXAULTED raced in range two to three wide early, traveled outside rivals up the backstretch, bid three deep on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, then
kicked clear from EVAN HARLAN and held a comfortable margin to the wire. WEEGEE settled inside early, raced between into and around the far turn,
angled out at the top of the stretch and put in a mild late bid to gain second. EVAN HARLAN vied three deep into the first turn then dueled from outside
around that bend, cleared early on the backstretch, vied inside rivals with three furlongs remaining, lost command in upper stretch, flattened late but
managed to save the show. TIO MAGICO steadied off heels early, tugged the rider when trying to be reserved off the pace, saved ground through the far
turn, angled out in upper stretch, split foes and missed the show. BALLADEER vied for the from inside then ceded control to EVAN HARLAN, stalked up the
backstretch, waited for room late on the far turn, asked in upper stretch and could not rally. SEVEN WONDERS raced four wide at the back into the
clubhouse turn, chased four deep into and around the second bend, came five wide into the lane and also lacked a rally. AGATINO (IRE) tracked two wide
on the turns, tip three wide into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, moved out to a clear path and failed to menace. DEGREE OF RISK was along the
three path near the back early, traveled three deep into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. BEEF WINSLOW vied between into the first
turn then started to pull when rated around the bend, stalked in the two path, bid between foes on the far turn, fought to the top of the stretch and folded.
