Footnotes
SHAKE RATTLE NROLL showed the way inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, responded when challenged far turn, rebroke entering the stretch and
maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. ABBREVIATION lacked early foot, three wide advance into the stretch, long drive for the runner up
position, narrowly gained the nod while not a threat to the winner. PERFECTLY GOLDEN forwardly placed while three wide, continued to prompt the issue
in the run up the backstretch, three wide bid midway on the second, proved no match for the winner through the lane, narrowly missed saving the second
spot. FIRST HILL pressed the winner in the two path for five furlongs, lodged a bid between horses midway on the final turn, failed to sustain that bid
through the lane, weakened to love a few positions in the run to the wire. NELLY TOO tracked the leaders toward the inside, railed to respond when called
on for the drive. PEACEFUL MOMENT void of early foot, four wide midway on the final turn, had little left for the drive. CANARY NATION in the second
flight while along the inside, stopped. FINAL WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION BUT CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
TIGER MOON settled off the pace and inside, advanced into contention four wide through the second turn, put a head in front when straightened for home,
long drive, bumped repeatedly by a drifting COACH ADAMS the final furlong, dug in late to withstand a bid from the runner up to prevail in game fashion.
FLATOUT WINNER forwardly placed toward the inside, continued in the two path second turn, came three wide for the drive, rallied, shifted out late,
narrowly missed. COACH ADAMS dueled up front off the inside, continued to do battle into the far turn, put the other speed midway on that bend, was
joined by the winner soon after, dueled through upper stretch, continued to vie past the furlong marker, drifted out to bump the victor repeatedly to the wire,
proved stubborn to the end. COLOSI lacked early foot just off the inside, continued in the two path second turn, staged a mild rally to improve through upper
stretch, no threat to the top three. TAKE CHARGE GENT broke out to be last away, continued devoid of speed for five furlongs, four wide into the lane,
improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals, never a serious threat. LEADER OF MEN alternated up front closest to the inside, gave way midway on the
final turn. FREDONIAN settled along the inside, in traffic through the first turn, had nothing for the drive. PRIMER DIMER within striking distance while four
wide into the first, continued outside, stopped far turn. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ENCHANTED NILE cleared into the first turn in the three path, angled in late, extended advantage up the backstretch, saw that margin shrink through the
final turn, held that daylight advantage past the furlong marker, enough left to just last. GOOD PENNY settled off the leaders toward the inside, crept closer
along the rail late in the final turn, moved out a bit for the drive, closed willingly to narrowly miss. GIANNA'S GIFT chased off the inside, moved closer to the
winner in the far turn, saw that progress stall into the lane, lacked a closing punch to finish up best of the rest. BIG BAD DIVA off a step slow, raced back
along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, improved slightly into the stretch, also flattened out the final furlong. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE bobbled
to be off a step slow, remained back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. BLESSED AGAIN in mid pack and three wide most of the way,
lacked a rally. BOBBIN TAIL broke back, moved up to mid pack, tired while also racing three wide most of the way.

Footnotes
STAR POSE in the second flight up the backstretch toward the inside, advanced and challenged midway on the turn, took over, shook clear when
straightened for home, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. AMERICAN BAND dueled in the run up the backstretch closest to the inside, fell
back midway on the turn, moved out, drifted stretch, set down, late surge, rebid late, missed. KEEN CONTENDER void of speed along the inside, continued
to save ground turn, battled stretch for third, gained the nod, no threat to the top two. DOOZY BATZ outrun in the early going, three wide into the lane,
narrowly missed the show while out in the strip, also had little for the top pair. QUALITY CHROME off a step slow, moved closer just off the inside turn,
came three wide for the drive, failed to sustain that advance through the lane. THE X FACTOR off a step slow, steadied on the outside into the turn, four out
to five wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally. ALITA in the second flight while out in the strip, retreated. BARGAIN HUNTER dueled up front off the
inside, continued to vie into the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
HEIR TO GREATNESS unhurried in the early going, advanced to a forward position four wide through the second turn, engaged the leader while still in the
four path turning for home wore that rival down by the sixteenth pole and kicked clear under steady handling. LIL BRO COOP in the second flight while
outside, advanced and took over in the three path midway on the final turn, showed the way into the lane, briefly dueled with the winner in upper stretch then
proved no match, clearly second best. MAJESTIC FLAG forwardly placed off the inside, challenged between horses and inside the runner up second, had
little for the top two through the lane, held sway for the show. CYCLONE in mid pack while out in the strip, raced in the three path through the second turn,
lacked a closing kick. BLOW TORCH chased the leader early along the inside, fell back after a half, went evenly through the lane. CHROME RUN broke
back, continued to lacked speed, made little impact through the lane. PIZZA CHARLIE five wide into the first turn, angled in, failed to muster a rally.
MOURVEDRE broke alertly, cleared into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch inside, gave way when headed by the runner up in the
second turn. TOAST TO COAST was never involved with a three wide trip. BENISSIMO last away, trailed, showed little.

Footnotes
TOWN BRANCH broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, edged away again when straightened for home, maintained daylight to
the wire under steady handling. PLAUSIBLE DENILE in the second flight along the inside, chased the winner through the turn, could do little with that one
through the stretch. held sway for the place. KINGMAKER off a step slow, raced in mid pack off the inside, moved out to be four wide into the stretch, mild,
belated interest to be along for the show. ROYAL KING also in the main body early, four wide when moving a bit closer through the turn, flattened out in the
drive. MAGNIFICUS ducked in at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back, four wide turning into the lane, improved a bit well out in the strip
while not a serious threat. READY SHOES went one paced in the two path, lacked a significant response. LIFE ON THE NILE in the second flight while
racing outside, continued forward into and through the turn, backed up through the stretch. CRONUS remained back while racing three wide. SHUFFLE
DANCE off slow, continued sluggish, pulled up turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
KLASSY BRIDGETTE behind the pace along the inside, got through entering the stretch, rail bid, kicked clear under firm right handed encouragement. U
GLOW GIRL forward from the start, moved up to duel in the three path through the turn, proved no match when the winner challenged in upper stretch, held
the place under confident handling late. JUNIORS JOANIE off a step slow, raced in some traffic into the turn, remained within striking distance while four
wide into the stretch, not enough late for the place. CRACKALACKING broke on top, narrowly showed the way into the turn, dueled in the two path,
weakened. CONDENSATION within striking distance in the main body into the turn, five wide midway on the bend, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing
response. SHE'S STORMING in mid pack while between horses, dropped inside late in the bend, also found lacking through the lane. CHARLEE MAE in
the second group up the backstretch while well wide, six wide midway on the turn, backed up in the drive. HOLIDAY DECISION four wide and between
rivals in the turn, also faded down the stretch.

Footnotes
STREET COMMANDER in a bit tight at the start, asked along early, moved closer in the two path turn, dropped inside for the drive, rail bid inside the furlong
marker, drew clear under steady handling. CLASSY SOCKS closest to the leader up the backstretch, challenged in the two path turn, shook clear when
straightened for home, drifted slightly, could not contain the winner, lasted for the place. SKYPED in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide out of
the turn, some gain on the runner up late while holding off the next rival under firm handling. SHAKE UP lacked speed, angled out into the lane, shifted out a
bit further in upper stretch, late surge, stride late midtrack. THIRD WATCH mid pack, dropped inside turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing
response. EV'S SHERMAN in the second flight while three wide, had little for the drive to finish up evenly. HACKER prompted the pace while racing three
wide, weakened in the drive. STORM STRATEGY broke back, raced outside, four wide turn, improved slightly while never dangerous. CHROME CANDY
fell back to trail after the start, failed to menace. MR. COMMANDER broke alertly, cleared early, showed the way into the turn headed by late in the turn,
faltered. CAMPISI in mid pack while outside, four wide through the turn, tired through the stretch. RUDIANO stopped before a half, jogged in far back.
