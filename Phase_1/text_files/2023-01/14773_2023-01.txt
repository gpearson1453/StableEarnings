KAZ MUNNINGS vied for the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace on the backstretch, drew clear on the turn and widened the margin in the
lane to prove much the best under a drive. SKIMBLE SHANKS was rated along early and advanced on the inside on the turn, then eased off the inside and
came three wide into the lane but failed to gain on the winner while clearly second best. LA PAZ tracked the pace three wide and weakened, bested rest.
SUMMER MIST was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. SONIC BLOOM vied for the lead on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
CLUBMAN was well placed along the inside to the upper stretch, tipped out three wide for aim on the front runner and made a bid in the lane to get up late
and edge clear, driving. A T M AWESOME set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear by the quarter pole and was still clear by the furlong marker but
could not hold off the winner late, second best. UNCLE YUDI tracked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole and then finished
willingly while needing more. COLONEL MOORHEAD pressed the pace three wide and weakened. EVENT PARTY chased the pace four wide, came five
wide into the lane and was empty. HOLD THE IRISH was off a step slow, then was five wide on the backstretch and tired. LORD WINSALOT was hustled
four wide into the first turn and failed to respond, eased and walked off.
