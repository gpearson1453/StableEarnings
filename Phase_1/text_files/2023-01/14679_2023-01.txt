Footnotes
STAY HYDRATED led under pressure early, repelled challenges and moved clear under steady urging through the stretch. LOOK OUT LAMBO raced in
closest pursuit of the pacesetter and continued willingly to gain place. MO READY raced close up outside, moved briefly closer on the final turn and finished
well in a game try. OUTRAGEOUS BET chased between rivals in the two path and flattened out in the stretch. THE ANGRY MAN lagged far behind then
passed tiring rivals. MY MAN ELVIS was close up four wide early, faded on the final turn and no factor. PETULANT DELIGHT bid closer wide after half a
mile but had no further response. BOAT OVER THE HILL settled inside off the leaders and weakened.

pace inside, then between rivals, chased two wide on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run but clearly second best. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE
raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and bested the others for the show award. LOST
LUGGAGE trailed the field, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO raced three wide
early, stalked three wide, went four wide at the half mile marker, chased and faded. PHARIBE tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and faded.
HOWMUCHAREYOUWORTH stalked two wide, went three wide at the half mile marker, chased and gave way. VEGAS WILD CAT vied inside for the lead,
dropped back past the half mile marker and stopped.

MILANO trailed early, circled his field on the turn, rallied extremely wide into the lane then surged clear through the final furlong. MUTASALLEM lacked
speed, split rivals rallying in the stretch but was outfinished. WIZKY'S ON THE BAY steadied after the opening quarter, awaited room on the turn, angled in
to secure space at the top of the stretch then went evenly. PERFECT SILENT CAT vied for the advantage inside, led briefly in midstretch but weakened.
BATTER UP BUD raced just off the leaders outside and flattened out in the stretch. BLACK LIGHT hustled to a clear lead in the opening quarter, dueled
outside and yielded in the final furlong. SEMPER FIDELIS moved close up inside, was shuffled back near the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
FLIGHT settled inside, angled three wide rallying into the stretch and edged away driving. BIG AMBITION vied for the advantage outside and continued well
to the finish. CRY IT UP hustled to narrow advantage inside then weakened in the stretch. CAPE NEDDICK broke sluggishly and raced far back before
offering some late energy. WILL BE NOW lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. OLD HEAD ducked in sharply in the opening quarter then advanced
inside before tiring. DIVINARY lacked speed and was never in contention. ELEVENMONTHSLATER chased very wide and gave way readily. LUNA T raced
within range four wide and stopped. SHEGOTTHEBESTOFME raced off the leaders three wide and was finished after half a mile. LITTLE MOOJI flashed
speed inside and stopped abruptly. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the backstretch.

PONTIFFANY stalked the pacesetter, took over into the stretch and pulled away under moderate urging. XENATOWN raced close up outside, drifted out
through the stretch while holding the place. SHETALKSTOMUCH trailed early inside, moved wide on the turn, was carried out in the stretch and could not
get by the runner-up.. SEVEN YEARS LATER sprinted to a clear advantage, was collared into the stretch and faded. RAINBOW TROUT saved ground and
began retreating on the turn. TIZITA raced wide off the leaders and stopped abruptly. ROMANTIC COMEDY broke very slowly, rushed to contention and
faltered badly.

HOTPOT trailed the field, made a four wide run into contention on the turn, came wide, closed steadily outside in the stretch drive, kicked in willingly late
and was up in time. STEELY DANZA chased two wide, moved up midway on the turn, rallied outside of MUST BE LOVE turning for home, dug in gamely,
gained a short lead at the sixteenth marker and battled to the wire. LATE TO THE SHOW raced off the pace inside, moved up between rivals at the quarter
pole, rallied in the stretch drive, closed between horses and was outkicked. MUST BE LOVE set the pace racing with a clear lead, raced off the inside
turning for home, dueled past the eighth pole and weakened. SON OF A BEAST raced two wide off the pace and had no rally. CATTY'S UNCLE stumbled
at the start, raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. JOVIAL chased on the inside and faded.

NUCLEAR OPTION controlled the pace, widened in mid-stretch and remained safe while kept to his task. BREEZY GUST saved ground early, angled out to
secure room on the turn and closed well. B B BAD trailed early, advanced inside on the turn, moved out and finished well while no threat. KOBE B raced off
the leaders between foes, faded on the turn then came again with a mild rally. MR. HUSTLE dropped back outside, moved very wide on the turn and was no
factor. THISCATCANJUMP urged close up inside for half a mile and weakened. DR. STEVE made a menacing four wide bid on the turn then proved empty.
GOLDEN JUAN prompted the pace between rivals and faltered. TANKINATOR was hard ridden to press the early pace then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
MR THRIFTY raced two wide off the pace, moved up between rivals on the far turn, bid four wide at the quarter pole, swept by the leaders and pulled away
under urging. WHAT'S TO BLAME raced off the pace inside, moved up inside at the half mile marker, chased on the far turn, made a rail bid at the quarter
pole and rallied inside for second. DECKOLOGY raced three wide early, stalked the pace, chased on the far turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, was in
tight and steadied entering the stretch, then dug in to earn the show spot. ACKER raced off the pace inside, came four wide into the lane and closed
belatedly. CURLIN'S THRILL trailed the field, came wide into the stretch and closed belatedly. ANGELUS WARRIOR vied two wide for the lead, shook free,
dueled between rivals coming to the quarter pole and tired. MAGNETRON raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the backside, chased three
wide on the far turn and tired. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE vied inside for the lead, then was through after a half mile and dropped back readily.
