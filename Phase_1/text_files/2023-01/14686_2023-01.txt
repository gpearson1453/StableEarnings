CLASSIC UNION stalked the pace, moved easily to the front three wide on the turn and drew away under moderate urging. BLACKWATER FALLS dropped
back after the start outside, raced wide and gained the place. SHADOW CHASER settled behind the dueling leaders, moved out on the turn and finished
willingly. UNION REWARD hustled up to duel inside then gave way after half a mile. RUN FOR KARL dueled outside to the quarter pole and stopped
abruptly.

Footnotes
WENDY'S FINE WINE bobbled at the break, raced off the rail, off the pace, made a three wide bid nearing the far turn, took over on the turn, drew clear
under urging and held well. MISQUILLO trailed the field, advanced on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter pole and rallied outside for second.
PLIANTLEA raced off the pace between rivals, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied inside and was outkicked for the place spot. DIANE'S COMET stalked
the pacesetter, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE raced three wide early, continued three wide off the pace, moved up
four wide on the far turn and tired. TIZ HER WAY raced off the pace inside and did not factor. FALL CAMPAIGN set the pace, shook free on the backside,
dueled briefly on the far turn and gave way.

NOT A TRACE controlled the pace inside, was collared in the stretch, fought back gamely and held rival safe. CREEDIBILITY rated early, bid closer before
half a mile, reached near even terms in mid-stretch but was outfinshed. BOOM BOOM GIRL prompted the winner for three quarters then came up empty.
LADY BREXIT saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. ABHAILE forced pace briefly inside then gave way. ELUSIVE RYDER pinched back early,
advanced wide then came up empty. GLOWING STAR dropped far behind and was always outrun. ANGEL RAPHAEL was urged close up outside early
then stopped abruptly.

dueled with the winner and dug in gamely outside to the finish. LONG LEGGED BOY chased two wide, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane
and finished evenly. DON'T BLAME FREDDY chased on the inside, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MEET THE ELITE dueled inside for

dueled between rivals on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
AMIGOS GUITAR moved easily to the front, widened on the turn, held a long advantage in mid-stretch and was under moderate late urging. CRAFTY DON
raced in close pursuit of the pacesetter and proved easily second best. I SAW IT ALL chased outside and continued well to gain the show. DANGNABBIT
broke slowly, advanced inside and finished well. DOUGIE lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing. BOOM BOOM KABOOM chased near
mid-pack and was never in contention. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN saved ground close up for half a mile and faltered. DOHKO trailed racing wide and was never
a factor. FRANK N DUCKY raced within striking range briefly then gave way. PANADERO dropped far behind and was always outrun. MR. TUTTLE lacked
speed and stopped abruptly.

MANOLETE eased back in the opening quarter, was blocked from midway on the turn to the stretch, angled out and surged clear. LONG TERM THINKING
steadied early, five wide bid on the turn, led briefly but was outfinished. NICK THE CARDSHARK settled inside the dueling leaders, moved out in the stretch
and closed well. ROCKIN COWBOY rated behind a wall of rivals down the backstretch then moved extremely wide into the stretch. AHSAD dueled along
the inside to the stretch and weakened. MANAHAWKIN lagged far behind then offered some late energy. SILVER FURY saved ground, awaited room on
the turn and flattened out in the stretch. KING'S HOUSE dueled between rivals to the stretch and faltered. EMPIRE'S SCORE prompted the pace four wide,
led at the quarter pole then gave way.

GEEBERT far behind early, moved very wide, finished strongly while moving clear in the final furlong. IN SKY WE TRUST broke slowly, weaved through
traffic and closed full of run to gain place. FOX RED set a pressured pace inside, edged clear in mid-stretch and tired. BERKS raced outside in striking
range then flattened out late. CANT STOP THIS MAN hustled just off the pace very wide and continued willingly. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY dropped back
early, saved ground and failed to threaten. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL forced the pace outside to the stretch and weakened. FIELDER advanced extremely
wide on the turn then faltered. TOMMY THE TORCH steadied in the opening quarter, raced outside and was no factor. CHAIN REACTION was urged close
up early then weakened steadily. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF broke a bit slowly, rushed to contention inside then gave way.
