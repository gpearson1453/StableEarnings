Footnotes
AMERICAN ROMA set the pace off the inside, vied through the final turn then edged away through the stretch under a steady drive. GRIT'N'GRIND lagged
far behind, advanced wide in the stretch and closed well. SAMARONTI saved ground early, went after the pacesetters on the final turn and finished willingly.
ORIGO bid inside to engage the leader before half a mile, dueled and tired in the stretch. CURLIN'S THRILL settled wide off the pace, angled inside rivals in
the lane then flattened out. GRAZELY prompted the pace outside for half a mile and stopped. MELINA'S DREAM lacked speed and faltered losing contact
with his field.

menacing. NEVER CHANGE lacked speed inside then flattened out in the stretch. VERBIER raced close up inside to midway on the final turn and faded.
MARGIN OF AIR prompted the pace three wide for five furlongs and gave way. OUCH OUCH OUCH moved briefly closer inside on the final turn then gave
way. EXPLAIN raced far behind throughout and weakened steadily.

CICI UNIFIED raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the turn, rallied into the stretch, closed steadily in the final furlong and got up late for the win. NO
SYMPATHY raced three wide off the pace, advanced on the turn, rallied outside at the quarter pole, took over turning for home, drew clear, dug in gamely
and was caught in the final strides. TOURING MARYANNE raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly on the rail. WITHOUT A
VIEW chased on the inside, chased on the turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. GET HER READYEDDIE was bumped and steadied at the start,
raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. FROSTED WILD RIDE opened up in the early stages, showed the way into the turn, dueled briefly
passing the quarter pole, then gave way. RISEN CHANGE broke in bumping a rival at the start, raced off the pace and did not factor.

WIZARD SERRAT split foes advancing after half a mile, took over at the top of the stretch and rallied clear. KITH prompted the pace outside, earned a
narrow lead on the final turn, was collared by the winner and weakened. TURNS raced off the pace in the two path and flattened out in the stretch.
MIDNIGHT TRICK lagged far behind then offered some late energy while no threat. MO READY set a measured pace inside then was finished after three
quarters. SHOWING OFF saved ground close up briefly then gave way readily. THIS ILL DEFEND raced three wide behind the pacesetters and stopped
abruptly.

Footnotes
OSPREY raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside, surged in deep stretch and was up in the final
strides to win going away. SPIKEZONE showed good early speed to set the pace, shook free, responded when roused, dug in gamely in the stretch run,
battled on determinedly in the final sixteenth and was caught late. UNIMPEACHABLE chased two wide early, chased on the turn, rallied midlly between
horses and dug in to get third at the end. RUFFY broke awkwardly and was steadied, chased on the inside, advanced on the turn and rallied mildly inside in
the stretch. HONORARY DEGREE chased close up three wide, chased on the turn, rallied mildly outside and was outkicked. KODAPENDENT was outrun
early and closed belatedly. SECRET RULES raced off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CASHING BIG CHECKS urged to the front, widened before half a mile, maintained a decisive advantage and was under moderate pressure to the finish.
CLOSET SHOPPER lacked speed outside then advanced inside through the stretch to gain the place. BEACH DAZE made a menacing move inside on the
final turn then flattened out. MISS LOYALTY trailed for five furlongs, rallied wide and showed some late energy. BABY GUNDIN settled inside, angled out
moving on the final turn then weakened. SOLEMN OATH dropped back early inside and was never in contention. CLOUT CHASER prompted the winner in
the opening half mile then stopped.
