Footnotes
DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE set the pace in the two path, drew clear while well in hand around the far turn, inched further away under driving pressure in upper
stretch, and was put to wraps late. DUDE DROP KID stalked along the inside, shifted to the two path entering the backstretch, gained place before tipping to
the three path and outside of the clear leader turning for home, then chased that rival through the lane while pulling clear of the rest. OLDER AND WISER
leaned outwardly at the start, saved ground off of the pace, then moved up along the rail. CHIEF KIMOSABI tracked four wide around both turns, and gave
way. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN trailed in the three path, and made little impact. CATINANDSCATIN stalked outside of the pace setter and from the three
path, but weakened between horses around the far turn, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF GLORY trailed in the three path, swung out entering the lane, drifted to the eight path at the three sixteenths pole, then rallied down the center
of the track to drive past the leaders in the closing stages. ROCK WITH YOU brushed an inner rival leaving the gates, dueled for the lead two wide, inched
clear nearing the lane, held sway from chasers through midstretch, but was caught by an outer oncharging rival in the final sixteenth. CELLULOID HERO
stalked the embattled leading pair from the outside, took aim on the leader in upper stretch, but only managed to chase that foe through the lane, and was
outkicked for place late. KISLOVODSK laid off of the pace along the inside, then chased along the rail through the lane while lacking the needed kick to
produce a bid. FASTNFURIOUS chased in the three to four paths around the turn, attempted to range up outside of the leaders turning for home, but tired in
upper stretch without menacing. JUSTFORSPEIGHTOFIT brushed with an outer rival at the start, sparred for the lead inside of that foe into the turn, but
weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole, and was eased through the late stages.

Footnotes
EASY RUNNER brushed the outer part of the gate while breaking a step slowly, prompted the pace three wide, vied into the turn, drew clear in hand nearing
the lane, shifted to the five path at the quarter pole, and drew off under moderate hand urging thereafter. CHROMPTON chased along the inside, split foes
three wide in upper stretch to bid for place at the furlong grounds inside of MR ELVIN, then battled with that foe through the late stages, and prevailed. MR
ELVIN tracked two wide and between horses, shifted to the four path and outside of the leader nearing the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with
that one while bidding for place entering the lane, gained that position before meeting CHROMPTON's inner challenge in midstretch, dueled with that one
through the final furlong, but was outfinished. OLE STUD MUFFIN chased while off of the pace and outside of rivals, got floated to the five path around the
turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and gave way. MAGIC LIGHTNING sparred for the lead two wide and between horses into the turn, but proved
no match for his outer counterpart turning for home, and yielded in upper stretch. REVERENT dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but weakened
leaving the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT tracked in the four to six path and outside of rivals around the first turn, inched closer to stalk the top pair from the five path into the
far turn, bid outside of a leading OAK HILL SOLUTION in upper stretch, dueled through midstretch, and edged ahead in the final sixteenth. OAK HILL
SOLUTION stalked outside of the leader and in the four path, pressed down the backstretch, vied around the far turn, led with a quarter mile to go as an
outer IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT loomed a danger, met that one's challenge in upper stretch, dueled well into the final furlong, but was bested in the closing
stages. PRAY IDE SING broke through the gate pre-race, but was quickly reloaded, set the pace while remaining multiple lengths off the inside as an outer
rival pressed, got headed by that foe at the quarter pole, yielded in upper stretch, yet lasted for show between horses late. LOUISIANA MOON laid off of the
pace in the three path, tracked the main group around the far turn, shifted to the five, then six, path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. I'M D'CAT was
coaxed along while tracking along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch, then failed to menace between horses. WICKED ALEX was a bit antsy in the
starting gate, trailed along the inside early on, swung from the three path to the seven entering the lane, and failed to factor. MY GUITAR stalked behind the
leading pair and from the two path early on, shifted to the five path and outside of them entering the backstretch, but came under coaxing while tucking to
the rail nearing the far turn, chased around that bend, but gave way through the lane. CAEUS IN PASADENA broke a step slowly, raced at the rear in the
four to five paths, and got outrun.

Footnotes
OUR FREDDIE MAC vied for the lead three to two wide, drew clear at the five sixteenths pole, and held sway from a chasing rival through the final furlong.
BIG SCULLY laid close up between the pace setting pair early on, failed to keep pace at the half mile pole, stalked them from the three path around the
bend, took aim outside of the clearing leader in upper stretch, but steadily drifted out while chasing well through the final furlong. TWO B broke slowly,
quickly rushed forward to duel for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but proved no match at the five sixteenths pole, and tired while hanging on his left
lead. FOOLISH DREAMS settled off of the pace in the two wide, then improved inside of rivals while being herded inwardly coming to midstretch.
ITELLYOUTHEFACTS chased from midpack in the three to four paths around the turn, then lacked a rally between horses. QUARTER RAT spotted the
leaders over a length while off slow at the start, lacked speed in the three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and lacked a rally. CHARLIE'S
TOWN pursued from midpack while hung in the five path around the turn, then drifted inwardly approaching midstretch while giving way. BAQUERO'S BIND
was outrun in the two path.

Footnotes
PACIFICISLANDTIME took a mild bump from an inner rival at the start, was contempt to trail behind fast fractions down the backstretch, rallied in the five
path around the far turn, sustained his charge to bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. DRILLING REPORT tracked in the three path, gained in the
four path to bid for the lead nearing the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and proved second
best. DREWHUSTLE stalked the run away leaders from the two path, inched closer to the remaining pace setter around the far turn as an outer rival did the
same, got outmoved by that foe nearing the lane, yet kept on to secure a minor placing. BIND FAITH was bumped by an inner foe into an outer rival at the
start, tracked along the inside, chased from the fence around the far turn, and lacked a bid. COHERE laid off of the pace in the four path, came into the lane
wider, and failed to factor. INTO WISHING settled off of the pace two wide, and made little impact. EVERLOVINGHAND broke out and bumped a rival at the
start, dueled for the lead inside of AND FIFTY while setting strenuous fractions, inherited a clear margin after his counterpart stopped at the half mile pole,
but was overhauled by bidders entering the lane, and weakened. AND FIFTY sparred for the lead two wide through a arduous pace, but was through before
reaching the half mile pole, stopped around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

FREEDOM'S WAY tracked in the three path around the first turn, inched closer along the inside approaching the far turn, split the leading pair two wide to
bid entering the far turn, vied with his outer rival turning for home, yet kicked clear entering the lane, and was driven home. SUPER WISE stalked outside of
the pace setter, but left ample room for FREEDOM'S WAY to bid between them while ranging up entering the far turn, vied with that one turning for home,
but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and chased that foe home to prove second best. FIELDSTONE laid off of the pace in the four path, tracked the
newly leading pair around the far turn, but only managed to chase them through the lane. WIN WORTHY walked out of the starting gates and spotted the
rest multiple lengths, lagged behind in the three path, swung to t he seven path entering the lane, and surpassed a tired rival. WILTON set a clear pace

Footnotes
CIGAR VAN pressed the leader from the three path, vied around the turn, drew clear in the six path leaving the quarter pole, widened his margin after
shifting further out at the furlong pole, and was put to wraps late. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY trailed in the four path into the turn, fanned to the center of the
track in upper stretch, and stayed on while hanging on his left lead to reach place late. HAPPY SEASON was floated inwardly at the start, chased along the
inside, pursued the top pair from the three path around the turn, took aim on the leader from the seven path in upper stretch, but failed to progress coming to
midstretch, lugged in slightly while flattening out at the furlong grounds, and was outkicked for place late. GRAY DANE laid off of the pace in the two path,
then chased mildly along the rail. STARPORT set the pace inside of the eventual winner while a path off of the inside, got headed by that foe nearing the
lane, failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and yielded between horses in the final furlong. ALL OUT WAR raced far back along the inside, and never got
involved. LINCOLN PRODUCTION chased in the four path, and faded. PUNCHIE was outrun.
