unhurried early, angled out six wide in the stretch, closed fast and was gaining on the winner. RISKY BOY raced mid pack early, rallied four wide in the
stretch, finished well and just missed place. HIDDEN RULER had good position on the inside and went evenly late. TEN TWENTY NINE tracked three wide
and lacked a late response. YO BERBS raced close up for a half, then faded in the stretch. W W KAN DO chased the winner on the inside and tired in the
stretch. AREYOUTALKINGTOME was outrun.

JOHN'S ROCK pressed early, rallied on the far turn and gained the lead, repulsed a bid in mid stretch and prevailed late under right handed urging. WE ALL
SEE IT was well placed early just off the speed, rallied in the stretch and drew close, could not get past the winner but was second best. ATOMIC TONE
was unhurried early, rallied on the inside and closed willing. FALCONS FURY raced three wide early, rallied in the stretch four wide and hung late.
BEHAVIN MYSELF raced four wide throughout and was no menace. IWILLPERSEVERE allowed to settle on the inside, failed to menace. GOOD IDEA had
good position on the inside and was no threat. RYEGATE STONE set the pace for six furlongs, then gave way.

ANIMO ROBERTO was allowed to settle early, rallied on the far turn three wide, closed determinedly under left handed urging and prevailed. SPLENDID
SPIRIT dueled on the early lead, shook clear down the backside, was hooked in the stretch, held grudgingly and just missed. NOSEY POWER was well
placed early, rallied in the stretch, steadied late in stretch and went evenly late. PEDAL TO DA KETTLE was allowed to settle early,, improved late while no
threat. BIG TIME FLIRT dueled on the lead for three quarters, then weakened in the lane. CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS pressed the pace for three quarters,
then weakened. BIRD GONE WEST raced mid pack early and tired on the far turn. MY TICKET turn head start, lost all chance,was distanced and walked
off. The stewards post the inquiry sign and the rider of NOSEY POWER claimed foul against the rider of ANIMO ROBERTO for alleged interference in deep
stretch. The stewards ruled MY TICKET received a fair start and the foul claim was not allowed.
