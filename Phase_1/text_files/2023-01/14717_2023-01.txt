MALIBU MIKE no speed to the turn, widest run into the stretch, moved up late. FORT LOWELL never menaced throughout. ROUGHIN THE CITY no speed
to the turn, moved up a bit in stretch run. GUEST SPEAKER between horses to turn, in tight three eighths pole, checked back hard to last and never
recovered. HEADLINE REPORT gave way readily into the turn. RUN RUN RAPIDASH rushed inside dueled early, gave way from the turn. TEMPO
