Footnotes
BEACHMONT CHARLIE stalked the pace from the rail, came through a wide open lane inside of the pacesetter in the stretch and was up on the wire.
MASTER OOGWAY set the pace along the rail, drifted out entering the lane, continued to drift mildly in the lane and led until the final strides. SMOOTH
MOTION was reluctant to load, raced in range three and four wide, had aim outside of the pacesetter in upper stretch but could only slowly gain through the
lane while lightly herded out. MATRO was pinched back at the start, raced off the pace three wide and ran on for a minor share. READY FOR DIAMONDS
saved ground and failed to menace. FIRST SQUAD was outrun inside. BLUE COSMO bumped at the start, raced two wide in midpack and faded in the
lane. SPY TOWN played no factor while racing two and three wide. UWHARRIE prompted the pace in the three path and tired in the lane. MY EAGLE
SOARS steadied along between rivals for a half, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. DONTKISSDAMINISTER hit the starting gate,
raced off the pace four wide, made a middle move outside down the backstretch, went five wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SMOOTH MOTION AGAINST MASTER OOGWAY WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
DOCTOR RON was unhurried in the two path, angled out going into the turn and moved up from the four path around the turn, was roused from the five
path into the lane, ran on to take the lead going into the final furlong, and drew clear. HELL'S KITTEN set the pace in the two path, was cued from the rail
passing the quarter pole and was under left handed urging going into the stretch, was caught by the winner passing the eighth pole, but held on to place.
FORTY FLASH brushed with an outer foe at the start, was prompted along in the five path, bumped with NEOPHYTE early, tipped out to the six path while
under a drive entering the stretch, and finished evenly to secure show. ON JET HEIR stalked along the inside but flattened from the two path in the stretch.
BANKER'S HOURS bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced from wellback in the five path, was urged from the seven path into the stretch, but was no
factor. NEOPHYTE was hustled along from up close in the four path, bumped with FORTY FLASH early, was driven from the two path into the stretch, but
faded. RARE JEWEL bumped with an outer foe and brushed with an inner foe just after out of the gate, trailed from the three path early and never factored.
JOYFUL SURPRISE chased in the six path early and was no menace from the eight path in the stretch.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN MOON narrowly led from the four path into the turn, received a right handed cue from the three path entering the stretch, opened slightly in
upper stretch, began to shorten inside the final sixteenth, but held on. CHROMEPLATED HEART pressed the pace in the two path, tipped out to the five
path into the lane, was under left handed urging and bumped with DESIGNED BY KITTEN passing the eighth pole, and ran on to hold place. DESIGNED
BY KITTEN stalked in the three path, was roused between rivals around the turn and was under right handed urging from the six path entering the stretch,
bumped with CHROMEPLATED HEART passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. LI LI BEAR prompted the pace in the five path, floated out to the
seven path into the lane, and finished evenly. MERCURY HEAD was held up along the inside, was driven from the two path into the stretch, and was no
factor. SMOOTH PEBBLE tracked in the four path but never threatened. VEERY was reluctant to load, chased from the six path and was no menace.

OK BOOMER rated in the four path, swung out to the eight path under a drive into the lane, and rallied to get up in the final sixteenth.
BLAMETHEGOODTIMES stalked in the four path, floated out to the six path going into the stretch, angled in and bid going into the final furlong, and ran on
for place. HARRY TIME (IRE) raced in midpack from the two path, was driven between rivals around the far turn, tipped out to the five path into the lane,
was herded in by an outer foe while taking a short lead into the final furlong, but was caught by a pair of outer rivals late to show. MOON LANDING
hesitated leaving the gate, trailed around the two path early, tucked in and was ridden from the rail around the far turn, was in the three path entering the
stretch, shifted out to the six path under left handed urging going into the final furlong, and evened out late. PRUDENCIO prompted the pace in the three
path, was driven from said position into the stretch, angled in to bid going into the final furlong but bumped SENDERO passing the eighth pole, and flattened
out. MASTER OF NONE tracked in the five path but was no factor from the eight path in the stretch. SYNDICATED (GB) set the pace in the two path, began
to fade from inside in upper stretch, and had to steady while yielding passing the eighth pole. SENDERO was unhurried in the two path, moved up from the
rail around the far turn, was short of room approaching the quarter pole, tipped out to the two path into the stretch, was herded in, bumped by PRUDENCIO
and forced to steady passing the eighth pole, and failed to threaten. AFTER AN INQUIRY, AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SENDERO, PRUDENCIO
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR DRIFTING IN AND BUMPING SENDERO NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE, FORCING SAID FOE TO STEADY
OUT OF THE RACE.

Footnotes
KINGSBARNS stalked in the two path, was between rivals and driven from the three path into the lane, ran on to take the lead into the final furlong and drew
clear. GAME WARDEN bumped with an inner foe at the start, was wellback in the five path, floated out to the nine path into the stretch and rallied down the
center for place. PRAIRIE DUNES rated in the four path, was carried out to the ten path by an inner rival turning into the lane, and ran on down the center
for show. ARCANGELO tracked in the three path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. WEYHILL ROAD was
prompted along in the five path, was coaxed to bid from the four path passing the quarter pole, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, but hung, and faded in
the final furlong. BIG DATA raced prominently in the six path, was urged from said position turning into the lane, but was no threat. BERLONE pressed in
the four path, took the lead around the turn, was roused from the two path into the stretch, but yielded. SARA'S SHAMAN broke in at the start, set the pace
in the two path but gaveway along the inside around the turn. WINGER got bumped between foes leaving the gate, was hustled along in the seven path and
never factored. EQUAL PROTECTION broke in and bumped an inner foe just after the start, chased in the five path but was empty in the stretch.
DREAMWITHINADREAM got bumped around at the start and trailed throughout around the three path.

Footnotes
SWEET DANI GIRL set a rated pace inside, was headed near the five-sixteenths pole, regained command nearing the eighth pole and edged ahead under
a drive. MONA STELLA raced off the pace four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and finished well to gain the place late. SUGAR FIX rated
three wide, bid three deep midway around the far turn, led into the stretch, appeared to be trying to lug in under a hard right rein, was only hand urged then
taken in hand in deep stretch and lost second late. SONAR bumped with DON'T GET KHOZY at the start, tracked the pace in the two path and lacked the
needed rally. DON'T GET KHOZY was bumped at the start then in a bit tight, saved ground and never threatened. CRYSTAL COAST prompted the pace
two wide, took a brief lead between foes near the five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE failed to menace while racing three
wide. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN was outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
LIGHTENING LARRY set the pace in the three path, was coaxed from the four path into the stretch, and drew clear. CAJUN'S MAGIC trailed from the four
path into the turn, was between foes and under left handed urging from the six path going into the stretch, kept on, and chased home the winner for place.
GATSBY prompted the pace in the the two path, was ridden along the rail around the turn, and evened out in the stretch for show. LEGAL DEAL bumped
with an outer foe at the start, chased in the five path, floated out to the eight path in the stretch, and was no factor. BOCA BOY broke in and bumped an
inner rival, tracked in the six path, ranged up in the five path around the turn, but faded in the stretch. LEGENDS CAN'T DIE brushed with an inner foe out of
the gate, rated along the inside but was no menace. UNSOCIABLE brushed with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four path but was empty in the
stretch.
