GALLANT GUY inside run to the turn, took over in the stretch while all out and held sway late to prevail. PURPLE DREAM inside run to turn, trapped inside
deep stretch, tipped out for run late and missed on the wire while probably best today. WILLTORUN wide run to quarter pole, floated to the four path into the
stretch and kept on gamely outside for the show spot late. UNPREDICTABLE BAY chased leader to the stretch but weakened in late going while gamely to
the wire. HOLIDAY HOUSE raced along never far back throughout but lacked a late kick when needed. JOHNY'S FIREBALL no speed to the stretch,
improved position a bit in the drive. STUBBORNKINDAFELLA never menaced. LUCCI rushed to the front, dueled to turn but stopped badly in the stretch.
