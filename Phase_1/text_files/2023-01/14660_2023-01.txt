Footnotes
VINNIE VAN GO pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the lane.
IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK led the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the three path around the bend, could not go with the
winner in the stretch and kept on to the wire. GOLOVKIN raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, navigated the turn from the three path and
improved position late. ODDS ON raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and finished
evenly. SIXTY ONE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and was never a
threat. JACK LUVS NOVA raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and made no bid. GUACO stumbled slightly
leaving the gate, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the bend and was never a factor.

back of the back early, came around the bend in the two path and improved position in the stretch. RAW HONEY dueled on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, gave way entering the stretch and faded further in the final furlong. C'EST PARTI raced off the pace
on the inside through the opening stages, swung out to the four path for the run around the turn and made no bid. EXPECT A CIRCUS raced in the middle

Footnotes
LULLABY LAND raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four and five
path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled in the lane to edge clear. ONE NIGHT STAND saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader
well off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and dueled to the wire, giving way late.
LEA RO raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began to improve position while racing in the four path around the
second bend and continued to gain ground in the lane. PANOTTI saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack
on the inside, came around the far turn in the three and four path and improved position mildly in the lane. MIDNIGHT PIRATE raced in the two path at the
back of the pack around the firs turn and up the backstretch, improved position while saving ground around the far bend and in upper stretch and flattened
out in the final furlong. CLASSY OF COURSE raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the three path and was outkicked. DONYA'S MAGIC sprinted to a clear early lead while racing in the two path around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and tired quickly while drifting out in the lane. RED PIXIE saved ground
around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was not a factor.

GRADE ONE stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and dueled in the stretch to just
get up for the win. HAPPY CAJUN bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, chased the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground late. VICTORIOUS WAVE pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, chased the leaders from the rail around the bend and dueled down the lane to narrowly miss. BLAKENSTEIN trailed the field up the backstretch,
began to improve position while racing in the four path around the turn and continued to gain ground in the stretch. SCRUTINIZER bumped with the horse to
his inside at the break, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and improved position mildly in the lane.
AIN'T WASTING TIME tracked the leaders on the inside early, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the bend and was empty in the
stretch. IN THE LOOP led the way between horses up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and faded in the final furlong.
