Footnotes
IVORY MOON set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under confident handling. BALLETIC stalked the pace from the rail,
tipped two wide in upper stretch, could not gain on the winner but stayed on for the place. CALABRIAN QUEEN was bumped at the start, raced outside in
midpack early, angled to the rail nearing the turn, briefly tipped two wide near the quarter pole, angled back to the rail in upper stretch and rallied for the
show. DADDYSLILBOSSLADY saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch and improved position in the lane. MENDED WE STAND
chased the pace three wide and weakened a bit in the lane. OOLONG HAI (IRE) pressed the winner two wide and faded in the lane. TAP AND CHU was
shut off at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. TAPIT'S APPROVAL broke outwardly and bumped CALABRIAN QUEEN at the start, raced well
back four wide around the turn and lacked a rally. FEDALINE placed off the pace three wide, lugged in in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. HEADING
WEST raced in range two wide, angled five wide turning for home and came up empty. CHILLY CHOCOLATE steadied at the start and played no factor
while racing three wide.

Footnotes
CARABINERO dueled for the lead outside of an inner rival from the five path into the turn, took command rounding the turn while shifting inwards to the four
path, briefly lost the right iron approaching the quarter pole, quickly regained the iron, opened up and was roused into the lane, and held sway while being
kept to task. BIG JOHN hopped and hesitated at the start, trailed from the two path into the turn, was coaxed along the rail rounding the turn and was under
right handed urging into the stretch, and kept on from the two path for place. GABE dueled to the inside of the winner from the three path into the turn,
dropped back around the turn and was ridden into the stretch, but yielded.

ALLAMERICANBEAUTY settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer under a drive three wide around the turn, split rivals nearing the
eighth pole, moved to the front leaving the sixteenth pole and held firm between foes late. DORAL broke awkwardly, was pinched back not long after, saved
ground off the pace, advanced two wide around the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, was forced out in upper stretch then closed well outside.
I'M A SURE THING angled in sharply not long after the start and bumped READY SHE IS into TAR HEEL GIRL into BOMBA NERA, pressed the pace two
wide, was bumped in upper stretch and was one-paced from there. BOMBA NERA was bumped not long after the start, raced in range inside, angled out
and bumped I'M A SURE THING in upper stretch, angled in and forced QUEEN ROCKET into KING'S SECRET while taking the lead leaving the eighth pole
but was outkicked from there. NOT EVEN THEN was squeezed back after the start, trailed in the two path early, advanced four wide around the far turn and
had a mild stretch rally. QUEEN ROCKET set the pace along the rail, steadied entering the first turn, led to midstretch, was forced in by BOMBA NERA
leaving the eighth pole, bumped KING'S SECRET and lost the whip in the incident then dropped back. READY SHE IS was bumped between foes not long
after the start, steadied a few strides later, tracked the pace three wide, was forced out in upper stretch and weakened. JUST THE SKY saved ground and
failed to menace. KING'S SECRET (GB) saved ground off the pace, bid at the rail nearing the eighth pole, was bumped and forced to take up leaving the
eighth pole and was not urged from there. APRIATI was off slow, saved ground off the pace, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened.
KEKIONGA played no factor while racing two and three wide. TAR HEEL GIRL was bumped between foes not long after the start, raced up close two wide,
steadied near the five-eighths pole and steadily faded. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH AND
DISQUALIFIED BOMBA NERA FROM FOURTH AND PLACED HER EIGHTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE EIGHTH POLE.

HOTTER THAN JULY broke out at the start, tracked in the five path, was roused to bid in the four path approaching the quarter pole, took a narrow lead
from said position into the the final furlong, gradually drifted out under left handed urging, and held on. HOLY BERRIES rated from the six path into the far
turn, loomed up from the five path passing the quarter pole and bid in the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on but hung while being floated slightly
out in the final furlong for place. BLAME THE VETS was rank in the two path around the first turn, stalked in the three path down the backstretch, briefly led
passing the quarter pole and was in the two path entering the stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong for show. SOUTH PACIFIC led along the rail into
the far turn, then yielded.

WELL INTO set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path into the stretch, opened up under right handed urging and held sway. HAY STACK
was reserved in the four path early, tipped out and was ridden from the five path turning into the lane, and ran on for place. MADEMOISELLEJACKIE
brushed with an inner foe just after the start, stalked in the two path and kept on from said position through the stretch to hold show. JUSTIFIABLE BELLE
rated in the four path, was driven from said position around the far turn and into the stretch, stayed on, and mildly gained. HIGHLAND GRACE bumped with
an outer foe out of the gate, was out in the six path around the first turn and raced prominently from said position thereafter, shifted into the four path turning
into the lane, and flattened out in the final furlong. SOLO ALBUM raced in midpack along the inside, was cued left handed from the three path turning into
the stretch, but was one paced. LEIPZIG raced off the pace in the four path early and was no threat from the six path in the lane. QUEEN DEYMAR was
wellback in the five path early and was no factor from the eight path in the stretch. LITERATE prompted the early pace in the four path but faded turning into
the stretch. TWO MINUTE LICK bumped with an inner foe at the start and then was in tight between just after, was held up in the six path but empty in the
nine path entering the lane. PARTY TIME trailed in the two path early and was no menace. A J'S MEMORY tracked in the two path, had to steady into the
far turn, and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
PSYCHEDELIC SHACK set the pace in the two path and widened through the lane while ridden out. GOLDEN SODA pressed the winner in the three path,
could not match strides with that foe in upper stretch but kept on well to hold off the rest. UBIQUITOUS raced off the pace three wide and rallied for the
show. LOYAL LOUIE stalked the pace inside and was one-paced through the lane. TRINNI SUMMER failed to menace while racing four wide. LOST A
LEGEND chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. PIPITO played no factor while racing four and five wide. ENSIGN PARKER broke
inwardly and bumped JOYFUL CANDY at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. PURE SPEIGHT saved ground to no avail. PICO
D'ORO was outrun inside. JOYFUL CANDY was bumped at the start and trailed in the three path.

lane, stayed on, drifted out after a left handed cue into the final sixteenth, but held on. SOSUA SUMMER stalked along the inside early, tipped out around
the turn and was ridden from the five into the lane, and ran on for place. ADIOS ASHER bumped with an outer foe at the start, was prompted along in the
four path but evened out from the six path in the stretch for show. NO ANGEL bumped with an inner rival out of the gate, raced off the pace inside but was
no factor from the two path in the stretch. DR. DUKE rated in the three path, was driven from the seven path into the stretch, but never threatened. CRACK
SHOT got bumped between foes at the start, tracked in the three path, had to steady into the turn, and flattened from the five path in the stretch. WAR

after the start, was in midpack around the five path, drifted way out into the stretch, and faded.

Footnotes
GOOD SOLDIER got bumped between foes at the start, brushed the rail three times going into the first turn and steadied slightly along the inside just after,
moved up to set the pace down the backstretch, opened up in the two path around the far turn and into the lane, and held sway. TOTALLY LIKE MOM broke
out and bumped an outer foe leaving the gate, led in the two path around the first turn, took back and raced prominently to the outside of the pacesetter in
the three path down the backstretch, was coaxed in the four path around the far turn and into the stretch, drifted out in the stretch, but kept on to hold place.
MEDIA SENSATION chased in the five path, was driven from said position into the stretch, and ran on for show. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE had a slow start
and was unhurried in the six path early, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the eight path entering the lane, and stayed on. SHA TIN stalked in the
two path, shifted inwards to the rail around the far turn, but finished evenly from the two path in the stretch. CHEVAL DORE had to steady going into the first
turn, tracked in the two path, was coaxed while shifting out to the six path turning into the lane, but was one paced. MODUS was out in the five path around
the first turn and raced wellback from said position down the backstretch,was under right handed urging in the six path entering the stretch, but was no
factor. UNCLE MARK rated in the three path but never threatened. MAKIN BANK broke in and bumped with an inner foe, trailed in the two path early and
was no menace from the seven path in the stretch. BLAST THE MUSIC was out into the five path around the first turn, was prompted along in the four path
down the backstretch but gaveway around the far turn.
