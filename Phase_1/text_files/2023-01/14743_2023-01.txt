LOVE TANK broke out at the start, was sent to be in a tracked position, loomed five wide through the turn, took control at the quarter pole and held safe for
the win. CAIRO MOON pressed the early pace from between rivals, drifted out in mid stretch, kept on and finished a game second. FIRST ZAP was
unhurried early, advanced six wide through the turn and was along for third. MORATTA was void of any early speed, raced seven wide trough the turn and
offered no late rally. MIZZEN MILLIONS set a pressured early pace from off the rail and faded.

Footnotes
MAMA WAS A ROCKET set a three wide pressured pace into the turn, angled in through the stretch, met the bid of HANNAH'S HIGHLIFE, dueled with that
rival and prevailed for the win. CROSSFIRE COWGIRL was void of any early speed, advanced seven wide through the turn, was gaining late and finished
second best. HANNAH'S HIGHLIFE tracked the early pace, raced five wide into the turn, made a bid on the winner, couldn't sustain the run and was empty
late. DOER NOT A FAKER was up close early, angled in and tired. FIRST AGAIN hopped at the start, was rushed to be in range and faded.
HOLOTTALUTE pressed the early pace from the inside and gave way.
