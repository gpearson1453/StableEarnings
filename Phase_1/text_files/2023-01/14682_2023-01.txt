Footnotes
SUPER DESIGN went to a clear lead to set all the pace throughout and proved much the best. CASEYS MEMORY was unhurried through the first turn then
moved out to four wide at the five sixteenths pole and was three wide in upper stretch and closed well. EYE DEE KAY stalked the pace from the three path
then made a mild bid at the three eighths pole but was out finished in the drive. UNCLE FRANK hopped at the start, then was under wraps in the early
stages, advanced up the rail on the backstretch and faltered. LUCK OF THE DRAW tracked the leader from the inside to the quarter pole and gave way.
EASY TO MISS was placed off the pace in the two path to the three eighths pole and stopped.

SMART ANALYSIS tracked the leaders from the inside around the first turn then moved between horses at the three eighths pole to take the lead, drew
clear into the stretch and held on. SEEHOSS was hustled along then went four wide into the first turn settled off the pace down the backstretch then made a
late rail rally to prove second best. PRODUCTION TIME vied for the lead from the inside to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. PERFECT STRIKE
raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a mild bid and passed tiring rivals. MIZSPELT went to a pressured lead from the three path
around the first turn, raced three wide around the final turn and tired. GILDERSLEEVE was unsettled in the gate, raced near the back around the first turn
then moved out to three wide at the three eighths and flattened out. YOU YOUR DADDY SON was not a threat. LUCKY BIG DADDY raced in the middle of
the pack from off the rail around the first turn then dropped back and was not a factor.

SADIE'S LIGHT went to the lead to set a pressured pace early then inched away at the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch. CPRIORITY was hustled
along to the first turn then vied for the lead from the two path to the quarter pole, couldn't match strides with the winner and proved second best. JEFFROW
lugged out going into the first turn then dueled from the inside in the second flight down the backstretch but never made a bid. HOME VISIT dueled in the
second flight from the two path then made a rebid from between horses at the quarter pole and flattened out. SARAH'S VISION dueled from the three path
in the second flight to the quarter pole and weakened. OCEOLA was a little rank going into the first turn then moved out to four wide at the half pole to make

MISTY'S FOOL went to a early pressured lead to the quarter pole then fought back in the stretch drive and dueled with DEALMEINBUD to the wire and was
just up. DEALMEINBUD saved ground while vying for the lead throughout and battled down the stretch with MISTY'S FOOL and just missed. MEDITATE
was bumped going into the first turn by COACH HUDSON then pressed the pace from the three path, took a short lead at the quarter pole and dueled
outside of MISTY'S FOOL and DEALMEINBUD into the stretch to the sixteenth pole and tired. COACH HUDSON broke well then raced close up going into
the first turn bumped MEDITATE on the turn and was through early, distanced, jogged in and walked off.

Footnotes
BRAVE CITY GIRL broke well and went to the lead and was kept to task in the drive. HAMAZING LACE was placed off the pace from the four path, was
asked at the three sixteenths pole, floated out into the stretch and proved second best. FABS was hustled along to vie for the lead from the two path then
dropped to the rail at the five sixteenths pole but didn't make a late bid. ACELA EXPRESS was forwardly placed in the three path and raced evenly. DEAL
ME A PENNY was last away made a three to four wide bid at the quarter pole and faltered. CHICKIETOWN STAR chased the leaders from the inside then
moved out to four wide in upper stretch to give late effort but was not a factor. CRYPTO BRAVE was forwardly placed in the two path and dropped back.
MOM'S PRAYER raced close up down the backstretch on the inside then hit the rail going into the turn kept on around the turn then tired.
