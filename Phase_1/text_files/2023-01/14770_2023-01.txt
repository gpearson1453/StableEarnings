Footnotes
OCEAN LILLY rated a slim lead from the three quarter pole, dug in to the challenge of Lace Revolution leaving the three eighths pole and urged clear of that
one approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled through the lane. GRACE'S SECRET stalked inside on the
first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and was gaining later yards.
NAVY SWORD settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and
came along to take third mid-stretch. LACE REVOLUTION tapered in through the front stretch and stalked the early pace, challenged the winner leaving the
three eighths pole but dropped back approaching the quarter and weakened leaving the far turn. DOOR BUSTER steadied between horses in the vicinity of
the three quarter pole and rounded the first turn in the three path, left the turn outside, bid past the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the three path of
the far turn. DECISIVE CAUSE showed little response. The Stewards reviewed and dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Lace Revolution for alleged
interference in the front stretch, lodged by the rider of Door Buster.

raced off the rail on the far turn and was kept alert to widen down the lane. KARPATHIAN DREAM rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, then dug in from the eighth pole to take second the final strides. CASTLE OF CAYLEE
raced well off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and
finished evenly to take third in the final strides. SARAH'S WARRIOR saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the
rail on the far turn, but flattened stride the final sixteenth. REVEIRS MINUTE took the lead two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole and rated the
pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail toward the quarter, continued close through the far turn then flattened in the
lane. GLOBAL EMPRESS rated off the pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch. NEW AGE BAD GIRL
raced off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. HOW IS SHE was not a factor.

Footnotes
STAVANGER rounded the first turn in the six path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved and took the
lead in the three path at the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and drew off under vigorous hand urging. GANDHI'S ORION became a little edgy in
the gate but took the lead early and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was met a furlong
away and relented the final sixteenth. PAPA CHARLES settled off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on
the far turn, but flattened stride in the lane. SMOOZER saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail,
angled to the five path approaching the top of the stretch, then flattened later yards. PLAYING GOLD rated close inside, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. BOUBOLINO mostly saved ground. CHERRYS CROSS rounded the first turn in
the four path, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole but faded in the four path of the far turn. HARDIN raced in the five path the first turn, saved
ground through the second turn and never factored. DR WILL rated close to the early pace about the three path, but checked leaving the second turn and
faded through the backstretch.
