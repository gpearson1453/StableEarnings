Footnotes
WONKA prompted the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, continued on the left lead until the sixteenth pole and just lasted. FAST AND FLIRTY
stalked the pace three wide, rallied between foes and just missed. WATCH IT steadied entering the first turn, raced two wide in midpack, angled four wide
near the quarter pole, rallied outside was narrowly outkicked. BREAKER OF CHAINS saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths
pole and rallied belatedly between foes. SATURDAY NITE GIRL saved ground off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. MY LIPS
ARE SEALED raced four wide in midpack, angled in nearing the far turn, raced two wide around that bend, swung six wide in upper stretch and lacked the
needed rally. PENTAGON raced off the pace outside, angled in early on the first turn, saved ground from there and never threatened. ON ALERT failed to
menace while racing four wide. SIEMPRE ELEGANTE hit the starting gate, raced four and five wide and made little impact. GUNESH steadied along inside
while racing up close early and faded in the stretch. QUALY set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. YOU LOOK COLD steadied along three wide
and was through early.

Footnotes
MAGE set the pace in the two path, was cued to open up turning into the lane, responded well and went clear. BOURBON RESOLVE tracked in the four
path, was urged from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. SUMMONYOURCOURAGE hopped at the start, rated in the five path, was driven
from the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for show. PERFORM prompted the pace in the four path, was roused turning into the lane, but flattened
going into the final furlong. ONE FAST DREAM stalked in the three path but faded rounding the turn. DARK VECTOR raced off the pace in the six path but
never threatened. KENTUCKY JOKER lost his right iron early, did not regain the iron and never was able to challenge. FOXBURG chased in the three path
but was done early. THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE ACTIONS OF KENTUCKY JOKER. NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
MOZAY was unhurried in the three path, tipped out around the far turn and ranged up while circling out to nine path under coaxing entering the lane, and
drew past inner rivals in the final furlong to win. KAHIKO stalked in the two path, was short of room turning into the lane, found an opening and was cued
right handed passing the eighth pole to run on between rivals for place. CAFE SOCIETY hesitated at the start and trailed in the four path around the first
turn, chased in the six path down the backstretch, was driven from the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) raced
prominently in the four path, was cued to bid in the three path rounding the far turn, took a narrow lead from the six path into the stretch, but evened out in
the final furlong. LOVE HER LOTS rated in the two path, was ridden from the seven path into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. JUNGLE JUICE
(IRE) set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path around the far turn, but yielded from the five path in upper stretch. OUT OF SORTS
tracked in the five path early but was no menace.

PERSONAL BEST rated in the two path early, tipped out around the final turn and was cued right handed from the five path into the stretch, and rallied in
the final furlong to get up late. TRANSIENT (GB) got bumped by an inner foe leaving the gate and was a bit rank in the opening half while in the three path,
loomed up and bid from said position into the stretch, lost the whip going into the final furlong, ran on and briefly led but was caught by an outer foe to place.
ADVENTURING broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace inside, was roused in the two path turning into the stretch, dug in under urging but was
caught by a pair of outer rivals late to show. BESIDE HERSELF raced prominently in the two path, was ridden around the final turn, but flattened from the
four path in the stretch. LISHEEN was unhurried along the inside, was roused around the final turn and swung out to the six path entering the lane, but was
no factor. MY CANDY GIRL stalked along the inside but faded turning into the lane. SOUL OF AN ANGEL trailed throughout around the two to four paths.

Footnotes
WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST stalked the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, angled to the rail and held clear under a
drive. SKYRO settled in range two wide, angled three wide in upper stretch, had aim outside of the winner through the lane but was second best. SMOKIN'
T broke inwardly and bumped BUSINESS MODEL at the start, raced off the pace three wide and rallied for the show. STEADY ON tracked the pace three
and four wide and was one-paced through the lane. CALIFORNIA FROLIC failed to menace while racing two and three wide. LIKE THE KING chased the
pace four and five wide and finished evenly. TANGO TANGO TANGO hit the starting gate, raced off the pace two and three wide and never threatened.
CARPENTERS CALL saved ground and lacked a closing bid. BUSINESS MODEL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide around the first
turn, saved ground around the far turn and made little impact. SUMMER ASSAULT played no factor while racing two and three wide. GREYES CREEK
saved ground off the early pace, went four wide around the far turn and was outrun. INTO THE SUNRISE set the pace inside, was collared nearing the
quarter pole and retreated through the lane.

MARYQUITECONTRARY got bumped and squeezed slightly between rivals out of the gate, raced off the pace in the six path into the turn, tipped in to the
five path and was under a ride around the turn, swung out to the seven path and was under right handed urging entering the lane, and rallied down the
center to get up in the final sixteenth. COLORFUL MISCHIEF rated in the three path, shifted to the rail around the turn and moved up under a drive into the
stretch, and ran on along the inside to get up for place. FIRE ON TIME had an awkward start, set the pace in the two path, was cued to open up entering the
lane, responded well but yielded passing the sixteenth pole, and held show. R ADIOS JERSEY pressed the pace in the four path early, was coaxed into the
lane, but was one paced, and drifted out late. LAST LEAF was hustled along in the five path, floated out to the six path into the stretch, but was no factor.
OBLIGATORY was coaxed along in the three path into the turn, and never threatened from the five path in the stretch. FAMED tracked along the inside,
was driven from the five path into the stretch, shifted inwards passing the eighth pole, and flattened. JAG WARRIOR bumped with an outer foe at the start,
chased on the five path, was roused from the six path into the lane, but faded. DIAMOND WOW bumped with an inner foe out of the gate, was wellback in
the seven path early and never menaced. MISS SPEEDY hopped out of the gate then was prompted along in the four path, gaveway turning into the lane,
and was eased.

Footnotes
RED KNIGHT settled off the pace while racing two wide, moved up between foes down the backstretch and three wide between foes around the far turn,
angled five wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole and edged ahead while drifting out a bit under left-handed urging. VALUE
ENGINEERING settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole
but could not withstand the winner. WICKED FAST was bumped entering the first turn, raced off the pace three wide, went five wide around the far turn and
rallied for the show. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace two wide, made progress between foes rounding the far
turn, angled six wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. TEMPLE was bumped early, saved ground in midpack and never
threatened. TIME FOR TROUBLE checked nearing the first turn, raced well back inside early, went three wide around the clubhouse turn, made progress
outside down the backstretch, went four wide around the far turn and lacked any further bids. CHANNEL MAKER had his head at the start, bumped with
TEMPLE early, stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole and faded in the lane. PAO ALTO (FR) raced up close inside and
came up empty in the lane. ABAAN set the a pressured pace inside and tired in the lane. AGITARE (IRE) was bumped and checked soon after the start,
became keyed up, rushed up, bumped WICKED FAST entering the first turn, rushed up four wide around that bend, dueled two wide the first time through
the stretch and around the clubhouse turn then retreated around the far turn. HARLAN ESTATE had early speed two wide, stopped nearing the far turn, was
pulled up in the stretch and walked off. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE'S FINAL MARGINS WERE CHARTCALLER ESTIMATES.

Footnotes
ENDORSED raced in midpack from the four path, was under right handed urging while ranging up from the eight path into the lane, rallied and drew past
inner foes inside the final furlong to win clearly. OCTANE brushed with an inner foe leaving the gate, stalked along the inside, was coaxed from the two path
turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. DEAN DELIVERS tracked in the four path, was roused around the turn and driven from the six path into the
stretch, and kept on under left handed urging for show. NOBLE DRAMA trailed along the inside, moved up around the turn, angled out to the six path going
into the lane, and finished evenly. PREVALENCE prompted the pace in the three path, was under left handed urging from the four path turning into the
stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. BLACK BELT bumped an inner foe out of the gate, raced prominently in the three path, was driven from the five path
into the stretch, but flattened. MILES D raced from wellback in the two path, shifted out to the seven path turning into the lane, but was no factor. MISH had
an awkward start and brushed with an outer foe, chased in the four path, fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, but never threatened. PICKING UP
PENNIES bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, but gaveway along the inside turning into the stretch. THE REDS rated in the
four path, tipped out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but was tired. TWELVE VOLT MAN stumbled at the start and was hustled along in the six path,
but was not a threat. DOC AMSTER got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe leaving the gate, was behind in the four path and never menaced.

Footnotes
QUEEN GODDESS stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole, shook clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead to the
sixteenth pole and held safe under a drive. SHANTISARA (IRE) raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and finished well. LADY
ROCKSTAR (GB) settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and stayed on to maintain the show. DALIKA (GER)
pressed the pace two wide, briefly led between rivals late on the far turn and weakened in the drive. WAKANAKA (IRE) saved ground off the pace, made
progress at the rail around the far turn, steadied off heels near the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. ARTIE'S
PRINCESS had early speed inside, rated just off the pace in the two path and had no response when roused nearing the quarter pole. JUSTIFY MY LOVE
(BRZ) was outrun inside. SWEET ENOUGH (GB) set the pace along the inside and faltered nearing the quarter pole. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
ATONE tracked in the two path, was roused while tipping out to the seven path entering the stretch, and rallied under left handed urging to get up in the final
strides. IVAR (BRZ) raced in midpack from the three path, bid from the five path into the stretch, ran on to take the lead inside the final furlong while drifting
out under left handed urging, and was caught by an outer foe late to place. SPEAKING SCOUT was unhurried in the two path, angled out to the seven path
entering the stretch, and kept on down the center for show. LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE stalked in the three path, was under right handed urging from the six
path turning into the stretch, and stayed on. ONE MORE BID set the pace along the inside, was roused from the two path turning into the stretch, and
yielded in the final sixteenth. KING CAUSE prompted the pace in the two path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but gaveway inside the final
furlong. MASTER PIECE (CHI) bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, trailed in the three path early, and was no factor between rivals in the stretch.
WIT was sent from the gate along the inside and was close up, tipped out to the three path under a drive going into the stretch, but faded. GOOD
GOVERNANCE (GB) raced off the pace inside but was no factor in the stretch and was stuck in traffic late. HURRICANE DREAM (FR) had a slow start and
was wellback in the three path, was roused from the six path into the lane, but was no threat. DECORATED INVADER rated in the four path, swung out to
the nine path into the stretch, but was no menace. CITY MAN bumped an inner foe out of the gate, was wellback in the five path and empty while going wide
in the stretch.

Footnotes
ART COLLECTOR settled in range four wide, edged closer outside down the backstretch, gained three deep around the far turn, took over in upper stretch
and readily drew off under a drive. DEFUNDED pressed the pace three wide between foes around the first turn and two wide between rivals around the far
turn, reached near even terms inside of the winner approaching the quarter pole, could not match strides with that foe in upper stretch but kept to hold clear
of the rest. STILLETO BOY set the pace along the rail to upper stretch, could not keep pace with winner from there but kept trying at the rail to hold third.
LAST SAMURAI settled off the pace while racing two wide between foes, edged closer down the backstretch, remained in range two wide between around
the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and churned on to hold fourth. PROXY saved ground off the pace, remained well back in the two path
rounding the far turn, swung out in upper stretch and made a mild rally. CYBERKNIFE raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, was urged along
four wide around the far turn and lacked a serious response. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING raced in range four wide, crept closer four wide under a drive
around the far turn but had little left for the drive. WHITE ABARRIO had early speed two wide between foes around the first turn, chased inside down the
backstretch and around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. GET HER NUMBER was in a bit tight early, raced off the pace four and five wide and
never threatened. SIMPLIFICATION saved ground in range, dropped back a bit inside around the far turn, swung six wide nearing the quarter pole and
retreated. O'CONNOR (CHI) played no factor while racing four wide. RIDIN WITH BIDEN checked nearing the first turn, trailed in the two path and was
eased in the lane.
