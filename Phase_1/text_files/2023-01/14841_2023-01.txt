Footnotes
GO ON MO hopped at the start then bumped twice with an outer foe just after, recovered well and raced prominently from the four path into the turn, bid
while in hand from the three path around the turn, was cued right handed entering the lane, took the lead going into the final furlong, and drew clear while
drifting out late. COOLER KING broke inwards at the start, set the pace in the two path, was roused when headed while along the inside turning into the
lane, yielded to the winner passing the eighth pole, and held on to place. CUMBERLAND bumped with the eventual winner twice leaving the gate, tracked in
the three path, was ridden around the turn and swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for show. GOODLOOKINRAGS prompted the pace
in the three path, was urged from the five path into the stretch, but was one paced. MAKE SUGGESTIONS stalked in the two path, checked along the inside
going into the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, but was no factor. BEN'S HERO chased from the two path early but was no menace. CALL BOB trailed
throughout around the three path.

MACHTENHAIRONFIRE set the pace in the two path, kicked away around the turn and opened up from the five path entering the stretch, and was much
the best while drifting out late. RANSOMS REWARD chased in the two path, moved up along the rail around the turn, was ridden from the three path in the
stretch, and finished evenly for place. SHES A GIFT stalked in the four path, was urged left handed from the eight path turning into the stretch, and was one
paced for show. SOPHIA'S STORM prompted the pace in the three path, was driven from the six path into the lane, but faded. SHE'S OUTTA HERE was
behind in the four path early and never factored. DISCO QUEEN raced from wellback in the five path and never threatened. PROVOCATIVA rated in the
three path but was empty along the inside entering the lane.

BOURBON THERAPY tracked the pace from the two path, tipped three wide in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up in deep stretch. TI SENTO
(IRE) set a clear pace in the two path and led until the final strides. CLASSY BOY saved ground off the early pace, swung five wide near the quarter pole
and rallied for the show. GOLDEN TALENT chased the pace three wide between foes and was one-paced through the lane. GERARD failed to menace
while racing four and five wide. KEKERE was up close four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
HIGH YIELD KITTEN raced prominently in the three path, bid from the four path while in hand around the turn, was roused into the stretch and took the lead
into the final furlong, and drew clear under right handed urging. HEY PORTER tracked along the inside, was coaxed around the turn and angled out to the
six path going into the stretch, and rallied in the final furlong to get up for place. ROGER MCQUEEN brushed with an outer foe leaving the gate, set the
pace from inside into the turn, yielded to the winner inside the final furlong, and was caught by a late charging outer foe in final strides to show. CAMINERO
stalked in the two path, was cued while tipping out to take aim from the five path turning into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. LORD JAXSTON
had his head turned at the start then brushed with an inner foe just after, was held up in the three path early but was no menace from the six path in the
stretch. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE chased from the four path into the turn but was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
ALTERNATE ROCK stalked the pace three wide, took over between foes in midstretch, was soon headed by CLAY SOLDIER, battled on inside of that foe
while getting herded down to the rail and battled back to prevailed. CLAY SOLDIER raced off the early pace outside, made some progress five wide around
the turn, took the lead outside of the winner in midstretch, angled in steadily through the final furlong and was narrowly outfinished. OH DARLIN stalked the
pace two wide, checked near the quarter pole, waited for room in upper stretch, tried to split rivals in midstretch but was bumped by MY LADY JAMES then
kept on for the show once clear. REVEILLE SONG chased the pace four wide and was no threat in the lane. MY LADY JAMES bobbled at the break, dueled
two wide, came in and bumped OH DARLIN in midstretch, tired, veered out late and bumped WILMA MANKILLER in deep stretch. HOAX dueled along the
rail and tired in the final furlong. WILMA MANKILLER was off a step slow, trailed inside, angled three wide leaving the three-eighths pole, lacked the needed
rally and was bumped late.

Footnotes
PROVOKE ME set the pace inside, was headed around the far turn and under right handed urging from the two path in the stretch, and dug in gamely to
just hold on. R ROSE' ALL DAY bumped with an inner foe out of the gate, raced prominently in the three path, bid between rivals around the far turn,
sustained that bid and ran on from the three path in the stretch, but lost the photo to finish with place. TAKE IT SOUTH raced up close in the four path, bid
three wide around the far turn and was in the four path entering the lane, but hung for show. MONETIZE IT (GB) stalked along the inside, was short of room
around the far turn, angled out to the six path going into the final furlong, and stayed on late but just missed minor rewards. NAA DUDETTE was unhurried
in the four path early, was roused around the far turn and swung out to the eight path turning into the stretch, was bumped by an inner foe nearing the final
sixteenth, and kept on. CONNECTING FLIGHT raced in midpack in the five path, was under right handed urging around the far turn and in the seven path
entering the lane, drifted out and bumped an outer foe approaching the final sixteenth, and evened out late. EVIE DOES IT bumped with an outer foe
leaving the gate, raced off the pace in the four path, shifted in to the two path turning into the stretch, but was no factor. STORM tracked in the three path,
was driven from the six path into the stretch, bumped with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and flattened. APPLE LOVER broke out and bumped an
outer foe leaving the gate, then steadied along the inside into the first turn, rated in the three path down the backstretch, tipped out and was ridden from the
five path into the stretch, bumped with an outer foe passing the eight pole, and never threatened. PLANET FROLIC brushed with an inner foe out of the
gate, trailed from the four path early and was no menace. APPLE SAUCY got bumped between rivals at the start, raced from wellback in the two path early
and was no threat while going wide in the stretch. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
