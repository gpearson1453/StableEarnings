Footnotes
LUCKY DUDE broke sharp, behind the leader along the inside, continued to save ground while patiently handled through the turn, briefly waited for room
entering the stretch, got through to mount a rail bid approaching the furlong grounds, gained the advantage and prove best under steady handling. GUIDED
ARROW moved up to clear after breaking just behind the winner, continued to show the way toward the inside through the bend, allowed the winner the
inside upper stretch, headed by that one soon after, outkicked. FAST LANE closest to the runner up on the outside up the backstretch and into the turn,
continued to prompt the issue into the stretch, lacked a winning response to finish up best of the rest. ASSET BASIS off a step slow, raced back and three
wide into the turn, improved position into the stretch, flattened out the final furlong to finish up evenly. BOURBON ON FIRE in mid pack while off the inside,
also went one paced through the stretch. KENTUCKY BOURBON off a step slow, moved up to the main group inside, saved ground to no avail. STILL ON
THE BOOKS void of speed, came four wide out of the turn, failed to rally. EL GEMAR tired while racing three wide.

Footnotes
DUCHESS BUBBLES settled off the pace and the inside, moved a bit closer in traffic late in the final turn, steered out and came four wide for the drive,
rallied with good energy to be up in time. CLOSE TO ME took back and was slow to settle early, began to move far turn, came five wide for the drive, rallied
outside the winner and finished willingly to be in time for the place, rode past the wire. IPSUM GRATUS pulled early while three wide through the first turn,
moved out further backstretch, advanced four wide second turn, mild bid inside the furlong marker, not enough late punch to hang with the top two in the
final stages. FIRST EMPRESS broke on top, narrowly showed the way early, continued to duel the middle half, disposed of the other speed turning for
home, faltered late to be overtaken in the waning strides. UNDECODED in the second flight outside, continued four wide through the second turn, closest to
the leader in upper stretch, also flattened out in the late going. ELEGANCE N TONIC in the second flight while racing three wide through the first turn, two
path through the final bend, had little for the stretch run. MUMBLEBEE settled in mid pack while three wide first turn, two path second bend, weakened in
the drive. SILENT SCARLET dueled up front in the two path for three quarters and gave way. VISUAL MAGIC off a step slow, moved up to the main body
along the inside, was finished after half.

Footnotes
PAPA ROCKET broke toward back, moved closer into turn, traffic through the bend just off the inside, angled sharply for room turning for home, outside bid
past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire, determined finish to prove narrowly best. TOUCH CODE away in good order, narrowly showed the way up the
backstretch, responded when headed between calls out of the turn, regained the advantage as the winner was moving to challenge approaching the furlong
marker, dueled with that one to the wire and proved stubborn to the end. SISAWAY NOW pressed the runner up from the outside in the run up the
backstretch, vied through the turn, briefly stuck a head in front entering the stretch but could not last, saved the show. RUM 'N TONIC forwardly placed while
three wide early, challenged outside of the first flight turn, also failed to sustain that bid through the stretch. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY off a step slow, moved up
in traffic into and through much of the turn, continued along the inside, came up empty when clear for the drive. HANKS within striking distance well off the
strip, four wide through much of the turn, floated out five wide turning into the stretch, failed to produce a closing response. CARBONITE broke back, four
wide trip throughout, remained back. TREATY broke back, five wide through the turn, trailed in showing little.

Footnotes
VERIFYING pressed the leader from the two path, continued to apply pressure into the far turn, challenged soon after, dueled into the lane when holding a
slight advantage, drew steadily clear to the wire under firm handling. GUN PILOT took control soon after the start along the inside, set a pressured pace the
middle half mile, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one the final furlong, remained clear for the place. TWO
EAGLES RIVER raced in some traffic behind the pace when a bit slow to settle in the first turn, continued to chase that pair in vain, closed the gap on the
runner up late with some mild interest while saving the show. RECKER POINT four wide in the first turn, settled while continuing outside, slow gain for the
show late while going evenly at the end. GUNFLASH shuffled back soon after the start, remained always back. JUDO broke in, tired after a three wide trip.

Footnotes
TALES OF HOME within striking distance outside, ranged up three wide to challenge late in the turn, gained the advantage, cleared, slight drift inside the
furlong marker, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. TYRONA forwardly placed along the inside early, in some traffic late in the turn, steered out
three wide turning for home, closed with interest to be getting to the winner late outside that one. STELLAR LILY broke alertly, chased the winner up the
backstretch off the inside, lodged a bid late in the turn, put a head in front from between horses and inside the winner turning for home, could not match
strides with that one late, also failed to contain the runner up. VOW settled off the early pace and the inside, came four wide for the drive, finished up evenly
in lacking a closing response. SHEZAPISTOL away in good order, moved up to clear before a quarter, continued to set the pace early turn, began to
weaken when headed turning for home, continued to give way to the wire. CHARTREUSE lacked early foot while three wide, failed to muster a rally.
CANDY CARAMEL in mid pack early outside, four out to five wide into the stretch, lacked a closing response. CHURCH SERVICE off a step slow, saved
ground to no avail. FABULOUS FANNY fell back after the start, continued to trail, bore out badly late in the turn, trailed home.

IMPRESSED forwardly placed for a half inside, behind horses into the lane, moved out a bit and split rivals when nearing midstretch, brushed with the
runner up while inside that one and then outfinished that rival in determined fashion to prevail. SLAM DUNK SERMON outrun in the early going, advanced
four down to three wide to a challenging position by late in the turn, brushed with the winner a furlong out, outfinished in the late going while holding sway for
the second spot. ASH FLAT broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, garnered a larger lead turning for home, gave ground grudgingly to the top
two late. LAKE RADIO off a step slow, trailed early as a result, swung out five wide turning for home, improved position to finish up willingly. SHADOW
MATTER in mid pack and three wide, continued off the inside into the lane, went one paced to the wire in lacking a closing kick. GOZILLA broke back and
made little impact while racing off the inside. LOOKIN FOR LOKI five down to four wide in the turn, also lacked a rally. FULL IMPACT dueled up front in the
two path, gave way while being bumped light by the winner nearing midstretch. THAT KHENNY finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
BETTY JO bumped just after the start with MISS ARKANSAS, recovered to settle behind the pace three wide, set down drive, late surge to be up in time.
STREET PAINTER pressed the early leader off the inside, advanced and took over midway on the turn, well clear past the furlong marker, maintained a
daylight advantage until run down the in the final strides by the winner. SASSY LASS within striking distance up the backstretch off the inside, came three
wide for the drive, lacked a winning kick. SOPHIE'S STAR off the early pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, also finished up one paced
to be found lacking in crunch time. RELENTLESS ROCKET off a step slow, raced back, encountered some traffic midway on the turn, was forced to check
up repeatedly, improved position up the rail with some belated interest. ELMO'S SECRET void of speed, saved some ground through the turn, improved
through some traffic down the lane. MISS ARKANSAS bumped with the winner just after the start, three to four wide when midpack through the turn, had
little left for the stretch run. QUARANTINED broke back, was used to move up steadily the opening furlong to take control, showed the way into the turn then
began to give way when headed by the runner up midway on the bend. GRANDMA BELLE five wide into the turn when well back, failed to rally.
FINISHWHATUSTARTED bumped repeatedly with BRADLEY PINK in the run up the backstretch, gave way after a half. BRADLEY PINK bumped
repeatedly up the opening quarter, fell back before a half and finished well beaten. MISS PONY UP four wide entering the turn, remained far back and was
well beaten.

Footnotes
HAZY COMMAND lacked early foot, three wide through the turn, steered out when straightened for home and finished full of run while widest to win going
away. DEALING JUSTICE in mid pack while off the inside, roused when straightened for home, rallied from between fillies and inside the winner, proved no
match for that one late while willingly garnering the place. PORTILLA came in just after the start, settled behind first flight inside, eased off the rail for the
drive, also displayed some late interest while between horses to gain the show while inside of the top two at the wire. TIZPLENTY with the pace between
horses, continued to vie turn, continued to be involved past the furlong marker, faltered late. HEADLAND set or forced the pace outside, contested the issue
three wide turn, also gave way in the final eighth. LISETTE broke out to be away slowly, lacked speed in the two path, dropped to the inside for the drive,
made little in the way of an impact down the lane. LOVEMESOMEME floated in just after the start, was righted to narrowly show the way backstretch and
into the turn, headed exiting the bend and gave way. ROCK STAR PARKING off slow, four wide exiting the turn, pulled up late, walked off.

Footnotes
GINOBILI moved up to race closest to the leader into the first turn under his own courage, pressed that one up the backstretch, moved at will to take over
midway on the final bend, drew off steadily through the lane without feeling the whip to win ridden out. RUNNIN' RAY in the second flight inside, fell back to
lose some position second turn while continuing inside, between foes into the lane, advanced to be closest to the winner a furlong out while well distant, no
match, determined to hold the place. RATED R SUPERSTAR fell quickly back to trail after, lagged up the backstretch, began to move far turn, fanned six
wide into the lane, late interest midtrack while too late for the runner up spot. HEART RHYTHM settled off the pace and the inside, in hand while between
horses the middle half, roused for the drive, lacked the needed closing kick. SILVER PROSPECTOR four wide onto the backstretch when well back, five
wide into the lane when making a mild gain, went evenly to the wire to also be found lacking in the final furlong in order to contend for the place. KING
FURY lacked speed off the inside, four wide and behind horses into the lane, failed to mount a late rally as well. SOY TAPATIO in mid pack inside, in traffic
turning into the lane when beginning to tire, continued to weaken in the run to the wire. SEIZE THE NIGHT four wide most of the way, failed to menace.
HELLO HOT ROD behind the leaders three wide, moved closer before a half, had nothing left for the stretch run. DREAMER'S DISEASE broke on top, set a
somewhat pressured pace, caved in when headed by the winner second turn.

Footnotes
SHOPPER'S REVENGE moved up to show the way into the first turn, set all the pace toward the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch while
extending that advantage the middle half, shrugged off a foe second turn, drew out through the lane, drifted out, righted with a right handed crop. PAPPY
WOLFE settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground second turn, finished willingly up the rail to earn the place, not a threat to the winner. ROCKET
AND ROLL chased the winner off the inside, two path second turn when moving closer lacked a further advance, outfinished for the place. TAHOE RUN off
a step slow, raced back, emerged from between rivals into the lane, staged a mild rally to improve slightly. TALLADEGA bobbled, in tight break, lacked
speed inside, angled out four wide turning into the stretch when making a mild advance, improved slightly. ESCAPOLOGIST fell back to trail after the start,
five wide into the stretch, improved by passing mostly tiring rivals and was never a threat. ITWASTHISBIG forwardly placed inside, weakened after five
furlongs. CITIZEN in the second flight early, began a steady retreat before four furlongs. BOUGIE JOE four wide through most of both turns, finished back.
VIOLENT RIVER was never involved.
