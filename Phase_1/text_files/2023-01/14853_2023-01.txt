Footnotes
ALYBAER raced off the pace five wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole, briefly
cleared and dug in to just last. NEOGEM was bumped at the start, was up close inside early, was bumped late on the first turn, dropped back inside, edged
closer inside around the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, kicked in nicely and just missed. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM set the pace three wide
around the first turn, cleared and angled in on the backstretch, vied inside around the far turn and through midstretch, yielded near the sixteenth pole and
held well enough to preserve the show. WHAT'S GOOD was up close between foes, was bumped twice and forced to steady around the first turn, remained
in range two wide around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane. MERRY GOLD was bumped at the start, vied between foes around the first turn,
stalked inside down the backstretch and around the far turn and lacked the needed stretch rally. BREAKING BULLET prompted the pace four wide around
the first turn, dueled two wide around the far turn, battled to midstretch and weakened through the final furlong. REASONABLY LOVELY raced two wide in
midpack, steadied early on the backstretch, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. DIXIE GROOVE was bumped at the start, saved
ground off the pace, steadied in upper stretch and was no factor. AMOR SALVAJE failed to menace while racing three and four wide. ANCIENT RELIC
steadied at the start, trailed inside early, went four wide around the far turn and made little impact. LADY BOURBON played no factor while racing three and
four wide. KASUF was up close four wide, was bumped late on the first turn and retreated three wide around the far turn.

Footnotes
LATE CALL brushed with an inner foe into the first turn, tracked in the four path down the backstretch, shifted in and moved in range from the two path
around the far turn, tipped out to the four path to bid at the top of the stretch, took command while drifting to the rail under left handed urging into the final
furlong, went clear and was wrapped up late. STRAIGHT TIME dueled in the two path around the first turn, led from the four path down the backstretch,
shifted to the two path under rousing turning into the stretch, yielded to the winner going into the final furlong, but held on to place. CANTILLATE dueled in
the three path around the first turn, was settled to prompt in the five path down the backstretch, was driven from said position into the stretch, and evened
out for show. TACTICAL FORCE brushed with an outer foe into the first turn and had to steady, rated in the two path, was roused around the far turn and
angled out to the seven path entering the lane, but was one paced. MR. CELLULAR stalked in the three path but never threatened. DANGER RANGER
trailed throughout around the four path.

Footnotes
READ ON set the pace inside, was roused from the rail around the far turn and opened up slightly entering the stretch, and dug in to just hold on.
SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR tracked in the two path, was coaxed from said position around the far turn and tipped out to the five path entering the stretch,
rallied in the final furlong for place, and just missed getting up to win in a photo. PEOPLE FORCE raced prominently in the three path, was roused going into
the far turn and in the four path going into the lane, and kept on between for show. ST IGNACIO settled in range along the inside, was ridden around the far
turn and shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on. CYCLONE RANGER raced in midpack from the four path, was under a drive in the six
path entering the lane, and gained belatedly. GUSTAVOR raced close up to the pacesetter in the two path but faded from the three path in the stretch. RIO
MOON rated in the three path, was under urging between rivals around the far turn, floated out to the eight path entering the lane, and finished evenly.
GENTLEMAN GERRY was reserved in the two path early, angled out to the seven path into the stretch, but was no factor. RULE IT stalked along the inside,
was roused from the rail around the far turn and in the two path entering the lane, but yielded. DREAMWITHINADREAM was unhurried in the four path,
fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but never threatened. BREAK THE ICE raced off the pace in the two path but was no menace in the four
path turning into the stretch. GLENHOLME trailed throughout. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
HANNITA'S EMPIRE stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths marker, took over leaving the quarter pole, drifted out under
right-handed urging in the lane and edged ahead. LITTLE BELITA pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, was collared by the
winner turning for home and stayed on for the place. NO DECAF was very rank and ducked out at the start, raced four wide around the turn, continued on
the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. MUGURUZA set the pace along the rail, was collared near the three-eighths pole and weakened in the
lane. BEAUTIFUL STAR failed to menace while racing two wide. QUEEN CUPID was outrun inside. ARETE'S CHALICE played no factor while racing three
and four wide.

Footnotes
EASY AS A. B. C. stalked in the two path, tipped out and was roused around the far turn, was in the seven path going into the lane, rallied to take command
into the final furlong and drew clear. AFY KID had an awkward slow start, chased in the five path, bid from said position around the far turn, took a narrow
lead entering the stretch, surrendered that lead to the winner approaching the eighth pole, but ran on to hold place. UNIFIED WEEKEND rated in the three
path, was driven in the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on down the center for show. LEGEND prompted the pace in the three path, took over the
lead in the two path around the far turn, but faded entering the stretch. PLUMA ROJA was held up along the rail but empty in the two path entering the lane.
MATEO raced prominently in the four path, was ridden between rivals around the far turn, but gaveway entering the stretch. COMMANDER FLYNN set the
pace in the two path but yielded around the far turn.

rail into the turn, tipped out around the turn and bid from the six path into the lane, was repelled by the winner into the final furlong, but ran on to secure
place. PERFECT GRACE chased in the two path, floated out to the eight path under urging in upper stretch, and got up for show in the final furlong.
AMERICAN OF COURSE set the pace in the two path, was headed passing the three eighths pole, and yielded entering the stretch. PEACHY WEACHY

Footnotes
COURAGEOUS COPPER set the pace in the two path, repelled a challenge by an outer rival rounding the turn, and was cued to open up from said position
into the lane, and drew clear under right handed urging. RED GUN had an awkward start and brushed with an outer foe, raced off the pace in the three path,
tipped out around the turn and was roused while swinging out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on to get up for place. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY
rated inside and stayed on from the rail in the stretch to get up for show. LUSCIOUS DANCER brushed with an inner foe out of the gate, tracked in the five
path, was under left handed urging from the six path entering the lane, and finished evenly. FROSTEDBIRD was prompted along into the four path, bid from
said position under coaxing turning into the stretch, was repelled in upper stretch, and faded in the final furlong. BLUE LIEUTENANT was hustled along from
the four path into the turn, was in the three path entering the stretch, shifted out late but was no factor. GO GO GREEN was brushed between a pair of foes
leaving the gate and then trailed throughout.
