Footnotes
BENDELENE stalked the leader from the four path, was inching up on the turn to gain command in the upper stretch and held on grudgingly to prevail in the
end. LINGERING PROMISE lead the way from the inside by a head into the turn, then continued to bid in the stretch but was outbid by an outside rival and
was second best. STORMIEIS BLUE raced closed behind the field while five wide then rallied in the upper stretch to close willingly for the show prize.
TAYLOR'S SECRET raced in close while three wide to bid on the turn but came up evenly in the final furlongs. HOT TUB HOTTIE was in a strong bid while
pressing the pace from the two path, was hard used on the turn and was out run in the end.

was closing gamely but it was not enough. ROBO was in a steady drive to track the leader from the two path down the backstretch, then rallied for

the stretch but could not catch the leader. MOLA MIA was bumped at the start then chased the pace while three wide into the turn but came up evenly in the
stretch. RECLAIMED tracked the pace from the four path into the turn to bid mildly in the stretch but was no threat. EAGLE'S QUEEN settled along the
