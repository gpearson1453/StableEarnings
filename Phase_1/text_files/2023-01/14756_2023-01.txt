Footnotes
DAHLIA'S DANCER sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her advantage into the lane and was ridden out to be kept to
task. LOTSA LOU chased the winner from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, was no match for the winner in the drive but held on well to save the
place. PRINCESS JAYLEEN was off slow, rushed to contend, raced five-wide through the turn but failed to gain in the drive. GOLDEN RACHEL settled off
the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to threaten. MY JOLENE was off a step slow, showed no
early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. WEST COAST ANDY showed brief speed and weakened.

racing four-wide, checked in mid-stretch and finished with good energy when clear. BRON AND THE BROW chased the leaders while racing three-wide,

did not offer a bid. FULL OF LIFE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. MYBESTISYETTOCOME was off slow

Footnotes
COLLECTING STARS lacked early speed, angled out approaching the stretch, offered a bid with a sixteenth to run, drifted in slightly late and edged away.
MO CONNELLY broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, vied into deep stretch and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. TWITTERATI
was off slow, lagged early, moved three-wide through the turn, checked nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. BELLS AND
WHISTLES dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. SUMMEROFTHESAMURAI was away in good order to dispute the
pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. MISCHIEF MAMA was void of early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
THE RIDER OF TWITTERATI LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST COLLECTING STARS CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF HER MOUNT AT THE
SIXTEENTH POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SANTALUZ DREAMIN was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by THE PUBLIC HERO nearing the half, opened a
clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority. TELLER lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, could not gain on the winner
in the drive but finished with good energy. RIVER ROSE was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain in the drive.
THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE PUBLIC HALO pressed the pace while
racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the half and weakened. FINAL ROSE raced four-wide through the first run, raced just off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and weakened. I'M AN EIGHT settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, weakened and
was eased through the lane.
