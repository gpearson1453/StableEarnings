Footnotes
GRAND MACALLAN tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground around the turn and dueled down the lane to just
hold the win. CAJUN OCCASION raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path
coming around the bend and dueled to the wire, narrowly missing. CRUISING DEREK led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the
two path coming around the turn, was caught in upper stretch and chased the top two home from there. ALTAIR veered out leaving the gate, settled in the
middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly. ROLLERCOASTER MAN stalked
the pace setter on the outside early, came around the bend in the three path and weakened in the lane. PERSONAL FINANCE chased the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and tired further in the stretch. GOD GIVEN RIGHTS was
pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout, raced in the two path and was never a factor.

Footnotes
R SWIRVIN GIRVIN stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn
and drew off in the lane. FACCIA BELLA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the
three path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and chased the winner home. STORMIN' AMANDA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early,
saved ground around the bend and finished evenly. SONG OF AMERICA led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the turn and
weakened in the stretch. NOBLE ATTITUDE bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came
around the bend in the two and three path and was never a threat. K D STRONG bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, raced off the pace
early, saved ground at the back of the pack around the turn and was empty in the lane. HONEY HAULER hit the gate and veered out leaving the gate,
causing her rider to lose their stirrups and never recover them, and trailed far back throughout. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON
REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ALL HORSES HAD A FAIR START AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MISSION OF JOY pressed the pace between horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far bend and kicked
clear in the stretch. TALL GIRL saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the
three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and chased the winner home. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY raced in the four path around the first turn, settled
in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and improved position late. AZTEC
PRINCESS trailed the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position in the lane
while never truly threatening. A NITE IN CAIRO led the way while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around
the far bend and weakened in the final furlong. GRAND OAK (IRE) raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn and was empty in the stretch. WAITWAITDONTTELLME pressed the pace from the three path around the first turn, dueled
outside up the backstretch, began to drop back from the three path coming around the far bend and tired further from there.

Footnotes
POSEIDONS MYTH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming around the turn and dueled
between horses to the wire to just get the win. CAJUN RED raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two
path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled on the outside to just miss. CALZONE raced outside at the back of the pack through the opening
quarter, began a five wide bid coming around the bend and dueled on the rail to the wire to just miss. WARP SPEED BEAST bumped with horse to his
outside leaving the gate, recovered to track the leaders up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and weakened late. GENESIS ONE
raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and was outkicked from there.
HEAVY WEIGHT chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded in the stretch. TAKEOVER KASH was sent
to an early lead racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the turn and faded in the lane. IT'S ME AGAIN raced off the
pace on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. ANDY WALKS WITH ME stalked the leader on the outside
up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and tired in the lane. DEACON ELI bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced at the
back of the pack early, came around the bend in the two path and was empty from there. RUM NOT BOURBON hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
