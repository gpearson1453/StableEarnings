Footnotes
VODKATINI prompted the pace outside OH MRS. MAISEL, overtook that one entering the stretch and drew off the final furlong while kept under urging. OH
MRS. MAISEL set a pressured pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and finished gamely despite her rider dropping his whip in mid stretch.
FLIMSY stalked the pace, advanced three deep on the turn, challenged for the lead outside VODKATINI in upper stretch, battled with that one to the eighth
pole then weakened. RED WINE TIME lacked speed, raced three wide on the turn, floated to the four path in upper stretch and only snowed a mild gain
late. CLARA BELLE , no factor, navigated the turn in the two path. MARTHARITA briefly chased the pace and hugged the inner rail on the turn before
dropping back through the stretch.

Footnotes
ITS OVER broke a bit slow but quickly recovered and edged up while saving ground, was under pressure pursuing the leading trio past the five sixteenths,
took closer order along the rail into the lane, shifted out for room past the three sixteenths, closed between rivals while under repeated right handed asks
and got up in the final jumps. THE LAST SCIP , urged along pressing the pace two wide, battled between runners past the three eighths, took a short lead
inside the furlong grounds, switched over to his left lead when wandering outward a sixteenth from home and just missed. DESPITE ODDS advanced inside
foes in the opening furlong to take command, went clear and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure around the turn, grimly held the
advantage while drifting out from left handed asking in mid stretch, fought on inside foes past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. MOSLER SAFE
was used hard from the gate and attended the pace three deep, failed to kick on with the leaders past the eighth pole and faded. TRIPLE TITOS was hung
out four wide a long way, angled in through the final furlong but failed to menace. JEBSTER , two wide between rivals early, angled four wide making some
progress heading to the stretch, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and weakened. DEJOHN , three wide between rivals early, dropped back around
the turn then lacked a response.

DUNDER BOSS stalked the pace, was four deep around the turn, closed determinedly outside COCKTAIL DREAMING and was along in deep stretch.
COCKTAIL DREAMING saved ground the turn, found ample room along the inner rail to take the lead in upper stretch, opened a clear advantage and gave
way grudgingly. ONE LAS OLAS lacked speed to mid turn, swung to the five path turning for home and rallied outside horses. DROPKICK QUEEN , caught
in close quarters leaving the starting gate, was not a threat and swung to the four path in upper stretch. PHARIBE , in the three path prompting the pace
around the turn, faltered. RUXTON ROCKS raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. NOWYOUSCAN'TLEAVE set the apce raced in
the two path around the turn and faltered in upper stretch.

GRAND ESCAPE , patiently handled stalking off the inside, saw the leader get away a bit past the five sixteenths, responded when put to left handed asks
in upper stretch, closed steadily and reeled in BLAME THE BOURBON past the eighth pole, poke a head in front soon after, dueled and held firm under
steady handling. BLAME THE BOURBON sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, edged away some mid turn, remained clear under encouragement
heading to mid stretch, dug in after being headed and fought gamely to the wire. WYATT RIDGELY saved ground leaving the three eighths, angled three
wide under a ride entering the lane, straightened away and closed nicely to gain outside the top pair. EL TOLU came in at the break and bumped with
GREAT DAYS AHEAD, corrected and raced between rivals, was lightly steadied leaving the far turn, shifted in soon into the lane but lacked a solid stretch
kick. GREAT DAYS AHEAD , jostled and forced in at the break, raced well back into the turn, circled four to five wide into the stretch but lacked the needed
response. THE COLORA KID , three wide outside a rival, was under pressure mid turn and faltered through the lane.

Footnotes
BOURBON ON THE BAY broke alertly, stalked the pace behind horses, moved to the four path on the turn, swept to command in upper stretch, was under
a left hand whip one time in mid stretch then eagerly drew away under a hand ride. MOSES WATER raced in the two path between horses around the turn,
pressed the pace to mid stretch and weakened late. LOOTAH , swung to the five path entering the stretch, had a mild rally and was steadied when drifting in
near the sixteenth pole. SWIFT DANCER , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way the final furlong. SURF CITY GOLD hopped at the break
and was off last, saved ground around the turn and was no factor. DIVIDED UNION showed speed along the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch.
CHASING STORMS pulled up before going a quarter of a mile and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but
no action was taken.

Footnotes
GOLD TIME VIXEN , between rivals early while in range, took closer order four wide past the five sixteenths, bid four deep soon after, dueled to mid stretch,
wrested command soon after then steadily drew clear under a drive. NO MORE MASK prompted the pace two wide, moved to attack and gained a slim lead
between runners past the three eighths, ceded the lead nearing the quarter pole, stayed on to battle and regain a short advantage inside horses in mid
stretch, could not match strides with the winner through the final seventy yards but dug in gamely to save the place. MY BOSS LADY , well back early while
saving ground, advanced inside in upper stretch, eased out to advance between rivals in mid stretch, altered out late and closed the gap. LADY JEAN
tracked three wide, bid three deep leaving the far turn, gained a short lead with heading towards the lane, sparred between rivals to mid stretch then
weakened late. LITTLE MS SCARLET , urged inside chasing, shifted out in the drive but lacked a serious punch. KASHAN took over inside rivals heading to
the five eighths, was hounded leaving the far turn, ceded the lead soon after, stayed on to dispute the issue to upper stretch then faded through the final
furlong. MY SUPER SALLY lacked speed off the rail, made a six wide run into the lane then flattened out. MERAVIGLIOSO lost ground five wide pursuing
the leaders, remained well wide past the five sixteenths and gave way. STAY OUT , off slowly when acting up as the gates sprung, was hustled up off the
inside heading to the turn, lacked a response around the turn and gave way.

SEMPER FI hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the three path in upper stretch, closed steadily between horses and was up late.
ARISTOCRATIC set a pressured pace along the inner rail, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. TOP BOSS stalked the pace on the
turn, was taken to the four path entering the stretch and rallied outside foes. QUICK TEMPO prompted the pace outside ARISTOCRATIC and weakened in
the drive. BOWIE TWO STEP trailed and was eased late.

Footnotes
TAPPIN JOSIE disputed the pace outside DIVISIBILITY while under rating, took a short lead leaving the far turn, was nursed along then cleared into the
lane, drifted in towards the rail, spurted away under solid handling soon after, swerved outward with a sixteenth to go then held firm. MAJESTY'S
FREEDOM , away alertly, chased the pace while outside a rival, shifted four wide into the lane and closed willingly to be clear of the rest. NAVAL EMPIRE
drafted back early on, circled five wide into the stretch and finished with interest. TRIBAL QUEEN edged up outside rivals heading to the half mile marker,
tracked the embattled leaders three wide around the turn, gave willing chase past the eighth pole then faded through the final seventy yards. DIVISIBILITY
dueled inside the winner, ceded the lead near the three eighths, stayed on to contest the issue to upper stretch, remained a willing presence to mid stretch
then gave way. BLOWTHRUYELOWLITES , off last after bobbling and bumping with a rival, regrouped to advance towards the inside and gained a forward
spot into the turn, eased out under pressure past the three sixteenths, lacked a stretch kick and faded. COAL MINE , bumped at the break, was hustled
along soon after, raced two wide into the lane and failed to generate a rally.

Footnotes
STRONGER THAN DEX sped to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail on the backstretch, remained along the rail and prevailed under pressure.
TENAX raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and had a slight rally between rivals. SUPERSTITIEUX , three deep
chasing the pace around the turn, drifted to the five path at the head of the stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and weakened. THRUSTER , four wide on the
turn, lacked a rally. NEVER SILENCED chased the pace, hugged the inner rail around the turn and gave way. PRESSING CONCERN , steadied when
breaking poorly, swung to the six path leaving the turn. TOTAL EFFORT chased the pace outside the winner and faltered in upper stretch.
