the turn, came four wide into the drive, finished willingly through the lane to gain the place but could not reach the winner. ROSES R BLUE was hard to load
behind the gate, broke slow in the beginning, steadied between rivals at the back, moved to the inside, two wide leaving the turn, tipped out into the stretch
and gained the show. BONITA LEONA raced in mid-pack between rivals into the bend, angled to the rail around the turn, came off the inside in the stretch
and got outfinished for the show honors. MAJESTIC GIGI vied for the lead three deep then cleared inside and pair and crossed over into the turn,
re-engaged by by UNWRITTEN CODE at the quarter pole, gave up command at the top of the stretch and weakened. OPTIMAS bumped leaving the gate,
coaxed along while dropping back early, trailed two wide leaving the turn and failed to menace. LIBERALISM traveled in mid-pack inside a pair of rivals
leaving the backstretch, saved ground then tipped out nearing the lane and could not rally. CARELESS STAR bumped at the start, showed early speed
between rivals, brushed inner rival and got shuffled at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and flattened out. SHVERE ARBETER
was off slow to begin, moved off the rail early, went two wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
COFFEE IN BED got floated in by SWEET TROUBLE at the start, allowed to settle on the inside early, moved closer on the turn, tipped outside the leader
at the top of the stretch, reached the front with a furlong remaining and drew away in the final sixteenth. SWEET TROUBLE broke in, reserved at the back
off the inside, steered out on the turn and came five wide into the stretch, rallied from outside but could not match the winner in deep stretch. TEENA ELLA
stalked the pace from outside up the backstretch, chased four deep on the turn, launched a bid at the quarter pole, fought three deep in upper stretch, was
no match for the top pair in the final furlong and churned on to save the show. TENNESSEE MOON sped clear and steered to the inside, challenged by
TEENA ELLA at the quarter pole, responded to urging and maintained command to upper stretch, relinquished the lead near the eighth pole and flattened to
fourth. WUDI coaxed to a forward position just behind and to the outside of the pacesetter, chased between through the turn in the two path, then weakened
down the lane. DOINITTHEHARDWAY chased three deep into and around the turn, tired in the drive, eased in the late stages and walked off. FIRST
QUARTER FRACTION HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ZIMBA WARRIOR stalked the top pair along the three path early, bid three deep on the backstretch, fought with inside pair through the far turn, put a head
in front at the eighth pole and drove clear. BIG BUZZ settled in three path, moved into the two path on the far turn then steered out and took aim four wide
leaving that bend, bid outside the leading pair in upper stretch but could not find the needed late kick to overtake ZIMBA WARRIOR in deep stretch. HIGH
HEATER pressed the pace from outside, raced on even terms after four furlong, took over at the three-eighths pole and vied between rivals around the far
turn, lost command at the eight pole, could not match the top pair late but finished a clear third. PEPPERMAN tracked in the two path around the clubhouse
turn, saved ground on the second bend and showed a mild rally to improve position. BOX OF CHOCOLATES tossed his head leaving the gate then went up
to take the lead along the rail, set the pace under pressure from HIGH HEATER early, dueled with that rival past the half-mile pole, lost command at the
three-eighths pole, fought back around the far turn, chased the leaders into the stretch, drifted out in the lane and weakened. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE
tracked in the four path early, raced four deep up the backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn, steered back out in the lane and lacked further
response. OUTRIGHT coaxed along in the beginning, chased four wide into the first turn, moved out wider into the backstretch, went five then four wide on
the second bend and faded.

CLOUSEAU chased outside a rival then got crowded between foes past the nine-sixteenths pole, went two wide through the turn, tipped out and rallied
three deep between rivals in the lane and drove past late. RHYTHEM ON STAGE raced off the pace early, traveled three wide then outside a pair of rivals
at the quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch, tipped out and rallied widest in the lane but got outkicked by the winner. YO TIME chased three wide
into the turn, bid three deep at the quarter pole, fought through the lane and stuck a nose in front briefly late, then got overtaken by the top pair in the closing
moments. MONTANA settled four deep early, launched a bid four deep at the quarter pole, battled through the lane but could not summon the needed final
kick. SEATTLE SURF broke a step slow then moved to a forward position outside the leader, bid between with a quarter mile remaining, took over shortly
after, met the challenge from several runners to the outside but succumbed to the pressure late. GHOSTLY ACT was off slow to start, trailed two wide
through the turn, moved out int he lane and failed to make an impact. LOGON TO WIN stalked from inside, pushed on around the turn, tipped out in upper
stretch and failed to rally. THIRSTY sped clear and crossed to the inside, challenged by rivals at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and
gave way in the stretch run.

ARDIS dueled briefly then cleared inner rival, showed the way along the inside then two wide into the stretch, urged right handed in upper stretch and was
ridden out under hand urging in the late stages. RIGHTEOUSLY stalked off the rail then outside a rival, went two then three wide around the bend, moved
inward in the stretch and held the place. TIZZY TWISTER chased between then two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the stretch and
was along for the show. FLATTERWITHJEWELS chased along the rail into the turn, tipped out and entered the lane three wide but lacked a late bid.
SANGRE AZUL tracked out of range two wide leaving the backstretch, found the rail on the turn, moved back out in the lane and lacked a rally. FULL OF
GRACE sat off the pace early on, rounded the bend three then four wide and could not offer a response when called upon. OREO'S DREAM chased
outside rivals into the turn, moved out to the four path then steered back in while losing ground and entered the stretch two wide and weakened. SECRET
MANEUVER dropped back early while under urging, trailed two wide into the turn, a bit off the inside into the stretch and was never a factor. RAIN DIVA
fractious in the gate, dueled briefly inside the winner early then chased up the backstretch, saved ground while starting to weaken on the turn and tired in
the lane.

stretch, angled widest in the lane, rallied and drove by BATUKHAN (IRE) in the final strides. BATUKHAN (IRE) raced in mid-pack from the two path early,
traveled three deep up the backstretch, spun four wide into the lane, took over at the eight pole and cleared midstretch under hand urging and got run down
by the winner late. HASKELLED rated on the inside early, roused on the second bend while moving to the two path, launched a bid with a furlong left to run
but lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch. FROST ALERT vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, took an awkward step at the three-quarter pole
then inched ahead, cleared with three furlong left to run, led two wide into the stretch, lost command with a furlong remaining and flattened to fourth. BIG
FRANK DA TANK chased two then three wide early off the pace, moved into range in the middle stages, launched a bid four then three wide on the far turn
but weakened in the final furlong. WHISKEY VISION settled on the inside then two wide, took closer up the backstretch then had to check at the
seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground through the far turn and cut the corner into the lane and weakened. COLLEGE BOY vied three deep for command
around the first turn, moved back to stalk the top pair up the backstretch, went three then two wide around the far turn and faded. VALIENTE vied between
rivals around the clubhouse turn, pressed FROST ALERT up the backstretch, lost contact with three furlongs left to run, dropped back between around the
far turn and tired.

Footnotes
BOWL OF CHERRIES sat off the pace early on, went three wide and between rivals into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied widest and collared
MISS FIA with a sixteenth to go and dug in late to edge the runner-up. MISS FIA broke out a bit but was still away quickly, stalked the pace outside a rival
into the turn, loomed three wide into the stretch, challenged from outside and gained command outside the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by BOWL OF
CHERRIES in the final sixteenth. LITTLE RACHEL brushed leaving the gate, trailed early on, went three then two wide on the turn, angled to the fence in
the lane and closed for the show honors. LA V. sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, set the pace on the inside into the stretch, lost command
midstretch and flattened to fourth. DEL MAR DRAMA stalked the lone leader two wide into and around the turn and could not summon the needed response
in the stretch. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN chased two then three wide around the turn, steered out in the lane and could not rally. KRISTI'S TIGER sat off the
pace on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a bid. TALKATIVE GAL bumped outer rival leaving the gate, stalked wide up the backstretch,
moved into the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
NULLARBOR set the pace outside STORM THE NIGHT, disposed of that rival around the turn, led a bit off the rail into the stretch and drew off under strong
handling and tap of right handed encouragement while drifting out. BIG HAT WILLIE was reluctant to load into the gate, stalked the top pair up the
backstretch, got blocked or boxed in near the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane then angled out and rallied for second. MOTORCADE was off slow
to begin, traveled in mid-pack along the rail into the turn, moved out and raced two to three wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane and was along for
the show. HENRY Q came out early and brushed with a rival, chased the leaders three wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch and flattened out.
SNAPP DADDY was off slow to start, steered to the inside, rounded the bend in the two path and produced a mild rally to improve placings. STORM THE
NIGHT broke a step slow then went up to press the pace from inside, lost contact with the winner midway around the bend and weakened in the lane. ICE
STORM sat off the pace early on, went three wide into the turn, angled five wide into the stretch and could not rally. READY RUMOR broke a step slow then
had his path taken shortly after and dropped back, went four then three wide around the turn and failed to menace. PACIFIC STATES drifted in and brushed
rival early, tracked outside rivals up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path then steered back out into the lane and came up
empty. CIRCLE THE MOON broke a step slow, raced near the back then trailed into the turn, navigated the turn three to four wide and came up empty.
