Footnotes
SIGNORINA MERISI (GB) broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, well rated through moderate fractions to the second turn, extended the lead in
mid-stretch and drew away in the final sixteenth. KOKO'S MOM forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the pace from a ground saving position to the
quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and stayed on to secure the place. JUBILEE LAKE (GB) crowded
at the start, showed early speed and stalked the moderate fractions, kept attendance to SIGNORINA MERISI to the second turn, lost ground to that rival
nearing mid-stretch, weakened in the late stages and was well clear for third in the end. JERUSALEMA (IRE) rated off of the pace, never far back to the
half-mile marker, two wide approaching the quarter pole, swung four wide for the drive and did not produce a late rally. TAKEMEBYTHEHAND (GB)
stumbled at the start then crowded JUBILEE LAKE leaving the break, settled off of the early pace, raced three wide on the far turn and did not factor in the
final stages. BIG ATTRACTION a bit slow into early stride, lagged through the backstretch run, raced four wide into the drive and did not threaten.

Footnotes
POLACCO broke alertly and sent to the early lead, well handled while setting decent fractions, in hand to the top of the lane, drew clear nearing mid-stretch,
given a pair of reminder taps in the final furlong and kept to task in the end. RUNAWAY KRISTIN allowed to settle while in the second flight, advanced two
wide on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not make headway on POLACCO in the late stages and held for place. GOVERNOR ARTHUR
allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, angled out in upper stretch, finished well in the final furlong and just missed for place,
while holding safely for show. LOVE OF THE SPORT bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, saved ground into the backstretch run, made a
steady advance approaching the second turn, came within aim nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid in the drive and flattened. UNUSUAL
CODE unhurried, saved ground to the second turn, improved position in upper stretch and offered a mild late rally. TWIRLING DERBY stalked the early
pace, came four wide into the second turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and weakened in the stretch run. KAI'S STATEMENT forwardly placed in
the early going, stalked the decent fractions to the half-mile marker, lost position while three then two wide nearing the top of the lane and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
WALKING BOSS unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the second turn, roused nearing the quarter marker, mounted a three wide rally leaving the
far turn, came within aim in mid-stretch, assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker, drifted in a bit in the final stages and held in a drive to prevail.
EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER caught three wide into the first turn, cleared the field and dictated terms while setting solid fractions to the half-mile marker, held
foes at bay to mid-stretch, tired inside of the furlong marker, unable to match strides in deep stretch with WALKING BOSS, steadied in tight quarters in the
final strides and held for place. BIG CITY BANE forwardly placed in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, tracked the solid fractions to the
second turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, outkicked in the late stages and missed for place in the final strides. AWE
settled off of the early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced on the inside nearing the quarter marker, lost ground approaching the furlong
pole, came in tight while along the rail in the final furlong and weakened in deep stretch. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) allowed to settle, raced two then three
wide along the first turn, unhurried to the second turn, steered four wide to the quarter marker, improved position in upper stretch but did not threaten in the
late stages. BROKEN FINGER tracked the early pace, maintained position to the half-mile marker, lost ground three wide on the second turn and gave way
in the drive.

MORE POWER TO HIM rated off of the early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, assumed
command approaching in upper stretch, raced on the left lead in deep stretch and kept to task in the late stages. AGENT ZERO allowed to settle, two wide
along the first turn, four wide on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well in the final furlong and was second best in the end. SUNNY SPOT
forwardly placed in the early going, three then two wide on the first turn, tracked the modest fractions to the half-mile marker, slipped to the inside entering
the second turn, waited for racing room approaching the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, was outkicked in the final stages and was clear
for show. ORCZY (IRE) unhurried in the early stages, two wide along the first turn, saved ground into the second turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch
run. DEALERS HAND a bit rank in the run into the first turn and steadied in tight quarters, stalked the moderate pace to the second turn, advanced to
confront DESERT DUDE nearing the quarter marker, chased MORE POWER TO HIM to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. DESERT DUDE
broke alertly and sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, confronted by DEALERS HAND nearing the quarter
marker, overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

SHANGHAI MIST shuffled a bit at the start and took back in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the second turn,
mounted a five wide rally leaving the far turn, closed fast nearing mid-stretch, assumed command approaching the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the
late stages. MOONSHINE CAT allowed to settle, saved ground into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the second turn, roused three wide
approaching the top of the lane, came within aim in mid-stretch, could not match strides with SHANGHAI MIST in deep stretch and held well in the end for
place. ARISTEIA sent to the early lead, set the pace while off of the rail into the backstretch run, set moderate fractions to the second turn, confronted by
DASHING DEMI nearing the quarter marker, repelled that foe and was set down for the drive, was overtaken by the top pair in the final furlong and just held
for show in the final strides. COCOA CENTS broke alertly then took back to track the early fractions, saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced two
wide along the second turn, swung four wide for the drive, was outkicked in the final furlong and just missed for third. DASHING DEMI caught in a bit of
traffic approaching the first turn, raced three wide into the backstretch run, advanced to prompt the moderate pace to the second turn, vied for the lead
nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired. SMILING MELANIE stalked the early pace, lost position nearing the half-mile
marker, saved ground to the top of the lane and weakened. KITTYBE QUICK caught five wide into the first turn, unhurried into the backstretch run, lost
contact on the second turn and was not persevered with in the drive.

HORSE DOCTOR settled off of the quick early pace, raced three wide on the turn, swung five wide for the drive, closed fast nearing the furlong pole,
matched strides with FOREIGN PROTOCOL to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. FOREIGN PROTOCOL tracked the rapid early
pace, saved ground through the turn, swung three wide for the drive, vied for the lead at mid-stretch, met the bid of HORSE DOCTOR in deep stretch and
was gamely bested in the final strides, while holding for place. AWESOME DUDE lost his path at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear to the
turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, closed well in the final furlong and secured show in the final strides. PAPAPIFAS close up to the early pace,
advanced along the turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, angled out in mid-stretch, finished well and just missed for show in the final
strides. WINDRIBBON tracked the fast early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, loomed nearing mid-stretch, made a
slight steady in deep stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. GREAT STORY forwardly placed in the early going, pressed the quick pace to the
quarter marker, battled for the lead nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace in the final stages and weakened. DARNQUICK broke alertly, showed
good early speed and set the pace to the turn, set fast fractions to the quarter marker while pressured, held the lead to mid-stretch and gave way in the final
furlong.

DOS VICIOS allowed to settle, three wide on the first turn, advanced on the backstretch run, gained two wide nearing the quarter marker, rallied three wide
for the drive, assumed command nearing the furlong pole and kicked clear in the late stages. MR. FIGHTER hustled to establish the early lead, set
moderate fractions while prompted to the second turn, overtaken by DOS VICIOS in upper stretch, chased that rival to deep stretch and held for place in the
final strides. START THEM UP tracked the early pace, three wide on the first turn, maintained position to the second turn, lost ground while three then four
wide nearing the top of the lane, re-rallied in the drive, outkicked in deep stretch and just missed for place, while securing show. EFFECTIVE GIG showed
speed and pressed the moderate early pace, kept close attendance to MR. FIGHTER to the quarter marker, chased DOS VICIOS leaving the second turn,
still in aim to mid-stretch, gave way in the final furlong and just edged for show. MIQUEAS allowed to settle, two wide trip to the far turn, improved position
nearing the furlong grounds and offered mild late rally. SLIGHTLY DIRTY bobbled at the start and was away slowly, unhurried to the second turn and did not
factor in the drive. LIBERTY WOLF settled in the second flight in the early stages, was not far back to the half-mile marker, lost ground nearing the quarter
pole and did not threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
PIPER'S CAUSEWAY broke alertly, showed good early speed and sent to establish the early advantage, set fast fractions while pressed to the quarter
marker, shook free in upper stretch, kept to task under steady urging in the drive and drew clear in the final stages. EARLY RELEASE forwardly placed early
on, tracked the quick pace from an inside position on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, made a mild late gain on PIPER'S CAUSEWAY in deep stretch
but could not reel in the winner and secured the place. SAXON SAGA showed speed and was prominent in the early going, advanced to press the quick
pace on the turn, lost ground to PIPER'S CAUSEWAY in upper stretch, could not match strides in the drive and was edged for place, while well clear in the
end for show. CONDORCAT chased the fast early pace, advanced four then five wide on the turn, was not able to impact the leaders in the final furlong and
passed tiring rivals late. BIG DIFFERENCE shuffled at the start and was away slowly, steadied in tight quarters entering the turn, raced two wide to the top
of the stretch, improved position in the drive and did not factor in the late stages. PROSPECT OF RAIN chased the early leaders, lost position while along
the rail on the turn, outrun in upper stretch and did not threaten. APLOMBADO stalked the quick early pace, raced two wide along the turn, could not match
strides leaving the turn and weakened in the drive. EL CAPRICHO tracked the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch
and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MADEIRA WINE assumed command in the early going, set modest fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, held foes at bay to the quarter
marker, extended the lead in mid-stretch and held safely while wrapped up in the final strides. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE unhurried in the early going,
roused leaving the three-furlong marker, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, closed with a rush in the drive, could not reel in the winner in deep
stretch and was up for place in the final strides. REV REE allowed to settle while not far back into the first turn, two wide into the backstretch run, advanced
three wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not make headway on MADEIRA WINE in the final furlong and was just edged for second in the
final strides. SHEZAGHOST prominent into the first turn, stalked the pace to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. SCHERZO
(GB) allowed to settle, saved ground into the first turn, raced two then three wide on the second turn, made a late bid in the drive but lacked the needed late
response. THAT'S AMARE forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the modest fractions from an inside position to the second turn, lost ground in upper
stretch and did not produce a late rally. TROJAN CLUBHOUSE broke open her stall door prior to the starter officially starting the race, lost the rider when
the assistant starter attempted to hold her back and was declared a non-starter per the stewards. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
START INVOLVING TROJAN CLUBHOUSE AND DECLARED THAT RUNNER A NON-STARTER.

to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and weakened. LADY OF THE LIGHT shuffled back at the start and away a
bit slowly, raced two wide on the turn, improved position in upper stretch, showed good late interest and galloped out well. ROSE OF MOONCOIN tracked
the quick early pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and gave way. VINTAGE chased the fast early pace, improved
position three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. SMILE AND PROFILE was a bit hard to load, broke out at the start
and was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker and was not a late threat. BLAZIN BAE lunged at the start and was
away slowly, trailed to the quarter marker and did not offer a response. FOREVER LOVELY chased the fast early pace, lost position on the turn and tired in
the drive.

Footnotes
LUXURY LINER came away in good order, got a good stalking position behind the pacesetter while always traveling comfortably, responded when asked to
challenge for the lead passing the quarter pole, got on even terms at the three-sixteenths, battled the length of the stretch and gained the upper hand late.
ANGEL'S ADVOCATE was first away and made the running from the first jump, held a clear lead while in hand through the turn, met a challenge by
LUXURY LINER at the head of the stretch, dueled that foe gamely to deep stretch but was outfinished in the final yards. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN broke well
but was outrun somewhat through the first quarter mile, responded when asked to pick up the pace from the five-sixteenths pole and continued to run on
well to the wire. SHEZARUNAWAY outrun early, chased the field through the turn, swung seven-wide into the stretch, was kept to task and was able to find
another gear in the final furlong and split the field. ROSE DAWSON had one horse beat in the early running, saved ground through the turn, swung out to
the four path for the stretch run and was finishing with some interest while having trouble finding room to run. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL got away well, raced
mid-pack down the backstretch, stayed three or four wide through the turn, started a sustained bid with three furlongs to go an finished evenly. AVERY
BLUE broke, well, established good inside position down the backstretch, was in striking distance with a quarter mile to run, remained prominent to deep
stretch but could not muster the needed rally. THE GREAT HAYNES up close through the early going, loomed a dangerous presence at the top of the
stretch but tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SUPERSONIC FLYER broke alertly, quickly seized the early lead without pressure, continued to lead through the turn while well in hand, repelled a
challenge by AUSTRIAN NAVY at the top of stretch and drew off to an easy victory. DANIELA BELLA unhurried early, gained some ground going into the
turn, waited for the rail to open up, dropped back some approaching the quarter pole then re-rallied through the stretch to win the head bob for the place.
AUSTRIAN NAVY got away well and tracked the leader to the turn, made a bid for the lead turning for home, was unable to match strides with the eventual
winner but ran on well enough hold a minor placing. CLOCHARD STREET outside of a trailing trio through the first quarter mile, started a sustained rally
from the seven-sixteenths pole, waited for some room approaching the top of the stretch, swung into the four path for clear running and kept to task while
never a serious threat. BIG CHICK last early on, had one beaten going into the turn, was put into a drive passing the three furlong marker and was able to
pass a few in the final furlong. ST. ANNIE'S INDY was up close after the break but was content to fall back to a mid-pack position for the run down the
backstretch, made a wide, sweeping move on the turn and loomed a threat at the head of the stretch but stalled and weakened in the last furlong. DESERT
SMOKE came away well and stalked the leading pair early on, took an inside position for the run through the turn, though in striking position at the top of the
stretch could not find another gear when needed. JUMPING JILL FLASH broke well but was outrun early, chased the field while wide around the turn, came
into the stretch seven wide and could not make up any ground. MOON ROCKET broke well and got good position early, was unable to keep up from the
five-sixteenths pole and steadily lost ground from that point.
