Footnotes
IRISH HONOR raced off the pace inside, moved up entering the far turn, made a rail bid, dueled with PLAMEN entering the stretch, dug in gamely inside of
that rival, took over and pulled away. PLAMEN raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, bid four wide on the far turn, briefly took over, then
dueled with IRISH HONOR, was no match and held well for second. NICK PAPAGIORGIO was reluctant loading, settled off the rail, off the pace, chased on
the far turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly. SOUTHERN BRIDGE raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane, closed mildly and
got fourth. YES SIR COLONEL was off a bit slow, raced off the rail, off the pace, went five wide at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. EDDIE'S
CHARGE trailed the field and did not factor. HIDDEN PROMISE raced three wide early, stalked the pace, chased inside on the turn and faded. CLEAR CUT
set the pace, dueled on the far turn and gave way. SPITTIN IMAGE pressed the pace early on, then chased and gave way.

ONE PAIR OF HANDS set pace off the inside, repelled a rival near midstretch then edged away again in the final furlong. BET ON DRAMA pressed the
winner along the inside throughout but could not get by the winner. TWYLA far behind early, advanced inside and finished willingly. CUP OF LIFE saved
ground off the pace and lacked a rally. ONLY GIRL dropped back near the inside and was never a factor. ESCANDALO chased very wide and proved
empty in the stretch. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL lagged far behind racing wide and was always outrun. ORB'S PARTY GIRL flashed speed and stopped
abruptly. SAY NO MORE stumbled badly soon after the start and lost her rider.

Footnotes
EXCLUSIVE ORDER settled off the pace on the inside, commenced his bid while three wide on the far turn, rallied steadily outside in upper stretch, dueled
past the furlong marker, took over and drew clear under urging. DOUBLE DEALER stalked the pace racing close up outside, bid two wide on the far turn,
dueled between rivals in midstretch, dug in gamely but second best. STAFF SERGEANT set the pace racing with a clear lead, shook the way into the far
turn, dueled inside rivals in upper stretch and weakened. DUBROVNIK raced off the pace two wide, then inside, moved up three wide on the far turn and
failed to rally. LIGHT WORK raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. FACTUM LOVE STYLE raced off the pace
between rivals and failed to threaten. SOCIAL JOE was fractious in the gate, then did not factor. D'LUCCI BOY chased close up inside and gave way.
SETTE STELLE raced three wide off the pace, failed to respond when asked and gave way. BIG REDWHITEBLUE hit the gate at the start causing the rider
to lose his irons, recovered nearing the first turn and was outrun. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.
