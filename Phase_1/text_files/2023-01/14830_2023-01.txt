Footnotes
ROSELEE settled in the three and four paths the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and circled rivals in the five path of the far turn,
steadily closed through the stretch and got up the final yards. MAYSVILLE MISS tapered in and took over nearing the three quarter pole and rated the pace,
came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the
final yards. IRISH SAMURAI was unprepared for the break, raced in the five path of the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced
through the far turn about the three path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER saved ground well back from early contention,
bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and ran evenly down the lane. AT THE GATE settled in the three and four paths the
first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the seven path of the far turn, then passed some rivals in the lane. PRETTY SPECTACULAR raced
off the pace in the three path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. CHANNEL SCENT showed
little response. TOUGH ONE saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened the final

the turn but dug in for a clear lead toward the sixteenth pole and widened through later yards. GRUMPY'S BUDDY raced with the pace three wide,
challenged at the three eighths pole and took a brief slim lead while between horses midway on the far turn, raced close through the upper stretch but
flattened the final sixteenth. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE entered the first turn in the three path then saved ground midway through the turn, picked up the chase
past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, left the turn outside and came along for third nearing mid-stretch. TIME TO CHOOSE

MYSTIFIED settled off the pace in the three and four paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the
far turn, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to hold off the game challenge of MASTER THIS, who saved ground off the pace and
bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadily improved off the rail on the far turn, entered the stretch three wide and dueled gamely to the wire. TYLER TIME
rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met leaving
the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. BOOK OF DELANCEY stalked from the three path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn in the four and five paths then flattened in the lane. SULEMAN rounded the first turn turns about the five path and raced outside into the backstretch,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced on in the five path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. RIGHTEOUS MAN stalked toward the
inside, gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole and raced close through the backstretch, then flattened in the four path of the far turn. LUFTY'S KISSES

FLAT DISCOUNT stalked the early pace off the rail, took the lead two deep into the backstretch and pulled herself clear toward the five sixteenths pole, was
urged away at the rail on the far turn then steadily handled in the lane. DAT DARES GOLD ducked in leaving the gate then set the early pace inside, was
met into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back approaching the far turn and dueled through the stretch for second.
MISS WILD rated close inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then relented in the stretch duel for second.
CENTERFOLD ANGEL rated close off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
weakened into the lane. ELITE SPEED hesitated at the break, rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced
in the three path of the far turn. DUSTWHIRL WONDER rounded the first turn about the six path and was never a factor. MISS HEART saved ground.

Footnotes
FATHER WALSH chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in leaving the eighth pole, took over in later yards and raced clear toward the wire.
MISCHIEVOUS JESSE tapered toward mid track and rated the pace, came under pressure and moved to the rail into the turn, dug in under steady
encouragement leaving the turn, was caught in later yards but held on for second. STRETCH THE TRUTH steadied early, gave chase inside and raced
near the rail on the turn, eased out toward the head of the lane and was gaining on the runner-up. ONE MORE FACTOR chased through the backstretch,
raced in the three path of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. MOSS BOSS chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the five path, was carried to
the outside nearing the head of the lane but came back to finish evenly. BIG HAMBONE chased, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened in the
lane. LOADED SNIPER chased, rounded the turn about the four path, angled out nearing the head of the lane and weakened in the stretch. CONFUSION
BABY BOY was not a factor and rounded the turn about the five path. AWESUMMER was shuffled back early and angled to the outside to give chase, then
saved ground on the turn.

PLUNK rated off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dug in under determined handling to take the
nod in the final yards. SEAN THE HAMMER took the lead at the three quarter pole, moved inside into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure
approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but reluctantly gave up the nod in the final yards.
CRYPTIC CODE rounded the opening turn about the five path and left the turn outside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn and took the nod for third under the wire. WILLIAM'S CAUSE stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase leaving the half mile pole
but faded at the rail into the far turn. MOTIVATED SPEAKER raced well back saving ground, gave chase into the backstretch, could only improve his
position and rounded the far turn off the rail. POSITRACTION saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded at the rail nearing
the far turn. SPEIGHTY SENSE raced off the early pace about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. COOL DUDE rounded the
