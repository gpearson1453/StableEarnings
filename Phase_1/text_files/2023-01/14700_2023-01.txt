CREME DE MENTHE was away in good order then unhurried early, moved up from the inside to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with UNRIVALED
QUEEN and edged away from that rival through the closing yards. UNRIVALED QUEEN pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the quarter, vied with the winner, rider lost whip nearing the sixteenth pole and could not match strides with that rival late. ELEGANT SWAY was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and showed good late energy. JUANA GALLO set a pressured pace while racing
three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. WILLOWMYGIRL settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave way in the
drive. ICE N LEMON lagged throughout.

ARIZONA SUN sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. DANCE SHOES
tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, could not gain on the winner but finished well to hold the place. LETS DECLARE
PEACE chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing response. HOLY TUTTA BELLA lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. V BUCKS was off slow, rushed to contention, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
STITZY tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and wore down SHINNY in the closing yards. SHINNY settled off the leaders early,
saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good late energy. MY INDY was bumped at the start, settled
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with good energy. GOLDEN ALE sprinted to a long lead early, remained in
control through mid-stretch and gave way through the final sixteenth. COURAGEOUS was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through
the turn and was not a factor. SONNY SMACK lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and was eased.

LINCHTOWN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, offered a bid with a furlong to run, vied with BESAME MUCHO through a prolonged
drive and edged away late. BESAME MUCHO broke sharply to duel for the lead with GODGUNSNCOUNTRY from the inside, responded when challenged
by the winner with a furlong to run, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly late. WIND RIVER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and gave way
through the final furlong. GENERAL THAYER showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CORN POP raced off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TIM'S BUDDY was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and held sway to the wire.
READY TO FORGIVE was reserved just off the leaders early, lacked racing room nearing the quarter, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good
energy. DIAMOND WILLOW showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with some late run. WHOS DALLINS DADDY broke
sharply to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside and gave way in the drive. BIG SCOTT DADDY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through
the turn and failed to threaten. GOT EVEN SMARTER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CATABILITY was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SHAMAN'S PRODIGY dueled for the lead with ROSEBUD RYDE while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by AKASI into the lane, vied with
that rival and gamely prevailed. AKASI was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, vied with the winner but could not get by that rival late. SASSY EINSTEIN showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled
out in mid-stretch and finished with some late run. LADY CREATIVE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters.
PREDETERMINATION raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second and finished evenly. EASY DOES IT settled off the leaders
early, moved six-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. TALKINGNONSTOP was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn
and did not offer a bid. ROSEBUD RYDE disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
WILLY THE COBBLER was away alertly then was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to gain command nearing the three-sixteenths
marker and drew off as a handy winner. OF GOOD REPORT stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid into the lane was no
match for the winner but clearly second best. BLUE AZUL sprinted clear soon after the start, raced four-wide while setting the pace and gave way after
going three-quarters. BLESSED JOURNEY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. KICK IT showed no
early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. WESTFEST raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the
second turn and weakened. UNCLE FLOYD was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not menace.
