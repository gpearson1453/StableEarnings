BIG BLUE NOTE opened a long lead at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and was ridden out to the wire. KEEPINMYPROMISE was reserved
just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished well. YELLEN chased the leaders while
racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. MY CLASSY WIFE hopped at the start, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. DELAWARE DESTINY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
OUR BOY ROY was bumped at the start, sprinted clear soon after, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy
winner. SUGAR SHANE tracked the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that foe in the drive but finished well to hold the place.
MONGOLIAN APPLE was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. HE'S A FLYIN broke sharply to chase the
leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. SPECIAL MOMENT was forwardly placed early, raced five-wide through the turn and
gave way in the drive. LITTLE AXE SOUL lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MISTER MAFIOSO broke out to bump
rival and lost the rider.

BOTERO lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was up with a late rush. LONELY PRIVATE dueled for the lead while racing three-wide
with GOOD BYE CHARLIE, vied with that rival into deep stretch but could not resist the winner from over the top. GOOD BYE CHARLIE was away in good
order to dispute the pace with LONELY PRIVATE from the inside and gave way through the final sixteenth. EL MAESTRO was pinched back at the start,
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PERFECT FANNY chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way
through the final furlong. NEW EVERY MORNING lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. MYSTICAL IMAGE raced off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MAD LUTHER broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and drew off with complete authority. UPO tracked the
leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and was up for the place. PALACE PRINCE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn
and finished with a belated bid. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going
three-quarters. EROTIC was forwardly placed early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way. VINTAGE KITTEN was off a step
slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. IMISSBAYMEADOWS was checked at the start, lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the second turn and raced far back through the lane.

Footnotes
PERFECT COME BACK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up five-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied and was up to prevail. GOOD
BYE PUTIN lacked early speed, waited for racing room nearing the quarter, moved between rivals into the lane, bumped with EL CHUMELITO and finished
willingly when clear. DYNAMIC RULER was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with EL CHUMELITO from the inside, opened a clear margin
into the lane and yielded late. SHOTGUN RIDER stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, checked nearing
the three-sixteenths pole and gave way thereafter. HEY SEQUOIA lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. EL
CHUMELITO disputed the pace while racing three-wide, was bumped nearing the quarter and gave way. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
CONCERNING THE BUMPIING OF GOOD BYE PUTIN AND EL CHUMELITO AT THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND AFTER REVEWING THE
FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED THAT GOOD BYE PUTIN HAD CAUSED THE INFRACTION AND DISQUALIFIED HIM FROM SECOND AND
PLACED HIM LAST.

NEVADAN broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held EL CHAVO DEL OCHO safe late.
EL CHAVO DEL OCHO disputed the pace while racing four-wide with the winner, stayed on well in the drive and held the place. ZATTER was off a step
slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. ROUSING RUBBLE pressed the pace from the inside and gave
way through the final furlong. MO GEE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. LIMITED OFFER was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and gave way in the drive. D K'S CROWN showed brief speed, steadied nearing
the seven-sixteenths pole and did not menace thereafter. THE RIDER OF D K'S CROWN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST ROUSING RUBBLE CONCERING
THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS MARKER AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS DISQUALIFIED LIMITED OFFER

Footnotes
GYPSY WIFE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run, vied with IF
YOU WANT IT and held that rival safe late to prevail. IF YOU WANT IT lacked early speed, raced seven-wide through the second turn, reached the winner
inside the sixteenth pole, vied with that foe and just missed. PRANCE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn,
offered a bid with a furlong to run, led and gave way in the drive. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second
turn and finished evenly. LADY NOGUEZ was off a step slow, lagged early, moved four-wide through the second turn, lacked room nearing the quarter and
finished well when clear. CIDSTAYINURLAINE dueled for the lead from between foes and gave way through the final furlong. MS SALLY was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. QUEEN OF LOVE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after
going three-quarters. MISS AGGIE BLING was away alertly to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. DADDY'S GIRL
raced off the pacesetters from the inside and gradually weakened.
