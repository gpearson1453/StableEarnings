five wide into the turn, was closing late and finished second best. OFFENSIVE was void of speed, advanced ten wide through the turn and closed for third.
NICE WORK tracked the early pace, raced seven wide and was empty late. KIRBY DERBY raced in mid pack early, went three wide and flattened out.
DIABOLICAL RULER set a pressured early pace from between rivals and faded. GRAN MANNA was allowed to settle early, raced nine wide and tired.
