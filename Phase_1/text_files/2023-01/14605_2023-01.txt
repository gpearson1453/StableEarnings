Footnotes
IMPACT ZONE forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the modest fractions to the half-mile marker, roused three wide on the second turn, overtook
SECRET SHAMBALA nearing the furlong pole, pulled away in the final furlong and was hand ridden to the wire. SECRET SHAMBALA stalked the moderate
early pace, assumed command leaving the three-furlong marker, could not hold off IMPACT ZONE in mid-stretch and stayed on to be second best.
CARRIZO SPRINGS allowed to settle, three wide into the backstretch run, four wide into the drive, lacked the needed late response and was clear for third
in the end. CORK MASTER took back off of the modest pace, never far back to the second turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker and lacked a late
rally. UPDRAFT assumed command in the early stages, set pedestrian fractions through the backstretch run, overtaken on the second turn, lost position in
upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
THE CALABRESE KID three wide into the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, roused five wide leaving the three-furlong marker, mounted a
four wide rally into the drive, steadily advanced approaching the furlong pole, assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the final
stages. CARSON'S LEGACY three wide into the first turn, advanced to track the pacesetter to the half-mile marker, vied for the lead approaching the top of
the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, could not match strides with THE CALABRESE KID in deep stretch and held for place. TIGER'S ARROW four
wide along the first turn, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, came within aim while four then three wide nearing the quarter marker, outkicked in
the stretch drive and held for show. AFRICAN PRINCE settled in the second flight, lost position along the backstretch run, raced three wide along the
second turn, swung widest for the drive and offered a mild late rally. PICK BYMY FRIEND allowed to settle, saved all of the ground, advanced nearing the
quarter marker, could not sustain that bid and flattened in the final furlong. THECHIEFHASTRICKS sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, confronted nearing the quarter marker and gave way in the stretch. DR. FLASH DANCER forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the
moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, steered three wide on the far turn, outrun in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MOTHER'S PRAYER sent to the early lead, well handled while carving out decent fractions, confronted by O B'S nearing the quarter marker, drifted out
nearing the top of the lane, extended the lead in mid-stretch and kept to task in the late stages to prove best. HOT JOURNEY allowed to settle, saved all of
the ground while well positioned to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, could not make headway on the winner in deep stretch and held for place.
O B'S took back off of the decent early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, rallied two wide along the far turn, vied for the lead nearing the quarter
marker, carried out a bit by MOTHER'S PRAYER at the top of the stretch and came three wide for the drive, could not keep pace in the final furlong and was
well clear for third in the end. CALI CONQUEST allowed to settle, raced two wide along the second turn and did not threaten in the drive. MONEY
MUNCHER stalked the pace into the first turn, raced in pursuit along the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. CHILLY
WILLY forwardly placed in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, dropped back on the
second turn and gave way.

Footnotes
COWBOYS DAUGHTER hustled to establish the early advantage, set the pace while off of the rail into the backstretch run, well rated to the half-mile marker
while setting moderate fractions, turned away STATEFOREST leaving the quarter marker, extended the lead in mid-stretch and kicked clear in the late
stages. SACRED BEAUTY unhurried in the early going, raced three wide on the first turn, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker, outkicked in the
drive and held for place. MISTY CAT came under a tight early hold, raced between rivals while stalking the moderate pace to the second turn, lost ground
nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch, challenged for place in the final strides and held safely in the end for show. HERE COMES RALPHIE
stalked the moderate early pace from the inside, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened. IDA CLAIRE allowed to settle, raced three wide on the first
turn, not far back through the backstretch run, steered three then four wide on the far turn and lacked a late rally. STATEFOREST forwardly placed in the
early going, raced four then three wide along the first turn, tracked the pacesetter to the second turn, turned away leaving the quarter marker and tired in the
late stages.

Footnotes
TRINIDAD broke alertly and dictated terms into the first turn, set reasonable fractions through the backstretch run, drew clear nearing the quarter marker,
widened the lead in mid-stretch, felt late pressure from DE LA LUNA and held on in deep stretch over the oncoming runner-up. DE LA LUNA allowed to
settle, improved position two wide on the far turn, swung three wide for the drive, finished well in the final furlong, put late pressure on TRINIDAD but could
not reel that foe in in the final strides and was second best. NO ICE NO GLASS forwardly placed into the first turn, raced three wide into the backstretch run,
chased TRINIDAD to the quarter marker, lacked a late response in the drive and held for show. FAST CHAD unhurried in the early stages, saved all of the
ground to the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive and found his best stride late. ENJOY THE MOMENT was away a step slowly, recovered to be
forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide into the backstretch run, ran in pursuit of TRINIDAD to the quarter marker and weakened in
the stretch run. LANGSTON ROAD tracked the early pace from the inside, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground nearing the quarter
marker and tired.

Footnotes
OCTANE (BRZ) shuffled leaving the start and away a bit slowly, unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide in upper
stretch, advanced nearing the furlong grounds, shifted out inside of the furlong marker, surged between rivals in deep stretch and was up in the final strides
for the win. GETTIN SIDEWAYS allowed to settle, three wide on the turn, mounted a four wide bid in upper stretch, closed fast while keeping pace with
OCTANE in deep stretch, just missed for the win in the final strides and was up in time to secure the place. MARILYN'S SMILE rated off of the moderate
early pace, raced two wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive, rallied in deep stretch and was up for show in the final strides. HOT RAGEOUS away
alertly, pressed the moderate pace to the turn, kept close attendance to GAYLES EVENING to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, took
a narrow lead inside of the furlong marker, overtaken in deep stretch and was just edged for show. CANAM GAL showed speed and pressed the pace
outside of rivals to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch while in range and weakened in the final sixteenth. TIP
TOP GAL forwardly placed in the early going, was a bit keen while in tight nearing the turn, chased from the rail to the top of the lane and lacked a late
response in the drive. GAYLES EVENING asked for early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, held foes at bay
to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
COLORMEMONEY tracked the early pace from the second flight, advanced three wide on the turn, confronted DARKSABER in upper stretch, came to even
terms with that rival inside of the furlong marker, dueled with the game runner-up to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides.
DARKSABER prominent in the early going, disputed the solid early pace to the quarter marker, confronted by COLORMEMONEY in upper stretch, held that
foe at bay to mid-stretch, dueled with the winner to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides, while besting the rest. QUIET CHARM tracked
the solid early pace outside of rivals, raced four wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the late stages and was up for show in the final strides.
UNCLE WILBUR unhurried in the early going, three wide approaching the quarter marker, came in tight in upper stretch and lacked room nearing the furlong
grounds, swung out nearing the sixteenth-marker, found his best stride late and just missed for show in the final strides. GREGS CITY ZIP chased the solid
early pace, raced two wide along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. SURPRISE FASHION bobbled at the start and was off a
step slowly, lacked speed while racing at the rear in the early stages, came two wide to the quarter marker and offered mild late rally in the stretch run.
MINOSO forwardly placed in the early stages, lost position while inside of rivals on the turn, chased to mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. CURLING
SECRET showed early speed, contested the solid early pace from the inside, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) rated off of the early pace, three wide along the first turn, four wide nearing the quarter marker, swung six wide for the drive, came
within range nearing mid-stretch, battled with SHOT OF A LIFETIME inside of the final furlong, responded to firm urging and determinedly kept to task in
deep stretch to prevail. SHOT OF A LIFETIME well placed in the early stages, three wide midway through the second turn, dove to the inside in upper
stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, battled with OTTAWA FIRE inside of the furlong pole, gamely bested in the final strides and was
second best in the end. J T'S WATCH tracked the decent early pace, raced three wide along the far turn, swung five wide for the drive, came within aim
nearing mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the top pair in the final sixteenth and held safely for third in the end. LIL MIRACLE MAN showed speed and
was sent to establish the early pace, set prompted fractions while off of the rail to the second turn, battled with UNION DANCE to mid-stretch and weakened
in the final furlong. UNION DANCE forwardly placed in the early stages, prompted the decent pace to the half-mile marker, kept close attendance to the
pacesetter to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, vied for the lead to the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages. ECOLOGIST broke in at
the start and was away a bit slowly, allowed to settle, raced two wide to the second turn and lacked a late rally. HOLY GHOST shuffled back at the start and
spotted the field in the early stages, unhurried while saving ground and did not offer a late response. TABLE FOR TEN allowed to settle, saved ground to
the second turn, came two wide to the quarter marker and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) raced in the clear and was content to sit a few lengths off of the pace to the far turn, gained ground on the leaders on the far
turn, came into the stretch three wide and responded to a strong hand ride with steady rally to just get up in time. ANITANEWMERCEDES was hustled to
gain forward position, raced to the outside of BRIT'S WIT to the turn, forced the issue approaching the three furlong marker, picked up the pace and battled
that foe to deep stretch and held off all challengers save for the winner in a game effort. CHIEF JACKSON brushed with ENJOY IT STRAIT after the break,
saved ground through the first turn and had a good inside trip to the far turn, launched a serious bid turning for home and finished stoutly but came up a bit
short. ARMA D'ORO fell well back of the pack in the early stages, began a sustained rally while four or five wide on the far turn, continued to rally down the
stretch and was still gaining at the wire. EL JOY had no early speed, falling well behind through the first half mile, advanced through the turn and finished
well enough to split the field. BRIT'S WIT broke out a bit after the start then was nudged to the front, established the inside position with
ANITANEWMERCEDES to the outside, raced in tandem with that one setting moderate fractions to the turn, picked up the pace passing the three furlong
pole, continued to duel into the stretch, kept on well but weakened in the final sixteenth. ROCKTILLYOUDROP last away from the gate, chased the field to
the far turn, was under heavy pressure entering the far turn, made a seven-wide rally into the stretch and passed a couple of tiring foes in the late stages.
ENJOY IT STRAIT brushed with CHIEF JACKSON after the break, tracked the leaders from a three wide position while under a stout hold for the first half
mile, was set down with three furlongs to go but was unable to keep up with the quickening pace and finished evenly. SYNC was away in good order,
seemed content to race in the middle of a strung out pack through the early stages while saving ground, started a bid approaching the half -mile pole but
stalled out on the turn and was unable to sustain the bid.
