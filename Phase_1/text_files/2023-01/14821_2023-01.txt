BROADWAY SKY dueled early dropped back slightly down the backside, rallied on the far turn and gained a clear lead, drew off in the stretch to win as
much the best, handily. AWESOME BREAK was allowed to settle, rallied in the stretch, was no match for for the winner but was up for place. SHEA D
CAPTURE raced inside and had no rally late. BLUNDER hopped at the start, rallied down the backside and around the far turn, then weakened in the
stretch. WHEN IN ROME dueled early, gained a clear lead down the backside, tired on the far turn and quickly gave way. BON DEUX was no menace.
