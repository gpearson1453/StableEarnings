Footnotes
LOUIS LE GRANDE broke out at the start, chased along the inside, was roused to secure position inside of rivals entering the turn, progressed to gain place
from an outer rival at the quarter pole, drifted outwardly many paths through upper stretch while pursuing the clear leader, then ranged up to that foe at the
furlong grounds, drove past entering the final sixteenth, and drew clear. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL cleared off and crossed over at the half mile pole, showed
the way in hand around the turn, was shaken up after the rider looked for challenges leaving the quarter pole, came under a drive in midstretch as an outer
rival menaced, but offered little resistance at the sixteenth pole, gave way, and narrowly saved place. SEMI CHARMED LIFE got keen before shifting
outside of the clearing leader at the half mile pole, stalked two wide, but lost place to an inner rival entering the lane, got floated outwardly many paths
through upper stretch while sustaining a chase, failed to match rallying stride entering the final furlong, then kept on in the late stages, but missed reached
place. COURAGEOUS TIMMY broke a step slow and took back from tight quarters between horses at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, improved
entering the lane, and failed to threaten the top trio. PLEASANT VISION lacked speed four wide, and made little impact. ROOSTER RUN leaned inwardly at
the start, pursued from midpack three wide and between horses, and faded.

Footnotes
MOTOWN MISSILE stalked the top pair from the four path, bid three wide at the five sixteenths pole, quickly assumed command entering the lane, shied
outwardly from a left handed crop through upper stretch before lugging inwardly from a right handed one inside the final furlong, yet simultaneously pulled
away while hanging on his left lead. HUMOR ME PLEASE pursued the leader from between a pair of rivals into the first turn, rated back and shifted out to
the four path exiting that bend, shifted three to four wide entering the lane, and stayed on while hanging on his left lead. LIMA ZULU set the pace inside of a
vying rival, then inside of a pair of foes into the far turn as MOTOWN MISSLE joined the fray, but proved no match for that one turning for home, sustained
place through midstretch, but lost that position at the sixteenth pole. G'S LAW bobbled a bit leaving the gates, raced at the rear along the inside, vacated the
rail to surpass a tiring rival turning for home, and failed to factor. LA BOUCANE vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but
proved no match for his outer counterpart turning for home, then weakened in upper stretch while resisting a lead change. WINNING DANCE tracked along
the inside, chased the top trio around the far turn, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
HIGH TONE stalked outside of the clear leader, pressed entering the turn, bid in upper stretch, led at the three sixteenths pole, and held sway from an outer
pursuing foe through the final furlong. CARBON STRYKER chased the top pair from the four path, drifted to the six path entering the lane, yet sustained a
grinding rally to take aim on the new leader in midstretch, but was kept at bay through the final furlong. MILTONTOWN tracked along the inside, pursued the
top trio from the two to three paths around the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and chased the leaders home while hanging on his left lead.
FRANK THE MAYOR trailed in the two path, then stayed on inside of rivals through the lane. TWO DOT chased from midpack in the four path and between
horses into the turn, and failed to factor. LET IT B cleared off early on, showed the way around the turn as an outer rival applied pressure, but was headed
by that one at the three sixteenths pole, and faltered between horses in the final furlong. AUTOCRATIC made little impact from the five path, and was
vanned off pulling up in the gallop out.

WORK ORDER pressed two wide and between horses, vied turning for home, led in the three path entering the lane, shifted down to the two path leaving
the quarter pole to shut the door on JULIA'S WARRIOR's bid attempt, then drove clear nearing midstretch, and inched away. JULIA'S WARRIOR took a
bump from an inner rival soon after the start, tracked the top flight from the two to three paths around the turn, inched closer to be just behind them entering
the lane, but put an inner rival to tight quarters while attempting to gain position inside of the leader leaving the quarter pole, lacked the needed kick to bid
through a rail opening in upper stretch, chased the clearing leader into the final furlong, and secured place at the sixteenth pole while hanging on his left
lead. BOOSTER SHOT bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, chased four wide, yielded to inner foes in the five path entering the lane, drifted to the
seven path approaching midstretch, yet kept on in the final furlong to gain show late. RATE CONFIRMATION stalked three wide, bid turning for home, but
yielded in the four path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, sustained a chase while changing over at the three sixteenths pole, but tired in closing
stages. POWER ALLEY was slow early, trailed along the inside, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, stayed on mildly between horses, and missed
reaching show. GEM COLLECTION broke out at the start, set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes around the turn, but was headed turning for home,
checked when put to tight rail quarters leaving the quarter pole, and weakened. THE TRAINER OF GEM COLLECTION CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF JULIA'S WARRIOR FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
LORDY LORDY was fractious in the post parade, pressed the leader from the outside, required urging to sustain pressure in the three path and between
horses around the turn, vied in the five path entering the lane, drifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, sustained a duel through the final sixteenth, and
narrowly prevailed. CUSTOM CADILLAC set the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch while maintaining a margin from an outer
rival, showed the way into the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, dueled through the final sixteenth, and got nailed at the wire. BOSTON BLITZ
broke inwardly, bumped the inner part of the gate before bumping and bothering an inner rival at the start, chased two wide and between horses while under
steady urging, vied for show between horses in midstretch, and edged that position through the final sixteenth. IRON MOON was bumped and bothered by
an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before fading. THROWIN' SHADE tracked three wide while in
the four path around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and gave way while hanging on his left lead. LONE STAR MAX veered out at the
start, and got outrun.

OATH OF ALLEGIANCE pulled clear while keyed up around the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, widened on her own power in the two
path around the far turn, and was driven home under a stout hand ride through the lane. LADY WITH A CAUSE laid off of the pace along the inside, gained
show turning for home, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and stayed on to reach place at the sixteenth pole. JAYLA stalked the clear leader from the
inside, chased while clearly second around the far turn, but tired entering the final furlong, and lost place to an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. SALSALITA
VERDE took a bump from an outer rival at the start, saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. INTERNET GIRL lunged inwardly and bumped a rival while off
a half step slow at the start, lacked speed three wide, and faded. SENSE OF HEART bobbled a bit at the start, stalked outside of the leader and from the
four path, but faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
MANGELSEN vied for the led two wide, was guided to the seven path for better footing entering the backstretch, led while remaining in the six path around
the far turn, held sway from chasers through upper stretch, and drove clear leaving the furlong grounds. MR. FOUR SEVENS vied for the lead inside of the
eventual winner, but was headed by that wide foe around the far turn, fought on through midstretch, but yielded in the late stages, yet held place.
HUDSON'S TURN bobbled at the start, rated at the rear two wide, inched closer in the five path around the far turn, but leveled off in midstretch, vied for
show between horses in the closing stages, and dead-heated for that position. SILVER GALAXY pursued from midpack two wide, then from the four path
and among rivals around the far turn, sustained a chase between foes through midstretch, then emerged late to dead heat for show. OH MY ACHING
ARCH saved ground towards the rear, then lacked the needed rail kick. REAL CITY SPEED tracked three wide, pursued from the five path around the far
turn, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, drifted to the ten path in upper stretch, chased the top pair while one-paced through midstretch, and yielded
to inner rivals late. MOMENT OF STARDOM saved ground in midpack, tipped out in upper stretch, chased between horses in the final furlong, and yielded
late. APACHE TEARS prompted the pace three wide, stalked the top pair entering the backstretch, but weakened in hand between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
FIFTEEN LOVE BACK chased from the two path, shifted outside of the leader in upper stretch, sustained a bid along with an outer rival leaving the furlong
grounds, and edged an advantage late. UNDERDOG tracked in the three path, came into the lane in the five path, grinded away, bid along with an inner
rival leaving the furlong grounds while steadily drifting out, and was outfinished by his inner bidding counterpart. CHANNEL WON set the pace inside of a
pressing rival, shook free entering the lane, but was challenged by a pair of outer rivals at the furlong grounds, and yielded late. TAPPIN FORA DANCE
broke a step slow before being bumped by an inner rival and forced into an outer foe at the start, trailed in the five to six path, and stayed on. COMPLEX
SYSTEM pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and weakened on his left lead. DREAM HALO lacked speed two wide and between
horses, took the turn in the three path, and failed to factor. SPECIAL PRYCE broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the four path, and made little impact.
FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN saved ground off of the pace, but faded.
