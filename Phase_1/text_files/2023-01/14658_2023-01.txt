Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON set the pace between rivals early then dueled inside a rival past the half-mile pole, maintained a short lead around the turn and two
wide into the stretch, disposed of RESILIENT in upper stretch, continued clear into the final sixteenth and lasted over the late charge from BIG CITY
LIGHTS at the wire. BIG CITY LIGHTS bumped leaving the gate, stalked in the two path into the turn, moved out and was asked four wide exiting the bend,
closed in from outside and drew alongside THE CHOSEN VRON late but missed. RESILIENT pressed three deep early then dueled past the half-mile pole,
fought through the turn and three wide into the lane, could not go on with the winner in upper stretch and kept on to hold third. TIGRE DI SLUGO tracked off
the rail up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FINNEUS dropped back to trail early,
traveled two wide around the bend, then angled out nearing the stretch and failed to menace. I'LL STAND TALLER bumped with BIG CITY LIGHTS in the
beginning, pressed the pace inside rivals to the half-mile pole then chased the top pair into the turn, continued along the rail through the turn and faded in
the drive.

MILA'S PAPA sprinted to the front, showed the way through the turn, led clear into the final sixteenth and held on. MOON ICE stalked off the rail, angled to
the inside on the turn, tipped outside the leader in the stretch, launched a bid in deep stretch but could not get by. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR ducked in and
bumped rival in the beginning, ran up on heels and had to steady up the backstretch, traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch, angled out and
put in a late effort to earn the show honors. BRONKO NAGURSKI broke a step slow, chased four deep early, went three then two wide around the bend,
kept on through the lane but was outfinished for the third. TRANSITORY broke in and bumped rival, chased inside rivals, bumped with outer foe on the
bend, bumped with same rival again in upper stretch and churned on through the final furlong. REGULATION DAZED got bumped leaving the gate, tracked
three deep and bumped with a rival early, had to steady at the three-eighths pole, bumped three deep around the bend, drifted in some in upper stretch and
could not rally. CHROME TO RICHES chased five deep early, moved into the three path on the turn, moved out in the lane and lacked further response.
LONESOME STEW was off slow to begin, pulled while between and had to steady and bumped with outer rival, got bumped on both sides on the turn,
continued between foes then bumped inner rival in upper stretch and flattened. VICTORY MATTERS was forced inward and steadied at the start, raced
near the back into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, angled out and failed to rally. NOTFORLACKOFEFFORT forwardly placed outside the speed,
raced outside a rival then three wide into the lane and faded in the stretch run. BOTH AT FAULT got bumped and forced in having to steady leaving the
gate, trailed into the turn and failed to make an impact. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SPIRITUAL ADVISOR FROM THIRD
TO LAST FOR DUCKING IN AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO VICTORY MATTERS AND BOTH AT FAULT AT THE START. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SASSY NATURE sprinted clear quickly, showed the way into and around the turn, coaxed lightly in upper stretch and widened while never asked for her
best. BAJAN BASHERT stalked the pace off the rail then moved inside, saved ground around the bend, could not threaten the winner but was clearly
second best. SHE'S NOT KIDDING was closest in pursuit from outside early, took the turn three then two wide and flattened in the stretch. TIMELY LUCK
broke inward, raced off the pace then moved into range up the backstretch, took the turn two then three wide and could not rally in the lane. DANEHILL
SONG veered in leaving the gate then bumped with outer rival shortly after, shifted a bit early on, saved ground through the turn and weakened in the late
stages. KIND OF BLUE broke in then bumped with DANEHILL SONG shortly after the start, was bothered by that rival early on the backstretch, trailed into
and around the turn, saved ground through the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
THORNE HOUSE bumped leaving the gate, dueled for command from outside early, cleared on the turn, met the challenge from MOOSE MITCHELL at the
half-mile pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and remained strong under a drive to the wire. QUEEN'S CODE dueled for the lead early from inside, could not
keep up and chased around the turn, finished willingly along the fence through the lane and edged MOOSE MITCHELL for second. MOOSE MITCHELL
raced up close four deep then stalked three wide into the turn, bid outside at the half-mile pole, lost touch in upper stretch and got edged between rivals for
second. JOE DON LOONEY stalked outside a rival two wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly three deep late and got
outkicked for the place and show. PRESS ON stalked the pace on the inside into the turn, tried to move out and between rivals but got put in a tight spot,
moved back inward and could not rally in the lane. ALPINE THUNDER bobbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace three wide around the turn and could
not rally. FORE FLAG raced two wide near the back into the turn, angled out crossing the dirt and into the stretch and could not summon the needed
response. SMILE FOR GLORY bumped leaving the gate, settled off the pace, raced on the inside to two wide on the turn, then moved out a bit and failed to
menace. LARRY'S LEGEND showed speed then got shuffled between rivals early, dropped back to chase and went three wide into the turn, moved out and
entered the lane five wide and weakened. CIBERTRUCK bumped leaving the gate, got shuffled between shortly after, moved to the inside, steered off the
rail and made no impact.

Footnotes
STAY IN THE GAME broke a step slow, stalked three wide early, roused in the the two path around the bend, tipped out at the top of the stretch, closed in
on the top pair and overhauled those rivals in the final strides. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT set the pace under pressure from outside, maintained command
through the turn, held a short lead over BIG DRINKER through the stretch run but was overtaken by the winner in the final moments. BIG DRINKER broke a
step slow then went up to press the pace from outside, kept the pressure on through the turn and down the lane but never found the needed late kick to get
by. KING ZOG raced up close outside the top pair, chased three wide into the lane, angled to the inside midstretch and flattened out. DORADUS stalked the
pace on the inside into the turn, lost ground around the bend and weakened. CHARBONNEAU chased five wide into and around the turn and also
weakened. UNCLE WALT had his path taken at the start, trailed a bit off the rail then raced outside a rival two wide into the lane and was not a factor.

BIG SUMMER chased early then went up to vie for command from inside, took a narrow lead around the turn, shook free at the top of the stretch and held
well under right-handed and strong handling. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM forwardly placed in the early going, traveled three wide into the turn, eased over to the
rail around the bend, tipped off the fence in the drive and finished determinedly to edge ALICE MARBLE for second. ALICE MARBLE was prominent early
then took a stalking position, entered the turn four wide then angled over to the two path, steered out into the lane and finished willingly but got outkicked for
the place honors. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL dropped back off the pace and had to check behind a rival early, moved inward and entered the turn two wide,
moved back out and came four wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. BELLA D allowed to settle early, steered to the inside and
saved ground along the rail around the bend, moved off the fence in the drive and improved position. TAMING THE TIGRESS raced up close then got put in
tight and had to steady early, chased five then four wide on the turn, got floated out crossing over the dirt and could not rally. SUNSHINE BABE got put tight
along the outer rail and steadied early, dropped back off the pace and raced outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the lane, lacked room
midstretch, tipped out to a clear path but was too late to regain the lost momentum. KLEEN KARMA broke a bit slow then lost her path at the start, moved
up between to vie for command, dueled outside the winner across the dirt, lost touch with that rival at the top of the lane and weakened. LA DEUXIEME
ETOILE sped to the front and cleared briefly, vied three deep into and around the turn, drifted out crossing over the dirt and faded through the lane.

THIRSTY JOHN broke a bit slow and inward then straightened out to quickly to take control on the inside, vied with rivals into the first turn then inched
ahead around the bend, set the pace under pressure from GIVER NOT A TAKER, shook free from that rival leaving the far turn, showed the way into the
final sixteenth, then was challenged again GIVER NTO A TAKER late and was able to hold. GIVER NOT A TAKER vied between rivals into the first turn
then pressed THIRSTY JOHN from outside, lost touch with that rival leaving the far turn, dug in and came again late but could not get by. PASSARANDO
brushed with outer rival leaving the gate, stalked on the inside then two wide around the clubhouse turn, was asked right-handed on the far turn, moved out
in the lane and showed a mild response to whittle the gap on the top pair late. CRYPTO RIDE raced up close outside the top pair early, lost ground around
the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and churned on for a minor award. GEEZER vied four deep early then took a stalking position, was coaxed along
when dropping to mid-pack on the backstretch, took the second turn three then four wide and failed to rally. AMIGO G A brushed with inner rival at the start,
lagged behind early and moved inside, tipped off the rail on the far turn and never got involved. MERIT SONG chased in the three path early, moved to the
inside for the far turn, pulled up at the quarter pole and walked off.

Footnotes
GRAZED MY HEART steadied behind GOLDEN AGAIN early then settled in the two path, moved inside and saved ground around the far turn, steered out
with a furlong left to run, closed in on the top pair and got up three deep at the wire. SELL THE DREAM vied three deep then crossed over to the inside, set
the pace under pressure from CAST MEMBER, headed by that rival midway around the far turn, inched ahead again leaving the bend, maintained a short
lead through the lane but got nailed by GRAZED MY HEART on the line. CAST MEMBER stumbled slightly at the start, pressed SELL THE DREAM from
outside, raced on even terms midway on the second bend, kept the pressure on through the lane and lacked the needed late punch to get by. GOLDEN
AGAIN took back early then moved out to the three path, went two wide into the far turn, angled out to the four path, got bumped from inside exiting the
bend, kept on through the lane but needed to find more late. CAROLE LOMBARD traveled along the inside off the pace, altered out to the three path when
closing on a pair of rivals on the far turn, bumped GOLDEN AGAIN into the stretch, had her path taken at the eight pole, steered inward and could not rally.
CHOLLY brushed with LOYAL TO A FAULT at the start, prominent early then rated on the inside, tipped two wide into the stretch and flattened out.
QUICKLY PARK IT drifted out into the first turn then raced outside a rival at the back, rounded the far turn two wide and was not a factor. LOYAL TO A
FAULT brushed leaving the gate, got crowded between while close up early, stalked the pace from the two path and weakened in the lane.

LEYAS CANDY chased four wide through the clubhouse turn, went up to take the lead past the five-eighths pole and dueled outside I KNOW CASH FLOW
up the backstretch, disposed of that rival past the five-sixteenths marker, roused in upper stretch, urged left-handed in midstretch and widened under hand
urging. DONNER LAKE chased three wide early, moved out widest on the backstretch, went four deep into the far turn, took aim three wide into the stretch,
failed to threaten the winner in the lane but stayed on to best the rest. BIG TALKER steered to the rail then two wide on the first turn near the back,
navigated the far turn three then four wide and was along for the show. I KNOW CASH FLOW sped to the front from inside, lost command but dueled
LEYAS CANDY in the middle stages, failed to keep up past the five-sixteenths pole, churned on down the lane and saved a minor award. MR. T'S THIRSTY
stalked in the two path early, coaxed along on the far turn, spun three wide into the lane, drifted out a bit in the drive and lacked a rally.
NOLONGERAHOBBY pulled a bit stalking the pace near the inside early on, saved ground on the far turn and trailed into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
COALINGA ROAD stalked from the two path, moved out wider on the backstretch, brushed with DOC ADAMS leaving the backstretch, bumped with that
rival again nearing the five-sixteenths pole, engaged the top pair from outside with a quarter mile remaining, took over with a sixteenth remaining and
gamely prevailed. ALIGATO was off slow in the beginning, tracked the speed from inside, took closer over up the backstretch, waited for room on the far
turn, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out and rallied four deep late but ran out of time. LUVLUV got bumped hard from inside leaving the gate, dropped
back and steered to the inside, trailed two wide into the far turn, angled out around the bend, closed through the lane and five deep in the final sixteenth got
edged for the place honors. KINGS RIVER KNIGHT came out in the beginning, went up to take command, led in the two path then moved inside, lost
command at the five-eighths pole and chased BANG FOR YOUR BUCK up the backstretch, re-engaged that rival from outside at the five-sixteenths pole,
took over leaving the far turn, held a short lead to midstretch, then got outkicked in the final sixteenth. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK came out and bumped rival
in the beginning, pulled while chasing off the rail early, tugged the rider forward and took over near the five-eighths pole, cleared and crossed to the inside,
was challenged by KINGS RIVER KNIGHT around the far turn, lost command leaving the bend, fought back from inside through the lane but was
outfinished in deep stretch. ROYAL 'N RANDO got bumped and forced out leaving the gate, pulled when reserved early on from inside, checked near the
three-eighths pole, tipped two then three wide around the far turn, kept on through the lane but failed to threaten. CARMELITA'S MAN got bumped hard in
the beginning, settled outside a rival, found traffic on the far turn, angled to the inside, lacked room outside the sixteenth pole and was too late to rally after
gaining a clear path. DOC ADAMS was prominent early near the inside then stalked the leader around the clubhouse turn, moved out on the backstretch,
brushed with COALINGA ROAD near the three-eighths pole, bumped with that rival on the far turn and weakened down the lane.
