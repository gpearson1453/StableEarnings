Footnotes
MAMBO DANCER brushed lightly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field between horses up the backstretch, continued to
show the way while racing in the two and three path around the turn and dug in gamely in the stretch to hold the win. KENYA SUN chased the leader on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three and four path coming around the bend, dueled in the stretch and could not get by
the winner. VOODAYO brushed with the horse to her outside at the break, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground mildly in the lane. PURE ELEGANCE trailed the field on the outside
up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the bend and improved position in the stretch. ISLA BONITA raced off the pace on the inside
early, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. WESTLODGE INTRIGUE tracked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, began to
drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
SAWEETIE GIRL led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled around the second bend, still in the two path, and
kicked clear in the final furlong. LA TACHE was reluctant to load, veered out and brushed with the horse to her inside at the break, raced in the two path
early, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path and could not go with the winner late, chasing that rival home.
CALISUE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and was outkicked in
the lane. FREE SHOT raced in the three path around the firs turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, angled in
to save ground around the second turn and showed no kick. MIGHTY MADI was bumped and forced back leaving the gate, recovered to save ground
around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing on the rail around the far turn and faded further in
the lane. BRITTY trailed well behind the field the entire way around the oval and despite saving ground was never a factor.

Footnotes
GOT EM THINKING trailed the field early, began to move up while racing into traffic in the two path coming around the turn, found room in upper stretch and
gained ground on the outside to edge clear late. TUNA N STAMPS dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path coming
around the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught late. HEREBY stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, raced in the
four path around the turn and kept on to the wire. GREENPOINT dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the
turn and weakened in the lane. J J'S JUSTICE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. TIMMINS tracked the pace setters between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the three
path and tired in the lane. MAGNA RULER raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground
headed into the turn and was no factor from there.

WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW led the field p the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, dueled down the lane and just
held for the win. MY MAN VITO stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the two path racing around the
bend and dueled to the wire to narrowly miss. DAVIDIC LINE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, began a bid from the three path coming
around the turn and chased the top two home in the stretch. CONFESSOR raced off the pace between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path
and gained ground late. KING OF HOLLYWOOD raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path
and finished evenly. LORD BERRIER chased the leaders on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final
furlong. HIDE THE DEMON bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the two path and flattened out in the lane. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace
through the opening three furlongs, continued around the bend in the three path and made no bid. FIRST RULE trailed the field on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was never a factor.
