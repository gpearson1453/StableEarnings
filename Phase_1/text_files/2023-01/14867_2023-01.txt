Footnotes
WRONGWAYHIGHWAY brushed the outer part of the gate, tracked three wide, ranged up in the four path in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds, and
drove clear. QUARTER RAT bumped with an outer rival at the start, rated at the rear along the inside, shifted out five wide in upper stretch, and offered a
late rally to gain place nearing the wire. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE pressed two wide, bid turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong
grounds after briefly delaying his lead change, kept on to gain place entering the final sixteenth as the rider stood momentarily, but was bested by an outer
rallying rival for that position late. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, stalked along the inside, but lacked progress in the
lane. THE THREE KS took a brush from an inner rival at the start, set the pace, vied with an outer bidder turning for home, but was headed by a wider
challenger leaving the furlong grounds, and weakened. BAQUERO'S BIND leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path, and
was done early.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PEGASUS stalked from the three path, allowed an outer rival to make first bid down the backstretch, shifted outside of the top pair to press
entering the far turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole sparking a duel with MOUNT KENYA, inched an advantage in upper stretch, and held in the stretch-long
battle. MOUNT KENYA tracked the leaders from the four path, made an early bid for the lead at the half mile pole, forged an advantage while tucking to the
two path nearing the three furlong marker, dug in to resist GOLDEN PEGASUS's outer bid turning for home, fought on after being headed in upper stretch,
sustained the battle while hanging on his left lead through the final furlong, but was bested. IZEONDEC was brushed by an outer rival causing him to graze
an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, moved up two wide and between horses around the far turn, stayed on to bid for show along with
an outer LEROY JENKINS nearing midstretch, sparred through the final furlong, and prevailed. LEROY JENKINS leaned in at the start, raced at the rear
two to three wide, stayed on to duel for show with an inner rival through the final furlong, but was kept at bay. TOP NOTE leaned in at the start, tugged clear
in the two path around the first turn, but weakened inside of a pair of foes with three furlongs to go. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE tracked along the inside, and
weakened into the far turn.

SAVAGE DARLING broke slowly and trailed the short field early on, gained three wide around the turn, took aim on the clear leader leaving the furlong
grounds, bid in the final sixteenth, and drove clear. CINCO DE CUATRO set the pace along the inside, inched clear turning for home, held sway through
upper stretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth. MIKITA pressed two wide, but gave way between horses turning for home, then held show through the
final furlong. BELLA PALOMA tracked along the inside under snug restraint through the opening quarter mile, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
WHOLELOTTAMO was restless in the gate, laid off of the pace along the inside, gained in the three path around the far turn before fanning five wide
entering the lane, and rallied to drive past inner foes in the final sixteenth. MEDLEY pressed two wide, vied between horses under steady urging around the
far turn, got floated three wide entering the lane, sustained a bid among foes while hanging on his left lead through deep stretch, but was outkicked by an
outer bidder late. MISHPACHAH set the pace along the inside, resisted bids turning for home, clung to an advantage from a group of foes entering the final
sixteenth, but was bested in the closing stages. BOX OF PICTURES bobbled inwardly at the start while still breaking towards the front, stalked along the
inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leader entering the lane to produce a bid two wide and between horses coming to the furlong grounds, but flattened
out. BLESSED ANNA tracked three wide, pressed the top pair around the far turn, got floated four wide entering the lane, then was outkicked by an outer
rival while yielding leaving the furlong grounds. GATOR PROUD broke slowly while leaning outwardly at the start, then saved ground far back, but to no
avail. AVERI EVER AFTER pursued from midpack in the two path around the first turn, but failed to respond to urging around the far turn, and gave way.
AKIANE'S SOLDIER raced far back two wide and got outrun.

Footnotes
SUMMER SPLASH set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pressing rival around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch, and held sway
under a drive. BLUE JAYS settled off of the pace along the inside, launched a gain in the two path around the far turn, shifted out to the four path turning for
home, sustained a charge to gain place at the furlong grounds, but leveled off, and was caught at the wire to dead-heat for that position. FIRST GLIMPSE
tracked two wide and between horses, got outmoved by an outer rallying rival entering the lane, chased from among foes into midstretch, then altered
course five wide and outside of rivals at the sixteenth pole, sustained stride late, and reached a dead-heat for place at the wire. SOUL COAXING stalked
two wide, pressed down the backstretch, but yielded in upper stretch, and tired between horses in the final furlong. MY BARILEY tracked along the inside,
chased around the far turn, and lacked a bid. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD laid off of the pace three wide, and never got involved. DIRECT ORDER trailed early
on, lagged behind leaving the first turn, and was outrun. VIM AND VIGOR chased from the four path, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
EYEING CLOVER vied two wide, cleared on his own power at the three furlong pole, and drew off under very light hand urging. FROG TOWN bumped with
an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, and sustained a rail rally to gain place nearing the furlong grounds. ZAICI raced off of the pace,
shifted out to the five path leaving the nine sixteenths pole to relieve himself from kickback, inched closer in the four path turning for home, produced a bid
for place along with an inner foe leaving the three sixteenths pole, but failed to match stride with that one while leveling off at the furlong grounds. BIG
BEEMSTER bumped with an inner foe at the start, got herded out to the six path passing the nine sixteenths pole, retreated to trail in the two path entering
the turn, angled back to the six path in midstretch, and moved up. MACHINE GUN MAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked the leading pair from
the outside, but was outkicked by rivals on either side while fading in upper stretch. BORN FLAWLESS chased four wide early on, but weakened while
tucking entering the turn. TIZ THE BIG ONE bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, chased that clearing foe
leaving the three furlong pole, then faltered between horses in upper stretch.

I DON'T VENMO set the pace in the three path, showed the way from a pair of bidders in the two path around the far turn, shook free of them entering the
lane, and held sway. SLICK AND FAST stalked outside of the top pair and from the five path, ranged up to them from the four path to bid turning for home,
but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, and chased that foe home well to prove second best. AMERICAN DOLLARS bumped with an outer
rival at the start, pursed from midpack in the two to three paths, tipped out to the five path entering the lane, then to the six path while picking up stride in
midstretch, and stayed on to reach show late. REGAL KINGDOM saved ground towards the rear, altered between horses in midstretch, and kept on. F T W
SLAM stuttered a step at the start while bumping with an inner rival, stalked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, shifted to the five path entering the
lane, gained show at the furlong grounds, but faltered between horses late. JOEY'S GAME hopped a stride after the start, got briefly keen after shying off an
inner rival in the aftermath, raced at the rear in the four path, then two path around the far turn, and made little impact. CAJUN CONNECTION pressed the
leader from the four path around the first turn, then from the three path and between horses around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. SACRED
NATION lacked speed in the three to five paths, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TAYLORS TAP settled off of the pace two wide, gained between horses entering the lane, claimed show in upper stretch, altered course outside of the
embattled leading pair at the furlong grounds, surged up to them late, and forged an advantage at the wire. FLAMAND broke outwardly, vied outside of a trio
of foes before clearing passing the half mile pole, tucked to the two path soon after, showed the way around the bend before meeting an outer challenge
entering the lane, gamely clung to advantage while dueling through midstretch, flopped back to his left lead inside the furlong grounds, then tenaciously
fended off her outer counterpart, but was nailed by an outer oncharging rival at the wire. IT TAKES HEART leaned out and bumped a rival at the start,
prompted the pace two wide and between horses early on, then stalked the clear leader from the three path around the turn, bid in the four path entering the
lane, dueled through midstretch, but was denied while outkicked for place late. BRU NA BOINNE tracked outside of the early leading quartet, chased from
the five path around the turn, drifted to the six path entering the lane, and ran on mildly. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF leaned in and bumped a rival at the start,
raced at the rear in the five path, spun in to the lane in the seven path, and moved up. MYSTIC STORM broke a step slow, saved ground towards the rear,
but to no avail. NEUTRALIZE vied for the lead inside of a trio of rivals early on, rated back to stalk leaving the half mile pole, but faded through the lane.
SAENZ took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, prompted the pace three wide and between horses, chased from the four path around the turn, but
weakened among foes in upper stretch.

HELAIRE settled off of the pace in the five path, circled rivals entering the lane, and kicked clear in upper stretch. HARD FOUR stalked along the inside
while just off of the fence, bid for the lead two wide and between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival soon after, and was second
best. TAMBOURINE STAR tracked in the three to four paths, spun into the lane four wide and between horses while getting outkicked, and kept on.
PEANUT N IKE saved ground far back, shifted out in midstretch, and moved up. FIELD OF VISION stalked three wide, and yielded between horses at the
quarter pole. BANKROLL set the pace along the inside, met a quartet of bids entering the lane, and weakened. FLOWER CAT failed to factor from the four
path. GOLDEN SOPO prompted the pace four wide, but went wrong entering the turn, was pulled up, dismounted, and untacked approaching three furlong
pole, and got vanned off.
