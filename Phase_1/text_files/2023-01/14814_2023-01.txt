Footnotes
ISABELLA'S GLORY lacked speed, moved up four deep leaving the turn, remained on her left lead until near the finish and drifted in a bit approaching the
wire. BRZINA showed speed, opened a clear lead slightly off the inner rail on the turn, raced on her left lead until deep stretch and steadied inside the
winner approaching the finish. HARLEY GIRL , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, steadily weakened in the stretch. SULLIVAN STREET , along
the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung to the three path approaching the stretch then retreated. BLUE MOON BUNNY , always outrun, was climbing
leaving the chute. VICTORIAN RIVIERA , along the inner rail chasing the pace for a half mile, gave way on the turn. TARA DANCER showed speed along
the inner rail, stopped after a half mile and was eased. An objection by the rider of BRZINA against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was
not allowed.

Footnotes
OXIDE came away in good order then drafted back a bit and rated kindly outside a rival, took closer order three wide and in hand past the three eighths,
snagged command from SHERIFF CHIP soon into the lane, cleared off and drifted in some past the three sixteenths, widened under right handed asking in
mid stretch, was kept alert to the sixteenth marker then coasted home from there. OUR HOISTED MAST , between rivals and off the early pace, swung six
wide with some momentum into the lane, straightened and kept on with good energy to nab the place in the final jumps. HOT N SPICY LOVE settled in the
clear, advanced five wide in hand past the three eighths, ranged up to loom in upper stretch, gave chase past mid stretch, flattened out very late and missed
second. ROYAL CRUSADER rated outside a rival, moved up two to three wide into the lane then came up empty. CAMP PENDLETON , off the pace and
off the inside, gained four wide between runners into the stretch but lacked a further response. EKATI'S VERVE lagged well back, raced four wide mid turn,
swung out well wide in the drive but failed to menace. AXXERATOR was rated back from between rivals at the break, settled well back, swung out very wide
and failed to threaten. MUCHACHO MACHO , two to three wide, made a run between foes into the lane then faded. SHERIFF CHIP opened up early, set
the pace two wide into the lane, ceded to the winner soon after and faltered. LIFESPAN broke slowly, saved ground off the pace, angled out and lacked a
kick. KRACHENWAGEN , hustled up early, gave hard chase towards the rail and faltered.

Footnotes
COLLECTION DAY rated three wide stalking the pace, took closer into the far turn, bid three deep soon after, dueled on a slim lead past the five sixteenths,
kicked clear when put to firmer asking in upper stretch, kept on under energetic left handed urging and held sway. CHELONIAN cleared early, set the pace
towards the rail, dug in and was put to pressure when meeting outside challenges leaving the far turn, emerged in a battle with the winner from the three
eighths, could not quite match strides with that one soon into the lane but stayed on valiantly through the final three sixteenths. TIME TO CRUISE , urged
inside and in range of the leader past the five eighths, dropped back leaving the three eighths, regrouped to advance inside rivals approaching the stretch,
came out for the drive and churned on. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL broke slowly, saved ground off the pace, angled out mid way on the final turn, circled four
wide into the stretch but lacked a serious finish. THTWASTHENTHISISNW , off slow when hopping at the start, was a bit rank and steadied when advancing
between foes early, settled near the five eighths and gained four wide outside horses into the far turn, lacked a punch nearing the five sixteenths and gave
way. JONES FALLS stumbled at the break, recovered and moved up wide around the first turn, failed to go on nearing the far turn and faltered. SOUTHERN
LAD prompted the pace two wide, applied more pressure when between rivals leaving the far turn, could not keep pace past the five sixteenths and
retreated. PER RULING #23-017 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, TIME TO CRUISE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED
DUE TO THE HISA RULE ON EXCESSIVE WHIPS STRIKES.

THENCOMEMORNING , jostled between horses approaching the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, gained the lead two wide entering the far
turn, steadily increased her advantage and was kept under urging the drive. WILD N' SASSY lacked speed, raced in the three path on the far turn and
rallied between horses. OMIKAMI , along the inner rail on the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, was asked for run late and responded.
GRASS CUTTER set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead entering the far turn and tired in the drive. SUSANAS LUCKYCHARM , four deep the first
turn, chased the pace outside horses down the backstretch, was three wide the far turn and weakened the final furlong. MEET ME AT SUNSET was outrun.
HELLA ELLA was no factor. ANATH , three wide both turns, chased the pace, faltered and was eased.

CAUSE TO DREAM edged up inside and stalked, eased out and rated kindly between rivals leaving the far turn, took closer order in hand past the five
sixteenths, came out for pursuit of a clear leader in upper stretch, closed in under a drive to engage from the outside with a furlong remaining, took
command near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. HOV LANE rated outside, moved up to track past three eighths, took over and was clear into the lane, dug
in when collared and gave way grudgingly. LUCKY LORRAINE settled well back, came three to four wide for the drive, advanced between runners in mid
stretch and kept on willingly to gain the show to the inside of a rival in the final yards. BAD TEMPER led early then was headed near the three quarter pole,
rated off the leader then checked nearing the turn, regrouped to stalk, angled out to chase then flattened out late. TORRE BRANCA saved ground off the
pace, angled out in the drive and had belated action. NIBBLES , towards the inside, came up empty. EARLEY ROSE , bumped at the break, raced off the
pace while three wide, angled out and failed to menace. MERGER OF EQUALS angled out very wide for the drive and was not a threat. LUNAR ICE broke
outward and bumped with a foe, raced four wide mid turn and failed to respond. LADY WHISTLEDOWN , three to four wide, faded. LOOKIN SPUNKY ,

FUHGEDDABOUDIT , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, secured command approaching the sixteenth pole then drove clear. HALEIGH B , clear
about a quarter mile after the break, was kept in the two path around the turn, led to mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. GOLDEN EFFECT raced along
the inner rail throughout and failed to rally in an even effort. WATCH YOUR TONE stalked the pace down the backstretch, eased out four deep leaving the
turn and lacked the needed late effort. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS , no factor, swung to the five path leaving the turn. BRUSHING bobbled at the start and
dropped back leaving the turn.

Footnotes
H P MOON drifted in at the break then was bumped from both sides, recovered and accelerated between rivals to take over, moved clear heading to the half
mile pole, set a rated pace two wide into the lane, spurted away a bit after being set down soon after, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, was engaged
from his outside in deep stretch and narrowly prevailed. MAGIC MULE had speed to the inside of the winner, rated off that one past the five eighths and
stalked, eased out three wide into the lane, leveled off under a drive past mid stretch, made a game grinding run, drew alongside nearing the wire and just
missed. SPONSORED , urged along three wide, angled in around the turn, came back out in upper stretch and finished with interest. ZEN MASTER ,
bumped at the break, dropped back off the pace around the turn then lacked a stretch kick. E J'S REVENGE stalked three wide, was pushed along pursuing
the winner past the five sixteenths, failed to go on near mid stretch, drifted and faded. PRACTICAL SENSE failed to menace and swung wide for the drive.
PICASSO , between rivals early, eased back near the turn, angled out and was put to pressure, failed to respond past the five sixteenths and gave way.
