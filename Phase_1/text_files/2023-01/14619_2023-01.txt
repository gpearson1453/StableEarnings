SIR AGGRAVATOR stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, edged clear and held off
a late closer to the wire. ASK FOR BODE raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up from the two path coming around the
bend and continued to gain ground down the stretch. ARCADIA CALLS dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path
coming around the turn and gave way late. PALADIO dueled on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and was caught in late stretch.
MR LIGHTNING BOY tracked the pace setters on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the lane.
ROCKYSBUCKAROO trailed the field throughout, raced in the two path around the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BAD WATER raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, gained
ground on the inside and got up for the win late. RAINBOW'S PRIDE was reluctant to load, hopped up slightly when leaving the gate, raced off the pace on
the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground late to just miss. ROCKY CHITU pressed the
pace on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the bend and dug in gamely in the lane to narrowly miss. DISCREET MAGIC was
reluctant to load, broke well and stalked the leaders on the outside early, challenged from the four path nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in the final
furlong. DISCREET DEVIL led the field on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the bend and tired in the stretch. AZTEC
LEGEND raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. EXQUISITO COCO
raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the lane. MUSIC GEM trailed far behind the field
up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was never involved.

second bend, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire while drifting. INVESTMENT INCOME saved ground around the first turn,
settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained
ground steadily to the finish. ROUNDABOUT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the
three path and improved position mildly in the lane. DYNA'S HONOR saved ground early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
inside, came around the far turn in the two path and finished evenly. I'M NERVOUS NOW brushed lightly with the horse to her inside at the start, raced in
the two path around the first bend, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the rail while coming around the far turn and weakened in the final
furlong. DRY HUMOR was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the
far turn in the two path and improved position in the stretch while never threatening. ALL BIZZ raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the
pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two and three path and was empty in the lane. BAZZARINA brushed
mildly with the horse to her outside at the break, recovered to lead the field while saving ground around the firs turn and up the backstretch, gave way from
the rail coming around the second bend and tired further in the stretch.
