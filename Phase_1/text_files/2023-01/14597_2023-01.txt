Footnotes
ON THE MARK bore out at the break, advanced four deep to gain the lead mid way on the turn, drifted in a bit near the eighth pole and pulled away with
something in reserve. CITI CREEK prompted the pace, raced in the three path between horses around the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive
and clearly held the place. MISS YOU AJAX floated out at the break, was not a threat and circled foes four deep turning for home. MOON SIGN saved
ground on the turn, swung to the three path in upper stretch and failed to rally. BUBBA CHROME sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail around the
turn and retreated through the stretch. FARTLEK was not a factor. BUCK WILD showed speed in the two path between horses into the turn and weakened.
SPUNKY IRISHMAN , fractious in the starting gate, was outrun. CONJUROR dropped back on the turn, pulled up in upper stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
LADNEEDSAHANDLER quickly established a clear advantage, set a rated pace towards the rail, responded when roused entering the lane, spurted away
under a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. RAHMER saved ground with pursuit, was under a hustling ride to the inside of a rival mid turn,
stayed inside through the drive and kept on with good energy. WHAT SAY YOU , three wide and outside a rival, was under asking past the five sixteenths
and could only muster up a mild kick. FLAMING EAST tracked the winner two wide, was under a hearty ride mid turn, ranged up two wide to loom entering
the lane, was turned away soon after, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then faded through the final seventy yards. CHAMBO saved ground in mid pack,
angled out under asking into the lane but lacked a rally. BILLINGSGATE , between foes into the turn, was not a factor. CHAUFFEUR , outrun, saved some
ground into the lane. MAD GENIUS , three deep nearing the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
MIT MAZEL advanced outside her stablemate and went clear nearing the three quarter pole, dropped in some and set a rated pace, met an outside bid from
HASHTAG LUCKY leaving the far turn, dueled under coaxing heading to the lane, responded to firmer asking and kicked clear soon into the lane, widened
under a drive in mid stretch then maintained a safe margin while kept alert. HASHTAG LUCKY led early then was rated back off of her stable mate heading
to the three quarter pole, shifted out and tracked, bid outside leaving the far turn, sparred to the head of the lane, failed to prove a match from there but
continued on willingly to hold down the place. PEYTON ELIZABETH veered out at the break, corrected and settled well wide, made some progress three to
four wide under pressure mid turn, chased into the lane but came up empty in the final furlong. BIG CHEEKS settled off the pace while well wide, circled
four wide with some action mid turn then lacked a serious stretch finish. ITALIAN DRESSING , between rivals early, advanced inside under asking near mid
stretch then flattened out. UNADULTERATED saved ground, swung out for the drive but lacked a bid. HOW LUCKY , three wide, gave way.

Footnotes
LA SAMANA LAURA set the pace two wide around the turn, opened up entering the stretch and dug in late under urging. RED WINE TIME hesitated at the
break, swung six wide entering the stretch, floated wider in mid stretch, remained on her left lead and rallied. PATTY CAKES , four deep on the turn, chased
the winner through the stretch and flattened out. ANILEATE , always well off the inner rail, had a mild move to mid stretch and failed to sustain the bid.
TORRE BRANCA saved ground on the turn, angled out, worked between horses and had a mild gain. CLASSIC LYNNE , no factor, raced outside horses in
the stretch. LADRO DI FICHI , three wide on the turn, chased the pace to the eighth pole and gave way. TOSS A COIN was not a factor. LUNAR ICE , four
wide on the turn, gave way. NIBBLES showed speed along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
THE CAIRO KID tracked the leader two to three wide, was under coaxing past the five sixteenths, ranged up outside to collar entering the lane, wrested
command near mid stretch then steadily drew out under a drive. PIT STOP MAN was sent clear early on, set the pace two wide into the lane, dug in when
confronted soon after, battled past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly while remaining clear of the rest. TOP BOSS rode the inside while under asking
past the five sixteenths, remained inside through the lane and churned on to grab the show on the final jumps. NOT A TRICK , three to four wide pursuing
the pace, kept on with some effort. INSIDE RISK , bumped at the break, lost ground four to five wide and offered a mild kick. E J'S REVENGE lagged back
early, swung seven wide for the drive and had a belated response. BOONDOGGLE chased two wide into the lane and faded in the final furlong. SPOTTED
BULL was steadied in close quarters in the opening furlong, angled five to six wide and lacked a solid bid. GREAT GO GO , bumped at the break, failed to
keep pace. PRESSING CONCERN saved ground past the half mile marker and was outrun. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
I'M GITTIN THERE saved ground around the turn chasing the pace, moved up along the inner rail to reach a striking position in mid stretch, lightly bumped
with FUHGEDDABOUDIT inside the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. FUHGEDDABOUDIT circled the turn three wide chasing the pace, was floated
out by ROCK ROSE in upper stretch, gained a short lead in mid stretch and just missed after drifting in and lightly bumping with the winner. SKIPPER SUE
lacked speed, raced in the two path around the turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch, angled back to the inside in mid stretch and passed tired
horses. GOLDEN EFFECT , steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, raced two wide on the turn, swung widest in upper stretch,
bid for the lead in mid stretch and weakened late. PROPER STORM hesitated leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail throughout and was not a
factor. ROCK ROSE set the pace in the two path around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. VOLNAY , kept wide on the turn, weakened.

Footnotes
PLANE DRUNK chased outside a rival, dropped back a bit mid turn, circled four wide gathering steam into the lane, sustained under strong handling to take
over near the sixteenth pole, shifted in some and held firm. BOURBON WILDCAT prompted the pace while saving ground, got through towards the rail
leaving mid stretch and finished gamely. SWEET GRACIE , under rating and to the inside of a rival early on, eased out leaving the far turn, edged up
between rivals into the stretch, was put in a tight spot and had to steady, shifted in and churned on. STAND BY YOU lagged well back into the turn, swung
six wide for the drive and had belated action. BANDITS WARRIOR , urged to the front, set the pace just off the inside, dug in when confronted near the
quarter pole, responded to firm asking and cleared past the three sixteenths, failed to contain challenges near the sixteenth pole and weakened. ICY
STARE DOWN angled out early and edged up to prompt the pace, bid three wide outside the leader near the quarter pole, failed to kick on in mid stretch
and weakened.

TAP N GLO stalked the duel down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the turn, swept to command approaching the stretch, drew off and was under
brisk urging in the drive. M'LADY THATCHER , three deep around the turn, gained the place. SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved ground on the turn, swung out
in upper stretch and passed tired horses. JUST ONCE MORE broke awkwardly, trailed to the stretch, swung five wide entering the lane and passed tired
foes. SIZZLING HOT disputed the early pace two wide, remained prominent to upper stretch and weakened. LADY GANGSTER was not a factor. MAKO
MISS hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid turn and tired.
