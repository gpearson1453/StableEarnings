Footnotes
PSEUDOSCIENCE set the pace along the inside around the first turn, but was headed by an outer bidding foe with five furlongs to go, vied until failing to
keep pace entering the far turn, yet stalked from the pocket around that bend, searched for racing room while sustaining stride in upper stretch, mounted a
rail re-challenge in the final furlong as the leaders tired, and forged an advantage late. DEBS PRAYER pressed two wide, led down the backstretch, showed
the way from an outer bidder around the far turn while remaining a bit off of the rail, clung to a margin in upper stretch, dug in between horses in the final
furlong, but was bested by an inner bidder late. GUANAJUATO broke a bit awkwardly, tracked two wide under a tight rein around the first turn, pursued from
between horses around the far turn before tipping four wide entering the lane, and offered a mild kick to attempt a bid leaving the furlong grounds, but was
outfinished by an inner rival late while being denied place. MYLIES STAR bobbled leaving the gates, leaned outwardly while recovering causing tight
quarters for an outer rival, checked once in tight quarters himself inside of a rival entering the first turn, tugged to a tracking position around that bend, but
was shuffled back entering the far turn, shifted three wide turning for home, fanned six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. T J'S FIRST checked from
crowded quarters between horses at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out four wide nearing the backstretch, inched closer outside of
foes approaching the far turn, but failed to threaten before tiring entering the lane. COME WHAT MAE broke out, stalked three wide, bid into the far turn,
vied between horses while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, but weakened leaving the furlong grounds. ZEEROCK trailed along the inside, then two
wide into the far turn, got floated seven wide entering the lane, and failed to factor.

KEYS INCLUDED stalked outside of the pace setter, assumed command in the three path turning for home, and drew off under mild urging.
RONITHELIMODRIVER took a brush from an outer rival leaving the gates, trailed, pursued from the five path around the far turn, then stayed on outside of
rivals to claim place late. MOSH PIT laid off of the pace in the four path, moved two wide and between horses down the backstretch, chased the top pair
around the far turn, stayed on to bid for place along with an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, but got outfinished. IRONMAN RICHIE ducked in slightly
while establishing a clear margin early on, required right handed correction from the rider to keep from acting up again nearing the backstretch, shifted out a
bit while showing a way at the nine sixteenths, then offered little resistance to an outer rival's bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, and weakened.
EXCLAIM brushed an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to five paths around the first turn, chased four wide around the far turn, then
lacked a rally between horses. COSTELLO'S KITTEN tracked three wide, lost position entering the backstretch, regained stride when roused between
horses at the half mile pole, but only managed to chase the top pair around the far turn before weakening. OGRE'S LION KING tracked along the inside,
chased around the far turn, and faded.

Footnotes
MR ELVIN tracked along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch, chased two wide coming to midstretch, sustained a bid inside of the leader in the final
furlong, and forged an advantage late. HALF MAGIC prompted the pace two wide, vied into the turn, drew clear leaving the five sixteenths pole, held sway
in the three path through midstretch, but tired late as an inner foe bid, and was bested by that rival before saving place from a pair of outer challengers.
RISKTAKER tracked five to four wide into the turn, rallied between horses while being floated back five wide in midstretch, stayed on to produce a late bid,
but ran out of ground. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS bobbled at the start and propped recovering, inched closer two wide and between horses to a tracking
position at the nine sixteenths pole, tipped four wide to take aim outside of the clear leader, but lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead through
midstretch, changed over at the sixteenth pole, sustained a mild bid along with an outer foe late, but did not have enough while getting outfinished for show.
BIG ACE chased three wide, yielded in the five path entering the lane, and gave way. CHROMPTON chased four wide and between horses, but backed out
to trail three wide at the three furlong pole, and was outrun from there. CIGAR VAN set the pace inside of a vying rival, but proved no match turning for
home, weakened, and was protected while eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
LADY AVE set the pace in the two path, vied with an outer rival around the turn, then drew off entering the lane, and widened under no urging. GALAXY
THIRTYSIX laid off of the pace in the four path and outside of rivals, then stayed on to claim place at the sixteenth pole. OURPERFECTPRINCESS stalked
along the inside, gained place in upper stretch, but was outkicked for that position entering the final sixteenth. BROKE FINANCING tracked in the three path
and between horses, but failed to menace. CAVE CREEK steadied after an awkward beginning, tugged forward outside of rivals to prompt the pace outside
of the leader after a quarter mile, vied in the three path around the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
PESO IN MY POCKET bumped an inner rival soon after the start, dueled for the lead inside of a foe, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch, and drove
clear leaving the furlong pole. PLANTERS PUNCH dueled for the lead two wide, led around the turn, but was headed by his inner counterpart in upper
stretch, gave way through the final furlong, and narrowly saved place. KING TUFF broke a step slowly before being pinched back among rivals at the start,
raced far back three wide, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and rallied to miss reaching place at the wire. HOLY CITY popped open the gate
pre-race without leaving it, then was bumped between horses and squeezed back shortly after the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, stayed on mildly
to bid for show in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked late. SPECIAL OPERATOR stalked the embattled leading pair from the inside, but lacked a bid
before fading. DIALED A DAME broke a step slowly, then was herded into an outer rival shortly after, raced at the rear two wide, and never got involved.
MASQUERADE BALL broke outwardly, lacked speed along the inside despite rider's urging, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TWIRLING CAT tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, but failed to change leads and was green to take aim entering
the final furlong, yet sustained a grinding charge to range up to the leader in the closing stages, and narrowly prevailed. PURSUIT L'HARMONIE vied for the
lead inside of a rival, dueled gamely through upper stretch, inched free entering the final sixteenth, but was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. SIKARA
SIKARA vied for the lead two wide, dueled through upper stretch, but yielded between horses at the sixteenth pole. SMART IZZY broke a step slowly,
tugged while keen behind rivals early on, settled off of the pace two wide, saved ground around the far turn, rallied along the rail in upper stretch, but
searched for racing room behind the top pair leaving the furlong grounds, committed to a rail charge soon after, but leveled off. MIDNIGHT FLAME tracked
while tucking from the six path to the three path around the first turn, then shifted out five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. CALLING stalked three
wide, but was floated out in upper stretch, and yielded at the furlong grounds. ENTITLEMENT raced toward the rear in the three to four paths, and made
little impact. CAT B CAUSE raced far back along the inside, failed to respond to urging down the backstretch, and was eased around the far turn, then
walked off.

Footnotes
STROBE rushed forward to vie for the lead two wide approaching the half mile pole, inched clear of his inner counterpart leaving the three furlong pole, then
was set down to widen at the three sixteenths, and ridden out under mild urging. THERIDEOFALIFETIME chased from behind the leaders and in the two
path, shifted outside of them to be three wide and between horses at the five sixteenths pole, took aim on the clearing leader entering the lane, but failed to
keep pace in upper stretch, and held place thereafter. TULANE TRYST broke slowly, lacked speed in the two path, split rivals two wide entering the lane,
bid for place inside of THERIDEOFALIFETIME in upper stretch, but was fended off through the final furlong. LONG WEEKEND chased three wide, floated
four wide at the five sixteenths pole, then kept on through the lane, but failed to menace. READY TO POUNCE trailed in the three path, and made little
impact. HIGH CRUISE showed the way along the inside early on, but was headed by the eventual winner leaving the half mile pole, proved no match
passing the three furlong pole, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
JIG TIME BANDIT laid off of the pace in the four to three paths, swung to the seven path while progressing entering the lane, and drove clear of inner foes
in upper stretch. EASY ACES bumped with an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, gained two wide into and around the far turn,
split the leaders at the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in the process, and kept on to prove second best. ZIPPING MOLLY tracked from
the three path, chased the leading trio from the four path around the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival while being floated to the eight path
entering the lane, and kept on mildly. ONE MO TO GO pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, led in the three path before meeting an outer challenge
turning for home, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. TAZZHER raced far back two wide, trailed around the far turn, then moved up between
horses late. RE RE'S RAINBOW set the pace along the inside, but weakened to a pair of outer rivals at the five sixteenths pole. ONECALLTHATSALL
settled along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally behind traffic. HOT PATOOTIE bumped with an inner foe at the start,
stalked behind the top pair, shifted out to press them from the four path around the far turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane, and lugged
outwardly in the final furlong. BAD GAL RIRI trailed three wide early on, then took the far turn in the five path, and got outrun.
