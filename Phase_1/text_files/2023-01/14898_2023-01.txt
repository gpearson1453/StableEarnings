MAJOR CAM hustled to a clear advantage, controlled the fractions then edged away through the stretch drifting out under steady handling. MY BOY
COLTON bid inside after half a mile, pursued the winner on the final turn then flattened out in the lane. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX settled off the leaders outside
early, moved inside on the final turn then went evenly. PRINCIPE trailed for half a mile, remained inside and just missed the show. JUNGLHERLY LOVE
raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter early then faded on the final turn. CONSTITUTIONAL BID stumbled at the start, raced three wide and gave way.
SETTE STELLE lacked speed and raced far behind throughout.

LARGE was in tight on the rail and steadied nearing the clubhouse turn, then tracked close up on the inside, bid between rivals at the seven sixteenths
marker, took over, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch and came up second best. HE'SSOSUBTLE set the pace on the
inside, dueled on the backside, chased inside on the far turn, weakened and held on for third. ANTE UP ALEX stalked the pace, chased outside on the far
turn and finished evenly in the lane. INSTANT CHAOS raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and had no rally. COMMISSIONER DAVE
was outrun early and did not factor. NIANGUA raced two wide off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn and gave way. TRUE DAKOTAN was outrun.

DANGNABBIT reserved close up inside, angled out on the turn then wore down the pacesetter nearing the finish. VERO SUN set the pace inside, moved
clear on the turn, led to the final yards but was nailed. PELOTA raced close up three wide, loomed a threat in the stretch but flattened out. DON'T RECALL
trailed for half a mile, moved inside and narrowed the gap while no threat. I SAW IT ALL forced the pace along the rail then began fading midway on the
turn. CAPE HEDGE lacked speed, raced very wide on the turn and was no factor. FIRE'S FINALE chased wide off the leaders and weakened steadily.
PANADERO dropped back outside and gave way readily.
