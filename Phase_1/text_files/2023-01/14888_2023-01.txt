Footnotes
MY SWEET MARY bumped with inside rival at the start, tracked leader off the rail on the backstretch, asked mid turn to not let leader spurt away, took aim
in upper stretch, responded to urging and drove past under a drive. GLITTER LAKE bumped with outside rival at the start, tracked leader along the inside on
the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, lacked a clear path and altered out passing the sixteenth, responded well and got up for second.
NAOMI FRALEY broke a bit slow and bumped by outside rival at the start, showed good speed and quickly cleared on the backstretch, extended lead on
the turn and looked prime for a win in upper stretch, began to shorten stride mid-stretch and tired late and lost second at wire. DORITA'S LEMON bumped
into rival at the start, stalked pace in between rivals on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and lacked needed response in the lane to improve.
JOE'S PASSION came in and bumped rivals at the start, settled for a stalking three wide position on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and
came up empty in the lane.
