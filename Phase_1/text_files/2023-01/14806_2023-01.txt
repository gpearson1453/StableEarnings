Footnotes
CLEVELAND ROCKS stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane.
SPEIGHTFUL SIS bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around
the bend and could not go with the winner in the stretch but chased that rival home. GET EVEN tracked the leaders between horses through the opening
quarter, raced in the two path around the turn and kept on to the finish while proving to be no match for the winner. CALLE DE BOYD raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. PEINADITO chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the
two path around the bend and faded in the lane. AGENT MULGANNON trailed the field on the outside through the opening stages, came around the turn in
the four path and never threatened. DORSODURO bumped with the horse to his inside at the start of the race, settled at the back of the pack in the early
going, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. DOC CARSON raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
three path and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
WAR CROSS raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around
the far turn and dueled down the lane to get up for the win late. SHIMMERING LIGHT bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to
lead the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the rail around the second bend and dueled
in the stretch, drifting out and getting caught near the wire. NIP OF BOURBON raced in the middle of the pack on the inside for the opening half mile,
navigated the far turn from the two path and chased the top two home in the stretch. FELIX THE FOX raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked
the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the far bend and weakened in the final furlong. MACHO REAL
hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path early, settled at the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground
around the second turn, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out from there. MISTA DONZELLA raced in the four path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn still in the four path and never fired. MAPACHE G bobbled
slightly and bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around
the far turn and made no bid.

CAIRO WINNER saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn from the three path and
never threatened. LADY KITTY raced in the four path around the first bend, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to
save ground around the second turn and made no bid. CAYMAN QUEEN raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and faded in the lane.

RUN CORY RUN hopped up leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path
approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear in the lane and held off a late closer at the wire. SUMMER CAUSE raced in the three path around the first bend,
settled well off the pace in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid in upper stretch and
gained ground to the wire, narrowly missing. RINGSIDE dueled on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the rail
around the far turn, was caught in midstretch and kept on to the finish. PROVE WORTHY raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second bend, and improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening. SUERTE veered out leaving the gate,
recovered to duel from the three path through the opening half mile, continued to battle from the two path around the second turn and weakened in the final
furlong. FIRE BARON saved ground early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far turn in the three path and made no
bid. ANTONOV raced off the pace on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the second bend still in the two path and was
empty from there.
