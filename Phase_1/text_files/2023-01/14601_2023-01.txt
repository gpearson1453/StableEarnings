Footnotes
MINISTER OF SOUL followed the early pace, made a strong six wide middle move through the turn, was gaining through the stretch, took control late and
surged clear for the win. GOOD BYE CHARLIE pressed the early pace, went five wide into the turn, took control in early stretch, opened up, couldn't hold off
the winner and finished second best. NO PASA NADA was taken back early, raced between rivals into the turn, angled in and was along for third.
COMPETITIVE IDEA was void of any early speed from the inside and finished belatedly. SWEET RIVER BAINES was unhurried early, went eight wide into
the turn and offered no late rally. IZE A CRAFTY GAL chased the early pace, raced along the inside, drifted out mid stretch and tired. MIDNIGHT SPLIT was
taken back early, angled out nine wide and never fired. MONTEREY SECRET raced in mid pack early from between rivals and tired. DANZ AT COLFAX set
a pressured pace angled in and faded.

Footnotes

hopped at the start, was rushed to force the pace from the inside, was no match late and finished second best. TATAS JOE MARK was reserved early,
raced seven wide through the turn and was along for third. READS CODIGO set a pressured early pace, went five wide into the turn and weakened. SNOW
MARK chased the early pace from between rivals, drifted out and faded. THE FINAL FOOTNOTE raced in mid pack from the inside and tired. KING BRYCE
was squeezed at the start and was no factor. SHAME ON ZCUINTLE was always outrun.
