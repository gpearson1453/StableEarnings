Footnotes
IRISH CORN away in good order, sped to a clear lead in the early stages, well rated to the quarter marker, quickened in upper stretch and pulled away
while in hand in the final furlong. COBRE chased the early pace from the inside, could not match strides with IRISH CORN in the stretch run, battled with
GONNA GETCHA GOOD in deep stretch and outfinished that rival for place. GONNA GETCHA GOOD chased the early pace, came within aim of IRISH
CORN nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace with his stablemate in the drive, battled with COBRE in deep stretch for place and was edged for
that spot in the final strides, while well clear for show. SNAKE ISLAND was away a bit slowly, lacked early speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PERSUASIVE LIPS broke alertly, took back and ceded the early lead, attended to the moderate pace to the quarter marker, overtook STATEFOREST
leaving the second turn, drew clear in mid-stretch, pulled away under steady urging in the final furlong and was geared down late. KITTYHAWK LASS
tracked the moderate pace from a ground saving position, could not keep pace with PERSUASIVE LIPS in the final furlong and stayed on in deep stretch to
be best of the rest. MISTY CAT allowed to settle while well positioned in the early going, raced while on a hold into the second turn, was outrun in upper
stretch, lacked a late response in the drive but stayed on in the final strides to secure third. STATEFOREST sent to the early lead, set modest fractions
while prompted through the backstretch run, held PERSUASIVE LIPS at bay to the top of the lane, lost the lead to that rival in upper stretch and weakened
in the drive.

Footnotes
HOT RAGEOUS broke alertly then took back to track the fast early pace, chased LOTSA PEPPER to mid-stretch, closed the gap on that rival inside of the
sixteenth-marker and made a late surge in the end to prevail. CANAM GAL unhurried in the early going, swung widest leaving the turn, closed with a rush in
deep stretch, could not reel in HOT RAGEOUS in the final stages but was up in time for the place. LOTSA PEPPER engaged with LAGATHA in the early
stages and dueled for pace duties to the turn, carved out fast fractions to the quarter marker, shook free nearing the top of the lane, drew to a clear lead in
mid-stretch, could not hold off the oncoming top pair in the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for show. TIP TOP GAL took back off of the fast early
pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped three wide for the drive, made a steady bid in the lane but lacked the needed late response. LAGATHA
hustled leaving the break and dueled with LOTSA PEPPER through quick early fractions, could not keep pace with that rival nearing the top of the stretch
and tired in the drive. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
BERNIE'S BIG BOY rated off of the moderate early pace, saved ground through the turn, swung widest for the drive, closed determinedly inside of the
furlong marker, reeled in KNOCKOUT BERT in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. KNOCKOUT BERT lunged at the start and spotted the
field in the early stages, rallied four deep nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead in mid-stretch, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker, was all
out in deep stretch and was tagged in the final strides for the win, while holding for place. RHODIUM RUNNER showed early speed, pressed the pace
between horses to the turn, dueled with ZERO BUCKS GIVEN to the quarter marker while carving moderate fractions, battled with KNOCKOUT BERT to
mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the late stages and held safely for show. THAT'S BIND BABE bumped with GREGS CITY ZIP at the start, tracked the
moderate pace from a two wide path to the quarter marker, chased to mid-stretch and lacked the needed late response. BROKEN FINGER chased the early
pace, took up off of heels entering the turn, trailed into the stretch run and offered mild late rally. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN broke alertly and contested the early
pace while inside of rivals, dueled with RHODIUM RUNNER while carving moderate fractions through the turn, battled to mid-stretch and gave way in the
final furlong. GREGS CITY ZIP bumped with THAT'S BIND BABE at the start, recovered and contested the early pace while outside of rivals, pressed the
pace to the quarter marker and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
TALBOT BAY forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the solid pace to the quarter marker, overtook the pacesetter and assumed command in upper
stretch, was set down for the drive and kicked clear under moderate urging in the late stages. LEMON DROP SHOT hopped leaving the start and was away
a step slowly, tracked the solid early pace from the rail, advanced while in tight nearing the top of the stretch, found room nearing the furlong pole, could not
make headway on the winner in the late stages and kept on to be second best in the end. CARDIFF CRACK allowed to settle in the early going, saved
ground to the top of the lane, angled out in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and held safely for show. SIXTYFOUR G T O chased the solid early
pace, raced three wide on the turn, gained ground approaching the top of the stretch, could not sustain that run in the final furlong and weakened. POLLO
D'ORO showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the
drive. KID STOLE A KISS unhurried in the early stages, trailed to the quarter marker and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages, roused four wide nearing the quarter
marker, closed well in mid-stretch, came within aim of IMPLICITLY in deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. IMPLICITLY allowed to
settle in the early stages, advanced on the second turn, came in tight and was boxed in approaching the top of the lane, found room along the rail in
mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the sixteenth-marker and was nailed in the final strides for the win, while besting the rest. DI LAURIAN hustled to
establish the early lead, set prompted fractions to the second turn, was headed by MY SUNSHINE nearing the quarter marker, came again and led to the
furlong grounds, weakened in the final sixteenth and held well in the end for show. MY SUNSHINE forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the
moderate pace to the second turn, took a narrow lead nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER away in good order, drifted out into the three or four path along the first turn, stalked the moderate pace to the second turn,
advanced nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. AWE broke through the gate prior to the start, settled in the
second flight in the early going, well placed to the second turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and faded in the stretch run. ORCZY (IRE) unhurried
in the early stages, lost contact on the second turn and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
REV REE threw her head at the break and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced on the far turn, mounted a four wide
rally into the drive, closed well nearing the furlong marker, raced on the left lead while battling to the sixteenth-marker and made a late surge in the final
strides to prevail. SHEZAGHOST broke alertly and dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted by
GHOSTLY GAL nearing the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, engaged with REV REE in deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final
strides, while just holding for second. GHOSTLY GAL forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the decent fractions to the half-mile marker, confronted
SHEZAGHOST nearing the quarter pole, battled with that rival to the furlong pole, felt pressure late from REV REE and grudgingly gave way in the final
strides, while just missing for place and holding safely for show. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE unhurried in the early going, trailed to the quarter marker, roused
in upper stretch, angled out inside of the furlong pole, closed willingly in the final sixteenth but could not impact the leaders in the end. UNDISTURBED
settled off of the early pace, was well positioned through the backstretch run, came within range along the second turn and did not offer a late rally in the
drive. LA VIKINA promient into the first turn, tracked the decent pace from an inside path through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and weakened in the late stages. MADEIRA WINE a bit slow into stride early on, was keen along the first turn and pulled to be close to
the pace entering the backstretch run, settled and advanced while three wide on the far turn, could not keep pace leaving the quarter marker and tired in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
BIG CITY BANE raced mid-pack under a light hold to the far turn, had to steady a bit near the seven-sixteenths pole and fell back to last, circled the field
from there emerging in the stretch six wide, launched a furious rally to get up in time. WALKING BOSS broke in and brushed with ECOLOGIST leaving the
start, lagged behind the field, made a bold move on the turn four wide from the three-eighths pole, hit the top of the stretch racing on the wrong lead, quickly
straightened out and continued to rally down the stretch, got the best of BRONZE WARRIOR within sight of the finish line but was tagged in the last jump.
BRONZE WARRIOR broke well and easily made first run into the clubhouse turn, made the running setting comfortable fractions, still had something left
turning for home and finished well, getting outrun in the last sixteenth. DEALERS HAND broke in and brushed with ECOLOGIST, spotting the field a head
start, lacked early speed early on and stayed towards the inside, moved closer approaching the far turn, lacked room through the turn, swung four wide into
the stretch and finished with some interest but was outfinished in the late stages. SYNC gained the rail while settling behind the early leaders, moved closer
down the backstretch, loomed a threat as the field turned for the stretch run and finished evenly but could not find another gear when needed. ECOLOGIST
tracked well behind the early leaders through the early stages, was asked to pick up the pace with three furlongs to run, steadied hard when WALKING
BOSS crowded him just past the quarter pole and was unable to recover. JEDI KNIGHT hustled from the gate, stalked the pace setting BRONZE WARRIOR
to the far turn, moved to challenge approaching the quarter pole but hand nothing left for the stretch run and tired.
