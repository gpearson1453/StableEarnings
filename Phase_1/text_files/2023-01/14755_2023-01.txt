Footnotes
DISCOVERY N SIGHT tracked the early pace, angled out seven wide through the turn, was gaining, took control late and surged clear. DANJERUS
STORM was reserved early, went six wide through the turn, took control at the quarter pole, opened up, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second
best. WEALTH N HEALTH was void of any early speed, advanced eight wide through the turn and offered a mild late rally. B R KIDD ROCK was allowed to
settle early from off the rail and offered no late rally. TIZ'A STELLAR DUDE set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn and weakened.
SMOOTH WATERS pressed the early pace, went five wide into the turn and tired. DIAMOND MINE was taken back and was no factor. ALL YOUR JAZZ
was outrun early and was no threat.
