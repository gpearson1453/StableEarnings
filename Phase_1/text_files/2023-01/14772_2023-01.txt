Footnotes
SWING STATE allowed to settle, closed rapidly three wide into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker and drew off to win as much the best.
HARSH TRUTH slow early, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack through the stretch while closing determinedly and got up for second. LOTSA MATCHA
also slow early, found his best stride through deep stretch while also drifting out to the middle of the racetrack. CONSTITUTION COAL rushed to be
forwardly placed, improved position on the turn then came up empty. RAY'S EMPIRE failed to menace. BAD BOY BOOGIE sprinted to a daylight lead soon
after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then stopped abruptly. COUNCIL OF FOUR chased the pace into the turn, drifted out in the stretch and
also stopped. TIER ONE lost his jockey near the five furlong marker due to him losing his left iron. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.

LOVELY LISA away alertly, set a pressured pace through the turn then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while being ridden out.
FRACING NASTY pressured the winner into the stretch then was no match but held on for second. LOVE'S TAVITO never far back, finished with good
courage four wide. ALSANAH trailed early then closed a gap late two wide. WILDCAT DREAM unhurried early, improved position in the five path into the
stretch then failed to sustain that bid. MY DANCING QUEEN vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch and faded late. SCARRAZANO had good
early speed then faded. AYY LADIES moved up three wide on the turn then came up empty. LELAWALA had brief speed.

SOMUCHSUGAR pressed the pace along the inside, matched strides the length of the stretch and proved best by a narrow margin in a game effort. THE
DEVIL'S DREAM away alertly, set a pressured pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly but couldn't handle the winner. CAUSE OF LOVE vied for the lead
into the stretch then faded. NICEASAKITTENSEYES had brief speed. I GOT HOPE drifted out at the start and trailed.

Footnotes
OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY never far back, rallied three then two wide between horses under left handed urging and was along in time. FLYING BUSINESS
stalked the pace along the inside, surged late along the rail but finished second best. CHARGAREE close up from the start, finished determinedly five wide.
ROSE RING unhurried early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. PAO DE QUEIJO stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three
wide to make the lead in upper stretch then was outfinished. LEADING INDICATOR trailed into the stretch and found her best stride late along the inside.
ROMANTIC JEWEL pressed the pace along the inside then two wide into the stretch, was in tight between rivals at the furlong marker, checked, angled out
to the five path and lost momentum. CATLIKE had brief speed. LIL' SISTER LOU broke in front, set a pressured pace two wide into the tune then was used
up.
