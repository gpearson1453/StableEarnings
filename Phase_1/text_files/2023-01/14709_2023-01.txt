UNION FLEET , urged soon after the gate and taken wide, edged up nearing the turn and tracked a contested pace, moved closer past the five sixteenths
then bid four wide outside runners entering the lane, took control leaving the three sixteenths, opened up under right handed asking then was geared down
the through the final seventy yards. HIGHLAND DREAM stalked the leaders three wide, bid between foes to challenge entering the stretch, failed to kick on
with the winner to his outside but continued on willingly for the place. CENTER MID MADDIE sped clear early while two wide, was joined from the inside
nearing the half mile marker, dueled around the turn, maintained a tenuous advantage heading to the stretch, could not hold off threats soon into the lane,
stayed on past mid stretch then faded. YOUNG TURK drifted in at the break, was corrected and taken to rate a bit, moved up to the inside of the leader
heading to the half mile pole, vied under coaxing around the turn, failed to stay on entering the lane and gave way. FORTH reared at the break losing all
chance, found himself far back and simply galloped around. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of FORTH but no action was deemed necessary.

GREAT GO GO broke sharply and cleared early, set a rated pace about two wide, staved off outside pressure from JIMMY THE KID, responded when
shaken up entering the lane, spurted clear past the three sixteenths, continued on under strong handling and held firm to fend off DIALING DIXIE. DIALING
DIXIE , off slowly when lunging at the break, regrouped and was nudged up to contention while three to four wide, stalked the embattled leaders past the
five sixteenths, moved with aim leaving mid stretch and kept on gamely. JIMMY THE KID prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, moved to apply
more heat leaving the far turn, failed to match strides soon into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. STAR LUCK , towards the inside chasing
the pace, faded in the final furlong. CONFUSION BABY BOY , two wide and off the pace, angled four wide for the drive but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CALL ME MAESTRO prompted the pace outside STAR SHOPPING, took command leaving the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and prevailed under
steady handling. HAMPDEN LANE , in hand along the inner rail stalking the pace, eased off the rail leaving the turn, floated five wide at the head of the lane
and rallied. STAR SHOPPING bore out leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and gradually weakened in the
stretch run. DR RAGS circled the turn three wide, moved to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired foes late. WINSTON'S GOLD , four wide on the
turn, raced between horses in the stretch and flattened out. JEBSTER , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, was fanned to the six path in upper
stretch and tired. TENAX lacked speed, swung to the seven path in mid stretch and was not a factor. PRESSING CONCERN raced in the two path on the
turn and weakened. NOTION TO TAPIT was outrun.

Footnotes
DEEDS OF LOVE edged up to the inside of rivals early on and contested the pace, was deftly rated back off the leaders into the turn, was coaxed along to
hold a forward spot along the rail past the five sixteenths, eased out in upper stretch, closed between runners to take command inside the sixteenth pole
and drew clear under a drive. MARIA FROM MIAMI rated forwardly behind foes, was guided three wide past the three eighths, angled four wide into the
lane, ranged up to threaten outside foes past the sixteenth pole, failed to match strides with the winner but kept on willingly. MAMA'S EYES , three deep and
with the pace nearing the half mile pole, prompted outside SIX THE HARD WAY mid turn, was roused clear in upper stretch, shifted in a bit, failed to contain
rivals past the sixteenth marker and weakened. SIX THE HARD WAY , fractious in the post parade, was sent up early and put a head in front between
rivals, emerged in a battle to the inside of MAMA'S EYES leaving the far turn, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded. GOLDIENESS dropped off the
early pace, came wide for the drive and lacked a solid run. SOLVING PROGRESS dropped back off the early pace while saving ground, shifted out past the
three sixteenths and offered a belated response. ELLIE VICTORINA broke slowly, saved ground under asking into the stretch but came up empty. CALM N
COLLECTED drafted back off the leaders in the opening furlong then failed to generate a run.

Footnotes
SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE stalked the pace racing near the inner rail, moved to the two path leaving the far turn, gained the lead outside MIT MAZEL in mid
stretch then drew off. MIT MAZEL , four deep rushing to the lead entering the first turn, moved to the inner rail leaving the turn, saved ground the far turn,
continued willingly in the drive but was no match for the winner. GAMESTONKS lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses on the far turn,
remained in that lane and passed faders. SHE IS WISKY , along the inner rail throughout, was never a factor. STARTWITHABANG moved up three wide
entering the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and gave way in mid stretch. THAT'S SOME KISS , rated in the two path down the backstretch, was
well placed three wide entering the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. DAILY PLANET , three wide both turns, weakened and was eased
late.

Footnotes
PHAROAHS BABY GYAL pulled her way clear leaving the chute, set a rated pace off the inside, responded when put to left handed asking in upper stretch,
eagerly opened up in mid stretch, was kept to solid asking to the sixteenth pole then cruised home the final seventy yards. COAL MINE , three deep nearing
the five eighths, stalked the winner around the turn, gave futile chase in mid stretch, faded and just held the place. CATS INTHE TIMBER , well back leaving
the far turn, angled four wide under a ride into the lane, straightened and found her best too late. CLASSY NANCY , taken to rate off the winner, eased back
while saving ground into the turn, remained inside but lacked the needed finish. ANGEL ART bobbled slightly at the break, edged up between runners early
on, shifted out to chase nearing the three eighths, remained a presence to the head of the lane then faltered.

Footnotes
CONDUCTANCE , two wide on the turn, chased the pace, bid for the lead outside SAPPHIRE BEAUTY in upper stretch, lightly brushed two times with that
rival in the stretch and determinedly prevailed. TIPSY TOURIST saved ground around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. SAPPHIRE
BEAUTY sped to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, drifted out a bit entering the stretch, lightly brushed with the winner while battling with that one
through the stretch and finished willingly. COFFEE BEAN lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn and failed to rally. KERFORD'S COMMISH ,
never a factor, raced in the two path on the turn. UNBRIDLED IRISH , three wide on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. BIZZY BIZZY
trailed and floated to the six path entering the stretch.
