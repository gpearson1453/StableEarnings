Footnotes
THIRSTY PAPPY rated on the inside stalking the pace, saved ground through the far turn, angled out widest in the drive, rallied and got up in the final
strides. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY bumped with inner rival early, settled three wide, bid four deep on the far turn and led exiting the turn, lost command in
upper stretch, stayed on gamely through the lane but was outfinished by the winner. WORKDAY sped clear and crossed over, set the pace under pressured
in the middle stages, vied with a trio of rivals on the far turn, lost command leaving the turn, regained command in upper stretch, inched ahead in the furlong
ground and got overtaken by the top pair in the final moments. STAR PROSPECT got put in tight, bumped, then pulled and became a bit rank, chased three
wide, mid-pack up the backstretch, bid three deep on the far turn and got outkicked in the late stages. HONDO CROUCH bumped early then steadied briefly
and began to pull, went up to press between then outside the pacesetter, challenged between rivals on the far turn, fought through the lane but got
outkicked in the final sixteenth. DO IT FOR DAVE got bumped and shuffled early, started to pull and steadied on the first turn, steadied at the three-eighths
pole, spun three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MICKEY GOLDMILL dropped back and trailed two wide into the first turn, raced three deep into the
second bend, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. BUCK OWENS bumped lightly with a rival and got put in tight quarters between foes
early, got blocked behind tiring rival and checked hard entering the far turn, moved to the inside and was not a factor. MY RANSOM raced up close three
deep early, started to weaken into the far turn, dropped back around the bend, tired in the lane, eased and walked off.

Footnotes
PARCO sped to the front and went two wide into the first turn then cleared and crossed over to the rail, set all the pace to the stretch and remained clear
under a drive. WORTHINESS tracked two then three wide early, saved ground on the inside around the far turn, steered off the fence in the drive and edged
MOONLITE IN HEAVEN for second. MOONLITE IN HEAVEN showed speed from inside then took hold to cede command to PARCO and switched outside
that rival, took aim two wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response and got nailed for the place honors. SUPERCENTS settled on the inside early,
tipped two wide on the far turn and could not rally in the drive. WHAT A WAY TO GO broke out a bit and was quickly corrected, went three wide into the first
turn then got floated out to the five path around the bend, continued off the rail, traveled three then four wide on the far turn and was not a factor.
MARGOT'S GIRL broke a step slow, was keen early in the two path and had to angle out four wide chasing the speed, rounded the far turn three wide and
weakened.

Footnotes
LIL NAS sped to the front in the two path then cleared inner rival and moved inside, showed the way along the rail through the far turn, urged right then left
handed in the drive and held safely. SO I'M TOLD got put in tight chasing between foes into the first turn, steadied behind FORGIVING SPIRIT around the
bend, stalked the pace from inside, tipped out in the lane, finished willingly but could not reach the winner. TALKLESSWORKMORE traveled in the two path
while racing a bit keen early, raced in range between rivals on the far turn, moved inside leaving that bend, summoned a mild rally and gained the show.
MISCHIEVOUS PATH broke well then quickly dropped back, trailed on the inside, swung out on the far turn and entered the lane four to five wide, bumped
with SHORTMAN near the sixteenth pole and improved position. SHORTMAN chased two then three wide on the first turn, raced three deep through the
second bend, bumped with MISCHIEVOUS PATH outside the sixteenth pole and could not rally. BEAUDACIOUS broke a step slow in the beginning, had to
check behind a rival on the first turn, chased three then four wide on the far turn and failed to menace. FORGIVING SPIRIT was a bit fractious in the gate,
prominent early along the rail then pulled and became a bit rank on the first turn, switched off the inside to give chase in the two path and weakened in the
stretch.

Footnotes
POST FACTO bumped twice in the beginning, vied three deep for command early, dueled outside TAKE CHARGE CURLY on the backstretch, cleared into
the far turn, led two wide through the bend, pressured by CLOONEY in the final sixteenth and held under left handed urging. CLOONEY was off slow and
lost his path, trailed on the inside into the first turn, came out into the backstretch, moved into range between foes, traveled four then three deep on the far
turn, closed in on POST FACTO and was bothered by that rival coming out a bit at the eighth pole, kept to task then lugged inward in deep stretch and was
held at bay. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY broke in and bumped rival, vied four deep into the first turn then dropped back a bit to stalk in the three path, had to
check between rivals past the seven-sixteenths pole, angled down to the rail and took aim at the winner but failed to find the needed late kick. TAKE
CHARGE CURLY vied between rivals into the first turn, dueled inside POST FACTO on the backstretch, chased that rival into the far turn, dropped back
around that bend and was able to churn on for a minor award. REEF CITY vied for the lead from inside then pressed the top pair to the nine-sixteenths pole,
chased those rivals leaving the backstretch, had to pause along the rail at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground around the far turn, moved out in the
lane and could not rally. MOON TIME broke a step slow on the outside, raced two wide near the back then came out leaving the first turn, went five then
four wide around the far turn and failed to menace. DEEP RIVER bumped with inner rival soon after the start, vied five deep into the first turn then dropped
back a bit to chase four wide leaving the bend, asked three then two wide on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ONCOMING unhurried early on while moving to the inside, tipped out leaving the first turn, moved into range nearing the far turn, roused three then two
wide around the bend, steered out in upper stretch, drew alongside the top pair and outdueled FLINT STROLL in the final sixteenth. FLINT STROLL settled
outside a rival, two then three wide on the first turn, had to check and tip out to the four path entering the far turn, moved in while launching a bid outside the
leader at the quarter pole, took over past the eighth pole, dueled with ONCOMING late and edged at the wire. ARREST sped to the front and set the pace
on the inside, pressured by outer rival then inched away on the backstretch, challenged by FLINT STROLL with a quarter mile remaining, resisted to the
eighth pole, then relinquished command and flattened to third. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH bumped lightly at the start, raced between then took back to
avoid a tight spot and angled to the inside, found traffic twice on the far turn, moved inward then back out into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and
rounded out the superfecta. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) pressed from outside early then moved back to a stalking off the pace, took closer order up the
backstretch and had to pause behind the leader into the far turn, continued to lack room and had to wait around the bend, cut the corner into the stretch and
weakened in the stretch run. ALGERIA (IRE) bumped lightly with outer rival at the start, tracked the pace along the inside then moved to the two path, raced
between rivals on the backstretch, had to pause at the three-eighths pole, angled in leaving the turn and could not rally. OCULUS pressed the pace from
outside early on, chased the leader past the half-mile pole, checked between rivals on the far turn, came two wide into the lane and weakened. HOODLUM
was off slow to begin, trailed far back early on, angled four to five wide on the far turn and failed to menace. BEROLIJEAN (FR) raced outside a rival near
the back, trailed into the second bend, got boxed in briefly when finding traffic near the quarter pole, got crowded a bit in upper stretch and was not
persevered with.

ICE DANCING was allowed to settle in the early going, gained four deep on the turn then took aim three wide leaving the bend, drew alongside FAST AND
SHINY and took over past the eighth pole, then kicked clear and won going away. SATIN DOLL raced off the pace then moved into range up the
backstretch, chased along the rail through the turn, finished willingly along the fence and got up for the place honors. FAST AND SHINY dueled briefly with
PARODY then inched ahead and cleared past the half-mile pole, showed the way along the inside then two wide into the drive, relinquished the lead to ICE
DANCING past the eighth pole and was outfinished for second. PARODY got bumped from outside at the start, showed speed and dueled outside FAST
AND SHINY, chased that rival past the half-mile pole, lost positions between rivals around the turn and weakened in the lane. HUNTINGCOCO broke in and
bumped PARODY, stalked the top pair from outside, traveled three deep on the turn and weakened. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
THE WILD GRAZER (IRE) tracked two wide into the turn, angled out leaving the end and came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair in
midstretch, took over and drew clear late. FUN MONEY away quickly in the beginning, raced up close outside the leader into the turn, took over in the two
path around the bend, dueled three wide into the stretch, put away outer rival but was soon challenged from inside, relinquished the lead to EXCELIA (IRE)
and stayed on well to earn the place honors. EXCELIA (IRE) stalked on the inside then moved to the two path, steered back to the inside to launch a rail bid
at the top of the stretch, took over outside the eighth pole, lost command with a sixteenth remaining and lost the place. PRINCESS BETTINA reserved in the
early going on the inside, came two wide into the stretch, moved out and finished evenly late. HAPPY GAL broke a step slow, raced three deep at the back
into the turn, angled out and came six wide into the stretch, drifted inward in upper lane and lacked the needed response. ALWAYS AT EASE broke a bit
slow, traveled between rivals at the rear early, came four wide into the lane, altered in from behind rivals in upper stretch and could not rally. MISS
BELLIMBUSTO broke a step slow then went up outside the top pair, dueled four wide across the dirt, could not keep up at the top of the stretch and
weakened. JORDAN sped to the front, set the pace inside a rival into the turn, lost command around the bend and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
REINCARNATE dueled for the lead inside SPUN INTENDED, inched ahead at the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared briefly with a quarter mile remaining, met
the challenge from NEWGATE in upper stretch, dueled while holding a short lead through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. NEWGATE trailed early on
the inside, came out into the backstretch, chased two wide at the back on the far turn, tipped to the three path around bend, challenged REINCARNATE
from outside and dueled through the lane but lacked the needed late punch to overtake the winner. NATIONAL TREASURE stalked on the inside then
moved off the rail, came back to the inside on the far turn, bumped with rival past the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly for a
clear third. PACKS A WAHLOP stalked three to four wide through the turns, trailed into the stretch, was forced out by SPUN INTENDED in the stretch and
was not persevered with. SPUN INTENDED dueled for command outside a rival, kept the pressure on into the far turn, lost touch with the winner at the
quarter pole and bumped with NATIONAL TREASURE shortly after, was pulled up and guided out in upper stretch and walked into the van following the
race.

Footnotes
OPRY stalked the speed along the inside, angled out on the far turn and exited the bend four wide, closed in down the stretch and reeled in the leader to get
up at the wire. DEAN MARTINI sped clear and moved over to the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, took pressure from outside rivals on the far turn,
kicked clear once again into the lane and continued unchallenged entering the final sixteenth, then got run down by OPRY in the closing moments. AVENUE
broke a step slow, angled to the inside off the pace, saved ground to the stretch, remained inside and produced a mild rally to gain the show. SCRIPT
unhurried in the early going, traveled two wide then steered out and was roused on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, earned a minor award but
needed to find more late. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) settled outside a rival off the pace, moved out three deep on the backstretch, angled out and came
six wide into the stretch and lacked a late bid. HUDSON RIDGE raced up close outside the pacesetter early, applied some pressure between rivals on the
far turn, could not keep up with the winner into the stretch and weakened down the lane. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) trailed early racing outside a pair of rivals,
angled over to the rail on the clubhouse turn, swung five into the stretch and failed to menace. MECKLENBURG (IRE) stumbled badly leaving the gate,
pulled the rider along to rush up outside the top pair, went four wide around the clubhouse turn, continued three deep to the far turn, pressed three wide on
the second bend, lost contact and chased the winner into the lane and weakened.
