Footnotes
PHOEBE'S FROSTY went to the front, showed the way in the three path, responded well under heavy pressure in the stretch, shook off multiple foes into
the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. REUNION TOUR saved ground on the first turn, prompted the pace, dropped back some near the
eleven-sixteenths, was asked in the two path on the far turn, gained to make a bid inside of rivals in upper stretch, fought with the winner into the final
furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along
late on the backstretch, chased four wide for most of the far turn then shifted five wide, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, dropped back into
the final furlong and weakened but just held the show. YOUR MISSION bumped lightly with an opponent at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled
just off the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the four path around the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped
back into the final furlong and tired then just missed the show. UNCLE BRUCE broke out and bumped lightly with a foe, went three wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, traveled three wide around most of the far turn, shifted five wide late on that bend and
failed to threaten. TIZA BROWN was rated in the two path on the first turn, settled down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, had the rider lose his
crop inside the five-sixteenths and came up empty. BOINTHEBACK raced in the four path around the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, was
urged along near the nine-sixteenths, dropped back three wide on the far turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
MELTING SNOW hustled from the gate, advanced after the start to duel with NEW YORK BANKER from the two path, shook off that rival and widened
away through the turn, spun three wide for home set down for the drive, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the final sixteenth to the finish.
VEGAS WEEKEND six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
continued in the two path into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. PRAIRIE FIRE chased three
wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing half a mile from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for
the top one while keeping on well clear for the show honors. VIRADIA coaxed from the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. NEW YORK BANKER dueled early on and was shaken off into the turn, went three wide through the
bend and continued three wide for home, then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
GANDY DANCING bumped lightly with a foe just after the start then was in tight, moved up under urging, chased four wide around the turn, pursued the
runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging. MOTION TO STRIKE angled in while going to
the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path around the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, led under a drive
into the final sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. FIRST DEPUTY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up under some
urging, went four wide around the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. DOUBLE SHOT
was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, held a good striking range in upper stretch but also lacked the needed
kick. BUSTIN THE RULES dropped back early, raced inside to the two path around the turn and failed to threaten. ACALTEQUE was carried in early, raced
just off the pace, was taken under a tight hold while off heels at the half-mile pole, dropped back into the turn, went around that bend in the two path, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, moved out inside the furlong marker and weakened. MIAMI CHROME showed speed then chased the pace on the outside,
dropped back in the three path around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and tired. TRIGGER PULL was urged along on the far outside, went five wide on
the turn and was no factor.

break, chased just off the inside briefly before taking to the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened
in the late stages. METAMORPHOSES six paths off the inside early on, tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,

Footnotes
GASOLINE was sent hard from the gate, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead under urging at the five-sixteenths, fought back gamely to regain the
advantage inside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong urging. TONAL IMPACT bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, gained leaving the backstretch, made a bid in the three path under urging on the far turn, battled between foes in upper stretch,
brushed with a rival near the eighth-pole, rubbed saddles with that foe in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. ANEJO was asked leaving
the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, moved closer near the five-eighths, gained to make an outside bid in the four path around the far turn,
brushed with the runner-up near the eighth-pole, rubbed saddles with that foe while drifting in some and was outifinished but clear for the show. BOLD
VICTORY was hustled from the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, moved out then came under urging early on the backstretch, went four
wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. ROYAL TRYST went three to four wide on the turns and failed to threaten. VASARIANO broke out
and bumped with a foe, tracked the pace in the two path, chased around the far turn and tired. MIDNIGHT WORKER raced inside to the two path around
the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along the rail on the far turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
PIECE OF MY HEART tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, made an outside bid
outside the furlong marker, gained the advantage coming to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong handling. COREY pressed the pace on the
outside, vied in the three path around the turn, took the lead inside the three-eighths, spun four wide into the stretch, led under a drive to just before the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. THISTLEFIELD went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, was asked along
the rail on the turn, lost the lead inside the three-eighths, turned into the stretch in the two path, fought on under a drive into the final furlong then weakened
but was clear for the show. SECRET LOVE settled just off the pace, chased two then three wide around the turn and tired. SHORT SUMMER DRESS lost
her footing at the start, was taken under a tight hold early then settled off the pace, went three wide around most of the turn, dropped to the two path outside
the quarter-pole and failed to respond. EASY TO BLESS was last to commence, settled towards the back, moved from the rail to the two path around the
turn, swung five wide into the stretch and came up empty.

to take over when placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive under threat from flanking challengers and was
caught seventy yards out, fought on between foes missing at the end. BONANA FANNA FOE chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the stretch and missed at the finish while well clear of the rest
for the show honors. FRANNIE LEW chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. TONIGHT WE LOVE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch, weakened. MENILY lunged at the start brushing the near side stall, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide
through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. TREAT STREET broke out at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and tired. WARSALM chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper
