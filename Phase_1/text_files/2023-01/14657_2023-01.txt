STELLIOT'S LEGACY dueled for the early lead while two wide into the turn, was inside in the stretch and gamely dug in and proved best in the end. IZATIZ
was inside then shuffled back on the turn, angled out to be five wide in upper stretch and closed willingly in late stretch. WAVING BYE rallied three wide on
the turn making a bid then flattened out in the drive. BLINGONMERCURY rallied four wide on the turn making a bid to upper stretch then flattened out in the
end. THE NEXT BIG BLING was between rivals on the turn then failed to menace. COME TO THE PARTY dueled for the lead from the inside, was used up
then gave way.
