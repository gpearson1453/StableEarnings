Footnotes
DEALIN' STELEN was allowed to settle in the two path around the first turn then made a middle move, steadily gaining on the leaders to be up in the final
strides. APPLEWOOD saved ground to the quarter pole then moved out to three wide to make a late run on the leaders, engaged the leader at the eighth
pole to take the lead at the sixteenth pole but was nail at the wire. SUMMER APPEAL was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a rail bid down
the backstretch and around the final turn, moved out to two wide in upper stretch and fought gamely in the stretch drive. CORVETTE SPIRIT pressed the
pace from the three path around the first turn then took the lead at the half pole was headed at the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. SOUTHPINE GIFT
was always back. IRISH EXPECTATIONS went to the lead from the two path around the first turn to the half pole then vied for the lead to the quarter pole
and weakened. OFF SIXES reared as the gates opened and was not a factor. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE, AFTER A
REVIEW STEWARDS DECLARED THAT OFF SIXES WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS OWN PROBLEMS AND WAS DECLARED A STARTER.

Footnotes
ETBAUER'S SECRET dueled in the second flight from the inside then moved between horses at the quarter pole and took command at the eighth pole and
drew off. ISLE CALL U LATER was close up on the leaders from the inside to upper stretch then had a stretch duel with WEST TEXAS BOB and was a
game second. WEST TEXAS BOB dueled in the second flight from the three path moved out to four wide at the quarter pole then dueled down the stretch
with ISLE CALL U LATER and just missed the place. OAK HILL MO was void of the early speed then went four wide in upper stretch for a late rally.
SABERMAN settled in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. NAUTICAL
CRUISE dueled in the second flight from between horses to the three eighths pole but was not a factor. EXOTIC GENTLEMAN sprinted to a clear lead and
tired in the stretch. BLONDIE FIX IT was placed off the pace in the three path to the quarter pole and gave way. STORMIN SUNDAY had a slow start
spotting the field many lengths, made up ground through out but was never a threat.
