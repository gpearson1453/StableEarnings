Footnotes
AUNT OPAL stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued spying the leader off the rail on the turn, dived to rail when leader drifted out and took full
advantage proving best late. CASILLALATER off a half length slow, stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered
lane in the four path due to drifting out leader and was outclosed by dream trip inside rival. NORTH DAWN cleared early on the backstretch, continued clear
on the turn, drifted out into the stretch, collared in upper stretch and weakend. MY SWEET MARY hesitated and made a complete mess of the start, losing
at least ten lengths, not asked throughout in a glorified workout.
