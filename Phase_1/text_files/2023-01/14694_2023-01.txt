Footnotes
EXPLOSIVELY HOT tracked in the two path, ranged up outside of the leading pair and in the four path around the far turn to bid at the quarter pole, then
drove clear approaching the furlong grounds. ISOLATION was unruly while reluctant to load, stalked along the inside, vacated the rail turning for home to
surpass the tiring early pace setter while aiming inside of the newly leading top pair, sustained a rail bid inside the final furlong, but was fended off.
BELLAMY CAY was last away, rushed forward four wide into the first turn to achieve a two wide stalking position around it, bid for the lead entering the far
turn, vied between horses as the eventual winner loomed a danger turning for home, got outkicked entering the lane, and yielded between horses leaving
the furlong grounds. MY LITTLE JEN trailed off of the rail around both turns, shifted outside of tiring rivals entering the final furlong, and surpassed them
late. HEART THAT BINDS tracked three wide, got floated four to five wide around the far turn, and faded. CALAJA set a clear pace in the two path around
the first turn, vied inside of a pair of bidders around the far turn, and weakened approaching the quarter pole. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS
OMITTED AND IS PENDING REVIEW.

Footnotes
CO CONSPIRATOR set the pace in the two path, showed the way from a pressing foe around the far turn, shook free of him in upper stretch, dug in to
resist another outer rival's bid entering the final sixteenth, and gamely clung to a margin to the wire. BONUS APPRECIATION trailed along the inside,
improved to a tracking position down the backstretch, pursued the leaders two wide around the far turn, split them three wide entering the lane, took aim on
a clear CO CONSPIRATOR at the sixteenth pole, bid and sparred through the late stages, but was denied. MAGAZINE STREET broke in and brushed a
rival at the start, tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path, but was outkicked by an inner rival while floated to the five path entering the lane,
chased while flopping back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and ran on to reach show. UNCLE NICK was brushed by an outer rival at the start, stalked
outside of the pace setter, pressed that foe around the far turn, but failed to keep pace while chasing on his left lead and between horses in upper stretch,
and yielded in the final furlong. MAD ADAM broke a beat slow, lacked speed while floated to the three to five path around the first turn, trailed soon after,
and improved in upper stretch. ANICLUDE was bumped by an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out to the five path nearing
the backstretch, but failed to respond to urging down it, bore out turning for home, and made little impact. KIDYOUNOT broke in and bumped a rival at the
start, stalked along the inside, and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
RUE LALA stalked the top pair from the two path, tipped outside of them to take aim in upper stretch, then kicked past them at the furlong grounds.
GIGABLAST bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, chased from behind the leading group through upper
stretch, tipped three wide nearing the final sixteenth, and surged late to reach place at the wire. SUMITUP pressed two wide, vied around the turn, led briefly
entering the lane, but relinquished the advantage in upper stretch, got outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, battled for place through the late
stages, but was nailed by an outer oncharging foe for that position at the wire. WUPKAR set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the
turn, dueled through upper stretch, but was outkicked by a wider bidder at the furlong grounds, fought on gamely for place thereafter, but was outfinished by
a pair of rivals. HEI HEI CUSTIVITY broke a step slowly before bumping with an inner rival at the start, rushed forward, tracked three wide and between
horses around the turn, but yielded in upper stretch. NONEYA chased from midpack three to four wide in to the turn, then faded five wide entering the lane.
VIOLA STAR was outrun. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS showed little.

EMERALD FOREST stalked the pace setter from the four path, bid at the three furlong pole, led turning for home, drew clear at the quarter pole, inched
away leaving the furlong grounds, and held sway from an outer chaser late. ALL WEST laid off of the pace in the four path, tipped to the six path and
outside of foes entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but failed to menace late. PRADO'S PRIORITY broke in and
bumped a rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, vied with an outer rival around the turn, but was headed turning for home, fought on through upper
stretch, but gave way leaving the furlong grounds. CRIME SPREE tracked four wide, pressed three wide while hung in the five path around the turn, but
failed to keep pace with the top pair entering the lane, and yielded between horses. DEVIL'S TOWER was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the
start, lacked speed in the three path, and made little impact. GORMLEYS GOT GAME took a bump from an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside
while just off of the rail around the turn, then gave way while hanging on his left lead.

CAJUN CRAZY stalked the top pair from the four path, prompted into the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, led entering the lane, and held sway through the
closing stages. SLICK AND FAST tracked along the inside, pulled to the pocket down the backstretch, vacated the rail turning for home to surpass a tiring
rival, then sustained a rail bid in the final furlong, but was kept at bay before saving place. I DON'T VENMO bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of
the pace in the four path and between horses, pursued the main group from the three path around the far turn, then chased from between horses through
midstretch, stayed on in the late stages, and missed reaching place. ANDERS SMILE prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far turn,
but failed to match strides with his outer counterpart entering the lane, and yielded between horses in the late stages. CAJUN CONNECTION stalked in the
two path, then from between horses down the backstretch, chased before shifting to the five path entering the lane, and ran on while hanging on his left
lead. ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT bumped an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace while hung in the five path, inched closer under an all-out drive
around the far turn, then tired through the final furlong. MAIN DUDE set the pace, but was headed by a pair of outer rivals around the far turn, and
weakened turning for home. INSPECTOR ED trailed while tucking from the seven path to the two path around the first turn, and never got involved. UP N
GONE raced at the rear in the six path around the first turn, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MYTOWN MYRULES set the pace while well in hand, drew off turning for home, widened under driving pressure while hanging on her left lead through
midstretch, then changed over at the sixteenth pole, and was put to wraps soon after. SOLIDARITY stalked two to three wide, bid for place outside of
LAYLA'S SONG entering the lane, but lugged in and bumped that rival at the three sixteenths pole, sustained a duel for that position through the final
furlong, and narrowly prevailed. LAYLA'S SONG tracked two wide, split the leaders to bid at the five furlong pole, pressed into the far turn, but yielded
approaching the five sixteenths pole, met an outer challenge for place entering the lane, took a bump from that foe in upper stretch, yet prevailed in the duel
for that position thereafter. SUPER COOL STORM got rank passing the wire for the first time, remained keen behind the leaders around the first turn, got
wrangled back to trail entering the backstretch, and was outrun thereafter. THE MILE FRACTION WAS OMITTED AND IS PENDING REVIEW.

Footnotes
GRACIDA moved about just before the gates opened causing him to spot the field multiple lengths at the start, lagged behind around the turn, shifted out to
the eight path in midstretch, then rallied to surge past the clear leader in the closing stages. MR. PRODUCTION broke out, tracked the top trio from the five
path, rallied to drive past those rivals at the furlong grounds, kicked clear entering the final sixteenth as the rider searched for competition, but offered little
resistance to an outer oncharging rival's late blitz nearing the wire. C'MON VE tracked along the inside, shifted three wide at the furlong grounds after MR
PRODUCTION got a jump, claimed place in pursuit of that foe entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked late. MR. PRIORITY laid off of the pace in the
four path, tipped to the six path entering the lane, and moved up in the final furlong while getting outkicked by an outer foe. CRUSADER EXPRESS raced
off of the pace in the three path and between horses, and failed to menace among foes. QUEST FOR AVETTE prompted the pace two wide and between
horses while taking the turn in the three path, led coming to the furlong grounds, but was outkicked leaving that juncture, and faltered. LOVEU AND
PROUDOFU took a bump from an outer rival at the start, pressed the top pair from the four path, but weakened between horses in upper strech. LT.
BONURA lacked speed two wide, and failed to factor. REECE'S PRIORITY set the pace inside of a pair of pressers while a path off of the inner railing
around the turn, got headed in upper stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. COUNTERFEIT bobbled and bumped an inner rival at the start, laid
off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor.
