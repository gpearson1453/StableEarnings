FIBER STRONG pressed the early leader from the outside, took command through the far turn and held safe under strong handling. AMIDSHIPS was
forced to check at the start, rushed up from the outside to contention, was in aim through the upper stretch and finished game after the troubling beginning.
DERBY DAY DREAMS veered in at the start, bothered foes at the break, raced three to four wide around the far turn from the outside of rivals, was six deep
into the upper stretch and closed in belatedly. Jockey of Drinkwithethestars claimed an objection for interference and stewards disqualified Derby Day
Dreams and placed seventh. SUPER JORDAN vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened. FROGGY THE GREMLIN was hustled throughout,
raced near the rail and had not enough. BOSS E BOOGS was bumped hard at the start, raced two wide around the far turn through the stretch and never
threatened. DRINKWITHTHESTARS was forced to take up sharply at the break, raced far back and was moved up to sixth place through objection.

NICO pressed the pace from the outside to foes while racing three deep and finished strongly to be well clear late under steady pressure. AUBURN MILL
was sent along early to set the early pace along the inside, was overtaken through the far turn, kept on but was no match for the winner. ROCKET APPEAL
pressed the early pace while racing two wide between rivals and weakened through the stretch run. OUT OF CENTS chased the early pace from the inside,
shifted four into the upper stretch and raced even with no rally. BOASTER settled near the back of the pack early on, made a four to five wide bid in the lane
and had not enough. BUFF'S EYE VIEW dropped back early, saved ground and lacked a bid. MISSIONSNINETYNINE raced mid pack early on, was near
the rail into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
A GOOD LAW pressed the pace from the outside of foe early on, took command, dug in deep stretch and prevailed under all out pressure in a determined
run. DIAL HER rated along early, moved up to challenge through the far turn, raced three wide in the lane and finished gamely to the wire.
CUMULONIMBUS dropped back off the early pace, moved up four to five wide and finished willingly to the wire. DECISIVE CAUSE settled off the early
pace along the inside, moved up through the far turn but had not enough in the drive. FORT ZANNA dropped back early, raced near the inside and had no
final bid. ULTIMATE BREEZE raced mid pack early, was four to five wide around the far turn and never threatened. CHANNEL SCENT stalked the pace,
raced three to four wide around the far turn and failed to sustain a bid. SUPERSTASIA showed early foot from the inside faltered.

dueled for the early lead along the rail and finished gamely to the wire. NEWS FLASH chased the early pace while being coaxed on, raced three wide
around the far turn and showed good late energy to move up late. GOLDEN KEY dueled for the early lead while racing between rivals and weakened a bit
late. INSIDE RISK was hustled along throughout, raced two wide between, experienced traffic near the sixteenth pole and kept on. CAIRO CALLING
stumbled at the break, chased the early pace and weakened a bit after the troubling beginning. STRONG FIBER hustled along, raced near the inside and
had no response. BAYTOWN WARRIOR saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
INDIANA RED rated early on, moved up to challenge from the outside of foe near the quarter pole while racing in the two pace and forged clear late under
strong encouragement. INSTIGATED coaxed along early, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled four to five wide and finished gamely to the wire.
JACK THE RIPPER (FR) showed good early foot from the inside and gave way grudgingly. MY CANDY BIZ hustled along early, raced from the inside past
the quarter pole and was even late with no late run. LOST IN MANHATTAN dropped back off the early pace, was five deep into the upper stretch and lacked
a rally. MONGOLIAN HERO settled off the early going, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and never threatened. COMPOUND IT was coaxed
along from the outside of rivals and faded. U ROCK IT threw his head at the break, raced four deep near the five sixteenths pole and never menaced.
