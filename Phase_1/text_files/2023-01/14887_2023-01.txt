Footnotes
NEED A MARKER broke a beat slow, quickly recovered and edged up off the rail to track the dueling trio, took closer order four wide and under mild asking
past the five sixteenths, forged to command soon into the lane, responded when put to firm encouragement in mid stretch and drew away while kept to task.
O SHAUGHESEY dueled between rivals through the opening three eighths, shifted in under a ride and continued to battle into the lane, failed to match
strides with the winner heading to mid stretch but kept on willingly to be clear for the place. SISTER'S DUTY vied three deep, held a slim lead leaving the
three eighths, fought on to the head of the lane then faded through the final furlong. GALACTIC TIDE , in a bit close at the break, saved ground off the pace,
eased out mid turn, came out further with a bit of a run in upper stretch then failed to seriously sustain. BUSTIN WIDE OPEN saved ground chasing the duel
and came up empty. MODELO RUBIA lacked speed, circled three to four wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. THEOLA FUGGINS was hard sent inside
and vied inside a pair of rivals, stayed on to mid turn, shifted off the rail near the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
GHOSTLIGHTER rated kindly and off the inside, eased out three wide leaving the far turn, moved swiftly and in hand to join the leader past the three
eighths, secured the lead in upper stretch, cleared soon after and eagerly moved away under steady right handed encouragement. MAJESTIC FRONTIER
broke a bit slow, settled towards the rail, came out for room mid turn, was under pressure four wide between foes into the lane, leveled off to a good run to
give chase past mid stretch, drifted in some and kept on well to be second best. JONNY QUIST vied outside a rival early then cleared leaving the three
quarter pole, set the pace two wide, was joined by the winner nearing the stretch, kept on willingly to mid stretch then faded. ON THE ENGINE , between
rivals early, rated back off foes near the five eighths, angled out and edged up some leaving the far turn, circled five wide under a drive into the stretch but
failed to rally. SHADY MUNNI , three wide stalking early on, dropped in a path mid turn, failed to kick on under pressure in upper stretch and gave way.
LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE vied inside through about the opening quarter mile, rated back off the leader and tracked inside, took a bit of a firmer hold into the
far turn, stayed inside to chase past the three eighths, lacked a response into the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
PERFORMANCEANXIETY disputed the pace to the inside of rivals while under rating, emerged in battle with TIPSY TOURIST into the turn, took over from
that one soon after, was nursed along maintaining the edged past the five sixteenths, spurted away after being set down in upper stretch, wandered out a bit
from a left handed ask near the sixteenth pole, was quickly corrected and kept on with good energy through the wire. GOOD STORY was rated back soon
after the break, dropped in leaving the chute and edged up a bit, remained inside to advance past the five sixteenths, angled three wide for the drive, kept
grinding on her left lead past mid stretch, switched over to her correct lead very late and gained the place. TIPSY TOURIST , between rivals early, vied two
wide outside the winner into the turn, stayed with that around the turn, failed to match strides soon into the stretch, gave hard pursuit past the furlong
grounds and gave way grudgingly. SOMEBODY LOVES ME dropped off the pace despite serious insistence, raced three wide into the lane, shifted in to
make a slight run between foes in mid stretch but failed to make an impact. DOOMSCROLLER lagged well back early, saved ground into and through the
lane and had belated interest. COFFEE BEAN drifted out at the break, corrected and moved up five wide to chase the quartet of leaders, dropped in a path
around the turn, was under strong hand asking approaching the lane, lacked a punch and gave way. HELLO JAMROCK , with the early pace four deep,
raced three wide pursuing around the turn, failed to go on in upper stretch and retreated. POLICE WOMAN rushed up between foes leaving the chute and
contested the early pace, could not keep pace while three wide leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SIR ALFRED JAMES , with the pace three deep, applied more pressure when coaxed along mid turn, responded to firmer asking and forged to command
outside rivals in upper stretch, spurted away under strong left handed encouragement in mid stretch then kept on with good energy through the wire.
THREES OVER DEUCES rated close up behind the trio of leaders, sat and waited till the quarter pole, swung out four wide in upper stretch and finished
gamely. GOING TO THE LEAD , urged up to the inside of rivals to contest the pace, battled around the turn, failed to contain the winner but held well
through the final furlong. WENDELL FONG , taken to rate about three wide, crept closer leaving the far turn, shifted out for the drive but lacked a bid.
KARAN'S NOTION got into a pace battle between rivals soon after the break, stayed on between foes around the turn and into the lane, lacked a punch
past the three sixteenths and faded. AIR TOKEN , nudged up early to be in range, saved ground chasing into the stretch but lacked a serious finish. SAVOY
drafted back off the early pace, came under pressure mid turn, swung six wide, failed to respond and was eased late.

STILL HAVING FUN accelerated to contention leaving the chute and got into a duel to the inside of SPOTTED BULL, sparred under some rating into and
around the turn, dropped back a bit as SPOTTED BULL and UNEQUIVOCAL got into their own scrum past the quarter pole, found more under right handed
asking to re engage leaving the furlong grounds, took command soon after and drew clear. SPOTTED BULL disputed the pace three wide outside the
winner, held a short lead into the lane, dug in when confronted from his outside soon after, opened up a bit when dueling to the inside of UNEQUIVOCAL
heading to the three sixteenths, wandered outward, corrected inside the furlong grounds, gave way stubbornly and clung to the place. UNEQUIVOCAL
stalked the dueling leaders into and around the turn, ranged up five wide to challenge in upper stretch, vied while being floated out in mid stretch then hung
very late. MINECRAFTER , off the contested pace, raced between runners into the stretch, advanced to the inside of a rival in mid stretch and churned on.
MAMAIGOTTHIS lagged well back off the duel, came four wide for the drive, shifted out and closed. BAD GUY rated in the clear early, circled three to four
wide into the stretch, made some progress in mid stretch then flattened out. VINNY saved ground and weakened. GALATIANS , well back while saving
ground, swung out for the drive and gave way.

THORNY TALE prompted the pace two to three wide outside MONEY RIDE, went on the attack mid turn, sparred under some rating into the stretch,
responded to solid asking and went clear in mid stretch, widened to the sixteenth then held firm while kept alert. UP AGAINST IT , forward between rivals,
steadied when in close nearing the turn, regrouped to advance into a stalking spot mid turn, angled four wide for the drive, gave game chase and ground it
out to gain the place. MONEY RIDE sped to the front, set the pace towards the inside, was joined mid turn, dueled under a hearty ride into the lane, stayed
on past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BOBBY G rated inside early on, steadied near the half, angled out then back in, raced along the rail in the
drive and rallied. NORTHERN THUNDER , four and three wide giving chase, was scrubbed upon and angled five wide for the drive, gave futile pursuit in
mid stretch then faded. SPEAK UNITY lost ground five wide and faded. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) , between foes early, rated three wide mid turn, angled in
some in upper stretch but came up empty. TITAN'S WILL close up inside rivals past the five eighths, was shuffled back several lengths into the turn and
failed to recover.

Footnotes
FEELING WOOZY vied between foes early while holding a short lead, secured the rail leaving the far turn and was nicely handled while taking outside
pressure from BYK around the turn, opened up after being put to stout left handed asking in upper stretch, came off the inside near the furlong grounds then
held firm while under mild urging late. CIRCLING THE DRAIN , bumped at the break, was taken wide and edged up four wide nearing the turn, chased five
wide into the lane and closed willingly. BYK , between foes early, prompted the pace two to three wide outside the winner, shifted out in upper stretch and
gave way grudgingly. IT'S VIPER , bumped at the start, moved up nearing the turn, raced in range but under solid asking mid turn then lacked a serious
kick. BO'S BOURBON , under a snug hold four wide outside foes and with the pace past the five eighths, dropped in and bit and pressed under a ride mid
turn, angled in soon into the lane and gave way. CORONOVA prompted the pace while saving ground, failed to kick on entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
SAPPHIRE BEAUTY , three wide between rivals nearing the five eighths, tracked in hand, moved to even terms outside the leader heading to the turn,
kicked away mid turn, responded and kept on under firm encouragement in upper stretch, wandered outward near the sixteenth pole and held sway.
SULLIVAN STREET , in a bit tight at the break, was hustled up into the turn while off the inside, came five wide for the drive, leveled off past mid stretch,
altered in late and rallied. M'LADY THATCHER , five wide outside runners forcing the pace near the five eighths, chased four wide under asking around the
turn but lacked a solid bid. VICTORIAN RIVIERA , four wide between runners early, chased three wide mid turn and into the stretch, was inside rivals near
the eighth pole and faded. CATEGORYNINETYNINE sped to the lead inside rivals leaving the five eighths, cleared then was collared into the turn, could
not. BIZZY BIZZY , between horses early, dropped back. HEARD saved ground, faltered around the turn and was eased.
