under a drive. SAN ANTONE stalked the early pace four wide, came five wide into the lane and closed well to gain a short lead late but was outfinished by
the winner. HESASMOKIN tracked the early pace, then was in contention on the turn and was blocked nearing the quarter pole, remained blocked to
leaving the furlong marker and then split rivals nearing the sixteenth marker and finished well but needed more. BERHANU vied for the early lead, then
made a bid between rivals by the quarter pole, then gained a short lead leaving the furlong marker but faded late. COAST TO COAST was off a beat slow,
then advanced on the inside and was ridden along on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and then was in tight between rivals by the furlong
marker and ran on but had no kick. HAIR OF THE DOG vied for the lead on the inside and weakened the final furlong. HERE WEGO pressed the pace and
made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole, then was bumped nearing the sixteenth marker and was empty late. GEM JUAN

then held on late to prove best, driving. U U STAR was rated along the inside early, eased off the inside on the turn and came four wide into the lane,
finished well to be gaining late to just miss. SUTTON VALLEY set a pressed pace early three wide, then shook clear on the turn and dropped to the inside,
then was headed leaving the turn and faded late, bested rest. THE LITTLE SPROUT was settled early on the inside, advanced on the turn and cut the
corner but finished evenly late. SUIT OF ARMOR was bumped hard at the start, advanced on the inside and then shifted to the outside on the turn and
came up empty in the drive. SASSY LAD failed to menace. LAST MINUTE MARIO pressed the pace on the inside and weakened. WHAT'S MY

RENEWING VOWS was reserved early while saving ground, angled out nearing the quarter pole for racing room, came wide and closed full of run to get up
and edge clear to prove best under strong left handed crop urging. MOBEER set the pace while racing in the two path, was well handled on the turn and
shook clear leaving the turn was clear by the furlong marker but was caught in deep stretch, good effort. ON AN ISLAND was well placed on the inside to
the three sixteenth and angled out for aim on the front runner but flattened out the final furlong, held show award. UPFOR PAROLE was rated along on the
inside, then eased out and was two wide by the quarter pole, then shifted back in for racing room in the lane but had no late kick. TEMPO CRESCENDO
stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened. BEJUCO was rated along three to four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn and
weakened. BOOK RUNNER lacked a rally. OUT OF STOCK stopped.

ECLIPTICALS SARAH set a pressured pace on the inside, then came off the inside by the quarter pole and made a bid leaving the turn and drew clear, then
widened the margin to prove much the best. PHANCY PHILLY was bumped at the start, settled on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and
rallied well for the place award. TOOTSYSROCKNROLLER was void of early speed, angled out in the drive and had a belated rally. DWELLER stalked the
pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the lane. COSMOLOGICAL pressed the early pace in between rivals and weakened. NO
EASY ANSWER pressed the pace three wide and was between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. ALWAYS MIA was allowed to settle, made a four
wide move on the turn and then was empty.

Footnotes
BAVARIA vied for the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace down the backstretch, drew off leaving the turn and was kept to mild pressure to
prove much the best. WEEKEND IN COURT was void of early speed, came five wide into the lane and finished well to gain the place award. VISHNU
tracked the pace two to three wide and weakened, bested rest. PIGGYBANK was reluctant to load, settled three to four wide and lacked a rally. DIGGERS
DIAMOND settled early on the inside and tired. SMOOTH OPERATION vied for the lead on the inside and stopped.
