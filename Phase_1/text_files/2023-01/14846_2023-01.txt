to rally. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. LEPRINO was off slow, lagged, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not reach contention.

LETS DECLARE PEACE showed no early speed, raced off the rail into the stretch and was up in the closing yards to be going away late. U DID IT dueled
for the lead from the inside with A LOT OF SPUNK, disposed of that rival into the lane, opened a clear lead but could not match strides with the winner late.
OUTSIDE THE LAW was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. A LOT OF SPUNK was away
in good order to dispute the pace with UN DID IT while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. SINGLE LADY was off slow, raced unhurried
early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
I AM FREAKY FAST pressed the pace while racing three-wide throughout and was up in the closing yards. MY MAN BIGGIE was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. BIG CREED broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside,
opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way late. PUBLIC OPINION lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, checked in tight
quarters late and failed to gain. COUNTESS OF CAIRO showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ECHO
CANYON settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. MOHAMAD showed brief speed from the inside and
weakened.
