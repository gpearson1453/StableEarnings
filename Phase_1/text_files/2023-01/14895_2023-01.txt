COLLIN'S GREY LADY settled inside, slipped through to the front on the final turn then edged off under wraps through the final sixteenth. TITANIC ROSE
lacked speed, continued along the rail and closed well for the place. LIVIN' AT THE BU prompted the pace outside and weakened slightly in the stretch.
MISS CHAMITA lagged far behind inside then narrowed the gap without menacing. PURRFECT MISTRESS set a clear pace in hand for five furlongs and
gave way. LA NEBLINA was urged off the leaders in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
PONTIFFANY tracked along the inside early, bid three wide entering the turn, dueled past the quarter pole, edged away in upper stretch and drew clear
under urging. SPIRIT OR SPITE vied inside for the lead, dueled inside of the winner on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and held on for second.
SHIRLEY GREENE raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied outside and just missed for second. GAVICHI was off
slowly and awkward, raced off the pace inside and gained mildly in the stretch run. SWEET LILLY FACTUM raced off the rail, off the pace, came four wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. POWWA OF LOVE stumbled at the start, stalked the pace, bid four wide entering the turn, then chased outside and tired.
SEA FRET vied outside for the lead, chased on the turn and faded.

CLASSIC UNION close up in the two path, moved wide in the stretch, offered a strong bid and drew away under moderate pressure. MEET THE ELITE
settled off the pace, slipped through to the front at the top of the stretch but tired. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE hustled to a clear advantage for half a mile and
weakened. FREDDYNESS broke a step slowly, rushed to contention inside, angled out on the turn then flattened. IN SPADES raced within striking range
three and four wide and faltered. SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE trailed far behind then caught a tiring opponent. LONG LEGGED BOY hustled off the pace
between rivals and gave way readily.

Footnotes
GET THE W led in the two path, repelled a challenge nearing the quarter pole then edged off again and remained safe while kept to his task. STRUGAR
close up from the outset, bid on the turn, could not get by the winner but finished willingly. COMMISSIONER G chased wide off the leaders, moved even
wider into the stretch and tired. HIDE THE RANSOM raced within striking range outside and lacked a solid bid. MACH TRIAL dropped back after the start,
trailed and passed tiring rivals. SUIGU STAR raced wide off the leaders, faded on the turn and was no factor. SNEAKINESS flashed speed along the inside
to the far turn and gave way.

HE'S INCREDIBLE vied two wide for the lead, dueled with FLOAT ON on the turn, edged away, turned back a bid from HUSHION in upper stretch, shifted
out a bit at the furlong grounds, drew clear under urging and coasted the final yards. HUSHION stalked close up outside, bid three wide at the quarter pole,
could not stay with the winner, steadied behind that rival at the eighth pole, then dug in late to hold second. FLOAT ON vied inside for the lead, dueled with
the winner on the turn, yielded, then dug in on the rail to the finish. BAILEY chased three wide, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. GOLDEN
SPOKE chased inside and tired. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU chased between rivals and faded.

FAR MO POWER pursued the loose pacesetter, collared that rival in midstretch and pulled clear through the final furlong. IRISH CORK controlled the pace,
lost the advantage passing the eighth pole but continued willingly. DOUBLE CROWN bid closer outside after half a mile then was up for the show late.
ELOQUIST saved ground within striking range then flattened out in the stretch. KING OF DREAMS chased outside off the leaders, was eased after the
finish and vanned off afterward. AMATTEROFTIME broke a bit awkwardly, raced wide and trailed most of the trip.
