Footnotes
PURE ELEGANCE raced off the pace up the backstretch, began to move up from the rail coming around the turn, swung out to the three path entering the
stretch and drew off to the wire. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way racing in the two path around the bend,
was caught passing the quarter pole and kept on to the finish. KENYA SUN chased the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile,
navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the lane while finishing evenly. LUCKY LIZZIE tracked the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and weakened in the final furlong. LADY TEUFLESBERG raced in the middle of the pack on the outside
early, came around the turn in the four path and never threatened. VOODAYO stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the four path and faded in the lane. GLOVANNA trailed far behind the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
RAPIDAMENTE bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path
coming around the bend and gained ground in the stretch to get up for the win late. TRULY A DREAM bumped with the horse to her inside at the break,
trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up from the two path coming around the turn and continued to gain ground to the wire.
BARBARA bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and dug in in the
stretch, getting caught in the final strides. TWELVE RED ROSES tracked the leader between horses early, navigated the turn from the three path and
weakened in the final furlong. CSILLA bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, stalked the leaders up the backstretch, raced in the five path around
the bend and flattened out in the lane. LADY WOOD bumped with the inside horse leaving the gate, chased the leader up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and faded in the stretch. MAKIN IT LOOK EASY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, dropped back
while racing in the three path around the bend and was empty from there.

Footnotes
CINDY'S SONG saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far bend, kicked clear entering the
stretch and held that margin to the wire. MONTANA JOYCE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn, launched a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground late. TAKE TO THE SKIES saved ground early, stalked the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and kept on to the finsih. BOCA saved ground around
the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and improved position in late stretch. NOVELERA
raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane.
LOVE'S MISERY saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and weakened late.
FANCYSOUL veered out sharply leaving the gate, recovered to track the pace setter from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in
the three path around the far bend and faded in the stretch. STYLE raced rankly in the early going, was taken up and out to the four path for the run around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, navigated the second turn still in the four path and made no bid while
drifting mildly in upper stretch. BELLSWILLBERINGING raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and tired from there.

Footnotes
SHAQ DIESEL raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far
bend, kicked clear in late stretch and held off a late closer to the wire. POSSIBLEMENTE was fractious in the gate, broke well and raced in the four path
early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the second turn and
gained ground steadily to the finish. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED raced in the three path around the first bend, chased the leader up the backstretch,
challenged from the two path racing around the far turn and kept on in the lane. JOE'S HAD ENOUGH saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the rail around the far turn and in upper stretch, and weakened in the final furlong, drifting out near the
wire. GRAND PICK bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside,
navigated the far turn still in the two path and made up some ground late but was never a threat. COX CANYON was fractious in the gate, broke slowly,
hitting the gate on the way out, trailed the field inside through the opening half mile, moved up while saving ground around the far turn and was empty in the
lane.

Footnotes
GO MIKE saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole and kicked clear late. WHISKEY PLANK saved ground early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
challenged from the two path coming around the second bend and chased the winner home late. KOBLA MAS bumped with the horse to her inside leaving
the gate, raced in the four path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, began
a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late. FLY FLY AWAY raced in the two path early, led the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving
ground around the far turn, was caught in upper stretch and kept on to the wire. BIRD'S EYE VIEW bumped with the horses to both sides at the break,
recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and weakened in late stretch. BEAR
CREEK bumped lightly with the horse to his inside at the start, raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, saved ground
around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. VINTNER raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of
the pack between horses, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. KING NATE raced in the two path early, trailed the field up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and made no bid. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT bumped lightly with the horses to both sides leaving the gate,
raced in the four path around the firs turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second bend still in the four path and faded
in the lane. MOONSHINE NOW raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, dropped back while racing
