Footnotes
MISS CASEY broke alertly and sprinted clear with alacrity, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained near the rail throughout and was
kept to her business in the drive. FORTUNATA ITALIA bumped with MEBS WEB approaching the half mile, circled foes on the turn while chasing the
winner, was four deep entering the stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and finished willingly. RAISE YOUR GAME raced in mid pack early, was four deep
turning for home and passed tired rivals. BELLA BETTINA came out at the break, lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and passed tired horses. MEBS WEB bumped with FORTUNATA ITALIA approaching the half mile pole, chased the pace while in the two
path around the turn and weakened. SALAMINA chased the pace while three wide on the turn and weakened through the stretch run.
TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK came in at the break, chased the pace, hugged the inner rail entering the stretch and was steadied in tight quarters approaching
the three sixteenths pole. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was no factor. CAPTIVATING GAL was not a factor. SOME IS
NINE , four wide on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
THE HAUNTED ROOM eagerly made her way to the front leaving the chute, set a rated pace just off the inside, moved away past the three eighths, opened
up when put to some urging in upper stretch, was roused once right handed inside the eighth pole then cruised home the final seventy yards.
PERFORMANCEANXIETY , five wide outside rivals through the backstretch run, dropped in leaving the far turn, came back out under coaxing heading
towards the stretch, worked between rivals and finished up willingly to be well clear of the rest. HUSHEMUP , bumped from both sides and put in tight
leaving the gate, recovered and advanced to contention in the opening quarter mile, prompted three wide into the turn, emerged as the closest pursuer while
under asking mid turn, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. JUST ONCE MORE raced four wide between runners early, was under a solid ride past the
three eighths, shifted out a bit wider in upper stretch but came up empty. DOOMSCROLLER , bumped at the break, dropped off the early pace, raced two
wide leaving the far turn and failed to respond. DESPITE THE GIN came in at the break bumping and crowding rivals, straightened and joined the winner
leaving the chute, prompted to half, chased around the turn then gave way through the final three sixteenths. THE HARPSTER broke outward and tightened
a foe, saved ground and dropped well back.

TREASURE TROVE lightly bumped with NAUTILUS leaving the starting gate, rated behind horses to mid way on the far turn, swung four wide approaching
the stretch, sprinted clear and drifted in in upper stretch and pulled away under steady urging. GUILLAUME chased the pace down the backstretch, bid for
the lead in the two path between horses leaving the far turn, weakened and held the place. BIG LAKE sprinted to a three wide lead entering the first turn,
angled in on the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and gave way the final furlong. NAUTILUS lightly bumped with the winner at the start,
steadied in close quarters along the rail mid way on the first turn, remained near the rail on the far turn and retreated in the drive. IRISH BOOLUM , three
wide both turns, chased the pace to the stretch and faltered. SHOOT THEMESSENGER was outrun. PER RULING #23-050 FROM THE MARYLAND

Footnotes
BUMP N RUN sped to the front, set a rated pace two wide, responded in upper stretch, kept on under right handed asking past mid stretch, remained on his
left lead and held firm to the wire. PRIDE OF PAYTON prompted the pace along the rail, edged up to threaten near the quarter pole, failed to kick on with
the winner but stayed on gamely to preserve the place. OMO DADA broke a step slow, recovered and edged up behind rivals while in hand, steadied near
the turn, regrouped to advance two to three wide in upper stretch and churned on. MINE RUN , three wide outside rivals early, checked when in tight leaving
the far turn then lacked a stretch response. HILL OF TARA , three to four wide, had aim into the lane and faded. TRUE ACCOUNT broke slowly, came four
wide for the drive, dropped back and was eased. WE CALL HIM CLYDE , three wide in close attendance early, faltered.

Footnotes
LOVELY LIZA edged up early and stalked three to four wide, was put to pressure mid turn, circled four wide into the lane, closed in steadily under left
handed asking in mid stretch, took over heading to the sixteenth marker and drew away while kept to task. QUIT QUAY sped clear early, set the pace
towards the inside, turned away an initial threat near the three eighths, spurted back clear, widened a bit under a drive and off the rail in upper stretch, failed
to contain the winner, weakened but saved the place. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN , three wide early, angled in for the drive and rallied mildly. CAMI
RACHELLE , away alertly and rated off the leader, outside bid to challenge leaving the far turn, gave hard chase from the five sixteenths, stayed on willingly
to the sixteenth marker then faded. JIMMYDABOOK lost ground four wide, circled into the stretch and lacked a bid. SISTER SPIRIT , inside, made a mild
run nearing the lane then failed to sustain. PEACE FIRE broke slowly, saved ground off the pace, angled out and failed to menace. EXCLUSIVE ROSE
chased for a half mile and gave way. BREEZY LEIGH was through early.

stretch and was under urging in mid stretch. SHAKE EM LOOSE , five wide the first turn, chased the winner, was three wide the far turn and held the place.
AMERICAN D'ORO , along the inner rail on the first turn, moved outside horses on the far turn, floated five wide entering the stretch and lacked the
necessary late effort. AMATTEROFTIME chased the pace between horses for a half mile, dropped back on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper
stretch and passed a pair of tired foes. KING OF DREAMS , in the three path chasing the pace on the first turn, moved to the inner rail entering the far turn

Footnotes
BALI HAI , with the pace three deep heading to the half mile marker, poked a head in front near the three eighths, sparred between rivals soon after, shook
clear in upper stretch, turned away an inside threat near the eighth pole and edged away under a drive. SWEET FACTOR vied between rivals early, rated
off the leaders into the turn, shifted in and challenged near mid stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. WAVERLEY saved ground with pursuit, eased out
three wide near the lane, edged up behind rivals near the furlong grounds and churned on willingly. ANATH , off the early pace, moved up three wide into
the lane and kept on with some interest. FIVE STAR FRAN , four wide, moved up outside to engage the winner near the three eighths, forced the issue into
the lane then gave way in the final furlong. CONCERT HALL saved ground early, angled out for the drive but failed to menace. FIVEALARM FREAKOUT
took a short lead along the rail early on, dueled inside rivals, ceded command three eighths out, remained a presence to upper stretch then weakened.
SUPER MONEY broke slowly, was urged while off the pace, swung wide for the drive but failed to threaten. CONTESTATION broke a step slow, regrouped
and edged up off the rail into the turn, swung out wide for the drive, failed to kick on and faltered through the final furlong.
