Footnotes
YANKEE DOLLAR sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the wire. LADY
COMMISSIONER showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. DIRT FLIRT was reserved just off the
leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and failed to gain in the drive. HURRICAIN HUNTER settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. BORN TO REIGN was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. YES
PLEASE chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened through the final furlong. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

HE'S A CANDY MAN sprinted clear at once, increased his advantage through the turn and was ridden out to the wire. MOHAMAD lacked early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with good late energy. BRAYBRAY was void of foot, saved ground,
through the turn, reached a contending position but was no match for the winner. MR. SO FUNNY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and lacked the needed closing response. BIG CREED settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SEIGE THE
DAY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. OAKDALE ROAD lagged early, moved four-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. A BIT MUCH showed brief speed and weakened. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

held gamely. STEAL HOME was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, rallied late and just missed. FIRE WHEN READY was

of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. AWESOME SATURDAY raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the
turn and weakened. HI HO CHEERIO showed no early speed, raced eight-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MORE HONOR lacked early foot,

Footnotes
SQUARE FOOTAGE was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held sway to the
wire. SWEET LADY LANA broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. PAYNT THE
KITTY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in with a sixteenth to run and finished with a steady bid.
BARBARIUS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. DISCOVER A
WISH settled off the leaders from the inside and failed to gain in the drive. BIG AL'S PRINCESS raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the
turn and finished evenly. AWESOME GALAXY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. PARTY POLICE was forwardly placed
from between foes and weakened in the drive. R HAPPY PLACE raced off the pacesetters from between foes, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker
and weakened. HAYNESPUN was off a step slow and lagged throughout.

sixteenth and quickly drew off. LOOKINTOGETEVEN stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths
pole, opened a clear margin but could not resist the winner late. GOLDEN SUN DROPS was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second
turn and failed to gain in the drive. FINE POINT ASSAY settled off the leaders from the inside, moved between rivals in mid-stretch and finished evenly.
REAL GOOD VYBZ sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going three-quarters. UNUSUAL DANCER chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going six furlongs. PRINCESS OF MALIBU was void of early speed, saved ground through the second

TIZ A MACHO GIRL settled off the leaders early, moved up from the inside to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with MISS HARD KNOCKS, drifted out
and held by the narrowest of margins. MISS HARD KNOCKS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide in tandem with the winner to offer
a bid nearing the quarter, vied with that foe, was carried out and just missed through a vigorous drive. LUCY K lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the
second turn and finished with some late run. MISSCZECH sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going a half. JOY
IN THE BATTLE chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half, vied and gave way through the final furlong.
KYNLIE'S EMPIRE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. TAKING CHARGE DESI lacked early foot, saved
ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter and did not offer a bid. CURLIN BLESSING showed brief speed, weakened, was pulled up

Footnotes
BIGFOOT CITY sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE was reserved just off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out into the lane, but
could not gain on the winner late. CASHANOVA settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a late bid. BOB'S
ALL IN lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly. GIANT PAYDAY settled
off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to rally. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. RIVER ROSE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. WE'RE
JUST SAYIN lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. VINTAGE KITTEN showed no early speed, raced four-wide
through the second turn and did not threaten. ZUMURUDEE hopped at the start then was allowed to settle, raced three-wide through the second turn and
did not menace. MY BOY LOLLIPOP was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.
