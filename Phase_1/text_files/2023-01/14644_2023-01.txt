Footnotes
UPTOWN QUEEN stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, dueled in upper stretch
and edged clear late. SPANISH DELIGHT raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, began to improve position passing the half mile pole, saved
ground around the turn, dueled in the stretch, could not go with the eventual winner late and kept on to the wire. MURUMBI raced off the pace on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the bend in the four path, swung wide into the stretch and improved position in the lane while
drifting out some in the final furlong. TRUE ATKA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and
gained ground mildly in the stretch while never threatening the top two. LIZZ A BEE trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the
turn, swung wide into the stretch and made no bid. SOUTHERN SMILE led the field on the inside through the opening quarter, dueled from the two path
around the bend and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MIGHTY HEART raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far
turn, quickly kicked clear and held off a late closer at the wire. BUMPERDOO raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch well
off the pace, improved position while racing in the five path around the second bend and continued to gain ground late, the best of the rest. HELIUM saved
ground early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position
mildly in the lane while never threatening the top two. MUNQAD raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came around
the second bend in the four path and finished evenly. PRENDIMI saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. MOTAWAAFEQ was reluctant to load, broke well and dueled from the two path around the first
turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and faded in the lane. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE trailed the field throughout, raced in
the two and three path around the turns and was no factor.
