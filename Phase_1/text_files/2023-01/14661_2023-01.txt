Footnotes
BOSS BRIDE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased her margin into the stretch and held sway to the wire.
DON'T GET PICKLED was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a
steady bid. DADS ESTRELLA chased the leaders while racing four-wide, was carried out by DON'T GET PICKLED in mid-stretch and failed to gain late.
SCATALICIOUS lacked early speed, saved ground, through the turn and failed to rally. PRINCESS JAYLEEN showed brief speed, raced five-wide through
the turn and weakened. SWIVEL HIPS was off slow, lagged far back throughout and was eased through the lane.

BEYOND AWESOME sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. ARIZONA
KALEI broke sharply to chase the winner while racing four-wide, could not reach the winner in the drive but held on well to hold the place. BANGIE GO
chased the leaders while racing from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. CLASSIC TASTE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and did not threaten. NATURAL IMMUNITY raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.
PAISLEY'S VISION lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. OUR MAGIC GIRL was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide
through the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LITTLE RED RIFLE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths marker, wore down INCREDIBE MO in the
closing yards and held SWEET SAVANT safe late. SWEET SAVANT pressed the pace while racing four-wide, bumped with PRECEDENT nearing the
three-sixteenths marker, was straightened away and finished with good energy. ROYAL AIR FORCE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and
finished with a steady bid. INCREDIBE MO broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with PRECEDENT from the inside, opened a clear margin into
the lane and gave way through the final sixteenth. DODGER BLUE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. PRECEDENT
was away in good order to dispute the pace with INCREDIBE MO while racing three-wide, drifted out to bump SWEET SEVANT nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and gave way through the final furlong. TIMES PROVIDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

a pressured pace early, opened a clear margin nearing the three-quarter pole, was well rated through the back-stretch and gave way through the final
sixteenth. JOKER MATT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, bumped with LIGHT CRUISER nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain late. COASTAL WATERS lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch
and lacked the needed closing response. UNCLE JEFF was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and gave way through the final
furlong. BARNFIELD settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and weakened. THEKOWBOYKABIN pressed the pace while racing
three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. BODEMONSTER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
DANNY ZUKO raced four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders, weakened and was eased through the lane. TIMES PROVIDED FOLLOWING
REVIEW.
