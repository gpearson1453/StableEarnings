Footnotes
SPEARS MILL tracked confidently to far turn, roused to go past quarter pole, responded well and cleared under stout handling to the wire. PORONUI inside
speed to lead, stayed to quarter pole while no match for the winner in the stretch run holding the place spot. MISSONI good position off rail, came three
wide past the quarter pole while all out in the stretch for show. MEGAN'S NOEL tracked inside to the half but leveled off with no late kick when needed.
SPIRIT DANCE no speed to the half while never a real threat throughout. WISHING ON A STAR unhurried early with no response when urged on at the
half. BROADBAND rail run to far turn but could not go on and faded back in the stretch.

GARDEN BELLE chased inside to turn, roused in the stretch, rallied quickly and drew clear, held sway to the wire. LADY LOWERY no speed to the turn,
came wide into the stretch and closed gap late while no match for the winner. DARING DO speed to the front, stayed to the stretch and shortened stride in
the final furlong while best of the rest . GRANNY LAW off rail run into the stretch, chased top pair but weakened late. SWEET SWEETFANTASY bore out
bumped at the start, never a real menace thereafter. WILD ACCLAIM bumped at the start, raced three wide, chased to the turn but gave way readily.
PUBLIC GARDEN tried to keep to the turn, faded in the stretch run while empty. ALWAYS LAUGHING never menaced. PIGALLE was through early,
dropped back readily. HEART SPIN had a steady fade. BRYLEE never a factor throughout.

Footnotes
RAVELLA speed to the front, stayed clear good handling wrapped up to the wire as tons the best. BRITTLE AND YOO inside position throughout, kept on
while no match, held place. STORY HOUR chased winner to far turn, stayed game stretch, missed place spot. FOXY DIVA no speed to far turn, rallied in
the stretch to improve position. IN MY OPINION outside run throughout, improved position from far turn late. LUCY'S CAKES FLY saved ground to no avail,
no late response when needed. WORRY FREE inside positon to far turn faded in the stretch run. QUARIA BRAVA good position never far back to far turn,
faded back in stretch. WICKED INTENT never factorered throughout. SOCIAL MANDATE wide first turn while close to laeaders, off rail to far turn, came
widest into stretch run fading back. HATTIE M had a ardy start, rushed, gave way at the half, dropped far back.

Footnotes
CHIPPEWA chased outside, strong bid dueled quarter pole to eighth pole, cleared in the late going and kept on gamely to hold sway. QUEEN TAPITURE
bit tardy, rushed inside to turn, angled five wide past quater pole, rallied on in the stretch run for place. RECITE had an awkward start, unhurried to turn,
rallied in the stretch for show. ALL THE ENVY good position to turn, outside run, bid stretch, hung late going. PROUD PERFORMER quick to the front,
dueled to the stretch, nothing left in drive. STORY CHANNEL squeezed start, no speed to the turn, bid stretch, hung late. REINA BELLA failed to menace
throughout. FOR THE BISCUIT chased from inside to the half, gave way readily. MS. THE LAW close up to the half, could not sustain bid, gave way readily.
LUTION awkward start, always back while no menace. NOW HERES THE PLAN showed no speed and never factored throughout. TESHIMA was through
early, dropped back readily.
