Footnotes
SISTER RULER broke a touch inwardly, stalked outside of the pace setter, chased before bidding at the furlong grounds, then drove clear in the final
sixteenth. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) set the pace along the inside, maintained a margin from an outer chaser through upper stretch, but was collared at the
furlong grounds, gave way entering the final sixteenth, and lasted for place. MARY JACK laid off of the pace in the two path, saved ground turning for home,
shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on well in the final furlong, but ran out of ground to reach place. SUFFRAGETTE trailed along the inside,
and never got involved. QUEEN'S MISSION tracked outside of the top pair, but gave way in the four to five paths around the turn.

JUJU NINETEEN laid off of the pace three to four wide, gained while fanning five wide entering the lane, sustained a bid coming to midstretch, and edged
clear. DEMON HUNTER tracked two to three wide, bid turning for home, floated four wide and between horses entering the lane, vied among foes through
midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the final furlong. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT trailed along the inside, cut the gap around the far turn, tipped two,
then three, wide and between horses entering the lane, but only produced a mild kick. HALF A DOODLE stalked along the inside, bid outside of the leader
around the far turn, led nearing the lane, but met a trio of outer bids in upper stretch, and gave way in the final furlong. BLUE RIDGE RED ran off and
opened up around the first turn, but was headed by a pair of bidders at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
BLURT vied three to two wide around the first turn, drew clear with five furlongs to go, relaxed in hand on the front end as foes closed in turning for home,
but responded readily and shook away in upper stretch, then held sway under a drive. MAX PANDOWDY tracked from midpack along the inside, moved
forward to gain place from outer rivals with a half mile to go, stalked behind the leader around the far turn, then failed to keep pace with that one in upper
stretch, battled for place through the final furlong, and held. MINISTRY OF ART bobbled at the start, stalked two to three wide, pursued two wide and
between horses turning for home, dueled for place with an inner foe through the final furlong, but was denied. DA GOLD ROOM laid off of the pace in the
three path, gained four wide into the far turn to be within striking range turning for home, but hung on his left lead while flattening out in upper stretch, and
weakened. ANICLUDE lacked speed in the two to five paths, and failed to factor. OKUDAH vied along the inside of the eventual winner early on, backed off
to stalk two wide down the backstretch, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole, pulled up in the final furlong, and walked off.

HEARTTHROB HALO snagged the outer part of the gate while breaking slow, recovered early on to track along the inside, shifted outside of the top trio in
upper stretch, ranged up outside of the leader at the furlong grounds, led entering the final sixteenth, and edged away. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW
prompted the pace three wide, led entering the lane, cleared before an outer rival menaced in midstretch, and was worn down a sixteenth from home. WAR
TROLLEY took a bump from an inner rival at the start, lagged behind in the two path into the turn, cut the gap in the five path entering the lane, dove
inwardly while picking up stride rallied in the two to three paths in midstretch, and offered a belated charge. EDDIE'S HUMOR bobbled a bit outwardly and
bumped a rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path, came into the lane in the six path, and moved up. REVERENT dueled for the lead two wide and
between horses, and gave way while creating tight quarters for his inner counterpart in upper stretch. CHIEFWEAVE dueled for the lead inside of a pair of
rivals, but yielded in upper stretch before being put to tight rail quarters leaving the three sixteenths pole. K T'S JILTED GROOM lacked speed in the two
path, and made little impact. MAGNOLIA RIDGE pursued from midpack in the four path, but weakened through the final furlong. REVERENT WAS
DISQUALIFED AND PLACED SIXTH FOR INTERFERING CHIEFWEAVE IN UPPER STRETCH.

Footnotes
HANG THE MOON laid off of the pace in the four to six paths, swung to the eleven path at the three sixteenths pole, rallied in the outer part of the track to
drive pat the leaders at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. BEYOND DOUBT tracked in the five path and between horses, tipped outside of a bidding foe
and to the eight path turning for home, bid in the nine path leaving the quarter pole, led in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival passing the
furlong pole. TITLED LADY stalked her entry-mate from the six path, bid outside of that one and from the seven path turning for home, vied as an outer rival
bid alongside at the quarter pole, but leaned inwardly while hanging on her left lead between horses in upper stretch, and failed to match strides with a pair
of outer rivals at the furlong grounds. VARMLANDER set the pace in the five path, resisted her outer entry-mate's challenge turning for home, but gave way
to wider foes in midstretch. PASTA SALAD RHONDA stalked in the four path and between horses, then from the five path around the far turn, but lacked a
bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, and failed to menace. DESSERT FIRST tracked inside of rivals while in the three to four paths around the turn, then
chased entering the lane before yielding.

VALE MALE laid off of the pace in the four path, gained into the far turn, sustained a bid in upper stretch, and drove clear late. VISIONOFWILDTIMES vied
for the lead along the inside of a rival, dug in to resist a different foe's bid nearing the furlong grounds, proved no match in the final sixteenth, and lasted for
place. SPELLBINDING laid off of the pace along the inside, inched closer four to five wide around the far turn, and stayed on evenly. ALLIACEOUS was
pinched by between horses at the start, trailed around both turns, shifted outside of rivals in midstretch, and moved up. MISS KENNEDY was bumped by an
inner rival into an outer foe at the start, tracked two to three wide, then lacked a four wide bid between horses through the lane. SPECIAL CONNECTION
took a mild bump from an inner rival soon after the start, vied two wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane. SKY HIGH SUSAN broke out and
bumped a rival a the start, stalked along the inside, and gave way.

MAASAI WARRIOR vied inside of a keen rival while in the five path, and drew off under driving pressure. CAROOM trailed in the six path, gained show into
the far turn, and sustained a rally to gain place at the sixteenth pole. MONJID stalked in the seven path, and stayed on. MO TIME AT ALL got bumped by an
inner rival causing him to get rank at the start, shifted out soon after, but ran off into the first turn, led in the six path around that bend, continued to pull while
vying with an inner rival around the far turn and weakened in upper stretch. BIG COMMERCE broke out and bumped a rival at the start, lacked speed in the
six path, and failed to factor. RUMBLE READY laid off of the pace inside of rivals and in the five path, and made little impact. MEANT TO BE LUCKY
steadied between horses entering the first turn, tracked from the seven path, and gave way. MASK PATROL lacked speed while hung in the eight to nine
paths around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BIG BOO vied three wide, drew clear into the far turn, and was driven home. DOUBLE ON THE RED trailed, gained four wide around the far turn, and
sustained his charge to reach place in the final furlong. OUR HEATSEEKER vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his
outer counterpart into the far turn, and faded. RUN ON ACES lacked speed along the inside, gave way down the backstretch, yet regained stride while
shifting five wide in upper stretch, and moved up. PRINCE PERFECTA chased two to three wide, and lacked a bid. SEA OF LIGHT vied for the lead inside
of a pair of foes, but failed to keep pace after a half mile, and weakened.
