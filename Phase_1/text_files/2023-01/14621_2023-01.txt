HASHTAG WINNER lagged back to far turn, angled out widest into the stretch, continued on with a late rush in time under stout handling. TEXAS MAGIC
secured good position to far turn, rallied in the stretch outside for a short lead but outgamed to the wire and settled for the place spot in a game effort.
COMPLETE tracking to pair tired, far turn, dueled stretch run, faltered. A REAL HERO no speed to far turn, angled out into stretch to improve late.
PRINCESS NINA never far back throughout while evenly with no response. TILTINGATWINDMILLS inside run to stretch angled out for run with no late
gain. TAPERINEA speed to the front, opened up to the half, nothing left from turn. NEVERSAYNOLETSGO had a slow start while far back with no response
when needed. ELUSIVE JUSTICE chased pace to quarter pole but came up empty and faded back readily. NO FRACTIONAL TIMES DUE TO A TIMING
MALFUNCTION. FRACTIONAL TIMES ADDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
