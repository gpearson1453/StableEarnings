Footnotes
EVERLYN'S ANGEL set the pace from under pressure early then inched away down the backstretch and was kept to task in the drive. MO SMOKING was
allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up from the two path down the backstretch and close well in the stretch but was not enough. MOR KISSES
pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn then tracked the leader through the final turn and weakened. TENSAS BERTIE saved ground
throughout, made a rail bid on the final turn and finished evenly. TAP IRON FIST was unhurried around the first turn while saving ground then moved out to
two wide at the three eighths pole to make a mild bid and flattened out. MOONLIGHTMADDY was forwardly placed to the three sixteenths and faded.
MIDNIGHT FAITH was allowed to settle around the first turn then went three wide at the half pole to move up on the backstretch, went four wide into upper
stretch but failed to sustain the bid.

LOVE TO LEARN tracked the leaders around the first turn from the three path then pressed the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leader at the three
sixteenths pole and took the lead at the top of the stretch and held on. PRINCESS TRINA was within striking distance around the first turn then moved out
to three wide at the half pole to vie for the lead down the backstretch, went three wide in upper stretch and just missed. HURRICANE TIZWAY was hustled
to the front from under pressure to the final turn then was headed at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. MISS BILLIE K saved ground from off the
pace around the first turn then settled in the middle of the pack down the backstretch moved out to three wide at the five sixteenths pole and flattened out in
the stretch. KICK N KISS was allowed to settle to the final turn then made a mild bid but only passed tiring rivals. FOURSWEETNIECES pressed the pace
to the half pole from the inside and retreated. COUNTRY DREAM was not a threat.

Footnotes
VIKING LEGACY went to the front to set the pace from the inside through the final turn when engaged at the eighth pole he dug in and just lasted. PITCH
AND RUN was off the pace in the two path around the first turn then moved between horses at the seven sixteenths pole, moved out the three wide at the
quarter pole to challenge the leader at the top of the stretch but couldn't catch that one. PRINCE PERFECTA tracked the leaders down the backstretch was
three wide at the five sixteenths pole move out to four wide in upper stretch to make a late rally but was too late. SILVER CHALICE stumbled at the start,
was able to recover and pressed the pace from the two path to the three sixteenths pole and tired. COLE'S SENSATION was allowed to settle near the back
to the final turn then made a two wide bid on the turn and finished evenly. STYLING HOOK was a little restless in the gate then was forwardly placed on the
inside around the first turn and retreated. LOVE OURS was unhurried and remained back. BOSS MAN ZONG was within striking distance from the three
path to the three eighths pole and gave way.

ANDIAMO GIACOMO tracked the leaders to the final turn then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole, caught the leader in the final sixteenth and
cleared late. HOT ARTIE was roused to a clear lead to the top of the stretch and battled to the wire but gave way grudgingly in the final yards. MY BOBBY
MCGEE floated out slightly going into the first turn then was allowed to settle down the backstretch started his bid at the five sixteenths pole, going three
wide into the stretch and was a game third. TAPPED OUT raced near the back to the final turn then made a three wide bid to upper stretch moved back to
the rail in the stretch to improve position. RUBIGINOUS was placed off the pace to the quarter pole and weakened. POWERSHOT saved ground around the
first turn then settled in the middle of the pack on the backstretch and tired.
