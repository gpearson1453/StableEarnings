Footnotes
VIRADIA was bumped at the start and last to commence, raced off the pace under some restraint, tipped out leaving the backstretch, ranged up four then
three wide to make a bid midway through the turn, moved to the two path later on that bend, took the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, dropped in
under a right-handed crop while shaking clear in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop near the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging.
INDIAN BELLA prompted the leading duo on the inside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased inside for most of the turn then shifted three wide under
the crop, pursued the winner in the stretch and was second best. TRIPLE P disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied in the two path for most of
the turn then dropped to the rail, lost the advantage to the winner near the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch then moved out around the furlong
marker and weakened but was well clear for the show. ALICIA'S WAY broke out and bumped with a rival, settled at the rear, was urged while inside for a
majority of the turn then shifted three wide and failed to respond. SHE'S GOT GAME contested the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the
backstretch, fell to the rear while three then two wide around the turn, came out into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
UMBRIA dueled from the five path early on with TEXAS TOWER to his inside, tucked to the two path into the turn and shook away a bit coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and
held well to prevail. CRYPTO CASH six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home, offered up a mild kick to be along well clear of the rest and second best. JUMPSTER chased five wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. SUPPLY CHAIN seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. TEXAS TOWER hustled from the gate, dueled from the three path with the eventual winner to his outside, tucked to the two path into the turn
and got shaken off when placed to coaxing near the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and weakened. Please note EYE OF GUNFIGHTER
raced with no front shoes.

REIGNING CHICK four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, tipped off the rail near the five-sixteenths placed to
coaxing and angled five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to
score. BEAUTIFUL KAREN hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with EASY PLAY to her inside down the backstretch, steadily shook off that rival
midway on the turn and was set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing late threat and was caught in the final
strides to the finish. BANKERS DAUGHTER three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and tipped four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive keeping on to secure the show honors well clear of the rest. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside
down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got nudged three wide at the five-sixteenths
before angling four wide at the head of the stretch, then tired in the drive. EASY PLAY hustled from the gate, dueled inside of BEAUTIFUL KAREN from the
get go coming under coaxing near the three-eighths when in the midst of being shaken off, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MY GLORY
six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn under motivation from the seven-sixteenths, tipped six wide at the head of the
stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
ZIAERATI disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear into upper stretch,
powered away into the final furlong and proved much the best under a brisk hand-ride to the wire. PROMISEHER AMERICA was well placed just off the
pace, chased in the two path around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. AVANT
broke a half-step slow, was asked early then settled on the inside, saved ground while roused early on the turn, shifted two to three wide near the
five-sixteenths and narrowly missed the place while just up for the show. MY BETSY broke a half-step slow, disputed the pace on the outside then in the
three path around the turn, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch and proved no match then was denied the trifecta. SHIRL'S DELIGHT was very
reluctant to load then broke a bit slow, spotted the front a couple lengths, settled at the rear, went three wide early on the turn then was roused while shifting
five wide, continued five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LA GROTTE broke in then was quickly corrected, was urged along on the
outside, chased four then three wide around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
GRANNYS CONNECTION spurted away in the two path patiently handled through moderate splits, got let out continuing just off the inside into upper
stretch, drew off padding her margin before being geared down to hold well and clear to the finish. CHARGING LADY coaxed from the gate, chased four to
five paths off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for
the top one while offering up a mild kick to secure the place honors. WINGS LIKE EAGLES four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path through the turn, got let out angled four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the show honors.
GEOMETRIQUE chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to
pass tired rivals in the stretch. DOLCE SERA five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four then three wide for home and made no impact. SOURCING NETWORK coaxed from the start, chased four to five paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn pushed along from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired. CARATS AND CAKE forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the
turn and continued in the inside route into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
D'ONT LOSE CRUZ broke in at the start bumping BELT PARKWAY in tandem with MACDONOUGH, chased just off the inside in aim of the front, tucked
inside through the turn coming under light coaxing midway, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the rail to take command just outside the
eighth pole, then edged away to the finish to prevail. STARQUIST chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the
turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. WHAT'S UP BRO coaxed from
the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide before tucking inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat
and was collared near the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. GOLD IN THEM HILLS four wide in aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. MACDONOUGH broke out at the start bumping BELT
PARKWAY in concert with D'ONT LOSE CRUZ, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened. SARATOGA BANKER chased five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide for home and tired. BELT PARKWAY got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased three to four wide until tucked
to the two path through the turn, spun two to three wide for home, tired and was reported to have bled.

Footnotes
JOKEMEISTER displayed good speed, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, responded well under threat from his
inside in the stretch and held gamely. THE COBBLER was re-positioned prior to the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn, made a rail bid before the eighth-pole, fought inside the winner in the final furlong, was gaining coming to the wire but just missed while clear for the
place. MATTY'S MARAUDER was void of speed, moved in to save ground around the turn, shifted to the two path late on that bend and improved position
to get the show. GINNSU WARRIOR dropped back at the start, was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.
JOHN'S PROTEGE chased the pace down the backstretch, pursued the winner in the three path around the turn and tired. TACO BEAN was urged along
off the pace, went five wide on the turn and came up empty. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE settled under some urging, went four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HUDSON OVERPASS chased the pace on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn and retreated.
CENTAVO was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and faltered.
