Footnotes
SWOONATRA set a clear pace in the two path and dug in gamely under left-handed urging to hold off challengers on both sides late. LINN PIER saved
ground off the pace, closed at the rail in the lane and just missed inside of the winner. NEVER BEEN WRONG was bumped at the start, raced off the pace
four wide and rallied outside. RIA FORMOSA lacked early speed while racing three wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole, angled widest in upper
stretch and rallied belatedly. HOT BOTTOM GIRL saved ground in range, remained up close two wide around the far turn, bid in upper stretch but flattened
out. OPENTHEGATE trailed in the two path, circled six wide around the far turn and never threatened in the lane. INES'S HATS failed to menace while
racing two wide. COUNTRY JEWEL chased the pace two and three wide and tired in the lane. LOVE UNLIMITED played no factor while racing three wide.
BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL was rank at the start and bumped NEVER BEEN WRONG soon after, chased the winner from the four path and retreated around
the far turn.

Footnotes
DANVILLE stalked in the four path, received a right handed cue to bid approaching the quarter pole, took the lead in the five path at the top of the lane,
opened up into the final furlong and was wrapped up late. SUN VIKING set the pace in the two path, was roused when headed approaching the quarter
pole, yielded to the winner nearing the eighth pole, and held place. MR TITO'S chased in the five path into the turn, was under right handed urging in the six
path around the turn, but flattened in the stretch for show. REBELDE tracked along the inside into the turn but faded around the turn. DOUBLE TOUGH
TIGER trailed throughout around the six path.

Footnotes
SANTORINI settled off the tearaway pacesetter in the clear in the two path, cruised up in the three path rounding the far turn, took over in upper stretch,
drew clear in midstretch and held clear while drifting out late. KING D'ORO saved ground off the pace, made good progress down the backstretch, tried to
come through inside of the pacesetter nearing the three-eighths pole, steadied soon after, chased inside around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch,
could not threaten the winner but outdueled SCRAMBLE for the place. SCRAMBLE broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back two wide, angled five wide near
the quarter pole and had a mild rally. GOTTA LIKE HIM sprinted clear soon after the start, set a fast pace in the two path, rated down the backstretch,
responded to challenges on both sides near the three-eighths pole, led to upper stretch then weakened through the final furlong. ROCKSTAR RED
hesitated at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. CHACHARERO trailed inside.

Footnotes
DETROIT CITY got bumped by an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside into the turn, was cued to tip out around the turn and loomed up to bid from
the six path entering the lane, took over the lead and opened up into the final furlong, and was geared down late. HEYMACKIT'SJACK was slow into stride
but rushed up to press the pace from the five path into the turn, took over the lead from the four path around the turn, was roused in the five path turning into
the stretch, but evened out for place. EXCHANGE DAY had to steady along the rail early, shifted out to track in the three path into the turn, was driven from
the six path into the lane, drifted out passing the eighth pole, but kept on for show. INEVTABL CONECTION got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe
leaving the gate, set the pace in the two path, was roused from the four path into the lane, but yielded. ROCKSTAR RO hit the inner side of the gate and
then bumped an inner rival, rated from the four path into the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no factor. AERONAUT chased form
the three path into the turn but was never a threat. TOO MUCH ACTION prompted the pace in the four path into the turn, but faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
BROADWAY FORCE settled off the pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, seized command near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch
and held safe under a drive. INVITING steadied near the three-quarters marker, was up close inside down the backstretch, steadied again when in tight
entering the far turn, tipped two wide not long after, angled four wide near the quarter pole, idled while stuck on the left lead in the lane, switched over
leaving the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. SHE'S MO BUBBLY raced off the pace four wide, angled in nearing the quarter pole and was along for the
show. SWEET CURALINA raced off the pace two wide between foes, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole and never threatened. GAMBLE'S ORB
pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, led to the quarter pole and tired in the lane. REACHING STRIDE failed to menace
while racing three wide. BALLROOM EYES hopped and was very rank at the start and was always well back inside. FRIENDSHIP ROAD played no factor
while racing four wide. CINDYLOUWHO set the pace along the rail and retreated from the three-eighths marker. EXAGGERATED HUMOR was outrun
while racing two wide.

PREFECT stalked the pace four wide, took a narrow lead near the quarter pole, dueled inside of EL SOCIO shoulder to shoulder through the lane and
prevailed. EL SOCIO settled off the early pace while racing five wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, reached even terms outside of the winner in
upper stretch, dueled through the lane and just missed. D. SILO raced off the pace three wide between foes and rallied between rivals to gain the show late.
RAVE ON set the pace in the two path, was collared near the quarter pole and weakened. DUNNIGAN broke outwardly, steadied not long after, raced three
wide in midpack, edged closer five wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. EYES OF CHAMPION steadied midway around the first turn, raced
off the early pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. GHOSTINYOU chased the pace inside and faded. ANOTHER DUKE
was in tight early, raced well back three wide around the first turn and six wide around the far turn and never threatened. SUPER WICKED CHARM was
outrun inside. UPSTART GENTLEMAN played no factor while racing four and five wide. ASTROTURF was outrun while racing four wide. ROYAL KITTEN
prompted the pace in the three path and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
FAR BRIDGE chased along the inside, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the four path under left handed urging in upper stretch, and rallied to nail
an inner foe on the wire. CARL SPACKLER (IRE) got bumped by an outer foe at the start, raced prominently in the four path, bid in the two path around the
far turn, took a narrow lead into the stretch and ran on, but was caught by a late charging outer foe on the wire to place. FORT WILDERNESS set the pace
in the two path, was coaxed along the inside turning into the stretch, yielded passing the eighth pole, and held on to show. MOR THAN TOUGH raced in
midpack from the four path, was ridden along while shifting inside turning into the lane, and evened out in the stretch. MUFRIH raced from wellback in the
three path, was driven along while swinging out to the nine path turning into the stretch, and flattened. FIGHTERTOWN broke in and bumped an inner foe
out of the gate, tracked in the five path, but was tired in the six path in the stretch. HARBOR MOON rated in the six path but was no factor from the eight
path in the stretch. GREYSTONE raced off the pace in the four path, but never threatened and bumped GLIDING AFLEET late. AMERICA'S GUEST broke
in and brushed an inner foe, steadied along the inside into the first turn, was hard held while up close from said position, and gave way from the four path
into the stretch. HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS brushed with an outer foe out of the gate, trailed from the six path early and was no menace. GLIDING
AFLEET was prompted along in the four path but faded in the five path going into the stretch.

CANDY MAN ROCKET prompted the pace in the three path, took over nearing the quarter pole and readily drew clear while ridden out. PACO'S PICO
raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and ran on for the place. ABSOLUTE GRIT lacked early speed, raced four and five wide
and was along for the show. THINKABOUTIT failed to menace while racing three wide. LIVING WATER stalked pace from the rail, had a clear path
throughout and came up empty in the lane. NEWBOMB set the pace in the two path, faltered in the lane and was eased late.

Footnotes
HOPE IN HIM set the pace from the four path into the turn, tucked in to the two path around the turn, was roused and opened up from said position into the
stretch, and was much the best. MIDNIGHT HURRICANE bumped with an inner foe out of the gate and had to steady just after, chased in the three path,
was coaxed rounding the turn, tipped out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and kept on for place. BELLA FUTURE was up close between rivals in the
three path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. FEELTHEBEAT rated in the five path, was urged from the eight path
into the stretch, but was one paced. NIC'S BRO bumped with an outer foe at the start, was prompted along in the two path but flattened from said position in
the stretch. BIG DADDY DAVE raced in midpack along the rail, checked hard going into the turn, and was unable to factor. PUTIN ONLINE trailed from the
three path, had to steady slightly into the turn, was ridden from the six path around the turn and floated out to the nine path into the stretch, and was no
factor. TORETTO stalked in the six path but faded from the seven path in the stretch. REGIMENTAL COMMAND tracked in the four path but was never a
threat. ADIOS GARY raced of the pace in the three path but was no menace.

CADET CORPS saved ground well back, advanced four wide around the far turn, fanned six wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up and
clear late. QUIET OUT EAST settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took the lead leaving the eighth pole
but was no match for the winner late. ULTIMATE IRONY raced two wide in midpack early, advanced three wide around the far turn, took the lead between
foes in midstretch but was outkicked from there. GOSPEL WAY saved ground early, advanced between foes around the far turn, steadied near the quarter
pole and was no threat in the lane. DUBBY DUBBIE saved ground and failed to menace. DERZKII raced closest to the runaway pacesetter while saving
ground, advanced inside around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. THENORTHREMEMBERS played no factor while racing two wide. BENELUX
was outrun inside. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) sprinted clear in the two path, led to upper stretch and faltered.
