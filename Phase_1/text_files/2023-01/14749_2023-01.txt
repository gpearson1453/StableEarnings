GOLD N SILVER was away alertly and quickly made the lead, was nicely rated on the front end, led throughout and widened late under a hand ride.
UNBRIDLED CAUSE had good position on the inside throughout, could not gain on the winner late but was second best. KINGDOM DIAMOND was never
far back, had a mild bid and went evenly late. INTO GOLD pressed the winner and weakened in the stretch. ROLLIN SO PERFECT was no menace.
LINO'S KID contended early and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
LARRY'S ANGEL dueled on the lead throughout, bore out late bumping with SAVESOMEFORME and prevailed. SAVESOMEFORME raced in the second
flight and saved ground, rallied in the stretch, was bumped late by LARRYS ANGEL and just missed. SEEYOUINMOTOWN was allowed to settle on the
inside, rallied in the stretch and finished well. BONNIE'S BEST dueled on the lead and weakened slightly late. PRONTO CHARLI raced close up throughout
and went evenly late. NO MORE MARGS pressed the pace four wide and tired. TOTAL SMOKESHOW contended early and was through after a half. MY
PINK BUNNY TALE raced mid pack, swung wide in the stretch and was no threat. OHIO LADY was no factor. THELMA LUCILLE hopped start and was
outrun. WICKED REESE had brief foot five wide and gave way.THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF SAVESOMEFORME
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LARRYS ANGEL FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING THE TAPE THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED LARRYS ANGEL AND PLACED HER SECOND.
