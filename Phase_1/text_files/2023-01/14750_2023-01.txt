Footnotes
ARROGANTE slipped through inside at the three eighths, pulled away quickly, extended her advantage and prevailed under a mild drive. AZTEC QUEEN
broke a step slowly, rushed to contention inside and was easily second. SIRENETTA chased off the pace outside and lacked a solid rally.
THEYCALLMELEE angled inside early, moved wide on the turn and was no factor. CANDY FLASH trailed far behind then passed a fading rival. WEST
VIRGINIA GAL quickly sprinted clear then stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
DATHOSS settled off the pacesetter, moved up on the turn, made a strong bid at the quarter pole, took over, drew off under urging and coasted late.
DADASHEV stalked outside a rival, moved up on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied and finished well for second. TWO COLOR MAP was
bumped and steadied after the start, raced off the pace, between rivals on the turn, rallied mildly on the rail and closed late for third. HEATED BATTLE was
off slowly, chased on the inside, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. SUNSANDDRINKINHAND was outrun early, swung wide turning for home and
closed belatedly. MANUKA BOBBY raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. MYQUIST was
bumped after the start, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. WEGOTTAGUY chased outside and tired. BAR ON THE BEACH showed good early
speed, opened up, was no match when challenged at the quarter pole and gave way in the lane. LAYNES KNIGHT raced off the pace, off the rail and did
not factor.

TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT lacked speed, advanced inside and finished well narrowing the gap. GOLDEN WILDCAT settled off the leaders inside, angled out
on the turn and continued willingly. THE MASE moved inside after the opening quarter then flattened out in the stretch. CAMP COFFEE broke slowly and
raced far behind throughout. SUPE settled close up outside for half a mile and retreated. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX raced wide down the backstretch and gave
way readily. KING SWANSBORO flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
GOD STILL LOVES ME set the pace on the inside, responded when roused, battled heads apart with SCARF through the stretch run, dug in gamely inside
that rival in the final sixteenth and prevailed late. SCARF raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, dueled with GOD
STILL LOVES ME passing the furlong marker, dug in gamely outside of that rival and battled on to the end. INSPECTOR RELOAD bobbled at the break,
raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, rallied mildly inside in the stretch and was along for the show spot. IMAGISM raced off the pace inside, chased
inside on the turn and had no rally. BE LIKE BETH chased three wide, chased on the turn and tired. YELLOW DRESS chased four wide, continued four
wide on the turn and tired. VANISHING FAITH chased close up two wide early, then three wide on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
GOLDEN BOW set the pace off the inside, widened on the turn and remained safe driving. ROSE LEGACY pursued the winner outside and continued
willingly to the finish to hold the place. PEARLBDANCING raced close up between rivals then inside and weakened. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX dropped back
early, split rivals in the stretch with some late energy. CASH ON FIRST bobbled at the start, prompted the pace inside and faded. NANA'S BOOPA raced in
midpack and proved empty in the stretch. PRINCESS EMMA JO raced within range early then faltered in the stretch. BELLA MARIA broke a bit slowly then
went evenly through the lane. MISBEHAVING LADY trailed early then caught fading opponents. FRIEDER FANATIC showed poor action racing into the far
turn and gave way. COLETTE'S SPIRIT lacked speed and was never in contention. LA ALTENITA raced wide down the backstretch and gave way readily.

IT'S GAME TIME vied three wide for three quarters and drew away under mild urging proving much the best. SOCIAL GROUP forced the pace inside then
continued well to be easily second best. FRENCH TOAST dueled between rivals for three quarters and weakened. SKILLFUL settled outside the dueling
leaders and lacked a response. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL came out slightly nearing the first turn and had his heels clipped and was outrun. JUST NOD AND
SMILE clipped heels and bobbled nearing the first turn then trailed. Following a stewards inquiry, BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL was disqualified and placed last
for interference nearing the first turn.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN CHAZZ dueled two wide for the lead, shook free on the turn, responded when roused, drew clear in upper stretch and was kept to the task.
FEDERAL CASE chased between rivals, bid at the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch run and held on late for second. LAZARETTO was off a bit
slow, raced off the pace inside, checked on the turn, rallied on the rail and finished well. HARD WEST chased outside rivals, bid four wide on the turn and
flattened out in the lane. CATCH MY VIBE chased on the inside, chased on the turn and had no rally. GOLDEN SPOKE raced off the pace between rivals,
four wide at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. SATCHEL DE RITCHES stumbled at the start, raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. PYLON
dueled inside for the lead, chased on the turn and gave way.

in closest pursuit of the winner and finished willingly for the place. LULI'S DANCER lacked speed, advanced inside to the final turn and closed well.
POSITIVE POWER dropped back early, moved very wide on the final turn but flattened out. PEARLS AND HEELS saved ground, moved closer before half
a mile and tired. LONDONDERRY trailed for half a mile then passed fading rivals. BONITA LASSIE raced off the pace in the two path and faltered. JUST
STAY HOME lacked speed and was never in contention. MADAME ROUGE chased wide and gave way readily.
