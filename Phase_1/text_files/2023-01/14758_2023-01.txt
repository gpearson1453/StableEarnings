Footnotes
THE CLUB rated in the four path, ranged up under coaxing from the five path turning into the stretch, and drew past a pair of inner rivals inside the final
furlong under right handed urging to win. HIGH VIBES set the pace in the two path, was roused from inside turning into the stretch, dug in while drifting out
slightly into the final furlong, and held on to place. MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) trailed from the three path into the far turn, swung out to the seven path under
a drive turning into the lane, and rallied down the center to get up for show in the final furlong. BALL GOWN stalked along the inside but finished evenly in
the stretch. BIG BEE was out in the five path around the first turn, tracked in the three path, was short of room around the four path in the stretch, and never
factored. TEMPORA pressed in the four path, bid from said position turning into the lane, but yielded passing the eighth pole. LAMASCO was out in the six
path around the first turn and was hard held from the five path while up close down the backstretch, tipped in to the four path around the far turn but faded in
the stretch.

TOO MUCH VINO settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. OOPSIE
DOOPSIE dueled two wide, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on for the place. OASIS JAK
pressed the pace three wide, led between foes near the five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane. LA PALMA failed to menace while racing five and six
wide. CURLIN HUMMINGBIRD steadied at the rail about a furlong in, angled five wide entering the turn and never threatened. AKELA had only brief speed
inside.

GUARDIAN ANGEL broke inwards out of the gate, stalked in the two path, shifted out late around the turn and was driven from the eight path into the
stretch, ran on to bid nearing the eighth pole, took over and drew clear under right handed urging. WEST BANK chased in the three path, was ridden around
the turn and floated out to the nine path entering the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. MAMA MARIA set the pace in the four path, was
headed nearing the quarter pole and put into a drive turning into the stretch, dug in in upper stretch, but yielded to a pair of outer foes inside the final furlong
to show. MINXY pressed in the five path, bid from said position passing the quarter pole and into the stretch, but faded. FREE TO ROAM broke out at the
start and tracked from the six path into the turn, but was no factor. UPSTREET trailed throughout from the five to two paths.

EXTENDO broke inwardly and bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path and drew off while ridden out. MARLEY LUCK chased the winner three
wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. UNIFIED WEEKEND trailed in the four path and ran on for the show. QUINCY
CAFE was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. SMOOTH RICO played no factor while racing three wide. NATIONAL UNITY was
bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide and had no response. SMART COVERAGE vied inside of the winner early, steadied nearing the turn,
chased in the two path around the bend and came up empty in the lane.

GRAND JOURNEY was out in the five path around the first turn, stalked in the four path from then on, bid from said position around the far turn and into the
lane, brushed with CHARLES CHROME multiple times in the stretch and dueled with said foe to the wire, and got the bob under right handed urging to win.
CHARLES CHROME set the pace inside, was roused from the two path around the far turn, floated out to the three path into the stretch, dug in and brushed
with the winner a few times while dueling to the wire, and lost the bob to place. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY was in the six path around the first turn and raced off
the pace from said position, was under a drive from the seven path turning into the stretch, bumped with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, and ran on for
show. IT'S A GAMBLE tracked in the three path, was in the four path entering the stretch, drifted out passing the eighth pole, and kept on. TAPSASIONAL
race prominently under a hold in the two path, tipped out to the five path under coaxing turning into the stretch, but was in tight and had to steady passing
the eighth pole. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE rated in the three path, angled out to the seven path going into the stretch, but was no factor. NEWS BREAK was
held up in the five path early, shifted to the six path turning into the stretch, was in tight and bumped between rivals passing the eighth pole, and had to
check out of it. SOUPER LEGACY raced in midpack from the four path but was empty from the eight path in the stretch. LOOKIN AT ROSES trailed from
the four path into the stretch and was no menace. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE AROUND THE EIGHTH POLE, NO
CHANGES WERE MADE.

SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL was off a step slow, stalked the pace inside, lacked a path in upper stretch, steadied and angled out near the eighth pole, bulled
through and bumped NO ACTION leaving the sixteenth pole, kicked in and edged ahead. NO ACTION prompted the pace in the three path, slowly gained
outside of the pacesetter in the stretch, was bumped by the winner leaving the sixteenth pole and stayed on for the place. MEGAN MAKIN MONEY set the
pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. FOREVER UNCAPTURED bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper
stretch, rallied between foes and was bumped in deep stretch. WELD HALL chased the pace two and three wide and was no threat. EGOZ UNIT raced off
the pace four wide, churned on outside and was bumped in deep stretch. BOTH SIDES broke awkwardly and was bumped soon after, raced three wide and

Footnotes
TRAIN TO ARTEMUS stalked the pace three wide, closed determinedly and was up on the wire. LOVE AND MONEY dueled two wide, cleared near the
five-sixteenths pole, angled in turning for home and led until the final strides. ONE IDENTITY dueled inside of LOVE AND MONEY for three-eighths and
kept trying through the lane to hold third. MAKIN MY MOVE raced in range two wide and was one-paced through the lane. GOGO SHOES was fractious in
the gate, trailed inside, tipped out in the lane and rallied belatedly. ADMIRAL HOPPER exchanged bumps with SLOT QUEEN after the start, saved ground
and never threatened. AMBASSADOR LUNA failed to menace while racing three wide. SLOT QUEEN exchanged bumps not long after the start, raced well
back two wide, swung out in upper stretch and never threatened. CONSTITUTION GAL hit the starting gate and was always outrun outside.

Footnotes
SHORT CIRCUIT raced prominently in the three path, bid from said position around the far turn, took the lead passing the quarter pole and opened up from
the six path entering the stretch, and held sway. SHE'S SO PRETTY stalked in the five path, loomed around the far turn and received a right handed cue in
the seven path entering the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. THRILLING BABY got bumped between foes at the start, trailed from the three
path, swung out to the ten path under urging turning into the lane, and ran on down the center for show. KHOSEA was out in the six path around the first
turn, chased in the four path down the backstretch, was driven from said position into the stretch, but finished evenly. MACHISIMA set the pace in the two
path, was coaxed along the inside around the far turn, but yielded in the stretch. DOMINEERING broke in and bumped an inner foe, raced in midpack from
the five path but was no factor from the eight path in the stretch. RUBYSA broke out and bumped an outer rival leaving the gate, tracked in the two path,
was roused around the far turn and tipped out to the eight path entering the stretch, but was empty. LA RUSIA was bumped between foes at the start,
clipped heels just after, then was out in the six path around the first turn, rated from the five path down the backstretch, but never threatened.
