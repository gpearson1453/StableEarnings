Footnotes
MISTER DEEKS took over while tapering to the inside and rated a slim lead, was met leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even terms
from that point, contested the edge through the turn and dug in determinedly to hold off the game stretch challenge of CRISTIANO BOY, who rated close
inside and started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, was eased to the four path on the far turn and dug in gamely under steady stretch encouragement to
take second in the final strides while being outfinished for the win. COLONIAL ROAD stalked two deep then challenged at even terms leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, relented to the winner and was outfinished for second in the final strides.
COMEONTURNMELOOSE hit the gate on exit then settled off the rail on the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, dueled to near even terms at the five sixteenths, raced three wide on the far turn then flattened later yards. ROCKET BALLAD exchanged
contact with Hardin leaving the gate and rounded the first turn in the three path, left the turn outside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn in the five path and showed little in the lane. CHARTERED COURSE settled in the two and three paths the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and took a brief slim lead three wide approaching the five sixteenths, but dropped back from between horses midway on the far turn and
weakened. HARDIN exchanged contact with Rocket Ballad leaving the gate, saved ground on the turns and could only close the gap.

Footnotes
TWEET THIS stalked off the rail, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, took the nod past the
eighth pole and dug in to edge clear late yards. REY O REYES rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met past the
eighth pole, but stayed competitive to deep stretch before reluctantly ceding late yards. SULEMAN settled in the three path on the first turn, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, eased out leaving the turn and finished well while gaining on the top two.
ICE BAR saved early ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and passed rivals in the lane.
INGREIDO exchanged contact with EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR leaving the gate and settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and
gave chase from the seven sixteenth pole but flattened in the three path of the far turn. The latter exchanged contact with Ingreido leaving the gate, rounded
the first turn in the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. LUNAR IMAGE saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. SKIP THE BULL stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on
the far turn. FEISTY KITTEN rounded the first turn about the four path, was never a factor and saved ground on the far turn.
