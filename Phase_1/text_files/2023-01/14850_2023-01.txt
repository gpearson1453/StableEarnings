WHO DAT GINGER set all the pace throughout and was kept to task in the drive. SCARLET STORM tracked the leaders throughout and made a late gain
in the stretch. SHE'S WAYNE'S was placed off the pace in the two path to the top of the stretch and was tiring but held on for the show. GYPSY JACKPOT
raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up on the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the final turn but was empty in the drive.
LITTLE Z was fractious in the gate and was never a factor. CECE WAVE broke in at the start then was allowed to settle but was never a threat. JOSIE'S
GRIP hesitated at the start then trailed the field, showing little, was distanced and walked off.

PAT ME DOWN pressed the pace from the three path then engaged the leader at the quarter pole, dueled to early stretch and held off the late closing rival.
TARGET PRACTICE had no early speed then moved up on the turn, moved out to five wide in to upper stretch for a late rally and just missed. SILKY'S
DANCE was just off the pace in the two path then moved out to three wide at the three sixteenths pole and fought gamely for the show. CLERIC was void of
the early speed and made a late run to prove best of the rest. MAD GOLD was close up on the backstretch then moved out to four wide at the five
sixteenths pole but lacked the late response and passed tiring rivals. GENIUS rushed up the rail early then tracked the leader from the inside to the three
sixteenths pole and gave way. OGA BEAR went to a pressured lead to the quarter pole then dueled to early stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DALLAS GOLD raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn then steadied at the five sixteenths pole, made a rebid from four wide at the three sixteenths
pole and closed fastest to be up at the wire. BODE'S LIGHT settle in the middle of the pack in the two path down the backstretch then made a three wide
bid at the quarter pole for a late rally to be up at the wire. SCREENPLAY took the lead to set the pace, drew away on the backstretch but was nailed at the
wire. VALIANT DEFENDER was unhurried to the final turn then made a four to five wide bid in upper stretch for a late run to pass tiring rivals. CHAPEL OF
DREAMS saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack, made a rail bid at the three eighths pole but lacked the late response in the stretch. MACHO
MARK hesitated at the start and was not a threat. DOUBLE PRIORITY tracked the leaders down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the five
sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. VEGAS GUY was off the pace to the three eighths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
DANCIN WITH ANGELS stalked the pace down the backstretch made a three wide bid at the three sixteenths pole to take the lead at the eighth pole and
just lasted. CREEKMORE chased the leaders down the backstretch then hugged the rail into the stretch but couldn't catch the winner but held the place.
MCLEAN raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch to make a late run and just missed the place.
COLONEL KLINK raced near the back from the inside down the backstretch, moved out to four wide in upper stretch and close well but was too late. HEZA
WAY MAKER was void of the early speed and passed tiring rivals. ROYAL CONSORT charged to a clear lead to the end of the bend and tired. JUSTIN
SPEIGHT veered out at the start then tracked the leaders to the top of the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CLASSIC RED RACER shot to a clear lead and was kept to task in the stretch. CORN SOUP was forwardly placed and was asked at the quarter pole for a
late gain. ETBAUER'S SECRET broke out at the start, raced in the middle of the pack from the three path then made a rail bid and held the show.
GILDERSLEEVE had no early speed then moved out the five to six wide in upper stretch for a late rally. SOUTH AL SPARKY raced in the middle of the
pack then made a four wide bid in upper stretch but faltered. BIG SESSY tracked the leaders to the turn then made a rail bid but failed to menace.
AMAZING AMERICAN raced near the back and was not a factor. SPRY CHARLIE stalked the pace and retreated. PRICED RIGHT was not a threat.
DA'MONEY ALARM was through early.
