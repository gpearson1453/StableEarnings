Footnotes
CAIRO SUGAR two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to knock heads with that rival before taking sole command near the half mile pole,
tucked inside through the turn and shook away, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a light drive to prevail. TWO
REDHEADS stumbled at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, proved no match for the
top one while running on to secure the place honors. DREAM ON CARA coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, kept on to procure the show honors. THE SPLENDID ONE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the
turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. LAVON coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide
under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. BERNING HONOR showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure
from the eventual winner, conceded the front near the half mile pole and chased along the inside through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths
and fading, went five wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
KNOW IT ALL AUDREY brushed with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside of two foes, ranged to the front in the four path midway through the
turn, kicked clear into upper stretch then drifted out some, extended the advantage under the crop into the final furlong then was placed under a hand-ride
outside the sixteenth-pole and was eased up with a diminishing lead late while best. MIA BEA STAR settled on the outside, moved in late on the
backstretch, was roused two to three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly to safely secure the place. BUSTIN BAY
broke out and brushed with a foe then was quickly corrected while coming out in front, led for the opening sixteenth-pole then pressed between rivals, took a
brief advantage for two strides inside the seven-sixteenths then lost the lead to the winner, shifted five wide while losing touch with that opponent into the
stretch, moved out in pursuit of that foe around the three-sixteenths and tired while well clear for third. CARAMOCHA was coaxed to the front after going a
sixteenth, set the pace under pressure to her outside, lost the lead while along the rail inside the seven-sixteenths, dropped back coming to the
five-sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
WINNING CONNECTION was hustled from the start then coaxed along just off the pace, chased in the two path for most of the turn then shifted three wide,
gained to take the lead into upper stretch then shook clear at the three-sixteenths and proved much the best under steady urging. PLEASE BABY dropped
back after the start then moved in, gained leaving the backstretch, was urged along in the two path around the turn, shifted four wide coming to the
quarter-pole, pursued the winner outside into upper stretch, had the rider lose his crop at the furlong marker and flattened out but just earned the place.
NIEUWENDYK went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path while asked on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch
and proved no match for the winner then narrowly lost the place while well clear for the show. STEADY PROGRESS was hustled from the start, moved up
to press the pace, was urged along while three then four wide around the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and tired. DISTURBED was off slow
and spotted the front a few lengths, moved out at the rear then was urged along on the outside, went five wide around the turn and was no factor.
PRACTICALLYMINE was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four then five wide around the turn and capitulated. BEAR'S
CORRECT raced just off the early pace, dropped back inside the three-quarter pole, went four wide around the turn and faltered.

DOUBLE SHOT chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went
seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to score. MASKED MARAUDER chased five
then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat and
was caught in the final strides to the wire. MICROSECOND prompted the pace of DADDY KNOWS from the outside four paths off the rail down the
backstretch, tucked three wide and dueled with that rival through the turn poking a head in front with five-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, kept on to preserve the show honors well clear of the rest. BREAKING STONES lunged as
the latch was sprung hitting the near side stall and getting away last conceding six to seven lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the
inside detached from the main body at the tail of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, continued in the two path into upper
stretch and weakened. DADDY KNOWS showed the way in hand three paths off the inside under some pressure from MICROSECOND to the outside,
tucked to the two path and dueled through the turn yielding command at the five-sixteenths, back tracked and went six wide for home, faltered, and was
eased through to the finish.

CAERUS dropped back under urging, went three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed
strongly to get up late. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure, bobbled just inside the half-mile pole, controlled
the action in the two path around the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and was caught while
shortening stride but was clear for the place. MOUNT TRAVERS was hustled from the gate, dropped back under urging, traveled around the turn in the two
path, angled out in upper stretch and improved for the show. F F ROCKET was urged along on the outside, moved from three to five wide around the turn
and lacked the needed response. WINNING DRIVE chased the pace on the outside then four wide around the turn and tired. MAGNIFICENT CHROME
pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path while inside of a rival around the turn and capitulated. STRIKING SPEED broke in and was off a
step slow, was coaxed along on the inside, saved ground on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
DR ARDITO coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong and was just up in the shadow of the wire to prevail over his barn mate. NABOKOV showed the way in hand four paths
off the inside under pressure from NUCLEAR OPTION to the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn and had GAGETOWN advance outside when
shaking off his prompter inside, got displaced from the front five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came again to take back
the front near the eighth pole, shook off GAGETOWN confronted late by the eventual winner and was nailed on the line. GAGETOWN coaxed from the gate,
chased just off the inside down the backstretch, made a three wide advance on the front through the turn stacking outside the leader three furlongs from
home before taking narrow command at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong from home,
kept on to preserve the show honors well clear of the rest. HERO TIGER chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide
into upper stretch, weakened. NUCLEAR OPTION led briefly early on before pressing the pace of NABOKOV along the inside in the two path, tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and was shaken off inside that station, went four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.
GOING TO THE LEAD hustled from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside when put to coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SAINT TAPIT hustled from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn, tipped six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CALLALOO brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled, set the pace under some pressure to his outside, controlled the action in the three path
around the turn, responded well under threat from the runner-up in upper stretch, disposed of that foe inside the furlong marker and drew off under steady
urging. REFUAH settled off the pace, was roused two to three wide on the turn, gained to make a bid inside the winner coming to the quarter-pole, battled
with that foe until outside the sixteenth-pole then proved no match while clear for the place. CENTRAL PRIDE was well placed just off the pace, moved out
leaving the backstretch, chased in the four path around the turn and weakened while well clear for the show. OLYMPIC DREAMS broke in and bumped with
a foe, settled on the far outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, went six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. VALENTINO'S HERE settled near
the back, went two to three wide around the turn and was no factor. RED D G P was urged along off the pace, went four wide around the turn and failed to
respond. QUACKENBUSH was hustled from the gate, raced just off the pace, dropped back while inside to the two path around the turn and retreated. LEM
ME DRINK had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, was bumped at the start, pressed then chased the pace on the outside, dropped back near the
half-mile pole, rounded the turn in the five path, floated seven wide into the stretch and faltered.
