a good effort. MAMBA FOREVER off rail chase, bid from quarter to stretch, gamely saved show. RAVEN'S NEST tracked four wide, rallied into stretch on
wrong lead to wire. MOON WISH unhurried to quarter pole, moved up mildly in the stretch run. ASHCROFT came in start bumped rival, no sped to far turn,
outside run. SHORTLY inside speed to the front, hooked at the quarter pole, gave way. FIXITWITHFORWARD tracking leaders from inside to far turn,
surrendered in stretch. LUNA VIEJA bore out start bothering rival, never a menace throughout. ROYAL DECADENCE never contended throughout while
inside through the stretch. STAR NATION sandwiched at the start, no chance from that point.
