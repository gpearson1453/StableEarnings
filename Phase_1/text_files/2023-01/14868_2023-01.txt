Footnotes
BIG BROTHER crowded a bit at the start by BLUE SILVER then was allowed to settle in the early stages, well placed through the backstretch run, roused
four wide on the far turn, made a steady gain in the drive under right-handed urging, battled with HEZA VALENTINE to deep stretch and determinedly
prevailed. HEZA VALENTINE a bit keen in the early stages, raced close to the moderate early pace, waited for racing room while saving ground nearing the
quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker, battled gamely to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides,
while holding for place. BLUE SILVER broke out at the start, crowded BIG BROTHER but recovered quickly and assumed command in the early stages, set
modest fractions to the second turn, confronted by COUNT ASHER nearing the quarter marker, repelled that effort and battled with HEZA VALENTINE to
mid-stretch, vied between rivals in deep stretch and was stubbornly outfinished in the final strides, while clear of the rest for show. LOOKOUT POINT took
back in the early stages, not far back through the backstretch run, raced four wide into the far turn, could not match strides with the leaders in the drive but
offered a mild late rally. COUNT ASHER crowded a bit at the start, rushed up to be close to the pace into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions to the
second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and came up empty in the late stages. TAKE THE TWO TEN hopped at the start and was off slowly,
allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced nearing the far turn, lost contact approaching the top of the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
ROISTER hard sent leaving the break and established the early advantage, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, drew
clear in upper stretch, drew off in the final furlong and was kept to task in the late stages while much the best. ROARING TIGER bumped at the start,
recovered to settle off of the early pace while not far back, maintained position to the quarter marker, was no match for the winner in the drive and
outfinished BROOKYS TAPIT in the late stages to secure second. BROOKYS TAPIT forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the moderate pace while
outside of ROISTER, lost contact with the winner in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was outfinished for place, while holding for show in the
late stages. CANYON CREST allowed to settle, saved ground to the quarter marker, mounted a mild late rally and challenged for show but could not secure
that placing. ARMOUR PLATE raced four then three wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, well positioned to the
quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and tired. WILL IS CHILL slow into stride early on, lagged through the backstretch run and did not threaten in
the stretch run. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
CANDY'S CLONE prominent in the early stages, contested the quick early pace with GETAWAY CHARM, dueled to the outside of that rival into the turn,
assumed command nearing the quarter marker, drew clear into upper stretch and pulled away while on the left lead in the final stages. KITTEN CALLS
chased the fast early pace, advanced nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace with CANDY'S CLONE in the drive and outfinished MISS IVES in
deep stretch to secure the place. MISS IVES forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the fast pace from a three wide path on the turn, was outrun by
CANDY'S CLONE in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was outfinished for second while well clear of the rest for show. GETAWAY CHARM
broke alertly and showed good early speed from the inside, contested the fast early pace with CANDY'S CLONE, lost the lead to that rival approaching the
quarter marker, chased to mid-stretch and faded. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE lacked early speed and was not a factor in the stretch run. FIREBALL MOLLIE
hopped at the start and spotted the field leaving the break, lacked speed heading to the turn and did not threaten in the drive. KINDOFBLUEKITTEN chased
the fast early pace, dropped back on the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BEACHGRASS took back off of the moderate early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run, roused three wide nearing the top of the lane,
chased TEAM CONCEPT to mid-stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, came within aim nearing the sixteenth-marker and made a late surge in
the final strides to prevail. TEAM CONCEPT broke alertly and assumed command in the early going, was well rated through the backstretch run while
carving modest fractions, repelled REMEMBER SUE leaving the quarter marker and extended the lead in upper stretch, felt pressure from BEACHGRASS
nearing the sixteenth-marker, met that bid to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides, while holding safely for second. BOLD ARTICLE broke
through the gate prior to the start, lost her path at the break and was off a step slowly, was unhurried to the second turn, mounted a four wide rally into the
drive, finished well in the final furlong, could not reel in the top pair in the late stages and was clear for third in the end. REMEMBER SUE stalked the
moderate early pace, advanced nearing the quarter marker, was repelled by TEAM CONCEPT, chased that rival to the furlong grounds and weakened in
the final stages. APPLAUD THE BENCH hopped at the start then was hustled to be forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace to the
second turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and tired late.

Footnotes
SAXON SAGA hustled to the early lead, set the pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, was given a few reminder taps inside of
the furlong marker and pulled away in the late stages. APLOMBADO broke out at the start and bothered CONDORCAT, lacked early speed, advanced on
the turn, passed tiring rivals approaching the furlong marker, rallied in the late stages and was second best in the end. BIG DIFFERENCE forwardly placed
in the early stages, raced close to the pace along the turn, weakened in the drive and just held for show. PROSPECT OF RAIN crowded at the start by EL
CAPRICHO, recovered to chase the early pace while outside of rivals, swung widest for the drive, offered a mild late rally and just missed for third in the
final strides. EL CAPRICHO crowded PROSPECT OF RAIN leaving the break but showed good early speed and pressed the pace to the turn, kept close
attendance to the quarter marker while outside of SAXON SAGA, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. DOGE OF VENICE
chased the early pace, came in a bit tight entering the turn, trailed into the stretch run and lacked a late response. CONDORCAT squeezed at the start,
rushed up to chase the pace to the turn, raced between rivals while in a bit tight heading to the turn, tracked the pace while two wide to the quarter marker
and gave way in the stretch run.

WILD WAGER bumped at the start, recovered and was well placed in the early stages, saved ground while not far back into the second turn, tipped three
wide in upper stretch, closed well to assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker and dug in in the final strides to prevail. QUE SERA SIR RALPH
forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the decent fractions while three wide down the backstretch run, swung four wide for the drive, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth but could not get by the determined winner and held for place. PORT O' CALL broke in at the start, bumped
WILD WAGER and was away a step slowly, tracked the decent fractions while between rivals, ran evenly to mid-stretch, gained ground inside of the furlong
marker, lacked room in deep stretch and was up for show in the final strides. THE LONNA RANGER showed early speed from the inside and assumed
command along the first turn, set decent fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, was confronted by SASQUATCH RIDE nearing the quarter
marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LOVE OF THE SPORT unhurried in the early going, trailed to the second
turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, slipped inside for the drive and showed good late interest, while unable to impact the leaders. SASQUATCH
RIDE broke alertly, was prominent into the first turn, prompted the decent fractions to the half-mile marker, confronted THE LONNA RANGER nearing the
quarter pole, battled with that rival to mid-stretch and gave way in the late stages. AWESOME CURLIN allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground
on the second turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and finished evenly in the drive.

Footnotes
AUSTRIAN NAVY showed good early speed and assumed command in the early stages, set a solid pace to the turn, carved out quick fractions to the
quarter marker, drew clear in upper stretch, drew off in the final sixteenth and was geared down in the final strides. ALL unhurried in the early stages,
improved position on the turn, swung widest for the drive, advanced nearing the furlong grounds, closed willingly in deep stretch, was no match for the
winner in the late stages but was best of the rest. PHANTOM INDIAN prominent in the early going, stalked the fast pace to the turn, kept attendance to
AUSTRIAN NAVY to the quarter marker, weakened in the drive and held safely for third. DANIELA BELLA chased the solid early pace, raced three wide to
the quarter marker and did not mount a late rally. HALF HOPING chased the fast early pace while between rivals, lost ground on the turn and finished
evenly in the stretch run. JUMPING JILL FLASH forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the quick pace to the turn, was outrun approaching the quarter
marker and faded in the stretch. KISS RIDE GOODBYE lacked early speed and was not a late factor. CLOCHARD STREET bobbled at the start and was off
a step slowly, showed brief speed while chasing the pace to the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter marker and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ROSE MADDOX allowed to settle in the early stages, raced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, slipped to the two path along the far turn, rallied in
upper stretch, chased the leaders to mid-stretch, overtook CHANCERY WAY inside of the sixteenth-marker and finished well in the final stages to prevail.
CHANCERY WAY was away a step slowly at the start, rushed up and assumed command of the early lead heading to the first turn, set decent fractions
through the backstretch run while well handled, extended the lead approaching the quarter marker, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, was overtaken by ROSE
MADDOX inside of the sixteenth-marker and held for second in the final strides. SHEZARUNAWAY unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the
second turn, loomed in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, was outkicked in deep stretch and held for show in the final stages.
MOMMA MOCCA allowed to settle while not far back in the early stages, advanced along the rail nearing the half-mile marker, continued that bid to the
quarter marker, could not sustain that bid in the stretch drive and flattened in the final furlong. ALL DIALED IN crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly,
was a bit keen along the first turn while between runners, slipped to the rail along the backstretch run, angled four wide approaching the top of the stretch,
swung widest for the drive and offered mild late rally in the late stages. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL prominent in the early stages, stalked the decent early pace,
kept close attendance to CHANCERY WAY to the half-mile marker, lost ground nearing the top of the lane and weakened. BELLEO'S FOREST tracked the
moderate early pace, maintained position to the half-mile marker, could not keep pace on the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. EXACTLY
WENDY forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the moderate early fractions, lost position while three wide nearing the quarter marker and tired in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
LADY OF THE LIGHT hustled for position from the break, settled for a five or six wide trip through the first quarter mile, began a sustained rally from about
the three eighths pole while still very wide, shied a bit from TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS near the head of the stretch, kept to task all the way to the wire and got
the nose down just in time. PROOF SHE ZIPS broke well and was on the outside of a three horse speed duel down the backstretch, continued to contest
the early pace with JERSEY SUNSET to mid-stretch, out-gamed that one and another challenger to the inside only to lose a head bob at the wire. ROSE
OF MOONCOIN broke alertly, took a tracking position behind the developing speed duel, had to wait for racing room through the turn, angled to the rail for
the stretch run, was making up ground and challenging for the lead inside the sixteenth pole when bumped by JERSEY SUNSET then drifted out a little and
initiated another bump with that rival in the shadow of the wire. JERSEY SUNSET broke sharply and dueled for the early lead with TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS
and PROOF SHE ZIPS through the first quarter mile, continued to battle with the latter to mid-stretch where they were joined by ROSE OF MOONCOIN
coming up the rail, drifted in a bit and traded bumps with that one inside the sixteenth pole causing some loss of momentum. TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS broke
in and brushed wtih ROSE OF MOONCOIN at the break, hustled forward and was in the middle of the three-horse speed duel early, backed out near the
seven-sixteenths pole then re-rallied from the half-mile pole and finished up well. TUDOR'S FOREST chased the field early on, made a mild mid-race move
on the turn, swung extremely wide into the stretch but was unable to make up any ground in the stretch. BLAZIN BAE up close early then fell back some
going into the turn, remained in striking distance to the top of the stretch then lacked a rally when needed. GIANT KID was off very slowly, fell far behind and
lost contact with the field, trailed throughout.
