Footnotes
MAUREENLOVESFRANK tracked three wide early rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, edged clear late after a long battle under strong handling.
POLISHED GEM dueled on the lead throughout, held grudgingly after a long battle and just missed. INDY PRINCESS KOKO was allowed to settle early,
rallied in the stretch five wide and finished well to be gaining. LIBERTY BELLE had good position, on the inside and went evenly late. BOX STEP raced
close up throughout and weakened slightly late. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL raced mid pack, rallied in the stretch on the rail, put in her bid, then hung.
CATABOUT raced wide and was no menace. DESTINY'S DARLING contended early while between horses and was through after a half. CURT'S ANGEL
was squeezed at the start and trailed.

Footnotes
MIND YOUR OWN dueled on the early lead, shook clear in the stretch, prevailed late under left handed urging. YEARS AGO pressed the pace throughout,
finished willingly three wide and just missed. PURDY PUMKIN was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch on the rail and closed willingly. CALTHA raced mid
pack early rallied in the stretch, was in tight late while between horses and went evenly late. GRAY ROYALITY contended on the inside and lacked a late
response. SKY allowed to settle, failed to menace. ROSE KNOWS was outrun. MIMI'S GOLDEN RING tracked four wide and was through after a half. The
stewards posted the inquiry sign but took no action.
