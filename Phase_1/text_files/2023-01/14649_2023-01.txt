Footnotes
STONE ALLIANCE set the pace inside of a vying rival into the backstretch, inched clear while a bit off of the rail turning for home, and drew off under driving
pressure. VERO CAMPIONE was herded inwardly by outer rivals at the start, tracked along the inside, saved ground before gaining place turning for home,
shifted out to four path entering the lane, and held place from chasers on both sided through the final furlong. BROTHER JEFF broke inwardly forcing a pair
of inner foes towards the rail, settled far back in the two path, inched forward to be between horses turning for home, cut the corner entering the lane, and
sustained a rail chase to gain show in the final furlong. RONALDS GATSBY tracked in the three to four path around the first turn, inched closer in the five
path and outside of rivals turning for home, but leveled off. SPREADING RUMORS bobbled at the start, trailed, fanned from the four path to the seven path
entering the lane, and moved up. STAR READY vied for the lead two wide, chased down the backstretch, then from the three path around the far turn, but
faltered between horses nearing the lane. HARD KINGS broke out while off a step slow, prompted the pace three wide, chased the leading pair down the
backstretch, then faded in the four path and between horses turning for home. WILD FIST was bothered and pushed inwardly by an outer foe while between
horses at the start, lacked speed in the three to four path around the first turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
PESO IN MY POCKET laid close up two wide and between horses, but steadied and bumped with both of those rivals when his outer counterpart spooked
into him at the half mile pole, recovered to stalk outside of that foe and from the four path around the turn, bid in the five path entering the lane, drove clear
approaching the furlong grounds, but drifted outwardly with seventy yards to go as an outer rival rallied alongside, bumped and pushed out that bidding foe
through the late stages, and held. AFIKOMAN settled off of the pace in the two path, came into the lane in the four path, shifted outside of rivals and to the
seven path in midstretch, rallied with a clear PESO IN MY POCKET to catch in the final furlong, surged to that rival's throatlatch with seventy yards to go,
but was bumped and pushed outwardly by that drifting foe through the late stages, and was fended off. BUCKY BIK COIN laid close up along the inside of
the leading pair, but bumped with her troubled outer counterpart at the half mile pole, stalked around the turn, then chased along the rail through the lane,
and gained show at the sixteenth pole. MAJESTIC MANDATE chased from midpack three wide, required stiff urging from the rider to sustain position
around the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and ran on. IRONMAN RICHIE set the pace outside of a pair of prompting foes early on, but jumped over
the shadow casted by the half mile pole, jostled an inner rival in the process, yet drew clear soon after, remained in the three path around the bend, got
headed by an outer bidder at the three sixteenths pole, and faded through the final furlong. MESABI trailed in the five path, and was outrun. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE CLOSING STAGES, AS WELL AS THE RUN DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH; PESO IN MY POCKET WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

upper stretch, and kept on. WINNING ROMANCE trailed the short field in the three to four paths, and failed to threaten the other two.

TOPSY broke out multiple paths at the start, set the pace in the two path as an outer rival pressed, shook clear of that rival at the quarter pole, and inched
away under driving pressure. HUNTRESS FOR HIRE tracked in the four path, vied for place in upper stretch, gained that position leaving the three
sixteenths pole, and chased the leader home to prove second best. WAR SAVER saved ground while stalking, then chased along the rail through the lane.
PELICAN LANE broke outwardly along with an inner rival at the start, pressed that pace-setting foe from the three path, but failed to keep pace entering the
lane, and yielded between horses in the final furlong. SINGING EMMA steadied once rank between horses after half a furlong, then was outrun in the five
path thereafter.

Footnotes
GIANNIS stalked three wide, pressed the leader into the far turn, assumed command with a quarter mile to go, and drew off under driving pressure.
GLUCKSTADT broke a step slowly, rated at the rear four wide, gained in the three path around the far turn, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead to
reach place at the sixteenth pole. LA BOUCANE bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace two wide before clearing an inner rival entering the
backstretch, showed the way inside of a pressing GIANNIS into the far turn, got headed by that foe with five sixteenths to go, proved no match turning for
home, gave way, and lost place at the sixteenth marker. LET'S GO RANDOM stalked two wide and between horses, then chased the top pair from the two
path around the far turn, and tired. JARED THE WARRIOR settled off of the pace along the inside, vacated the rail to surpass a stopping rival entering the
far turn, then improved between horses in the final furlong. WINNING DANCE bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace three wide,
surpassed inner rivals entering the far turn, took that bend in the two path, and made little impact. OWEN THE ICE MAN broke a step slowly, raced far back
two wide and between horses, then three wide around the far turn, and never got involved. HOLY PRINCE laid close up along the inside, stalked entering
the backstretch, but weakened nearing the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
GEORGE ALLEN vied for the lead two wide, inched clear at the three sixteenths pole, and held sway. COURTMAN stalked outside of the top pair, drifted
out a path while between horses entering the lane, pursued the clearing leader approaching midstretch, and chased that rival home well through the final
furlong. GUTZY tracked from midpack while under consistent urging into the turn, then chased evenly outside of rivals through midstretch, lacked the
needed kick to produce a bid, and saved show from an outer bidder late. HELAIRE bumped an inner rival shortly after the start, raced at the rear two wide,
swung five wide and outside of foes in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly to miss reaching show. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN laid off of the pace two
wide, then along the inside around the turn, shifted back out two wide in upper stretch, but lacked the needed rail bid. BANKROLL set the pace inside of a
vying rival, but gave way to that foe at the three sixteenths pole. EDDIE'S HUMOR broke a step slowly before brushing with rivals on both sides, raced off of
the pace along the inside despite rider's urging, but faded into the turn.

Footnotes
FROG TOWN stalked two wide and between horses, pursued from behind the leaders while in the two path around the turn, split those foes nearing the
lane to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, sparred with a game inner GREEN BEANS through the lane, and narrowly prevailed. GREEN BEANS nudged an
inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a trio of vying rivals entering the lane, dueled tenaciously with FROG TOWN
through the lane, but was bested. AMANWALKSINTOABAR stalked the top pair from the four path, but was outkicked by an inner bidding foe at the quarter
pole, then chased the embattled leading pair through the final furlong. WOLF HUNTER brushed an outer rival at the start, racked along the inside, but failed
to sustain that position leaving the half mile pole, vacated the rail and chased from the three path around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and
stayed on while one-paced. BLANTON broke inwardly while last away, trailed in the three path, shifted out in upper stretch, but failed to menace. WIRED
TO GO broke out at the start, lacked speed in the four path, drifted to the seven path entering the lane, and tired. BOXSTER pressed outside of the leader,
remained a path away from that foe while between horses around the turn, which allowed for an inner rival to slip through entering the lane, and weakened
three wide at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
WHO TOOK THE MONEY continues to be excused from post parades, settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, tracked in the three to four
paths around the far turn, rallied four wide and between horses to bid along with an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, and kicked clear at the furlong
grounds. SMARTY ALEX trailed, circled rivals with a five wide gain around the far turn, produced a bid along with an inner rival in upper stretch, but failed to
keep pace with that one coming to the furlong grounds, and held place thereafter. BUDRO TALKING broke a beat slow before taking back from crowded
quarters soon after the start, tracked three to two wide and between horses, but was outmoved by a pair of outer rival while awaiting racing room nearing
the lane, shifted outwardly in upper stretch, and stayed on to chase those rivals home. BALLINONABUDJET rated back from crowded quarters early on,
settled off of the pace four wide, tugged to track outside of the top pair and from the four path entering the backstretch, ranged up to bid entering the lane,
but was outkicked by outer bidders in upper stretch, and yielded. PLAY MO prompted the pace two wide while remaining a path away from the inner pace
setter, vied with that foe around the far turn, but was also outkicked by outer rivals in upper stretch, and yielded. CITY PARK saved ground off of the pace,
retreated to trail turning for home, swung out entering the lane, but made little impact. CHARLIE G stalked along the inside, but checked behind the leaders
nearing the lane, and gave way. MAGA MAN set the pace along the inside, came into the lane inside of host of bidders, and weakened at the three
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
BRON AND BROW stalked along the inside, pursued the leading pair from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of them entering the lane, grinded
away through midstretch, inched closer entering the final sixteenth, and reeled in the leader at the wire. SWOT ANALYSIS pressed three wide, vied outside
of the leader while remaining a path from that one around the turn, led entering the lane, maintained a margin rom his inner counterpart through midstretch,
dug in as an outer rival bid in the final sixteenth, but was caught at the wire. MIKE J bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, but was
headed entering the lane, fought on through midstretch, but gave way entering the final sixteenth. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE broke a step slow, raced from
midpack along the inside, chased from off of the rail in upper stretch, and failed to threaten the top trio. BIG CHOPPER pursued from midpack in the four
path, but lacked the needed kick. WIN YA WIN broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, cut the corner entering the lane, but lacked a rail
rally. RELENTLESS DANCER bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three path, shifted outside of foes in upper stretch, and failed to factor.
CREOLE CHARLIE took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, tracked in the three path and between horses around the turn, but faded. JANETS
JAY JAY lacked speed while hung in the five path around the turn, then yielded while floating wider in upper stretch.

FOOLISH STEVE stalked the clear leader from the two path around the turn, ranged up leaving the quarter pole, led entering the final furlong, and drew
clear. DREWZANO sped clear early on, but was caught by an outer rival at the furlong grounds. UNDERDOG tracked along the inside, tipped outside of
rivals in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show at the furlong grounds. MAINTAINANCE MATT took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start,
tracked in midpack four wide, gained show turning for home, but flattened out and lost that position at the furlong grounds. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK leaned
out and bumped a rival at the start, trailed in the two path, and moved up between horses. IMPACT PLAYER lacked speed two wide and between horses,
floated five wide entering the lane, and tired. TAPPIN FORA DANCE bumped an inner rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
BETTER WATCH OUT bumped an outer rival at the start, chased three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. MUSCADINE bumped with
an inner foe at the start, lacked speed in the four to six paths around the turn, and faded.
