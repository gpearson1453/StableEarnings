Footnotes
FIESTY FIST pressed the paced from the two path then took the lead at the half pole and was kept to task in the stretch. FATHER GOOSE was off the pace
in the two to three path around the first turn then vied for the lead at the five sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. FLASHY PREMO saved
ground through the final turn while moving up on the final turn then moved out to two to three wide in upper stretch to show late interest. UNFATHOMED
tracked the leaders from the inside moved out to three wide at the quarter pole and faltered. INTO WISHING was not a factor. MAGAWILDTIME went to the
early lead around the first turn then slowly retreated. TOO MUCH CROWN was never involved.
