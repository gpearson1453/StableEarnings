at the sixteenth marker, took over and drew clear. LOVERBOY LOU vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, shook free at the top of the lane, dug in
gamely, was no match for the winner and then held on for second. CREA'S BKLYN LAW trailed the field, advanced four wide on the turn, had the rider lose
the crop at the top of the lane, rallied outside and was gaining slowly late. MAY WE ALL vied three wide for the early lead, chased three wide on the turn
and tired. EMPIRE'S SCORE vied between rivals for the early lead, dueled two wide on the turn and tired. KING'S HOUSE stalked the leaders racing close
up outside, chased on the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE ERICA dueled outside for the lead, dueled with THE BIGGEST ONE on the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch, edged away and then
dug in gamely late to hold on. CLASSY SADIE raced off the pace inside, steadied entering the turn, moved up inside on the turn, rallied on the rail in the
stretch drive, finished well and was gaining at the end. THE BIGGEST ONE dueled inside for command, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in through
the stretch drive and held on for the show spot. LIVE AID chased on the inside, continued inside on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied mildly
outside and just missed for third. PROSPERA raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane, raced between horses in upper stretch and
closed mildly. NOTHINS FREE chased between rivals, chased on the turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. CABRA CHICA raced three wide off
the pace, chased four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. AWESOME PAL raced three wide off the pace and did not factor.
SIZZLING ROMA raced off the pace between, moved up three wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and had no rally. MAGICAL ANNA raced four
wide off the pace, chased outside on the turn and faded.
