Footnotes
MITESSE set the pace inside, was cued from the two path into the stretch, dug in to fight off a challenge from RICH GIFT through the stretch, and held on
gamely. RICH GIFT raced prominently from the two path, was roused to bid from the four path turning into the the lane, sustained that bid through the lane,
but hung for place. DOWNBURST stalked along the inside, was coaxed and angled out to the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on for show.
REACHING STRIDE broke out and bumped with KISS UPON A STAR at the start, then with COUNTRY JEWEL just after, trailed from the three path,
moved up between rivals around the far turn, was driven from the three path into the lane, and kept on. LINN PIER was held up in the two path, cut the
corner entering the lane, and mildly gained along the inside in the stretch. COUNTRY JEWEL broke out and bumped with REACHING STRIDE at the start,
rated along the inside, drifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and never factored. MARILYN tracked in the five path, swung out to the seven path under
urging going into the stretch, but was even paced. INES'S HATS was prompted along in the four path but faded from the five path going into the stretch.
KISS UPON A STAR had a slow start and bumped with REACHING STRIDE out of the gate, chased in the four path but was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
DRINKS ON ME tracked the pace four wide, moved to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SAMMY'S TOWN broke outwardly, sped to the
front, set the pace in the two path, yielded to the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and just lasted for the place. RED WIND raced off the pace two wide,
steadied near the three-eighths marker, angled out in upper stretch and rallied outside to just miss second. PROPER MANNERS stalked the pace in the
three path and was one-paced through the lane to just miss second and third. DANCING DOLL bumped with QUEEN CALYPSO at the start, raced off the
pace four wide and had a mild rally. ISLAND MAGIC raced off the pace two and three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and never threatened.
QUEEN CALYPSO bumped at the start, had speed at the rail and weakened.

Footnotes
BRYCE CANYON prompted the pace in the three path, bid from the four path when cued passing the three eighths point, took the lead and opened up from
the two path into the stretch, and held clear. DIGITAL SOFTWARE was unhurried from the three path early, shifted out to the seven path under urging
turning into the stretch, and lugged in slightly nearing the eighth pole while running on for place. PLEASECALLMEBACK raced in midpack from the three
path, was ridden from the six path going into the stretch, and kept on for show. SUN VIKING broke in and bumped with EYES OF A CHAMPION twice at the
start, rated in the two path, swung out to the seven path going into the stretch, and stayed on. EYES OF CHAMPION got bumped by SUN VIKING twice at
the start, recovered well to set the pace from the four path around the first turn, was in the two path down the backstretch, lost the lead from the four path
turning into the lane, and faded. ANOTHER DUKE chased in the five path, was driven from the eight path into the stretch, and passed a pair of tiring rivals.
T VILLE tracked in the four path, tipped out to the five path going into the stretch, but was tired. EL SOCIO stalked from the two path but was empty in the
stretch.

Footnotes
PATOU ROAD pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and widened under a
drive. HITTING BOMBS steadied after the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied for the place. TIMO raced two and three wide in midpack,
swung widest in upper stretch, made some progress in upper stretch and flattened out. BUNKER HILL saved ground in range, briefly tipped out to pass a
foe nearing the quarter pole, angled back in in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. MESAORIA stalked the pace three wide and faded in
the lane. MAKIN BANK set the pace along the rail and gave way near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
VAI BELLA raced in midpack from the five path, moved up around the far turn to bid from the four path turning into the lane, dueled with PAWKY through the
stretch, and got up in closing strides to win. PAWKY brushed with ANOTHERDAYGONEBY at the start, tracked in the five path, bid three wide around the
far turn, led from the three path into the stretch, and dug in but was nosed out late to place. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY brushed with PAWKY at the start,
stalked in the three path, was roused from the five path turning into the stretch, and ran on for show. CRIMSON PRINCESS got bumped around between
rivals at the start and may have clipped heels, trailed from the two path, was cued from the three path entering the lane, and kept on. ANGELAS PARTY
GIRL bumped with CRIMSON PRINCESS at the start, was unhurried from the four path, swung out to the eight path going into the stretch, and stayed on.
MAJOR PRYCE was held up from the four path early, was ridden from the seven path turning into the lane, but flattened. MURSAL rated in the five path,
was driven from the eight path into the stretch, and was no factor. IRONY got bumped by DULCE AMBICION at the start, chased in the three path but was
empty going into the stretch. INQUIETA bumped with CRIMSON PRINCESS at the start, rushed up from the six path around the first turn, prompted the
pace in the four pathdown the backstretch but gaveway from the three path going into the stretch. DULCE AMBICION broke out and bumped IRONY at the
start, rushed up from the five path around the first turn, led from the two path down the backstretch but yielded turning into the lane.

AMERICAN OF COURSE set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn and widened under a drive in the lane. ELUSIVE MOLLY lacked early
speed, raced two and three wide around the turn and was along for the place. MUGURUZA was up close inside, tipped two wide nearing the quarter pole,
was no match for the winner and held third. INVALUABLE pressed the winner two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. SIMPLIFY (ARG) had her
head turned at the start and was never involved while saving ground. AMAZING TRIP chased the pace three and four wide and retreated after a half.

STROKES (IRE) bumped slightly with CARLOTUK at the start, stalked the leading trio from the three path, was roused while taking aim from the five path
turning into the stretch, and swept past a dueling duo in the final sixteenth to win. ONE OF ONE prompted the pace from the five path, was coaxed to bid
three wide around the turn, and kept on for place. CLAY SOLDIER pressed in the four path, was roused to bid between rivals going into the turn, led from
the rail going into the stretch, but evened out for show. CARLOTUK got bumped by LE BOIANA at the start into STROKES immediately after, trailed from
the two path, swung out to the six path under urging going into the lane, but was no factor. DEFENDED led from the three path into the turn but yielded from
the two path entering the lane. LE BOIANA broke out bumped CARLOTUK at the start, rated in the three path but was no menace.

Footnotes
LAKER MAMBA set the pace in the two path, kicked clear nearing the quarter pole and held safe under a drive. EXULT settled off the pace while racing
three wide around the first turn, edged closer five wide around the far turn and rallied outside for the place. ARTEMUS BRIDGE saved ground off the pace,
lacked room nearing the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and finished strongly to gain the show. BENELUX raced well back two and three wide and
rallied belatedly. QUIET OUT EAST went evenly while racing three wide. DANIEL SUN raced off the pace four wide, launched a four wide bid around the far
turn but failed to sustain that bid in the lane. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) saved ground off the pace, steadied near the three-eighths pole and passed tiring rivals in
the lane. OFFICER COUNTRY stalked the pace inside and faded through the lane. COURTLY MANNER prompted the pace three wide and tired in the final
furlong. STRONG AGAIN chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) was outrun while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
KAVALA rated from the three path, moved up around the turn under a drive and swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, and rallied down the
center to win. TOVIA set the pace inside, was cued to open up from the two path going into the stretch, and responded well but was caught by the winner
nearing the sixteenth pole to finish with place honors. VALIANT SHI SHI broke out and bumped TWO BEER BUZZ at the start, tracked in the three path,
was driven from the five path into the stretch, and evened out for show. FIA FIRST prompted the early pace from the three path but flattened in the stretch.
GO MIKA chased along the inside but was no factor. TWO BEER BUZZ got bumped by VALIANT SHI SHI at the start, was hustled along in the five path,
floated out to the seven path going into the stretch, and was tired. AWESOME MARINA trailed from the two path into the turn and was never able to
threaten. MY MICROBURST stalked in the two path but backed up rounding the turn. ALWAYS SUN raced from wellback in the three path but never
menaced.
