SINGALONG KAYLA saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way racing around the far turn in the two
path and held off a closer in late stretch. GALLEY HEAD saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the second turn from the two path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily to the wire. ACE UP HER
SLEEVE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the three path coming around the far bend, and
flattened out in the lane. SILVER SPRINTER saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far turn and never threatened. LIVELY REMARK raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the second
bend still in the two path and faded in the stretch. I'LL GO ALL IN raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the three path and made no bid. GET IT trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, dropped back further while saving
ground around the far turn and was not a factor.

SPEED WAY trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid passing the eighth pole and quickly went from last to
first to pull clear at the finish. SHANGHAI WARRIOR chased the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, challenged from the two path around
the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught late. JAMA DILLON raced off the pace early, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid
nearing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. I'LL FINISH led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the bend and tired in the
final furlong. AIDINGANDABETTING tracked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and weakened in the
lane. COMPASS CAY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the bend from the four path and was empty from there.

HEREBY saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, launched a bid
approaching the quarter pole and got up for the win late. GET EVEN saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show
the way racing in the two path around the far bend and dueled in the stretch, getting caught in the final strides. STREET GLIDE raced in the three path
early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn and improved position in late stretch. DIAL HIM
UP raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and improved position in the
lane. URBAN BEACH raced off the pace on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the two path and
made a mild improvement of position in the stretch. TIMMINS raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for
the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly while never threatening. LORD OF THE NILE raced in the four path
through the opening quarter of a mile, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the second bend in the three path
and was outkicked in the stretch. WICKED MOMENT raced in the two path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn and tired in the lane. LANCELOT LYNK trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground
around the far bend and was never a factor. SING ME AN ALIBI raced at the back of the pack in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
dropped back to trail well behind the field while saving ground around the second turn and was eased to the wire.

MORGAN POINT dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and drew off in the lane. HAPPY CAJUN
chased the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced into mild traffic while saving ground around the turn, could not go with the
winner in the stretch and kept on to the wire while drifting mildly. SAN COSTANTINO stalked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the
three path around the bend and chased the winner home in the stretch. CONFESSOR tracked the leaders between horses early, navigated the turn from
the two path and faded in the lane. BLAKENSTEIN dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and
tired in the stretch. GOT EM THINKING trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two and three path around the turn and was never a
factor. THE RIDER OF HORSE TWO, HAPPY CAJUN, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE FIVE, MORGAN POINT, CLAIMING INTERFERENCE
ON THE FAR TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
