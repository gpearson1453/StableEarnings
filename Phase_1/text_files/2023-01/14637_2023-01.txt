FU MAN SUE took over toward the three eighths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter, rounded the turn off the rail and was
steadily handled to widen. GRAND FIBER raced briefly clear and angled to the inside, chased the winner nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the turn at
the rail and settled for second. ROLL DEM BONES chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail, was eased out entering the stretch and finished evenly.
GRUMPELSTILTSKIN became a bit anxious in the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened the final
sixteenth. BUCKED TOOTH chased the pace inside then flattened at the rail on the turn. SHACKLED gave chase through the backstretch but flattened in
the four path of the turn. SCOTTY SILVER gave chase and rounded the turn about the six path. UNNAMED SOLDIER saved ground.

Footnotes
LA MADDALENA drew clear toward the half mile pole and angled in to set a pressured pace, dug in to the challenge of JUBASLILBALLERINA while two
deep on the turn and raced determinedly to keep that one at bay through the lane. The latter came in and made contact with Odina in the vicinity of the half
mile pole then gave chase inside, challenged while in tight at the rail midway on the turn and dug in gamely before relenting late yards. JUMPIN JACK
BRASS steadied on the chute then gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path, angled to the five path leaving the turn, dueled for third mid-stretch and
finished well while gaining on the top two. VAN HOOK angled in early and gave chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened
the final sixteenth. GREY FLAMINGO gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path and flattened in the lane. AWESOME MOON raced in tight early, gave
chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened stride. ODINA was bumped while in tight in the vicinity of the half mile pole, gave
chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the stretch. APPEALING ROAD was crowded early, gave chase through the
backstretch and rounded the turn in the three and four paths. ELLIES AT WINDSOR was through early. S S FRONTIER ANGEL gave chase and rounded
the turn in the five and six paths. The Stewards reviewed two claims of foul. First claim was against the rider of Jubasliballerina lodged by the rider of Odina
for alleged interference in the vicinity of the half mile pole. Second claim was against the rider of La Maddalena for alleged interference on the turn, lodged
by the rider of Jubaslilballerina. Both claims were rejected.

Footnotes
BAYS CASTLE rounded the first turn in the three path, rallied to the front approaching the five sixteenths pole and edged clear midway on the far turn, dug
in under steady stretch handling and widened the final sixteenth. TENNIS TAP was bumped outward and into EX RATED leaving the gate then saved
ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced five wide on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. The latter was bumped at the break
and saved ground well back from early contention, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel
for second. HOW IS SHE settled off the rail and rounded the far turn near the rail, angled out toward the head of the lane and passed some rivals outside.
IHEARTRAINACOMN veered outward and made contact with Tennis Tap leaving the gate, raced with the pace two deep and dueled leaving the half mile
pole, drew to even terms at the three eighths pole but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened in later yards. AIM'S JUBILEE stalked inside,
lacked room into the far turn, eased to the three path through the turn then flattened later yards. DIXIE YODELER rated a slim lead inside, was met and
dueled Iheartrainacomn from the half mile pole, was caught at the five sixteenths pole but continued close at the rail through the far turn before weakening.
SARAH'S WARRIOR settled close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the turn four wide then weakened.

Footnotes
MISSIONARY was reluctant to load but contested the pace from the start and dueled determinedly to clear CUPID'S SONG in late yards, while the latter,
contested the pace from the start and factored to mid-stretch, but reluctantly ceded later yards. ROCKIN CHAIR chased inside, raced near the rail on the
turn and ran evenly through the lane. JUBAY gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and finished evenly. ASTRAYAL exchanged contact with He's Clever
leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and flattened in the lane. WINDSOR'S STAR chased through the
backstretch, raced in the five path of the turn then flattened. HE'S CLEVER became a bit anxious in the gate then bobbled and exchanged contact with
Astrayal at the start, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. GETTIN SPICY gave chase, was
never a factor and raced off the rail on the turn. CURB THAT TIGER saved ground. SHADE TREE CORNER gave chase then saved ground on the turn.
