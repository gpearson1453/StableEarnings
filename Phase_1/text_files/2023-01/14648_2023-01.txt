Footnotes
ALPINE MIST was unhurried around the first turn then made a rail bid on the backstretch and through the final turn, moved out to three wide at the
sixteenths pole and made a rebid to clear late. WHERE'S AUNT J sprinted to a clear lead to set most of the pace from the inside to the top of the stretch
then was headed at the eighth pole and battled with ADDI BUG in the stretch and was out finished. ADDI BUG tracked the leaders from the two path
through the final turn then engaged the leader at the eighth pole and dueled in the stretch with WHERE'S AUNT J but was outkicked. TAKEN IT was
forwardly placed in the two path through the first turn, made a bid at the three eighths pole, moved out to three wide in upper stretch and finished evenly.
LOUISIANA LIBERTY was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved out to four wide at the five sixteenths pole to make a mild bid and flattened out.
DECORATED LADY stalked the pace from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and stopped.

LUCKY LINDA rushed to a clear lead to set all the pace from the inside and was kept to task. ANNA CLAUSE raced in the middle of the pack down the back
stretch, moved to three wide at the three eighths pole to make a bid around the final turn and was gaining on the winner, proved second best but was
vanned off. CHROME SAVAGE bobbled at the start, settled in the middle of the pack in the two path moved out to the three path at the five sixteenths pole
and proved best of the rest. LACIS JEWEL was unhurried through the first turn and down the backstretch then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole to
improve position. APHRODITES REVENGE stalked the pace from the two path made a middle move on the backstretch to chase the leader and tired.
BEYOND D'ORO was forwardly placed around the first turn and slowly retreated. KIND WAYS tracked the leaders to the three eighths pole and gave way.

Footnotes
KINGS WAGER was roused to a clear lead on the inside and drew off under light urging. DARK MATTER raced in the middle of the pack from the two path
moved out five wide at the seven sixteenths pole, coaxed at the three eighths pole, moved in to the two or three path on the final turn and proved second
best. K V TARGET raced near the back down the backstretch made a two wide bid on the final turn moved out to three wide in upper to be up for the show.
MULETRAIN settled in the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a three wide bid and flattened out. COUNT ON RAIN was five wide into the first
turn and was forwardly placed on the backstretch, move four wide at the five sixteenths pole and tired. ANGOLA VACATION saved ground to the final turn
then moved out to two to three wide in upper stretch but failed to menace. CHELSEA'S GLORY rushed up in the early stages and dueled in the second
flight from the two path to the quarter pole and weakened. D'FESTIVE CAT was allowed to settle through the first turn and down the backstretch made a
three wide bid at the quarter pole and was not a factor. HE'S A CLASSIC was off the pace around the first turn then dueled from the inside in the second
flight to the quarter pole and gave way. FIGHTING SOLDIER was hustled along around the first turn then dueled from the three path in the second flight to
the three eighths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
EMPIRE OF GOLD was hustled along to duel for the lead from between horses to the three eighths pole then taken off the pace around the turn and made
a rebid in upper stretch to take the lead at the sixteenth pole and drew clear late. SUPER OCHO (CHI) was rushed up to duel for the lead on the inside to
the three eighths pole then pulled away at the five sixteenths pole but was caught in the final sixteenth to be second best. PRIZELESS sprinted up the rail
through the turn then lacked room in mid stretch and was best of the rest. HYPERBOLIST was void of the early speed through the turn then move to three
wide in upper stretch for a late run but was not enough. SCRAPPY ARTIE broke well and dueled for the lead from three wide to the three eighths pole and
gave way. BASEBALL LOVER was last away and remained back. SIMPLY WICKED was close up early and chased leaders home.
