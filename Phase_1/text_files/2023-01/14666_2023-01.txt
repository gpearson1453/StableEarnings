Footnotes
MAGICAL LADY broke out at the start, crowded BOLD DAUGHTER and lost her path leaving the break, unhurried into the turn, saved ground to the quarter
marker, angled three wide for the drive, came within aim nearing the furlong pole, assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker, switched to the correct
lead in deep stretch and lasted over the oncoming runner-up in the final strides. MIRACLE IN MOTION tracked the moderate early pace, raced two wide on
the turn, swung four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while securing the place.
BOLD DAUGHTER crowded by MAGICAL LADY at the start and was away a step slowly, chased the early pace, advanced two wide on the turn, rallied in
the drive, finished well in the late stages, challenged for the win and place and held safely in the end for show. MISS ARROWHEAD forwardly placed in the
early stages, pressed the pace into the turn, assumed command and took a narrow lead approaching the quarter marker, set down for the drive while
leading nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace in the final stages and weakened. ALL tracked the early pace, raced three wide on the turn, swung five
wide for the drive and did not mount a late rally. RUNAWAY PRINCESS assumed command leaving the break, set the pace to the turn, overtaken nearing
the quarter marker, chased to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. GARDEES WORLD chased the moderate fractions, raced three wide on the

Footnotes
BIG STORM KITTY took back off of the decent early fractions, saved ground into the turn, improved position nearing the furlong pole, tipped out inside of
the furlong marker, overtook HILLSDALE NATION inside of the sixteenth-marker and showed a good late kick to draw away in the end. LOVELY LOLA
stumbled leaving the break, recovered to track the decent pace to the turn, saved ground nearing the quarter marker, angled three wide for the drive, was
outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and was up for place in the final strides. KINDOFBLUEKITTEN tracked the early pace, two wide on the turn, four
wide into upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and just missed for place, while securing the show. HILLSDALE NATION forwardly placed in the early
going, dueled inside of TRUE COMFORT through solid fractions to the quarter marker, shook free of that rival and drew to a clear lead nearing the furlong
pole, could not keep pace in deep stretch and weakened. MORO FIRST CLASS tracked the solid early pace, raced two wide on the turn, swung five wide
for the drive and finished evenly in the late stages. TRUE COMFORT hard sent leaving the start, set quick fractions into the turn, dueled outside of
HILLSDALE NATION to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GOOD FOCUS broke alertly, ceded the early lead to EYE CANDY RANDY and stalked that rival through decent early fractions, lost ground nearing the
quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, made a steady gain in mid-stretch while drifting out, assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker and kept
to task in the final stages to prevail. REALLY EASY tracked the decent early fractions, lost ground three wide on the turn, re-rallied in upper stretch, could
not make headway on GOOD FOCUS in the late stages and stayed on to secure place. HEZA VALENTINE stumbled at the start and was away a step
slowly, lacked early speed, raced three wide into the turn, swung four wide for the drive, advanced in upper stretch, finished well in the final furlong and was
up for show in the late stages. EYE CANDY RANDY showed speed and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions to the turn, drew clear nearing the
quarter marker, had the margin reduced nearing the furlong pole, was overtaken by GOOD FOCUS inside of the furlong marker and weakened in the final
sixteenth. MANY AMBITIONS tracked the decent early fractions, lost ground three wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not have a late impact.
VIVA LEON JODIDO chased from the second flight, saved ground on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. HABANERO KID chased the
solid early pace, two wide on the turn, offered a mild late rally but did not threaten in the final stages. WHISPER AND WINK lacked early speed, raced three
wide into the turn, came two wide into the drive and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT EMPIRE settled in the second flight while on a snug hold, advanced two wide on the second turn, battled with APPLAUD THE BENCH while
vying for the lead in upper stretch, shook free from that rival inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the late stages. BOLD ARTICLE broke a step
slowly, allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground on the first turn, made a steady advance through the backstretch run and into the second turn,
came in tight and was blocked in upper stretch, found room nearing the furlong marker, was outkicked by TWILIGHT EMPIRE in deep stretch and was
second best. APPLAUD THE BENCH allowed to settle while not far back in the early stages, two then three wide into the first turn, advanced nearing the
half-mile marker, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, battled with TWILIGHT EMPIRE to mid-stretch, could not keep
pace with that rival in the final furlong, weakened in the late stages but was well clear in the end for show. JACRODRA'S DEVIL stalked the early pace,
close up through the backstretch run, came in tight and checked repeatedly nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and lacked a late
response. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU unhurried, two wide along the first turn, three wide into the far turn, trailed into the stretch run and did not have a late
impact. HARBOR ABBEY allowed to settle in the early stages, three wide into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, continued that rally while
four wide on the second turn, outrun in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. GOOD TIME DOLLY broke alertly and showed early speed to
dictate terms into the first turn, well handled while setting decent fractions to the second turn, confronted by APPLAUD THE BENCH nearing the quarter
marker, steadied in tight quarters in upper stretch, stopped in the final furlong, was eased after passing the wire, walked onto the van and was vanned off.

Footnotes
EMILY SMILES unhurried in the early stages while not fact back, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, angled out in upper stretch, drifted out and
impeded AMANDA ROSE inside of the three-sixteenths marker, loomed inside of the furlong marker, assumed command inside of the sixteenth-pole and
drew away in the late stages. SPUN BEAUTIFUL broke alertly and showed good early speed, set solid fractions through the turn, came under pressure
nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace with EMILY SMILES in deep stretch and stayed on well in the final strides to win the nod for place. MISS
BELLA forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the quick pace to the turn, advanced two wide approaching the quarter marker, battled with SPUN
BEAUTIFUL to mid-stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the late stages and just missed for place, while holding for show. ST HELENA allowed to settle,
two wide on the turn, advanced in upper stretch, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for the minor awards. TIJERA LEE chased the fast
early pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch, showed good late interest but was unable to threaten in the final stages.
AMANDA ROSE tracked the quick early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, was bothered by EMILY SMILES in upper stretch when that rival drifted out
leaving the turn, made a mild late rally but was unable to impact the leaders in deep stretch. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH INVOLVING EMILY SMILES AND AMANDA ROSE. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
EMILY SMILES IMPEDED AMANDA ROSE, COSTING THAT RUNNER THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED EMILY
SMILES FROM FIRST AND PLACED LAST.

Footnotes
SATANTA allowed to settle while not far back, saved ground midway through the turn, circled the field to go four wide into the drive, advanced nearing the
furlong marker, closed determinedly in the final sixteenth and was up in the final strides to prevail in a game win. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS showed the most
early speed and set the fractions to the turn, set a moderate pace while holding foes at bay to the top of the lane, extended the lead approaching
mid-stretch, drifted out in deep stretch while under firm handling and was nailed on the line for the win, while holding for place. GRIT AND CURIOSITY
bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to stalk the moderate early pace into the turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, altered course when LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS drifted in in deep stretch and bothered two rivals with that action, was gaining in the final strides
and just missed for the win and place. OUR EXPECTATION chased the early pace, raced between rivals while two wide on the turn, lost a bit of ground
nearing mid-stretch, took up when crowded by GRIT AND CURIOSITY in deep stretch and was unable to offer a late response. HANDSOME GARY showed
early speed and tracked the moderate pace to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker while close up, was outrun in upper stretch, was forced to
steady in tight quarters when crowded in deep stretch and was unable to offer a late response. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE
RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS STARTED A CHAIN
REACTION BY DRIFTING OUT IN DEEP STRETCH AND RULED LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED
LAST. THERE WAS ALSO AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE ASSISTANT TRAINER OF GRIT AND CURIOSITY AGAINST THE RIDER OF
LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS.

Footnotes
CAPTIVATING BOY broke in sharply after the break forcing DRINKUP BUTTERCUP towards the rail, sat off the dueling leaders through the early going,
swung out to the three path for clear running room on the turn, began a sustained bid from the seven-sixteenths pole, took command at the top of the stretch
won by a comfortable margin at the wire. DR LOW KEY broke well then was sent to the front, held a short lead down the backstretch and through the turn
while being dogged by SGT POWELL, disposed of that foe at the head of the stretch and ran on well to hold second but was unable to fend off the winner.
SGT POWELL broke sharply and vied for the early lead just off the flank of DR LOW KEY, tracked that one through the turn, attempted to challenge that
one at the head of the stretch but weakened, finishing well ahead of the rest of the field. DRINKUP BUTTERCUP forced to steady after the break when
bothered by CAPTIVATING BOY, angled out to the four path half-way down the backstretch run, made a mild mid-race move on the turn, was getting out
somewhat approaching the quarter pole and flattened out while racing greenly down the stretch. TOP WOLF broke out at the start and came away last from
the break, angled over to the rail, after a furlong began to gain on the field into the turn, was put into a stiff drive passing the three furlong marker but came
up empty. EUSEBIO unable keep up early, chased the field to the turn, raced wide into upper stretch and was never a threat.

Footnotes
WELLSWORT (IRE) rated off of the early pace, saved ground along the first turn, well placed through the backstretch run while tracking the solid fractions,
loomed two then three wide nearing the quarter marker, collared LUCK IS GOLDEN in upper stretch, drew clear nearing the furlong grounds, was ridden out
in deep stretch while widening the lead and was much the best. DANNY MICHAEL allowed to settle while not far back early on, saved ground into the first
turn, lost position along the backstretch run, made a steady advance from the rail along the second turn and into upper stretch, was no match for the winner
in the final furlong and stayed on late to be best of the rest. LUCK IS GOLDEN showed early speed and led the way into the first turn, set solid fractions
through the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch, chased that rival to the furlong
grounds, weakened in the late stages and just held for third. PORT O' CALL shuffled at the start and off a step slowly, tracked the solid early fractions while
two wide on the first turn, advanced two wide on the far turn, swung four wide for the drive, did not produce a late rally and just missed for third. VANISKY
bobbled at the start then stumbled while in tight leaving the break, was allowed to settle, raced three wide along the first turn, advanced three wide along the
second turn, swung five wide for the drive and passed tiring rivals in the stretch run. WILD WAGER settled off of the solid early pace, raced two wide into
the backstretch run, came three wide along the second turn and did not offer a late rally. STAY LIT shuffled at the start and was away slowly, unhurried in
the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, trailed into the far turn, raced four wide to the quarter marker, swung six wide for the drive and
finished evenly in the final furlong. QUE SERA SIR RALPH settled in the second flight in the early stages, raced four then three wide into the backstretch
run, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, mounted a four wide rally on the far turn, could not sustain that run in the stretch and flattened in the
final stages. AWKWARD MORNING forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the solid early fractions through the backstretch run, lost ground on the
second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. TAM'S TIME was allowed to settle, raced three then two wide along the first turn, lost ground
approaching the second turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and did not factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
WORTHY OF MAGIC broke sharply and sped to the early lead, dictated terms while off of the rail on the first turn, well handled through moderate fractions
to the half-mile marker, held foes at bay to the top of the lane, drew clear nearing mid-stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prove best. BELLEO'S
FOREST settled in the second flight heading to the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run, raced two wide along the second turn, swung four wide
for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, gamely split foes in deep stretch and rallied in the final strides to secure the
place. MAEVE OF CONNAUGHT (IRE) allowed to settle in the early stages, two wide along the first turn, not far back while maintaining position on the
backstretch run, three wide into the second turn, swung six wide for the drive, closed well in the final furlong and was up for show in the final strides. ZELAIA
exchanged bumps with TAMANTARI at the start but recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace from a ground saving
path to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was unable to make headway in the final stages and was just edged for show in the final strides.
DERRYGOOLIN forwardly placed into the first turn, three wide into the backstretch run, prompted the moderate pace to the quarter marker, lost position in
upper stretch and weakened. GEA unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the far turn, angled widest
leaving the quarter marker, mounted a seven wide rally in the drive and found her best stride late. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) crowded a bit at the start by
DISTORTED QUEEN, recovered to be not far back in the early going, raced three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground three wide nearing the
quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. BANDEENA settled in the second flight in
the early going, three wide along the first turn, lost ground three wide on the far turn and did not threaten in the stretch run. TAMANTARI traded bumps with
ZELAIA leaving the break, saved ground into the first turn while off of the pace, lost position nearing the second turn and was not a late factor. DISTORTED
QUEEN broke out at the start, lacked early speed, raced two wide into the backstretch run, trailed while three wide into the far turn and did not offer a
response in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ZEUS' WAR reserved early, started to move forward from the seven-sixteenths pole with EL BROMISTA pressing to the inside, surged together with that
one to challenge for the lead with a quarter mile to go, engaged in a spirited battle lasting the length of the stretch and just outlasted that rival in a gutsy
effort. EL BROMISTA up close in the early stages, tracked the pacesetters to the turn, followed, then joined ZEUS' WAR in a bid for the lead turning for
home, dueled that one to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly in the shadow of the wire. BOY CHARLEMAGNE under a ride from start to finish, saved
ground through the turn, swung out to the three path for the stretch run and kept to task to gain a minor placing. GUNNIN FOR GOLD broke well and moved
up to challenge MURLOC BAY for the early lead, had gained the lead passing the three furlong pole, then was joined by EL BROMISTA and ZEUS' WAR at
the top of the stretch, held on for a furlong but tired from earlier efforts and faded. J D'S RUDE BOY pressed to keep up with the pack early but fell back
towards the rear of the field, picked up a bit on the turn but was unable to find another gear when needed down the stretch. BRONZE ONE outrun from the
start, started a mid-race move through the turn, cut to the inside turning for home, sustained the bid into the stretch and finished evenly under heavy
pressure. MURLOC BAY took command from the break, was joined to the outside by GUNNIN FOR GOLD at the half mile marker, ceded the lead to that
one passing the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the stretch. IRISH ROYALTY checked off heels a few strides out of the gate, then struggled to keep
up in the early stages, chased the field through the turn, regained contact by the head of the stretch, then bothered a tiring RAY'S REGAL near the eighth
pole while out-finishing a few stragglers. CUT ACROSS SHORTY broke alerty, raced inside of the quartet behind the dueling leaders for the first quarter
mile, was asked to pick it up near the three furlong marker and maintained position for about a furlong before tiring in the stretch. RAYS REGAL broke well
but fell well behind the pace, came under a ride passing the half-mile pole, never found another gear and was done before the turn for home. ALOHA
CHROME walked out of the gate at the break then veered out to the eight path, spotting the field a dozen lengths or more, was kept to task despite being
distanced and was gaining some on the field in the end while still far behind.
