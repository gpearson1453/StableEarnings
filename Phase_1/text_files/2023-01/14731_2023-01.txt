Footnotes
ROOKIE SALSA stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, dueled down the lane and
held a slight margin to the wire. HOT AND HEAVY settled in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two
path around the bend, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and dueled down the stretch, but could not get by the winner. SHOO SHINE raced in the middle
of the pack on the outside early, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and chased the top two on to the wire. PATROL raced at the back of
the pack in the early going, began to move up while racing in the five path around the turn and continued to improve position in the lane. ASK FOR BODE
chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and was outkicked in the stretch. STAY HOME raced off the
pace between horses through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the four path and passed tiring horses in the lane while never threatening.
GOLD WING trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid. BLACK V. K. raced off the pace on the inside
early, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there. KEVIN WITTE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back while
racing in the three path around the turn and faded further in the stretch. NEW YORK STYLE led the way on the inside through the opening quarter, dueled
while saving ground around the turn and tired in the lane.

the process, saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the far
turn and weakened late. EXCHEQUER hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to track the pace setter on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated

Footnotes
NOTAH chased the leader up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, challenged from the rail passing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch
and held that margin to the wire. ALL OUR MUNNY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the
three path racing around the bend and gained ground late. CITY HUMOR led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two
path around the turn, was caught entering the stretch and kept on to the finish. ESTILO MAGICO raced in the middle of the pack between horses early,
navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly. FALK raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, began to improve position from
the four path coming around the bend and flattened out in the stretch. THREE FOLD tracked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and faded in the lane. EL BURRITO raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, continued around the turn in the three path and
never fired. AWESOME HONOR trailed the field throughout, saved ground and was never a factor.

Footnotes
OLIVIA DARLING led the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and drew off under a drive in the stretch. PINK SHOELACES chased the leader
between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and kept on to the wire, no match for the winner. PLATINUM GEM raced off the
pace on the outside early, began to improve position while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to gain ground mildly in the lane. NIGHT
CAP raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three path and passed tiring horses in
the stretch. LI'L MISS CAMILLE stalked the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn and weakened in the
lane. JIM'S BRONZE STAR raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and faded from there.
POSH PLAYDAY raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, came around the turn in the two path and flattened out in the stretch. EAST WING
raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the three path, swung wide into the stretch
and made no bid.

Footnotes
ALMANZO raced in the two path around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the three path around
the second bend and drew off in the lane. CAXAMBAS CANDY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued
around the far turn in the two path and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. GREAT BRITAIN stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to race in
the three path early, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the three path, could not go with the winner in the
stretch and kept on to the wire. GREYZER saved ground around the first turn, raced up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, continued to save ground
around the far bend and was empty in the lane. AIRMAN raced off the pace on the outside around the first bend and up the backstretch, angled in to save
ground around the far turn and made no bid. MR MATUSCHEK raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside
for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
ZYDECEAUX dueled on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and held a slight
advantage to the wire while drifting in the stretch. CHAMPIONS DREAM bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, recovered to stalk the pace setter
on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the four path coming around the bend, switched to the inside in upper stretch and
dueled to the finish, narrowly missing. SHAQ DIESEL chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to trail the field from the two path
around the turn and ran on again to improve position in the lane. HANDSOME PLAYBOY was reluctant to load, bumped mildly with the horse to his outside
at the break, trailed the field through the opening stages, began to improve position while racing in the three path around the turn and flattened out in the
stretch. LOCO ABARRIO dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and tired in the lane.
ARMSTRONG bumped lightly with the horse to his inside at the start, tracked the pace setter between horses early, saved ground around the bend and
faded from there.

Footnotes
TAP DANCE FEVER raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path coming around the far bend, dueled down the lane and just got up for the win. PASS THE CHAMPAGNE dueled on the outside around
the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and dug in gamely in the stretch, narrowly missing. BETH'S
DREAM raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far bend and
weakened in the lane. MOLLY'S ANGEL raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and
finished evenly while never threatening. BEACHFRONT BID raced in the two path early, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, continued
around the second bend still in the two path and faded from there. BOW DRAW saved ground around the first turn, raced up the backstretch off the pace on
the inside, continued to save ground around the far turn and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
MODERN LOVE raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field well off the pace up the backstretch, began a bold bid from the five path coming
around the far turn and dueled down the stretch to hold on to a narrow win. LIL MISS MOONLIGHT raced in the three path early, stalked the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the four path and dueled down the lane to just miss, the best of the rest. LADY BEE tracked
the leader on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path and finished evenly, no match for the top two.
SEAWITCH raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the pace setter between horses up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming
around the far bend and faded in the lane. WITCHING HOUR led the way from the four path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dropped back
while saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.
