Footnotes
SWIFT RITHMS pressed the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, dropped back and shifted out four wide, came on again under left handed urging to
make the lead neat the furlong marker and edged clear under strong handling. PLAYFUL SUMMER settled in the six path into the first turn, raced a wide
trip, drifted out past the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch, closed willingly and got up for second. CHORIST with the second flight inside, offered a
bid nearing the quarter pole, kept on inside rivals but was outfinished. SUSPICIOUS MINDS broke a step slow, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter
pole, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished. LOVE'S TAVITO with the second flight between horses, steadied as the winner angled out at the half
mile pole then lacked the needed response. HERO'S DAUGHTER set the pace into the stretch then gave way. FIONA hopped at the start and was through
after a half.

swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. CAT'S RHYTHM allowed to settle, found her best stride late in the six path. NORTHERN
JOURNEY had speed from the start, offered a bid two wide into the stretch then came up empty. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE dueled for the lead along the inside
into the stretch and weakened late. BAY MAGIC was hustled along to contest the lead two wide into the turn and was through after a half. BEST OF YOU

Footnotes
CHLOES ANGEL chased the pace into the stretch, surged four wide under left handed urging near mid track and proved best. BEAUTIFUL LASS raced
outside, loomed boldly in the middle of the racetrack in upper stretch and finished second best. SEEKING THE MONEY sped to the lead soon after the start,
set the pace off the rail, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch then was outfinished. LATE DATE failed to menace. FAITHFUL SOLUTION allowed to
settle, improved position along the inside into the far turn then came up empty. GIMME CLEARANCE was through after a half. SWEETER THAN HONEY
was no factor.

GRAN MAMIBELLA never far back, closed willingly four wide under left handed urging to make the lead on deep stretch and edged clear late. MOANA'S
TALE never far back, rallied through the stretch five wide and finished clear for second. FREE TO RUN away alertly, set the pace into the turn, made strides
until deep stretch then faded. MON PARADIS slow early, found her best stride late. CLIFTONS BALLERINA stalked the pace into the stretch, loomed boldly
three wide before the furlong marker then failed to sustain that bid. AWESOME WONDER chased the pace into the turn, made the lead two wide, set the
pace until deep stretch then weakened. DANCE ON OVER broke slowly and was no threat. BOUJEE KITTEN was no factor. LINDA LOVES LACE was
outrun. TALK DIRTY was through after a half. TIMES PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

chased the pace, dropped back entering the stretch then came on again late along the rail and just missed. GRAND DEAL unhurried early, swung wide and

stretch then was outfinished. AGNELLO'S DREAM pressed the pace two wide through the first turn, took command, shook clear before a half, set the pace
to the quarter pole then weakened. DUKE OF FENWAY close up early, was through after a half.

Footnotes
TRIGZ TOO sped to a clear lead in hand, set all the pace unchallenged and won under brisk handling. GIANT CRITIC was hung four wide on the first turn,
stalked the pace three wide, swung wide and was steadily gaining ground late in the middle of the racetrack. NOT YET CHARLIE allowed to settle, swung
wide and had a mild late rally out past the middle of the racetrack. DISTORTED LIMITS settled inside and failed to menace. JUSTIN'S QUEST chased the
winner two wide into the stretch then weakened. MOTAGALLY chased the winner near the inside and was through after a half. CANDY KINGDOM was
always outrun.

Footnotes
TEAM LEYENDECKER stalked the pace into the stretch, responded readily when set down, made the lead before the furlong marker and finished full of run
in the middle of the racetrack to win going away. JEBIP unhurried early, dropped inside rivals and finished determinedly to be clear for second. RUN
ROCKY was squeezed soon after the start, dropped back to trailed, swung wide then came on again late. CONDEMNATION moved up three wide through
the turn then leveled off. COWTOWN BOSS broke in front, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the middle of the racetrack then weakened. GIV'EM THE
BIZ chased the pace into the stretch and weakened late. LONE BOY was through early. WILLIE JONES was no factor.
