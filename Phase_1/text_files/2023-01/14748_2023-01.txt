Footnotes
A GIRL NAMED JAC disputed the early pace while racing along the inner rail, opened up on the turn, remained on her left lead through the stretch and
steadily drew off while under a hand ride. HOT LOOKIN ROYAL lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and rallied.
ROCK ROSE , three wide chasing the winner around the turn, weakened in the drive. TAM CHAR , along the inner rail on the turn, moved to the three path
entering the stretch and failed to rally. SWEET TALIA lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and passed tired
horses. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF , four deep on the turn, gave way. FANCY PRINCESS raced in the three path between horses on the turn and gave way.
ICY REPLY , hustled down the backstretch, prompted the pace for three furlongs, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
PIT STOP MAN accelerated to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and eagerly pulled away under intermittent urging. SPRING THE BEAST saved
ground on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied mildly. MONTAUK DADDY chased the pace outside the winner around the turn,
drifted out entering the stretch and drifted out badly in mid stretch. ROYAL THUNDER raced in the two path between horses on the turn and failed to rally.
TOM TERRIFIC lacked speed, was four wide turning for home and failed to be a factor. SHOULDA HAD IT , rank leaving the starting gate, was never a
factor. BOONDOGGLE , three wide on the turn, faltered entering the stretch.

Footnotes
PROPER ATTIRE took over between rivals, then spurted clear of a rival to her outside when approaching the turn, set the pace under a light hold and just
off the inside, responded when put to firmer asking in upper stretch, opened up and was kept to solid hand urging to the wire. R AVERIE LYNN broke
sharply then was rated off the leaders in the opening furlong, saved ground advancing into the lane, kept on gamely and was clear for the place. LA
FAMILIA was steadied in the opening furlong, regrouped and saved ground under coaxing, shifted out for the drive and came on with some late interest.
BEHIND THE COUCH prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, gave futile chase into the lane and faded. AWESOME VIEW chased outside a rival
and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LEVISA quickly sprinted to a clear soon after the break, saved ground around the turn under confident handling and was under urging in the drive. LIL
SPINNER broke alertly, raced outside the winner and gamely chased that one through the stretch. DONNA'S COURAGE bobbled slightly at the break,
raced along the inner rail around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole and finished evenly. BRING THE MAGIC , pinched back leaving the starting gate,
was four deep turning for home and failed to menace. ARROGATES DREAM bore in leaving the starting gate, was outrun and raced along the inner rail on
the turn. MISS ANTIETAM , three wide chasing the pace, gave way entering the stretch. PRINCESS LEXI was outrun. THE BAWSE'S LADY trailed after
being bumped at the start.

Footnotes
ONLY CHILD set a pressured pace inside, met an outside challenge entering the lane, wandered outward going clear in mid stretch, dug in under strong
handling, met a bid from his inside and got the bob. LOVE MACHINE settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out near the half mile marker and
gathered some momentum, shifted out four wide continuing progress entering the lane, edged up behind rivals near the eighth pole, angled towards inside,
surged and just missed in a gritty effort. UNCOMMON VALOR , well placed tracking the dueling leaders, moved under asking and engaged approaching the
lane, drifted out to be about five wide in upper stretch, corrected and forced the issue past the three sixteenths then hung. GIVE IT A GO , outside a foe
early, dropped in and gained into the far turn, chased inside into the lane then flattened out late. NO ME DIGAS , four wide early, disputed the pace outside
the winner, stayed on to upper stretch then faded. CAIRO BOOGIE failed to menace. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , four to five wide early, was not a factor.
BETTHEOVER hopped at the break and was away last, rated off foes early, raced well back past the three quarter pole, made a mild move between rivals
leaving the far turn then failed to sustain. AUSTIN WHYLIE , five wide around the first turn, failed to menace. RESILIENT COURAGE saved ground, moved
up some into the far turn, pursued past the five sixteenths and weakened. SPIRITUAL GHOST dropped back. SO THERE saved ground with early pursuit,
stopped around the final turn and was eased through the drive.

Footnotes
JOHN THE BEAR showed speed down the backstretch, set the pace in the two path on the turn, steadily drifted out the final furlong and held sway.
MOMOS chased the early pace, failed to keep up on the turn, raced along the rail on the turn, rallied inside horses and drifted out late. LOCAL MOTIVE
stalked the pace, circled foes three wide on the turn, was in striking distance in mid stretch and flattened out. JALEN JOURNEY lacked speed, was four
deep on the turn, remained outside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. BIGMANCAN raced three wide on the turn and failed to rally in an even
effort. JACKIE A raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. TREASURE TRADITION prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way.
SHACKLED LOVE , done on the turn, was eased in the stretch.

HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , urged between rivals and took over nearing the five eighths, set the pace towards the rail, turned away a threat from DEMO
DOCTOR nearing the quarter pole, spurted clear under strong handling and held firm. BRILLIANT ICE rated in range while saving ground, eased out about
a path while under coaxing in upper stretch, kept on grinding in game fashion and nabbed the place in the final strides. DEMO DOCTOR , away alertly,
prompted the pace outside the winner, ranged up about three wide nearing the lane, gave valiant chase from there but was nipped for second very late.
FOLE'S NOTION , off the early pace, was urged along to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, stayed inside into the lane but lacked a rally. RAD
PAISLEY stalked the pace, circled three to four wide into the lane and faded. HEMP steadied off heels nearing the half mile marker, angled five wide for the
drive and failed to respond.

drew off while kept to her business. IF THEN , along the inner rail both turns, steadied lacking room near the quarter pole, swung to the three path in upper
stretch and rallied mildly. MO FIRE saved ground the first turn, raced in the two path entering the far turn, swung four wide at the head of the stretch, offered
a mild advance to the eighth pole, switched to her left lead late and flattened out. NIBBLES , sent to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the rail and
tired through the stretch. REDWHITEANDTACOS prompted the pace two wide and weakened after six furlongs. SHE'S ALL COURAGE , three wide the first
turn, was outrun. BACKSTREET GAL , done on the far turn and was eased late.
