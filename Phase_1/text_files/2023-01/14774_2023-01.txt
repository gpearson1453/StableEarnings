Footnotes
FABSTRACTION was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held
MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY safe late. MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out approaching the
stretch and finished with a steady rally. DOUBLE PERFECTION disputed the pace while racing five-wide and gave way grudgingly in the drive.
WEARENOTBADPEOPLE settled off the leaders early, moved eight-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SILVER KING BAIN broke sharply to vie for
the lead from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. INSTIGATE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ATOMIC CANDY was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the half and drew off with complete authority. THIRTY
SECONDS OUT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a steady
bid to be clearly second best. CLUB MESQUITE settled off the leaders early, moved up from the inside to be within striking distance after going
three-quarters and gave way in the drive. THICK HAZE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. FORT LANGLEY
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going six furlongs. BLUE SKYE JADE pressed the pace while racing four-wide and
weakened after going a half. PINTXOS was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and did not offer a bid.
