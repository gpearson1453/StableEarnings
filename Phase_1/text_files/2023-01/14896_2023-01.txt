Footnotes
WAIT A SEC dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by TRULY A MESS in mid-stretch, vied with that foe and edged away
late. TRULY A MESS was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage the winner with a furlong to run, vied with that rival but could
not match strides in the closing yards. LIP'S OF WINE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved seven-wide through the turn and finished with good late
energy. RATTLEME disputed the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. BETTY'S BAR was forwardly placed
early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. CAROLYN'S WAY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn,
weakened after going three furlongs and was eased late.

Footnotes
COASTAL RUN was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with BENGAL TIGER, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear
lead, increased that margin and drew off with complete authority. PALACE STAR pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, could not reach the
winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. SUMMEROFTHESAMURAI settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, angled out
further with a furlong to run and finished with good energy. SHOE GAME showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a
belated bid. BENGAL TIGER disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way to that rival after going a half. THATSALOTOFBLING
was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TIMBERLAKE GAGE lacked early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
MARGOT'S GIRL settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off.
BAKERSFIELD BABE was away alertly to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and yielded to the winner late.
LOVELY LOLA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. WHAT A WAY TO GO lacked early
foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. EXTRA SAUCE was forwardly placed early, angled out into the stretch and finished
with good late energy. BOOSICAL LADY was never far back while racing from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way. FULL OF
WINE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. REAL GOOD VYBZ was void of early foot, angled in with a furlong to run
and did not reach contention. DEELITEFUL LIZZY lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not menace.
KEEPONROCKINMEBABY broke sharply to dispute the pace from off the rail, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane. THE RACE
WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED, TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
CHASING FAME was away in good order then reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run
and drew clear. LORD BRANCUSI disputed the pace with STAND TO while racing three-wide and gave way to the winner through the final furlong. GRAY
MAGICIAN lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. STAND TO dueled for the lead from the inside with LORD
BRANCUSI and gave way after going five furlongs. YOU'RE THE CAUSE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
PISTOL POWER showed brief speed and weakened. YOU SPLIT TENS settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn and gradually
weakened. BANGO FOR BUCKS lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
JOKER MATT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to gain command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin soon after and was
fully extended to hold MOGGIE SON safe late. MOOGIE SON lacked early, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and
rallied late. LIGHT CRUISER settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position and finished evenly late.
COLOR ME LEGENDARY raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. EXECUTIVE
ACTION pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. COASTAL WATERS showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the
second turn and did not offer a bid. LITTLE RED RIFLE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a
factor. NOTACRY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going five furlongs. OUR VALLEY pressed the pace
from between foes and weakened after going five-eighths. THE RACE WAS ORIGINALLY HAND TIMED, TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.
