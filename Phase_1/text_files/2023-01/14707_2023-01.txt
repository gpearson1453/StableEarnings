Footnotes
SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD broke a bit awkwardly, had early speed between foes, rated back nearing the first turn and angled into the three path, advanced
outside down the backstretch, continued to gain five wide rounding the far turn, moved to front leaving the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. WAR
BEAT tracked the pace from the rail, waited for room in the two path from the quarter pole past the eighth pole, tipped out soon after and rallied between
foes for the place. PAPA JOJO bumped with SEDONA ROAD at the start, stalked the pace three wide between foes, could not match strides nearing the
quarter pole but churned on through the lane to regain the show late. TESTA pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led
past the eighth pole and weakened late. JERRY'S TURN was up close four wide, bid in upper stretch and flattened out. DUNKLE failed to menace while
racing four and five. SEDONA RED broke awkwardly and bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. COVERT KAT steadied
along between foes around the first turn, raced two wide and lacked a closing bid. TEPPER raced off the pace three wide, edged closer four wide around
the far turn appeared to clip PAPA JOJO'S heels nearing the quarter pole and lacked any further bids. LATE CALL was outrun inside. AWAY FROM HOME
set the pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenth pole. RACKET played no factor while racing three and four wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED
BY THE RIDER OF TEPPER AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
RAISON THE GLASS tracked in the four path, was coaxed to bid passing the quarter pole, floated out to the six path into the stretch, took a narrow lead
passing the eighth pole, and edged away under right handed urging. SHES A GIFT prompted the pace from the two path into the turn, was cued to bid
around the turn, dueled to the inside of the winner from the four path into deep stretch, and kept on for place. PROVOCATIVA stalked in the two path,
angled out to the seven path turning into the lane, was one paced through the stretch, and got up for show in the final sixteenth. ROUGH ENOUGH set the
pace along the inside, was roused around the turn, but yielded going into the final furlong. RANSOMS REWARD broke out at the start, chased in the five
path but was no factor. BLAME THE VETS always trailed around the six path.

Footnotes
SOUPER SUCCESS bumped twice with an inner foe out of the gate, prompted the pace in the five path, was cued to bid while shifting in around the turn,
took the lead from the two path into the stretch, and drew clear under left handed urging. SWASHBUCKLE stalked in the two path, was roused and tipped
out to the four path turning into the lane, and chased home the winner for place. GAME BOY BENNY chased the pace in the five path, floated out to the
seven path entering the stretch, and ran on down the center to get up for show late. ELEKTRONIC set the pace in the two path but faded along the rail in
the stretch. UNIFIED CONQUEST rated in the four path, swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, and kept on down the center. STANDUP raced off
the pace while shifting into the three path around the turn, was ridden from the two path into the stretch, but flattened. SOUPER ENERGIZER raced
wellback in the two path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, steadied and shifted back in to the two path passing the eighth pole, and was no
factor. BEE BY THE SEA broke out and bumped with an outer foe twice out of the gate, raced prominently under a hold in the four path, was urged from the
five path into the stretch but yielded. HIGH PRESS had his head turned at the start, tracked in the three path but was empty from the six path in the stretch.

NOT PHAR NOW set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. MY MAN FLINT raced well back inside and rallied
between foes to gain the place late. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE stalked the pace from the rail, was no match for the winner in upper stretch but stayed on for
the show. WAR STRATEGY bumped with NATASKET BEACH at the start, prompted the winner in the three path, drifted out in the lane and weakened.
REGAL SPEAKER failed to menace while racing two and three wide. NANTASKET BEACH bumped at the start, saved ground in midpack and went evenly.
PLENUM tracked the pace four wide around both turns and faded in the lane. GHOST GIANT played no factor while racing three wide. SELFMADE was
outrun inside. WIND NINETY NINE bumped THE BIG GREY after the start, saved ground and had no response. THE BIG GREY was bumped after the start
and trailed throughout. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
ENGLISH BEE stalked the pace two wide, seized command two wide between foes as the field swept past a wayward waterfowl near the quarter pole,
dueled inside of SKY'S NOT FALLING while continuing on the left lead to midstretch, edged clear of that foe after switching to the right lead then dug in
gamely to repel a final challenge from the runner-up. MOUILLAGE (FR) saved ground in range, moved out in upper stretch, idled on the left lead, switched
over and kicked in leaving the eighth pole, was rapidly gaining late but was staved off. BAY STREET MONEY saved ground off the pace for six furlongs and
rallied between foes to gain the show in deep stretch. SKY'S NOT FALLING had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace three wide, launched a four
wide bid around the far turn, reached near even terms outside of the winner near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, battled to deep
stretch but weakened late. PROVEN STRATEGIES set a clear pace inside and gave way near the quarter pole. BREAKING THE RULES broke outwardly
and slowly, chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. SOLE VOLANTE trailed inside. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
NITROUS CHANNEL set the pace in the two path, was roused around the turn, opened up slightly from the three path into the stretch, and held safe.
JUDGE DAVIS stalked along the inside, was ridden along while tipping out to the four path turning into the lane, and kept on to hold place. BOURBON
CREED was behind in the four path going into the turn, shifted to the rail and passed a pair of outer tiring foes around the turn, was coaxed while angling
back out and floated to the eight path into the stretch, and ran on down the center for show. GIANT GAME tracked in the four path, took aim while under a
drive in the six path turning into the stretch, but evened out late. PALACE KITTEN chased along the inside but flattened in the stretch. KISSALOT was
outrun early in the five path and never threatened. TOO MUCH ACTION prompted the pace in the three path but yielded from the five path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
EL SEGUNDO settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and
drove clear. THE BEST DISTANCE set a clear pace in the two path, was collared by the winner in midstretch and fought on inside to hold the place.
WATCH THE MUSIC steadied incessantly while saving ground through the opening quarter, went three wide around the far turn, angled widest in upper
stretch and rallied for the show. CAPTURE MI tracked the pace in the three path, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, vied to midstretch then
weakened. KRYPTON was fractious in the gate, hit the gate at the start, was bumped soon after, raced two wide in midpack, went five wide around the far
turn and never threatened. BEAUTY AMAZED hit the starting gate, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced five wide around the far
turn and failed to sustain the bid in the lane. GREG'S HONOR raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, raced at the rail around the far turn and
through the lane and made little impact. MY MANE CHAMP stumbled at the start, saved ground and played no factor. I AM RESILIENT was outrun while
racing two and three wide. MAJOR KING steadied into the first turn, raced up close inside, steadied late on the first turn, chased in the two path around the
far turn and came up empty in the lane. LEOPARDI bumped with KRYPTON after the start and was never involved while racing four and five wide.
