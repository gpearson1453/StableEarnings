Footnotes
UNCORRELATED showed speed then chased on the inside, came through along the rail to take the lead outside the three-eighths, shook clear outside the
quarter-pole, spun into the stretch in the two path, responded well when put to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, drifted out some in the final
furlong and held under strong urging. REGISTER was taken up while in tight between foes early, moved up to race just off the pace but near the rear, was
put to strong urging while two then three wide around the turn, lost ground on the leader while climbing into the kickback, steadied into the kickback outside
the quarter-pole, swung six wide into upper stretch and surged to get the place late while no threat to the winner. MO THAN LUCK broke awkwardly and
was off a step slow while brushing with a rival, chased the pace on the outside then four wide around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the
stretch and just lost the place while narrowly able to get the show. WHENLOVETAKESOVER broke a step slow then brushed with an opponent, was coaxed
along on the far outside, chased five wide around the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and missed the trifecta. PAXSATIONAL pressed the pace on
the outside of the leader, vied in the three path around the turn and tired. EE YAH broke in but came out in front, showed the way under pressure to his
outside while in the two path, lost the lead to the winner outside the three-eighths, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
JESSICA'S RACE hustled from the gate, raced six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide for home, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, then dug in under growing late threat and held
safe to prevail. JOEY THE FISH broke in a step at the start getting away awkward and conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased sluggish early on
eight to nine paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking five then four wide through the turn, began a steady advance from the three-eighths,
went six to seven wide into upper stretch, closed in with good courage through the final furlong to threat for it all on the outside but was ultimately repelled to
the wire while well clear of the rest for the place honors. DENIECE OF DEGRACE coaxed from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths pressuring the front, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive and
weakened in the final furlong while along for the show honors. MAIZE LOVED LAFFY coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand five paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, spun three wide for home, got collared with three-sixteenths to go and weakened.
AMANDA'S FOLLY bumped at the start by MISS BARB, who broke outwards, raced five to six wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide
through the turn, came inwards spinning just off the inside into upper stretch placing MISS BARB in tight along the rail, then weakened in the stretch.
DARKNSTORMY hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
tired. MISS BARB broke out at the start bumping AMANDA'S FOLLY, chased just off the inside advancing into contention five furlongs out and vying briefly
for command until shaken off three furlongs from home, got steadied when put in tight along the rail near the quarter pole, then tired in the drive. BETTING
ON A STONE hustled from the gate, chased four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, went three to four wide into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LUNA LOCA bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms in the two then three path around
the turn and drew off under a strong drive to prove much the best. BELLA MICHELLE moved out while urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on
the turn and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. MAGGIE T broke in and bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the outside, went
three wide for most of the turn, dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole and weakened then just lost the place while narrowly able to get the show. OUR
ROSIE DIAMONDS was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up while pinched back, went five then six wide on the turn and just missed the trifecta.
MAGIC MISS dropped back fast at the five-eighths, fell well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the two path and showed little.

QUICK CHAOS showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
under threat and held stubbornly to the finish to score. LIFETIME OF CHANCE four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and dug in under a drive to threaten to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the end. BOURBON
CHASE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to
secure the show honors. WYNN GIANT hustled from the gate, chased four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. WANNA WINNA broke a beat slow, chased four wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and weakened. MAMA BANNED ME five to six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. IN MY
SHADOW hustled from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home and faltered.

Footnotes
VALLARAND was hustled from the gate then ridden along off the pace, advanced four then five wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch, took the lead
outside the furlong marker, shook clear near the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. MISS CHAMITA dropped back while showing no
speed then angled in, raced inside early on the turn, shifted four then five wide later on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and got up for the place.
INFRINGEMENT moved out while urged along, started the turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide late on that bend, gained to make a bid in upper
stretch, fought with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match then lost the place while clear for the show. PURRFECT MISTRESS disputed the
pace on the far outside, moved clear at the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two to three path, turned into upper stretch under pressure from the
rider, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker and tired. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE was hustled from the gate then chased the early
pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. PAVE MY WAY moved up to dispute the pace on the inside
of a rival, dropped back at the nine-sixteenths then moved out, went three to four wide around the turn and capitulated.

SIX PERCENT settled just off the pace on the outside, ranged up five wide on the turn, made a bid late on that bend, took the lead in upper stretch, fought
with the runner-up into the final furlong then edged clear under strong urging. BALDIZAR stalked the pace on the outside, came under coaxing late on the
backstretch, went four wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, dropped in some into upper stretch, fought with the winner into the final
furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. FULL MOON FEVER bumped with a rival just after the start then was taken up, moved out towards the
rear, went four then five wide on the turn and was along for the show. DURKIN'S CALL settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, came fou
rwide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the last spot in the superfecta. BOURBON BAY was hustled from the start, showed the
way down the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. WILD BANKER broke out then bumped with
an opponent, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. ADVANCED
STRATEGY lost his footing slightly at the start, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went three wide on the turn, moved out around the sixteenth-pole
and was no factor. THERISASTORMBREWIN was well placed just off the pace, gained to make a bid at the nine-sixteenths, passed the half-mile pole on
even terms for the lead, vied in the two path while inside of foes around the turn and tired. SUNDAESWITHSANDY bumped with a rival after the start then
was taken up while squeezed back, moved out at the rear, went five then six wide around the turn and failed to threaten.

bumped lightly with a foe, was urged along off the pace, went three wide early on the turn, dropped to the rail late on that bend and improved for the show.

into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOST IN ROME pressed the pace, vied in the three path under urging on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch,
