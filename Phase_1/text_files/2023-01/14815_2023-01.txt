Footnotes
SISKIYOU SKY tracked clear leader off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail spying the leader on the turn, ranged up to leaders flank heading
into the lane and shook clear in upper stretch to win convincingly. AROUSING LOVER stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued saving
ground on the turn, eased out to bid three wide in the lane and finished up a willing second. G G RULES settled slightly off the rail on the backstretch, went
to rail entering the turn, saved ground through the turn, altered around weakening rival in upper stretch and kept to task to get up for third late. RAGTIME
GIRL sent clear on the backstretch, continued clear heading into the turn, headed by rival coming into the stretch, stayed on until the final sixteenth when
weakening and losing third late. JEANIE'S SWAN settled off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, eased out in the lane and lacked
needed response to improve. SEEKING ANSWERS stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed to launch a rally
in the lane. CINDY stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, failed to respond heading into the stretch and rider wrapped
up once rival altered out into path.

MEASUREOFDEVOTION sent clear, opened up on the backstretch, maintained clear lead into the lane, began to be leg weary final sixteenth and just
lasted. QUIET FOREST chased leader along the inside, eased into the two path on the turn, launched bid in the three path and gained to the wire.
CASILLALATER tracked leader off the rail on the backstretch, continued in the three path on the turn, launched bid in the four path in the lane and
outclosed by inside rival. SAI PHAR showed mild speed on the backstretch, began to lose ground throughout the turn and kept on in the lane to improve.
ROCK N ROLL SONG setttled three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, and failed to rally in the lane. LA CROIX off bit slow and lost
all chance to contest the pace, stayed towards the rear on the turn and showed little in the lane.
