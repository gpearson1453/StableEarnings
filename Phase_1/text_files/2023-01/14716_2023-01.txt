Footnotes
HAPPY UNION raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter
pole, and dueled down the stretch to just hold the win. SORTARIA chased the leaders between horses early, began a bid from the four path racing around
the bend, and gained ground steadily to the wire, narrowly missing. LUVISANAKI bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. WICKLOW GAL dueled on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, battled from the three path around the turn and faded in the lane. FULL TIME STRUTIN raced at the back of the pack on the
inside in the early going, came around the bend in the two path and made no bid. RED DELICIOUS tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. SUNSHINE GIRL raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, continued
around the turn in the three path and was empty from there. PER FGCC CASE #2023-009301 DATED, 03-24-2023, SORTARIA WAS DISQUALIFIED DUE
TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL brushed lightly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way
racing in the three path around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. ALIZEE tracked the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile,
began a bid from the four path coming around the turn, could not go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. NINJA
ABARRIO raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the lane. TRUE ATKA brushed mildly with the
horse to her outside at the start, stalked the pace setter up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and weakened in the stretch.
MAGICGIRL trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was never a threat. DANCIN DEE chased the leader on the
inside in the early going, saved ground around the bend and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
INTER MIAMI bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, dueled up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and
kicked clear in the final furlong. GOLDEN TONE trailed the field early, began to move up while racing in the four path around the turn and continued to gain
ground in the stretch. RIDGEPOINTE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and kept on to the
finish. TAPSOLUTION chased the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. SUNNY SAINT raced off the pace between horses through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and
never threatened. LITIGANT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and faded in the
lane. CARMENOOTZ bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, was shuffled back to race off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn and was empty in the stretch. JUPITER BLUES dueled between horses early, dropped back racing around the turn, was pulled up due to bleeding in

GODS GLORY raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, kicked clear while racing in the three path around the far turn and
drew off in the lane. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a mild bid from the three path
coming around the second bend and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. MAJOR DEAL tracked the pace setter on the outside through the
opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. HIGHLY UNLIKELY saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace
on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening.
MIRO raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and made no bid. FOREVER SAUCY
raced in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three and four path and
faded in the stretch. NOBLE AND KIND chased the leader between horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground
around the far bend and tired further from there.

Footnotes
DOCTOR OSCAR dueled on the inside up the backstretch, edged clear while racing in the two path around the turn and held that margin to the wire. NO
QUE NO tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, was blocked in upper stretch and forced to switch outside
and chased the winner home from there. ABOUT TODAY (ARG) was reluctant to load, broke well and stalked the pace setters on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile began a bid from the four path racing around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and was outfinished late. CHICKS DIG
SCARS chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened in the lane. WHERE PARADISE LAY
trailed the field on the outside early, raced in the four path around the bend and never threatened. TOPPER T raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, swung out to the four path for the run around the turn and made no bid. FEAST dueled on the outside early, continued to battle from the three
path around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
PACIFIC PRINCESS raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, edged clear while racing in the three
path around the far bend and drew off in the lane. MONTANA JOYCE raced in the three path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and chased the winner home, no match for that
rival. MS BOOMBASTIC saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, navigated the far bend from the two path and improved
position mildly in the lane. LOVE'S MISERY raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn and weakened in the stretch. BOCA saved ground around the first turn, raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch and around the far bend and finished evenly. A RING THING led the way while saving ground through
the opening half mile, dropped back to chase the leader from the two path coming around the far turn and faded in the lane. ROSE'S CAUSE raced in the
two path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, came around the far turn in the three path and made no bid. BIONDA SUPRISE
trailed the filed throughout, raced in the two path and was never a factor.
