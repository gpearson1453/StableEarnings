Footnotes
BONANA FANNA FOE was well placed behind the leading trio under urging, started the turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide while gaining later
on that bend, closed fast to blow by the embattled leaders coming to the quarter-pole then went clear, drifted in significantly while having the rider fumble the
crop in upper stretch, regained a hold of the crop while widening near the furlong marker, was flagged with the crop from the right-side once and proved
much the best under a solid hand-ride to the wire. SARAH'S PRIDE bobbed her head while restless in the gate, bumped with a rival at the start then was
taken up badly, spotted the front several lengths, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch in the three path and improved for the
place. WINE GODDESS was urged along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
weakened while clear for the show. FRANNIE LEW bumped with a foe at the start, showed speed under some restraint early, moved up to dispute the pace
between horses, vied in the two path around the turn and tired. TAKE CHARGE LISA broke out from the outside post, contested the pace on the outside of
two opponents, vied in the three path around the turn and capitulated. RENT CONTROL broke out at the start, showed good speed, disputed the pace on
the inside of two foes, vied along the rail early on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and stopped.

Footnotes
R GIRL FAITH coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command three-sixteenths from home, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. SWEET SENSATION coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for
home, proved no match for the top one while running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. WICKED LADY six paths off the inside in closest aim
of the leader, tucked four wide and advanced on that rival to take narrow command five-sixteenths from home, swung five wide into upper stretch under
threat, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish while along for the show honors. SWEET SUGAR BABY hustled from the gate,
chased just off the inside until tipped three wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and
weakened. CRYSTAL ORB coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.
ICE COLD GOLD established the front and showed the way in hand four then three wide coming under threat midway on the turn and was put to coaxing in
response, yielded command with five-sixteenths to run, spun three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
CONFIRMED GENIUS tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn, gained to make a bid before the furlong marker, took the
lead approaching the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong handling. OLIVE KAT moved around just prior to the start and broke a bit awkwardly,
went up to show the way down the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, led under a drive until just before the sixteenth-pole then was
overtaken while able to hold the place. CHLOE ROSE showed speed on the inside of a foe then between rivals, vied in the two path while between horses
on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, kept on well in pursuit of the top two in the stretch and secured the show. BACI pressed the pace inside of
foes down the backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, kept on in the stretch but lacked the needed kick. PRAIRIE
FIRE showed early speed, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, went two then three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch
then moved further out and lacked the needed response. GREATEST LOVE settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide around the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

RUSSIAN TO WIN five wide in pursuit down the backstretch and through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper
stretch, had the leader drift out in front and floated out two additional paths straightened away while rallying to collar that rival a furlong from home, then
edged clear under a drive kept to task. BIG VENEZUELA coaxed from the gate, chased four wide in aim of the front advancing into the turn to apply
pressure midway, took over command near the quarter pole and swung six wide for home, floated out two paths straightened away while under a drive and
growing threat to the outside, got collared a furlong from home, dug in and ran on to preserve the place honors over a pair on the wire. LABARDE four then
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, offered up a bid a furlong out, then kept on to the finish to
secure the show honors in a photo with a pair. DOCTOR LOVE chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then kept on to the finish. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE three wide
in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. FENWAY coaxed from the
gate, showed the way just off the inside through swift splits, came under coaxing under challenge at the five-sixteenths, yielded command swinging three
wide at the quarter pole and tired.

NO BURN brushed with a foe early, dropped from the two path to the rail around the first turn, moved to the lead with six furlongs to run, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied in the three path while under a bit of extra left-rein pressure around the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch then drifted out
while clear and drew away under steady urging. LITTLE DEMON was hustled from the gate, showed the way in the two to three path around the early part
of the opening bend, lost the lead to the winner with six furlongs to run, prompted that foe down the backstretch, chased inside to the two path around the
final turn and safely secured the place. LOCALLY OWNED started the first turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide later on that bend, was forwardly
placed on the outside down the backstretch, chased in the five path around the far turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch and weakened but held the
show. BE BETTER brushed with a rival into the first turn, rounded that bend in the four path, settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path around
