weakened in the drive. TOFFEE raced back to turn, bolted out badly eliminating all behind her. GIRLS HOUSE never far back to turn, giving way, slammed
hard, eliminated. STUPENDOUS reared in gate, no speed to turn, bothered upper stretch, stopped. LIVE WIRE slight bobble from the gate, never a real

while all out in the stretch run but missed on the wire in a good effort. BIGGIE inside run to quarter pole, gaines a short lead, stayed game in the stretch for
the show spot. GUS GUS no speed to the half , roused and ran on from quarter pole but flattened out late. TEXAS RED PEPPER good position to the half
but could not go on and flattened out in the stretch run. MIDWAY MIRACLE threw head at start with no speed throughout while no real factor. WILLACY
never far back to far turn, dueled into the stretch but faltered late. SHA KON O HEY was through early from inside and dropped back and jumped a light
shadow at the wire. LOLAS BEAU never factored. PROTECTED AREA sprinted clear to the half but used up to the quarter pole and stopped readily.
