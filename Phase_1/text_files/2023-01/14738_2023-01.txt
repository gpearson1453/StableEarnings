Footnotes
SHE'S A JOY stalked the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. SASSY BUT
PRECIOUS angled in and was clipped behind about a furlong into the race, raced in range two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, could not
gain seriously on the winner in the lane but outfinished a foe for the place. OUR FLAG FLYING saved ground in range, raced two wide between foes around
the far turn, bumped with STUCK IN MALIBU in upper stretch, angled to the rail nearing the eighth pole and lost the battle for second. FROSTY O TOOLE
hopped at the start, raced two wide and went evenly. KITTENZEN raced off the pace three wide, angled in near the three-eighths pole, angled back out in
midstretch and never threatened. STUCK IN MALIBU set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the five-sixteenths pole, bumped while
tiring in upper stretch and retreated inside. CECILIA'S WINGS raced off the pace inside, took an awkward step midway around the first turn, went two wide
around the far turn and made little impact. CONFER clipped heels about a furlong into the race, raced three wide and was never involved.

Footnotes
HANDSOME PRINCE tracked in the three path, ranged up and took aim from the six path turning into the stretch, and drew past passing the eighth pole
under right handed urging. TIZ ROMANTIC bumped with STORMY SOUL multiple times in the opening quarter, chased in the two path, shifted out to the
five path turning into the stretch, was short of room and angled back in to the two path passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. SPIRIT ANIMAL rated
in the four path, was ridden around the turn and in the seven path going into the stretch, and kept on down the center for show. COOP TRIES HARDER
prompted the pace in the four path, was cued and bid approaching the quarter pole and was in the five path entering the stretch, but evened out in the final
furlong. STORMY SOUL got bumped multiple times by TIZ ROMANTIC in the opening quarter and was steadied back to last early, was behind in the six
path entering the lane, and was no factor. POUND GREEN was wellback in the two path early and never threatened. MILITARY DRILL pressed between
rivals into the turn, took a short lead approaching the quarter pole and was roused from the three path into the stretch, but yielded into the final furlong.
LORD OF LEGENDS set the pace in the two path but gaveway approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SOLAIR stalked in the four path, was roused while taking aim from said position going into the stretch, bid into the final furlong, and fought on to get up in
the final strides. DEMURELY prompted the pace in the two path, bid along the rail around the turn, was under left handed urging from the three path
entering the stretch, ran on and led going into the final furlong, but was caught in final strides to place. LENA THE LION set the pace in the four path going
into the turn, drifted way out to the center in the stretch, and held on to show. KILLARGUE'S GIRL raced from wellback in the two path early, was driven
from the five path into the stretch, and stayed on late. HEIR TO THE ROAR brushed the side of the gate, tracked in the six path, swung out to the nine path
into the lane, and finished evenly. CUPID AUSTIN was reserved in the four path early and never factored around the three path in the stretch. GLEAMING
BRUTALITY was coaxed along from the five path, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, and flattened. I SAID HEY rated in the five path but never
threatened. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) chased in the two path but was no menace.

THE MRS bumped with an inner foe just after the start, stalked along the inside, bid from the rail under right handed urging into the stretch, and edged away
late. JUST KATHERINE bobbled out of the gate, prompted the pace in the five path, tucked in around the turn and bid from the three path into the stretch,
ran on but hung for place. LADY IRVINE set the pace in the two path, was roused from said position into the lane, and kept on to hold show. MILLENNIUM
PARK bumped with an outer foe just after the start, was reserved in the three path early, angled out to the seven path under a drive in upper stretch, and
evened out in the final furlong. ENCHANTED RIDER tracked in the three path, was under right handed urging from the four path entering the stretch, and
flattened out late. VOLTA D'ORO chased in the four path, was driven from the seven path into the stretch, but faded. MELINOE broke in and bumped an
inner foe out of the gate, rated in the six path, tipped out to the eight path into the lane, but was tired. COMPASS FIRE was hustled along from the five path
but weakened in the stretch. RAGGEDY bumped with an outer foe, was wellback in the four path early and never threatened. WORK OF FICTION was
coaxed along from the three path but backed up around the turn. FAMOSA was always behind in the three to six paths.

and made little impact. DOO WOP DON was bumped at the start and played no factor while racing three wide.

GOOCH GO BRAGH stalked while hard held early in the three path, was roused to bid from the five path turning into the lane, took the lead passing the
eighth pole and drew clear. BOARD CERTIFIED tracked in the four path, was coaxed from the five path into the stretch, drifted out passing the eighth pole,
received a right handed correction and chased home the winner to get up late for place. QUANTUM THEORY set the pace in the three path, was under right
handed urging from said position turning into the lane, yielded to a pair of outer foes in the final furlong but held show. VLADISLAV chased in the two path,
was under right handed coaxing while taking aim from the four path entering the stretch, but evened out late. DREAM OF A DAY rated in the three path,
tipped out to the six path turning into the lane, but flattened. FLATTER ME was reserved early in the three path, swung out to the eight path into the stretch,
but was no factor. EUPHORIA STAR raced off the pace in the four path, was roused from the three path around the far turn, but was empty in the stretch.
IMPULSIVENESS had a slow start, was unhurried from the five path early and never threatened. LOVE ME ARCHIE trailed from the five path early and
never menaced. OSKEE WOW WOW raced prominently in the four path but backed up around the far turn.
