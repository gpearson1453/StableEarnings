RENEW was away alertly then was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, drifted in through the lane and was up in the final
yards. BOURBON AND WATER tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin
with a furlong to run but could not resist the winner late. DEVIL'S OFF DUTY broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the
three-eighths marker and gave way through the final furlong. BLUE PARADISE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final
furlong. TAP THE BANK was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. ENTANGLEMENT lagged early, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor.

CANDY ZIP broke sharply to press the pace of ALLEVA while racing four-wide, gained command with a furlong to run and edged away in the drive. ALLEVA
dueled for the lead from the inside throughout and gave way grudgingly to the winner in the drive. MAJOR MUNNINGS was reserved just off the leaders
from the inside, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain late. GOLDEN COWBOY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly. TRY TO CAPTURE disputed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and
gave way. BIG BARREL was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to rally. STONUS
MAXIMUS was off a step slow, raced unhurried early and did not threaten.

Footnotes
MS FLASHY HARBOR tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, responded when set down for the drive, reached the fore through
the closing yards to be going away late. STAR FINALITY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with
good energy to gain the place. GRACIE'S A TIGER sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the
closing yards. GLIMPSE OF GOLD was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way after going a half. ANOTHER TEN was off
slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HENRIETTA MAE showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
AXEL STEEL tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch, vied with COASTAL KID and edged away from that rival late. COASTAL KID
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and gave way grudgingly to the winner in a
hard drive. STAND TO pressed the pace while racing three-wide, angled out further into the stretch and was up for the show. KELLER'S GOLD sprinted
clear soon after the start, responded when challenged nearing the half and gave way through the final furlong. COBRA JET was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HIJO GALANTE lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

MINEHUNTER sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased his margin into the lane and held sway to the wire. LAST

the place. FOREMAN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. BLESSED BROTHER

through the turn and finished with a belated bid. IRISH KNIGHT raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
HAMMERING LEMON chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going five furlongs. IMPERATOR was off slow, lacked early speed,
raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. LIVE A GOOD LIFE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened

Footnotes
WINNING MAGIC sprinted clear at once, increased his margin through the turn and drew off through the lane with complete authority. PASSED BY PAUL
was void of early speed, steadied nearing the half-mile marker, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished well to gain
the place. CHEF showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. WARFRONT FIGHTER was reserved just off the leaders from the inside and lacked
the needed closing response. SIDE STREET DAVE raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished
evenly. KATZUMOTO chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. PARLEY STREET lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MORETHANSOULTITLE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.
DON'TTEASETHETIGER lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ASSETS INCLUDED raced off the pacesetters early,
moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. LIL LATIGO lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RIDER OF
MORETHANSOULTITLE LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST WINNING MAGIC CONCERING THE BREAK AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE. FRACTIONS ADDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

through the second turn, rallied in the drive and just missed. MISS GHISLAINE settled off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, led but could not resist the top pair late. WALK SOFTLY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way
after going three-quarters. TWELVE STARS raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and
finished evenly. PINK CHANNEL raced off the pacesetters early while racing from between foes, angled in nearing the five-sixteenths pole and did not offer
