Footnotes
JEANETTEO was away alertly and sent to the front to set the pace on the inside, drew clear on the turn and then widened the advantage in the lane to
prove much the best, driving. AMI'S LINK was rated along early, made a inside move to chase the winner on the turn, proved to be no match for that rival
while clearly second best. SEAMIALAUGH was reserved early on the inside,advanced on the inside on the turn but had no late rally, bested rest. CLOSET
SHOPPER was reserved early three wide, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. FOLK HERO was well placed three wide and weakened. ANOINT
tracked the pace four to three wide and tired.

clear by the sixteenth marker but was caught late to be denied. YES IT'S ROO was allowed to settle early on the inside, shifted out on the turn and came
