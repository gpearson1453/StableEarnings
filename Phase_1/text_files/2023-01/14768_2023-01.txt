Footnotes
HONORARY GUEST settled off of the pace along the inside, moved to a two wide tracking position down the backstretch, pursued from the three path
around the far turn before tipping to the five path to be outside of the newly clear leader in upper stretch, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds, forged an
advantage at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. HAPPY SAILS tracked in the four to five path around the first turn, pressed the top pair into the far turn,
was roused to bid from the four path with three furlongs to go, drove past the leaders turning for home, drew clear entering the lane, but met an outer bid in
midstretch, got headed at the sixteenth pole, and gave way. MAGICAL STARDUST tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a weakening
rival turning for home, tipped three wide entering the lane, claimed show in upper stretch, and chased the top pair home. MEG AND CLAIR trailed around
both turns, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up. FIBRILLATOR bobbled slightly a stride out after the start, vied for the lead in the five to
four path around the first turn, vied with an inner rival entering the backstretch, led in the three path into the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival
turning for home, weakened through the lane, and was vanned off. LAKE RUNNER vied for the lead inside of a rival while in the three path around the first
turn, then from the two path into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with an outer pair at the three furlong pole, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
COUSIN LARRY settled off of the pace along the inside, gained place from outer rivals into the far turn, narrowed the run-away leader's clear margin around
that bend, tipped outside of him to take aim in upper stretch, ranged up nearing the furlong grounds, but drifted out from a left handed crop leaving that
station, sustained stride and produced a bid while changing back to his right lead at the sixteenth pole, then dueled through the closing stages, and narrowly
prevailed. MASTER GAME tugged in the bit while vying inside of a rival and a bit off of the rail around the first turn, pulled away while remaining keyed up
under tight restraint entering the backstretch, settled into stride around the far turn as his advantage narrowed, held sway through upper stretch, flopped
back to his left lead inside the final furlong as an outer rival menaced, dueled gamely with that foe through the late stages, but was nailed at the wire.
KEEPCALMCARRYON rated at the rear two wide, was urged along in the five path around the far turn, and moved up. REWIRE stalked outside of the
keyed up leader and from the three path around the first turn, came into the backstretch in the five path, then gave way in the four path around the far turn,
weakened between horses entering the lane, yet darted out to the center of the track at the furlong grounds. CARTIER CAT tracked in the three path, but
was tentative to secure position between horses at the nine sixteenths pole, trailed in the two path into the far turn, and made little impact.

Footnotes
SMOKEY HARBOR prompted the pace in the four to three path into the first turn, vied two wide leaving it, opened up under rider's urging in the three path
into the far turn, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but drifted out while tiring approaching the final sixteenth, balked crossing over the leftover
dirt marks from the starting gate causing him to flop leads, yet held from an inner re-bidder. BOOTDADDY JUSTICE vied along the inside of the eventual
winner, yielded to that foe entering the far turn, dug in for place turning for home, yet regained stride in upper stretch, stayed on to attempt a re-bid inside of
the wandering leader in the late stages, but did not have enough. OTTOTHELEGEND stalked the leading pair three wide and between horses, but came
under a stern drive at the three furlong pole, and kept on mildly. DUKE OF CARTHANIA tracked four wide, gained into the far turn to vie for place at the five
sixteenths pole, but flattened out. PALATIAL TIMES laid off of the pace while hung five wide around the first turn, then trailed around the far turn, and failed
to factor. SIERRA HOTEL saved ground while stalking the leaders, but faded.

HUNTER'S DRIVE bumped with an inner rival at the start, then checked when put to tight quarters three wide and among foes at the back of the pack into
the first turn, settled off of the pace four wide, but failed to respond while getting outkicked by an inner rival turning for home, cut the corner entering the
lane, rallied along the rail to bid leaving upper stretch, led entering the final furlong, and held from an outer chaser thereafter. SOFT PANTS stalked along
the inside, shifted to the four path at the five sixteenths pole to split the leading trio three wide entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by
an inner rival at the furlong grounds, then chased that foe home well. WOLF HUNTER raced in midpack along the inside, but was wrestled back under very
stout restraint around the first turn, saved ground well back around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on. Z Z'S PRINCE
stalked three to two wide around the first turn, vied between horses entering the far turn, but yielded at the furlong gounds. MINNESOTA MOON bumped
with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed four wide, inched forward entering the backstretch, sustained progress to vie for the lead three wide nearing the
far turn, sparred in the four path around that turn, but weakened after being floated to the five path approaching the lane. BOXSTER set the pace, vied
inside of a pair of bidders entering the far turn, but was headed around that bend, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. COTE D'IVOIRE laid off
of the pace two wide and between horses while tugging around the first turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
NOSILVERSPOONSHERE set the pace, approaching the five furlong pole, opened up on her own power around the far turn, and widened handily. LEAD
ME laid off of the pace in the three path, gained inside of foes entering the far turn to gain place with three furlongs to go, then failed to threaten the leader
while safely managing that position thereafter. UNIFIED LOVE bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed along the inside, gained ground along the fence
around the far turn, achieved show turning for home, and leveled off. KITTENOFTHE COURT bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside,
but faded three wide around the far turn. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA bobbled inwardly at the start, tracked from the three path, but gave way while hung five
wide around the far turn. ROCKETT MAGIC took bumps from rivals on either side at the start, pressed the leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace
entering the backstretch, and weakened four wide into the far turn.

Footnotes
KATHAAN rated off of the pace two wide, moved forward between horses turning for home, rallied on his left lead while shifting outside of the embattled
leading pair in upper stretch, changed over while taking aim entering the final furlong, and offered a good kick to drive past them a sixteenth from home.
LOLLOPING popped open the gate pre-race causing restlessness for most of the field, established a loose margin in the two path into the first turn, dug in to
resist WAYWARDNESS's bid turning for home, quickly recovered from a light brush to her hind quarters in upper stretch, gamely sparred while clinging to
an advantage through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer oncharging foe in the final sixteenth. WAYWARDNESS stalked outside of the clear leader
and from the four path, bid turning for home, dueled through midstretch while not able to reach even terms, but was outkicked by an outer bidder while
flopping back to her left lead, and was fended off for place. LIVY B took brushes from rivals on either side while off a step slow, raced at the rear along the
inside, gained inside of the eventual winner to bid for show turning for home, but failed go rally along with that one in upper stretch, and chased. LADY
EMILY tracked along the inside, but yielded in the five path around the far turn. FORDLAND tracked in the five path around the first turn, but faded entering
the far one.

ROSE PALACE dueled for the lead inside of a rival while remaining a bit off of the inner rail, shook free of that foe in upper stretch, and held sway from her
through the final furlong. PLEASE BE KIND vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner while kept in the three path, but failed to keep pace in upper
stretch, and chased her home well through the final furlong. CATWINGS tracked in the three path, tipped out to the five path entering the turn, gained show
turning for home, but leveled off without threatening the top two, and managed show through the final furlong. LADY HUXLEY laid off of the pace in the two
path, then chased from between horses through the lane. PARKER EVA tracked along the inside, but lacked a bid. CHEEKY pursued from midpack in the
four path, but yielded entering the turn. I AM UP prompted the pace outside of the top two, but weakened around the turn. PERFECTION SAVER was
outrun.

Footnotes
FOR REAL ALICE tracked in the two path, chased before tipping to the five path entering the lane, offered a grinding charge to bid at the sixteenth pole, led
shortly after, and held. THEBOYZGALAXY broke out, raced far back in the two path, swung to the nine path in upper stretch, and rallied on his left lead to
reach place late. POINT OF VICTORY pressed two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane before being
brushed to the four path by an inner rival at the quarter pole, yet sustained vying position among foes nearing the final sixteenth, but was outkicked late, and
caught at the wire for place. A. K. A. GRAMS broke a step slow while last away, stalked along the inside, brushed his way to the three path to be outside of
the clear leader leaving the quarter pole, bid at the furlong grounds, led shortly after, but faltered between bidders in the final sixteenth. NEW YEAR'S
PARTY laid off of the pace along the inside, but steadied entering the turn, closed the gap behind the main group through midstretch, offered a three wide
foe-splitting charge in the final sixteenth, but ran out of ground. PEACEFUL VISION laid off of the pace, tucked to the rail entering the turn, then chased
along it through the lane. SHADES OF TRUTH shook her head at the start, set the pace along the inside, shook free of a pressing foe entering the lane, but
was headed approaching the final sixteenth, and faltered between horses. STORIED TRIP raced far back in the four path, then failed to menace in the eight
path. HALFGLAMOROUS tracked three wide, but bore out to be six wide entering the lane, and weakened.
