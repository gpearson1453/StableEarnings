CALCULATED went to a pressured lead from the two path to the five sixteenths then pulled away and proved best. IRON N STEEL pressed the pace to the
five sixteenths but couldn't continue to match strides with the winner and proved best of the rest. GRAY DANE raced in the middle of the pack from the two
path and passed tiring rivals. PITCH AND RUN tracked leaders from three wide to the seven sixteenths then was off the pace to the three eighths pole and
weakened. CASH HOLIDAY was unhurried around the first turn then made a two wide bid at the three eighths pole, saved ground around the final turn but
was not a factor. BOSS MAN ZONG raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground but was not a threat.

Footnotes
ANOTHER HOT MESS was placed off the pace in the two path to the final turn then was asked at the three sixteenths pole and took over at the top of the
stretch and held sway. SWEET LAURA stalked the pace from two to three to the final turn the was coaxed nearing the three sixteenths pole, was gaining on
the winner but couldn't catch. JACKIES IRISHDREAM went to a clear lead to set the early pace through the final turn then was collared entering the stretch
but was empty in the drive. FOUR PRINCESSES tracked the leaders from the two path around the first turn then dropped back and was not a threat.
SIMPLE PLEASURE was forwardly placed going into the first turn on the inside, faded and was outrun.
