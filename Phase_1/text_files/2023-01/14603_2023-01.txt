Footnotes
CHI TOWN HEAT set a pressured early pace while inside, was well handled then drew away on the turn and was clearly much the best in the end.
MARSANNE stalked the pace while three wide into the turn, was making a bid two wide on the turn but was no match for the winner in the stretch. FAR'S
LAST ONE was settled then rallied on the turn, was four wide in the stretch and no menace. CHARACTER COUNTS was saving ground on the turn while
making a bid to mid stretch but came up empty in the end. XTRASAUCEWELLDONE was making a rally while three wide in upper stretch but was no
menace. EYE OF THE STORM was unhurried early then made a late rally while three wide in the stretch and was no threat. PRICELESS PICTURE was
very fractious in the gate then raced three wide on the backstretch, was used up and gave way. GRANDPAPPY'S DREAM was unhurried early then was no
threat. BOGEY FREE pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, was used up and stopped. GULF BENDER was through early while four wide and
