Footnotes
HOPS PETUNIA quickly gained a clear lead, led throughout, drifted in late stretch and prevailed under left handed urging. IRON WILMA raced between
horses early, rallied in the stretch on the inside, altered course late stretch and just missed. MARIMBA raced mid pack early, rallied in the stretch four wide
and finished willingly. IRON BERTIE had good position throughout and went evenly late. STRAIGHT TO GO was unhurried early, rallied on the inside and
improved. FRANCIA (PER) chased the speed and weakened in mid stretch. KILLOEAN ROSE raced wide and was no menace. WINEDOWN was no factor.
SAPPHIRE MOONLIGHT had early foot and was through after a half. TEST YOUR FAITH had no speed and trailed. The rider of IRON WILMA claimed foul
against the rider of HOPES PETUNIA for alleged interference in late stretch. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.

REINVESTEDINTEREST dueled on the lead until mid stretch, repulsed bid and drew clear late under firm handling. HIP HIP HOORAY tracked three wide,
rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, gained a slight lead in mid stretch, was outfinished late but was clearly second best. BLOOD MOON had good
position on the inside and went evenly in the stretch. DOCTOR WU allowed to settle early, did not factor late. CHACO SPIRIT raced mid pack and was no
menace. RUN BUBBA RUN was no factor. MUTINY had speed for a half, then gave way.
