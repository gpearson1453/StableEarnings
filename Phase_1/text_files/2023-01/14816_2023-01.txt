Footnotes
TOWN CHAMP pressed the issue up the backstretch outside, dueled exiting the turn while remaining off the inside, edged away late under steady handling.
TRUMPENCE forwardly placed in the two path, steered out three wide into the lane, angled back in nearing the furlong marker, proved no threat to the
winner late, gained the nod for the place. DRENA'S STAR moved outside in the run up the backstretch, three wide far turn, floated out four wide by the
runner up turning for home, dueled with that one the final furlong for the place while widest, missed the nod. OTIS OTIS OTIS broke outward but alertly,
brushed, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled with the winner late in the turn and into the stretch, faltered. LIVINGONTULSATIME lacked speed
outside, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. FIRERY TALE brushed at the break, lacked speed inside, continued to save ground turn, lacked
response stretch. RELEASED failed to menace while racing between horses. HEZA WILD RIDE fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
HOUSE WRECKER with the pace from the start inside, dueled through the turn while continuing along the rail, shook clear when straightened for home,
stretched that advantage out a bit under a right handed crop past the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. PROUD VICTORIA back
off the pace while well out in the strip, five wide into the turn, continued out in the strip into the lane, roused, getting to the winner late while outside that one.
C C THE BARTENDER broke in, bumped DAWNLAND, back off the pace, closer turn off the inside, three wide into the lane, modest late gain. DORITA'S
HEART antsy prestart, off slowly, trailed early, five wide turn, mild rally upper stretch, flattened out in the final furlong. VISUAL MAGIC void of speed, raced
in the two path turn, continued just off the inside into the lane, also found lacking a late punch. FIVE QUEENS lacked early speed, went one paced
throughout while racing toward the inside. DAWNLAND bump start, recovered to race forwardly early, weakened before a half. HALE'S ANGEL broke
alertly, alternated up front off the inside, first to blink exiting the turn. COSTANARMANDALEG in the second flight early, gave way midway on the turn to be
finished before a half.

Footnotes
LADY COMMANDER broke in but alertly, set or forced the pace in the two path, shook clear into lane, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire
without feeling the whip to win ridden out. NO GUILT in mid pack early, moved closer then steadied just before a half, fell back a bit, chased the winner into
the stretch in the two path, made minimal inroads on that one late, clearly second best. AMENSET steadied near the back into the first turn, closer before a
half off the inside, came four wide for the drive when mounting a mild rally to finish up best of the rest. INTO DISCO in mid pack after angling to the rail first
turn, firm in hand while surrounded in the run up the backstretch, steadied in continued traffic far turn, went evenly to the wire after recovering. DIAL TONI
within striking distance outside, advanced to race closest to the winner briefly with a three wide move second turn, failed to sustain that advance down the
lane. BLAME THE TOLL lacked speed outside, four wide through the final turn, remained back in failing to rally. SHEZA CAT fell well back after the start,
came four wide for the drive and continued to be well beaten. ELUSIVE BELLE restless in the gate prior to the start, was unloaded, broke with the field, set
or forced the pace for five furlongs, stopped far turn, distanced, walked in.

Footnotes
CABALLO FELIZ sprinted clear soon after the start, quickly well clear through some lively early fractions, continued to hold a considerable advantage
through the final turn, roused nearing the furlong grounds, enough to hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. BUBBA CAN DANCE off a step slow,
well back for five furlongs, began to advance three wide far turn, kept coming through the lane while drifting slightly, rapidly getting to the winner late.
DARYL'S BOLT settled off the pace and the inside, continued in the second flight final turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, remained clear of
the others. BREAD WINNER got out, bothered an outer foe into the first turn, settled off the inside, continued one paced in lacking a closing response.
HARD TO COME BY lacked early foot, in some traffic and three wide far turn, improved into the lane then flattened out the final furlong. COMMANDER REX
chased the winner for six furlongs and gave way off the inside. LINE TO GAIN settled off the pace, had little for the drive. PROPELLANT forwardly placed
for a half, stopped and was well beaten. DOUBLE STRIKE bothered by BREAD WINNER into the first turn, fell far back and and was never involved.

Footnotes
RUN FEARLESS lacked early foot out in the strip, carried out four wide by SHE'S HAMAZING midway on the turn, came three wide into the lane, angled in
sharply nearing the furlong marker when beginning to rally, continued with good energy up the inside to up in time. JERI DAWN off a step slow, raced back
early, began a good gain off the inside late in the turn, steered out nearing midstretch, lugged out further when feeling a left handed crop a furlong out to
impede K J'S PISTOL ANNIE, was straightened, gained command late, nailed by the winner in the final strides. MISS RITA chased the early leader up the
backstretch through a quick opening quarter, continued to pursue that one through the turn, took over when straightened for home, could not contain the top
two, narrowly lasted for the third position. SHE'S HAMAZING in mid pack, came out midway on the turn floating the winner out, came four wide into the lane,
improved through upper stretch then flattened out. BIG ON BROADWAY void of speed off the inside, began to improve in the two path late in the turn,
continued to better herself without posing a serious threat. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE in the second flight, closer three wide out of the turn, bothered a furlong
out, finished up evenly after recovering. GUEST IN MY HEART off slowly, trailed early, four wide into the stretch, improved position while also not a serious
menace. MISS DUTTON fell back to trail in the turn, picked off some tiring horses after the issue had been decided.. HALF SCOUT in the main body inside,
had little for the drive. DERBY DAY LASSIE broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear through a rather glib opening quarter, maintained a considerable advantage
through the turn, stopped in the drive. NAVAGATIONALBEACON forwardly placed for a half, also stopped down the lane.

Footnotes
VOBISCUM broke on top, set all the pace along the inside, continued to hold daylight to the wire under firm handling. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO moved up
closest to the winner soon after the start, chased that one in the two in vain throughout, clearly second best. UPTOWN SOCIAL settled toward the front
behind the top two, had little for the top pair through the lane, well clear of the others. SHOTGUN UP off a step slow, moved up a bit and settled three wide
early, one paced the final half mile, no late response. STRICKLAND off a step slow, lacked speed, saved ground turn, improved in the drive while never a
threat. TALK TO TOKEY briefly forward along the inside, began to fade before a half. STROLL LIKN OUTLAW saved ground to no avail. CLASSIC SHINE
remained always back. R R EMPIRE off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
LOCHMOOR stalked the lead group well out in the strip, advanced four wide to challenge through the turn, vied past the furlong marker between horses,
edged clear under steady handling. DATA STORM broke on top, raced with the pace up the backstretch, vied three wide into the turn, between foes and
inside the winner entering the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, clear for the place. TWISTED DIXIE back off the pace early, five wide into the
turn, advanced to a challenge position outside the winner late in the turn, flattened out through the lane to finish up best of the rest. MAHOMEY with the
pace off the inside, vied between foes through the turn, weakened through the lane. ROLLING FORK moved up early along the inside through a narrow
opening to contest the pace into and through much of the turn, also faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. DINNER AT CRUMPIES
broke back, remained near the rear and was never a factor. MACHO RONNIE faded early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MAJOR GENERAL within striking distance inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, advanced toward the rail far turn, steered out and engaged the leader
turning for home, dueled upper stretch, drove clear. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke on top, set a modest pace along the inside, briefly responded when the
winner came alongside turning for home, proved no match for that one the final sixteenth, clearly second best. STEFANO off a step slow, trailed much of the
way, began to move far turn, angled out to be five wide turning for home, rallied midtrack to be up for the show, not a threat to the top pair. SIMOVITCH
settled off the pace outside, four wide through the first turn, continued outside, five wide through the second, improved into the lane, caught late for the
show. MAGIC CASTLE forwardly placed while three wide, continued within striking distance the middle half, weakened in the drive to lose a couple of
positions late. NOTARY void of early foot, raced back, in traffic in lacking room late in the turn, steered out a bit, encountered additional traffic with less than
a furlong remaining, improved with some late interest. RVINDICATED lacked speed three wide, continued in the three path second turn, made little impact
through the stretch. GEAUX YOSHKA in mid pack for five furlongs, dropped inside in the second turn, came up empty for the drive. CONTACT TRACING
back off the pace, steadied in traffic into the first turn, remained back. COSMO in mid pack and three wide for a half, three to two wide second turn, failed to
muster a rally when called on. BELLA'S PRAYER forwardly placed for six furlongs, gave way turning for home while toward the inside. RUNWAY MAGIC
four wide when with the second flight first turn, gave way while remaining four wide in the second bend.

Footnotes
LAUGHING LEGACY brushed start in breaking near the back, restrained early behind the pace three wide when moving closer turn, four wide into the lane,
engaged the leader nearing midstretch from the outside, dueled to the wire, proved narrowly best in a determined effort. LAPIS LAZULI away well, vied up
front into the turn three wide, continued to contest the issue through the bend, held a narrow advantage into the stretch, responded when the winner
challenged form the outside nearing the furlong grounds, dueled to the wire, proved stubborn to the end, well clear for the place. MY NOAH broke back,
brushed, moved up to contest the pace between foes, vied turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, all out to narrowly hold the show.
EXTRAVAGATE off a step slow, lagged for a half, moved out for the drive, finished with good energy in finding best stride too late. PRACTICAL MAN broke
well, fell back to race in the main body off the inside, went evenly in lacking a closing response. GOLDEN LUNA broke on top, narrowly showed the way
early, vied along the inside through the turn, faltered in the drive. HELLEPHENT back off the pace inside, continued to save ground to no avail through the
turn, no response drive. NEW DICE remained back while along the inside. BILLY YANK lacked speed while racing outside, failed to muster a rally.
ROMANCER mid pack early, gradually weakened four to three wide through the turn. DEL MOON was never a threat. FIRST RATE broke back and was
never involved.
