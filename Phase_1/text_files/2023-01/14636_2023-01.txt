Footnotes
DRINKING PROBLEM set the pace along the rail, briefly got out entering the first turn but angled back in soon after, took pressure to upper stretch then
drew off under a drive. MY FAVORITE TOPIC tracked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in the lane and ran on for the place. CHROMOTION pressed
the winner two wide, could not keep pace in the lane but held well enough to preserve the show. ROCK CHALK saved ground in midpack, went two wide
around the far turn and finished evenly. TIO TONY lacked early speed, raced two wide, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally while drifted
in and out. CROWN IN CHARGE was fractious in the gate, raced in range two wide, bid three wide around the far turn, could not match strides in upper
stretch, shied out in midstretch and dropped back. TAKEMETOTHEMOON bumped at the start, saved ground and failed to menace. SERGEANT SINATRA
played no factor while racing four wide. NETWORKING chased the pace two wide and retreated three wide around the far turn. COPPERMASTER made
little impact while racing two and three wide. MANA KAI bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. ADORIAN was outrun inside.

Footnotes
KUKARO rated along the inside, was driven from the three path while passing tiring outside rivals around the turn, shifted back to the rail under right handed
urging entering the lane, and rallied to get up in the final sixteenth. POWDER MY NOSE was bothered by a pair of out-breaking inner foes and had to
steady at the start, trailed from the five path going into the turn, swung out to the eight path going into the stretch, and ran on for place. NYSSA set the pace
in the two path, was roused when headed by an outer foe passing the three eighths pole, dug in from the four path entering the stretch, but yielded passing
the sixteenth pole for show. BREEZY CONNECTION broke out at the start, chased in the four path, was urged from the six path turning into the stretch, but
flattened out late. DELTA RED stalked along the inside, shifted out to the six path and was coaxed rounding the turn, but was no factor. SPONGER broke
out at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, was cued to bid passing the three eights pole, floated out to the five path entering the lane, but faded.
MISS MCBRIDE tracked in the five path but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
CRAZY PASSION pressed in the three path, took over the lead around the turn, was roused from the five path going into the stretch, and dug in to hold off
challengers on both sides to win. NOBLE DREAMER bumped with SO SOFTLY at the start, tracked in the two path, ranged up from the six path and took
aim turning into the stretch, ran on but was drifting out through the stretch, and held place. VIGIL ANNA popped the gate before the start, trailed from the
three path early, passed a pair of foes while swinging out to the six path turning into the stretch, and drifted in through the stretch while keeping on for show.
WALKS LIKE A LADY chased in the six path, lost ground and was passed by a pair of inner foes around the turn, shifted in to the four path while under a
drive going into the lane, and stayed on. QUEEN CASHMERE rated in the two path, was urged from the seven path into the stretch and mildly gained.
ALICE HARPER set the early pace from the two path, was coaxed around the turn, and yielded in upper stretch. SO SOFTLY bumped with NOBLE
DREAMER at the start, stalked in the five path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY HAMILTON was carried out seven wide between foes early on the first turn, angled down to the four path late on the bend, advanced in the four path
around the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, vied inside of LOVE MAMI LOVE from there to midstretch then kicked clear under a drive. LOVE
MAMI LOVE saved ground off the early pace, advanced five wide around the far turn, reached even terms outside of the winner nearing the quarter pole,
vied past the eighth pole and was clearly second best. APPLE LOVER was pinched back at the start, saved ground well back, swung five wide in upper
stretch and rallied for the show. KINDNESS IS FREE saved ground in range, went two wide around the far turn and finished evenly. NOTHING BUT
PUMPS raced well off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. IRON LOTUS pressed the pace two wide, led inside
around much of the far turn but gave way readily near the quarter pole. GREY PRINCESS was forced eight wide early on the first turn, bid three wide
around the far turn, reached near even terms between foes approaching the quarter pole but tired soon after. REPLENISH failed to menace while racing two
and three wide. AMERICAN ODALISQUE set the pace along the rail and was through after a half. DEFENDER GAL led inside early, bore out entering the
first turn, raced very wide and had no further bids. HOT MISSION played no factor while racing two and three wide. BATTLING BUBBLES broke awkwardly
and slowly and trailed in the two and three paths.

Footnotes
CLASSIC CAR WASH bumped with AFY KID at the start, set the pace in the two path, was cued to open up from the rail turning into the lane, responded
well to left handed urging and went clear. ANAMNESTIC stalked in the three path, tucked in to the two path around the far turn, was roused from said
position going into the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. CAPTAIN ANTHONY prompted the pace in the four path, was under heavy urging
from the three path turning into the lane, and evened out for show. SMART STRIKER tracked in the five path, was ridden from said position turning into the
stretch, but flattened. BIG SAVE bumped with AFY KID at the start, was unhurried in the four path early, swung out to seven path turning into the stretch,
but was no factor. PLUMA ROJA rated in the three path, was driven from the six path into the lane, but never threatened. AFY KID got bumped between
foes at the start and was held up along the inside, but was no menace.

Footnotes
STURDY GIRL stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, closed steadily under left-handed urging and was up in deep
stretch. YOOOU KNOW prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole and led until deep stretch. BOTITA raced off the pace three
and four wide and was along late for the show. SUGAR SIN set a pressured pace along the rail, vied inside past the eighth pole then weakened. SUBTLE
FAITH raced off the pace inside, hit the rail in upper stretch and never threatened. AMOR VICTORIOUS was outrun while racing three wide. SISTREN
reared and lost the rider at the start, galloped along behind the field and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND
TOOK NO ACTION AFTER RULING THAT SISTREN CAUSED HER OWN TROUBLE.

Footnotes
FROSTED OATS raced prominently in the two path, was cued to bid rounding the far turn, took the lead from the four path entering the stretch, and drew
clear. STATE CROWN rated in the two path, was roused from inside around the far turn, tipped out to the three path going into the lane, and ran on to get
up for place. SPEED SALSA stalked along the inside, was coaxed going into the far turn, angled out to the six path going into the stretch, but evened out at
the eighth pole for show. OGLALA bumped with SEQUIN LADY at the start, trailed in the two path early, shifted out to the six path turning into the lane, but
was no factor. KHOSEA chased in the five path but flattened from the seven path in the stretch. SEQUIN LADY broke out and bumped with OGLALA at the
start, was unhurried from the four path, swung out to the nine path under urging turning into the lane, but was no threat. BRAVO ZULU set the pace along
the inside but yielded from the two path in upper stretch. DREAMING OF AUDREY tracked in the three path but never menaced.

Footnotes
KEKERE settled off the early pace in the two path, angled five wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane, moved to front near the sixteenth
pole and inched ahead late. DARKDESERTHIGHWAY dueled two wide, edged ahead nearing the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth pole and fought on inside
of the winner through the final sixteenth. SIR GOOSA was bumped between foes at the start, raced in range three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch
and rallied widest. RED GUN stalked the pace three wide, bid in midstretch and flattened out in the final furlong. RAKA RAKA CRUZ was in range inside,
tipped two wide nearing the quarter pole, lacked a clear path, ran up on heels nearing the eighth pole, checked hard and veered in and was unable to regain
the momentum at the rail in the final furlong. EXPLOSIVE WAVE was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. LUSCIOUS DANCER
played no factor while racing four wide. ADIOS YOUR HONOR dueled along the rail to midstretch, was forced to steady near the eighth pole and dropped
back inside. TAKING WHAT'S MINE was bumped at the start and trailed in the three path. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RAKA RAKA
CRUZ AGINST DARKDESERTHIGHWAY FOR ALLEDGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.
