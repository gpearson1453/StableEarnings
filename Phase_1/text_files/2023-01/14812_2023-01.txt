Footnotes
EMILY SMILES broke out at the start and was away a step slowly, tracked the moderate early pace, tipped three wide for the drive, advanced nearing the
furlong marker, overtook MISS BELLA nearing the sixteenth-marker and pulled away in the late stages. AMANDA ROSE stalked the moderate early pace,
saved ground to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with EMILY SMILES in the final furlong but stayed on well late to be
second best. MISS BELLA showed early speed and dictated terms to the turn, drew clear nearing the quarter marker, held a clear lead to the furlong
marker, was overtaken by EMILY SMILES in deep stretch, gave way in the final stages but was clear for show in the end. ST HELENA unhurried in the early
stages, saved ground to the top of the lane and lacked a late response. DEVINE DANCING hustled to be forwardly placed in the early going, chased MISS
BELLA to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
J T'S CREDITCARD prominent into the first turn, kept close attendance to MACHO CHROME through moderate fractions to the second turn, dueled with
that foe to the quarter marker, assumed command in upper stretch, held a narrow lead into the final furlong and dug in in deep stretch to hold off the
oncoming runner-up. TALISKER BAY allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the far turn while not far back, came within aim at the top of the
lane, came in tight in mid-stretch, shifted out in the final furlong, closed willingly in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while securing the place.
MACHO CHROME hopped at the start but recovered in the early stages and contested the pace to the first turn, assumed command and set moderate
fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, dueled with J T'S CREDITCARD to the quarter marker, lost the lead to that rival in upper stretch, was
a bit erratic and hard to place through the lane and was outfinished in deep stretch, while holding safely for show. TAM'S TIME allowed to settle in the early
going, well positioned through the backstretch run, asked for run while three then four wide approaching the stretch run, was gaining in the late stages but
lacked the needed late response. SKY DINSKI a bit keen into the first turn, tracked the pace into the backstretch run, remained hard to place along the
backstretch run and pressed the pace three deep to the far turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

POLACCO broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, drew off on the far turn, in hand
into upper stretch, had the margin cut into a bit in deep stretch, kept to task in the late stages and was geared down in the final strides. HARBOR SKY
bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle, saved ground into the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but closed
with good interest in the final furlong and was second best in the end. MR BOTANICALS forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions to
the half-mile marker, lost contact with POLACCO nearing the quarter marker, weakened in the drive but saved show in the final strides. STAY LIT unhurried
in the early stages, raced three wide into the far turn, lacked the needed response in the drive and just missed for show in the final strides. RUNAWAY
KRISTIN well positioned in the early stages, stalked the decent pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker and did not offer a rally in
the drive.

CLASS CODE allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced on the far turn, mounted a three wide bid into upper stretch, closed the gap on LAST INNING
inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the final sixteenth under mild late urging. LAST INNING forwardly placed in the early stages, assumed
command of the pace along the first turn and set prompted fractions to the half-mile marker, extended the lead along the far turn, drew to a clear lead in
upper stretch, could not hold off the winner inside of the furlong marker and held well for second in the final sixteenth. DANCE LADY rated off of the early
pace while not far back, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive and
just held for third in the final strides. STEIN'S GIRL bobbled at the start then allowed to settle, roused three wide on the far turn, finished evenly in the final
furlong and just missed for show in the final strides. BENSON showed speed and contested the early pace with LAST INNING, took back to prompt that rival
to the half-mile marker, could not keep pace on the far turn and gave way in the drive. ALESHA unhurried in the early going, saved ground to the quarter
marker, tipped two wide for the drive and did not threaten in the late stages.

Footnotes
TALK ABOUT AUTISM chased the solid early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, loomed in mid-stretch, came
within aim of CAPTIVATING BOY inside of the furlong marker, battled against that rival to deep stretch and made a determined late surge to prevail.
CAPTIVATING BOY broke alertly then took back off of the quick early pace, tracked the quick pace to the quarter marker, took a narrow lead in upper
stretch, was confronted inside of the furlong marker by TALK ABOUT AUTISM, battled gamely against that rival to deep stretch but was outfinished in the
final strides and was second best. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY hustled to the early lead, set quick fractions to the quarter marker, overtaken by CAPTIVATING
BOY nearing the furlong marker, tired in the final stages and was clear in the end for third. CHILLY WILLY forwardly placed, steadied while in tight nearing
the half-mile marker, chased from the rail on the turn and was not a late factor. ZHIVAGO chased the solid early pace, saved ground on the turn and gave
way in the stretch run. STORMY JOE chased early, outrun on the turn and did not threaten in the drive.

Footnotes
PRANCIN N THE PARK shuffled at the start and was off a step slowly, came under a tight early hold while racing toward the rear, advanced on the far turn,
came in tight nearing the quarter marker, angled four wide for the drive, rallied in upper stretch, came within aim of LEXCELLENT in deep stretch, was fully
extended in the final strides and surged to prevail. LEXCELLENT stalked the pace into the first turn, stayed within aim through modest fractions to the
second turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead in upper stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the furlong marker, was
confronted by PRANCIN N THE PARK in deep stretch, gamely met that bid but was bested in the final strides and was second best. IRISH SONG LEADER
allowed to settle in the early stages, raced three wide along the first turn, mounted a five wide bid approaching the top of the lane, could not impact the top
pair in deep stretch but stayed on in the end to secure third. SPORTS FOR WOMEN stalked the early pace from the inside, maintained position to the
second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked room behind a tiring rival and and did not offer a late rally. PURPLE NIGHT contested the early pace with I'M
GONNA SHINE then assumed command into the backstretch run, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and held foes at
bay to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final furlong and gave way late. I'M GONNA SHINE broke alertly, contested the early pace with PURPLE
NIGHT then ceded the lead to that rival into the backstretch run, attended to the modest fractions to the second turn and faded in the drive.

OUR EXPECTATION unhurried in the early going, trailed to the quarter marker, navigated traffic in upper stretch and advanced nearing the furlong marker,
determinedly split foes in mid-stretch and kicked away in the final stages. GRIT AND CURIOSITY chased the moderate early pace, raced outside of rivals
on the turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch, battled for the lead with R M C HOOK'EM to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the furlong marker, could
not match strides with OUR EXPECTATION in deep stretch and was outfinished by that rival, while holding for second in the end. HUNTERS GHOST away
a step slowly from the gate, tracked the pace from second flight, mounted a four wide rally on the far turn, swung five wide for the drive, finished well in deep
stretch and was up for show in the final strides. MUAY THAI (IRE) forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the moderate fractions to the quarter marker,
advanced in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and was just edged for third in the final strides. R M C HOOK'EM broke alertly, ceded the early lead to
VIA EGNATIA then stalked that rival to the turn, pressed outside of the pacesetter on the turn, took a narrow lead leaving the quarter marker, battled for the
lead with GRIT AND CURIOSITY to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. SATANTA tracked the pace from the second flight, saved ground on the
turn, tipped two wide for the drive and finished evenly. VIA EGNATIA hustled to the early lead, set moderate fractions while pressed by R M C HOOK'EM,
was outrun leaving the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SEEKING forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the solid pace to the turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, chased O'NEILL'S
LEGACY to upper stretch, confronted that rival nearing the furlong marker, assumed command and took a narrow lead to deep stretch, dug in in the final
stages and held in a drive to prevail. LADY'S SERMON tracked the solid early pace, raced closest to the top pair to the furlong marker, rallied three then
four wide leaving the turn, closed fast in mid-stretch, finished well inside of the sixteenth-marker, could not reel in the winner in the final strides and was up
in time to secure the place. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN rated off of the solid early pace, raced two wide on the turn, loomed nearing the top of the lane, dove
inside in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, could not make headway in the final furlong and was outkicked, while holding for show.
O'NEILL'S LEGACY broke alertly and showed good early speed, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, held ALWAYS SEEKING at bay to mid-stretch,
could not keep pace in the late stages and was outfinished. SEEMS LOGICAL rated off of the early pace, raced in the second flight along the turn, rallied in
upper stretch and found her best stride late. ZAZEN broke out at the start and slammed into PRESKITT leaving the break, chased from towards the rear in
the early going, improved position on the turn and was gaining in the final furlong. PRESKITT slammed with ZAZEN at the start and was off slowly, lacked
early speed, improved position in upper stretch and offered a mild late rally. ALTHEA GIBSON lost her path and took up at the start when neighboring rivals
slammed into one another, trailed to the quarter marker and improved position in the final furlong. STOIC LUNA chased from midpack in the early going, lost
position on the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT up close under restraint, was turned loose with three furlongs to run, was idling between horses down the stretch but found his best stride in
the final yards and was up in time. KIWI'S DREAM (AUS) quickest away from the gate, seized the early lead before the first turn and set very moderate
fractions as the lone pacesetter, was able to quicken in the stretch and finished with a good run to hold off all but the winner in a game effort. TABLE FOR
TEN raced three wide and well behind the early pace to the far turn, started a bid with a quarter mile to run, swung out to the five path at the head of the
stretch, finished well in deep stretch despite being bumped in the shadow of the wire and was up in the final strides to secure third. LIL MIRACLE MAN
hustled to gain early position, tracked the pacesetter in the two or three path, went to challenge passing the five-sixteenths pole, was able get within striking
distance of the leader but was then unable to gain any further in the late stages, and was just edged for show. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was up close but
three wide throughout, launched a bid from the three-furlong pole was finishing evenly then was squeezed by CONUNDRUM and TABLE FOR TEN inside
the furlong grounds and forced to take up near the finish. CONUNDRUM lagged near the rear of the field to the far turn while saving ground, tipped out for
the stretch run, shifted out just inside the eighth pole when LIL MIRACLE MAN took his path and made contact with SHOT OF A LIFETIME and steadied in
the final yards. HOLY GHOST last away, trailed the field through the early stages, saved ground through the turn, was put into a drive from the
five-sixteenths but was unable to make an impact.
