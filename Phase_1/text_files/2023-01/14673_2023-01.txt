MONIKER tracked the early pace, loomed five wide through the turn, took control at the quarter pole and drew off as an easy winner. LET EM RIP was
allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out, was no match and finished second best. PERFECT IMAGE was void of any early
speed, angled out six wide in early stretch and was along for third. LAUGH OF THE PARTY set a clear early pace, from off the rail and faded. OJO FELIZ
was unhurried early, raced five wide and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
ARI OAKLEY tracked the early pace, loomed five wide through the turn, took control at the quarter pole, drifted out and held for the win. FLYIN FALYNN
raced in mid pack early, advanced six wide through he turn, was closing fast, couldn't get by the winner and finished second best. OUTSIDE THE LAW
chased the early pace, couldn't match strides with the winner, drifted out in early stretch and was along for third. BRAVE CINDERELLA was void of any
early speed, raced seven wide through the turn, angled in late and offered no late rally. UNIQUE BABE was allowed to settle early, raced four wide and was
empty. REVENOOR WOMAN was taken back early from between rivals and was no factor. RESPECT THE RIDE was reserved early and flattened out. IZE
A CRAFTY GAL set a clear pace, raced off the inside, faded and was vanned off.
