Footnotes
CATALON vied early in the two path, moved clear on the turn and stayed safe under steady handling. SWEETER broke very awkwardly and trailed early,
moved inside on the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX dropped back inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well.
MISBEHAVING LADY raced just off the pace inside and proved empty in the stretch. NANA'S BOOPA bid closer inside into the far turn then faltered.
DELIGHTFUL DREAMER broke sluggishly and was never in contention. LET'S CELEBRATE raced wide off the leaders and was finished after half a mile.
IMAGISM dueled outside early and began fading on the turn.

Footnotes
COLD WALKER set the pace racing near the inside, widened the margin on the turn, responded when roused, drew off and was ridden out. STARSHIP
GOTHAM tracked on the inside, advanced inside on the turn, rallied and was clearly second best. DADASHEV stalked close up three wide, chased three
wide on the turn, finished evenly and earned the show spot. FIELD OFFICER raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, gained mildly and got the
fourth spot. ALONZO MOSELY raced two wide off the pace and lacked a rally. CONNECTING stalked close up two wide, chased on the turn and tired.
SUNSANDDRINKINHAND raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. TEQUILA JR raced off the pace between rivals and gave way.

for three quarters then tired holding the place. LOUIE'S LAW lagged far behind then offered good late energy in the stretch. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN
chased off the pace between rivals early and finished willingly. EMPEROR'S CAUSE saved ground within striking range then faltered. MORE THAN A
DANCE broke slowly, chased outside and stopped abruptly.

WENDY'S FINE WINE stalked close up three wide, bid two wide entering the far turn, quickly took over, drew away, was kept to the task, then taken in hand
for the final yards. AMATERASU set a pressured pace on the inside, briefly dueled with the winner on the far turn, then dug in gamely inside in the final
furlong to earn the place spot. DON'T TELL FRANKIE raced close up early, pressed the pace on the backside, advanced two wide on the far turn and was
outfinished for second. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD raced two wide off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn and had no rally. YOURINDENIAL raced off
the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, then lacked a rally. OUI MADAME raced off the pace inside and was outrun.

FROSTED WILD RIDE set the pace off the inside, widened on the turn then held a rival safe. BOSS CARA pursued the winner outside throughout, loomed
a stretch threat but was outfinished. GRIS TORMENTA dropped back outside, moved very wide on the turn rallying. TIZ HER WAY trailed to the stretch then
passed fading rivals. SHEWEARSTHEPANTS saved ground off the pace and gave way. MISS ALEX lacked speed and was never in contention. GET HER
READYEDDIE was unruly at the gate and ordered a late scratch at the gate on the advise of the starter.

Footnotes
CHEWY CHEWY GOOD raced three wide early, stalked close up outside, bid on the far turn, dueled, led into the stretch, drifted in a bit in midstretch, dug in
gamely and edged away late to prevail. SUMMARY JUDGMENT set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with the winner
passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside of that rival past the furlong marker, continued willingly to the end but second best. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY
raced off the pace between foes, chased the leaders on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and closed for third. MANI PEDI trailed the field, improved her
position in the lane and failed to threaten. LULA'S ROADRUNNER raced off the pace with an inside trip and failed to respond. TWIRLING WIND tracked
along the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. LIL MISS HOTSHOT raced four wide early, settled three wide off the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
NICK THE CARDSHARK saved ground close up, angled out into the stretch, bid to the front and was just up in the final yards. THE BIG BLUFF lacked
speed, moved very wide in the stretch, closed with a rush and just missed. PRINCE FILIP vied between briefly, moved inside on the turn, led in the stretch
and continued gamely to the finish. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY dueled very wide down the backstretch and turn and weakened slightly. FAST BREAKIN CASH
prompted the pace three wide between rivals then tired in the final furlong. CRAFTY JACK hustled to a clear lead, bore out on the turn, was straightened
and continued willingly while fading in the final furlong. E T'S SUPER STAR dropped far behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JACKSON ROAD stalked outside, moved up on the backside, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with MORETHANAFEELING, led into the stretch, dug in
gamely outside of that rival and drew clear in the final furlong, driving. MORETHANAFEELING vied two wide for the early lead, took over nearing the half
mile marker, dueled inside of the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and came up second best. KAON reluctant to load, raced two
wide off the pace, then three wide, chased two wide on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and gained late inside for third. BATTUTA D'ORO raced four wide
early, settled off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn and rallied mildly outside. ONE BITE raced off the pace inside, then between
rivals, chased inside on the far turn and tired. DOCTOR MAGIC was reluctant to load and outrun. UNION PARK vied inside for the lead, then chased and
gave way.

Footnotes
DIESEL engaged in a blistering duel inside, shook off that rival then edged clear in the final furlong driving. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT battled the winner
outside to midstretch and continued gamely to hold the place. FEDERAL CASE pursued the dueling pacesetters outside and finished willingly. KOBE B
dropped back along the inside and offered only a mild rally. PARDSY chased in the two path then went evenly through the stretch. VIDAL was urged off the
dueling leaders inside and came up empty. JUMP SHOT lagged far behind racing very wide and passed a fading rival. PER DIEM ducked out soon after the
start and gave way readily.

turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch run and got up for third at the wire. NOT A TRACE set the pace in the two path, then vied inside, dueled with FAST
INTENTIONS into the far turn, battled back in upper stretch, dug in gamely, weakened late and lost third. SOUTHERN CENTS tracked on the inside, chased
on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. FRISKY FEELING was reluctant to load, then off slowly, outrun early and passed tired rivals.
