Footnotes
DIVINE FASHION stalked three wide on the first turn then challenged into the backstretch, took the lead two deep leaving the quarter pole and was steadily
handled in the lane. PRACTICALLY THERE broke a step slow then saved ground well off the early pace, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole
and steadily progressed to take second mid-stretch. MISS COREY rated the pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, gave up
the nod passing the quarter pole then flattened in the lane. CASTLE OF CAYLEE settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. SHE'S ALL COURAGE stalked the early pace off the rail, challenged while between
horses into the backstretch and dueled close, but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole and faded at the rail on the far turn. UNEXPECTEDLY saved
ground on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the six
path. CHRISTINE'S COSMO veered out leaving the gate and rounded the first turn in the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole then weakened into
the far turn.

Footnotes
BRIGHT DAWN settled back in the four path the first turn, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved in the five path of the
far turn, left the turn outside, dug in to take over mid-stretch and raced clear in later yards. SPIRIT OF WINDSOR stalked off the rail on the first turn, picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and dug in the final furlong to take second late yards.
THUNDERINREADYRICK entered the first turn five wide then angled in and took over two deep at the nine sixteenths pole, rated the pace from that point
then came under pressure toward the quarter, was met inside the eighth pole and dueled through the stretch to hold third. REMYS GUNSMOKE set the
pace most of the opening quarter mile then stalked from the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths and raced at even terms toward
the head of the lane, but was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. IN JUBALATION saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, improved off the rail on the far turn but eased outward toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. SIENTE EL AMOR settled in the three path the
first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, but showed little in the lane. SPECTACULO saved ground.

Footnotes
PER DIEM stalked three wide then bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide at the quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn and
widened under steady stretch handling. TARAASHOQ settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn,
then dug in through the lane to take second the final yards. FANEUIL HALL stalked two deep, moved to even terms leaving the half mile pole and dueled
from that point, but was caught at the quarter, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME saved ground
well off the pace on the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then passed rivals down the lane. SHANNONRUN
rounded the first turn in the four and five paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, eased out into the
lane and showed little further. ADARA came out and made contact with BASHDAFLASH leaving the gate then settled inside, gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened stride while losing ground toward the head of the lane, while the latter was bumped early but quickly took the lead and rated the
pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, gave up the lead at the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn. A
THOUSAND IDOLS ducked out leaving the gate and never factored.

CURLIN'S MALIBU rounded the first turn in the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, eased outward on the far turn and left the turn
four wide, dug in from the eighth pole and got up the final strides. JUNGLE BEAST rated close inside on the opening turn, took the lead three wide at the
three eighths pole, drew off from the five sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, was steadily encouraged through the lane but gave up the lead
in the final strides. SANTO saved ground on the first turn, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in
the lane. BE ONBOARD settled close in the three and four paths, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the four path of the
far turn. LIKE SEGAL rated a slim early lead inside, was met leaving the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase toward the three eighths, but weakened at the
rail on the far turn. BROTHER CORBIN stalked the early lead about the three path, showed little response leaving the first turn and faded past the three
eighths pole. TRIKITRAKI stalked the early pace from the three path, took the lead past the nine sixteenths pole and dueled leaving the seven sixteenths,

FREEDOM RIDER was bumped leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn in the five path, started a bid passing the seven sixteenths pole, took a slim
brief lead toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, recovered the lead past the eighth pole, raced clear
mid-stretch and widened under steady encouragement. MANHATTAN WEAVE veered out and made contact with Freedom Rider leaving the gate then
raced with the early pace off the rail, dueled from the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but was met past the
eighth pole and relented the final sixteenth. STORMIN ROCKET stalked off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far
turn three wide, dug in through the stretch and took third in the final yards. DANCIN IN DUBAI raced with the pace inside with a slim intermittent lead,
dueled toward the three eighths pole but ceded the edge past the pole, steadied at the rail at the five sixteenths pole and faded into the far turn.
FEARNOUGHT raced inside on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn at the rail then flattened stride.
PROUD UNION saved early ground then picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the five and six paths, left the turn outside
and passed rivals. STRONG HEART saved ground. STRINGFELLA raced off the pace in the three and four paths on the first turn, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened. LIL TOUGHMAN was not a factor. HIDDEN ROD rounded the first turn in the three path,
raced outside into the backstretch, showed no response and was eased the final quarter.

Footnotes
JUBA'S NOTION tapered in to stalk from the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took over three wide approaching the five sixteenths,
drew clear past the quarter pole and was kept alert in the stretch. AREYOUGONNAKISSME rated a slim early lead but was met at even terms approaching
the nine sixteenths pole, dueled from that point but dropped back at the quarter pole, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just lasted for second.
NO LOVE FOR JUBA rounded the first turn in the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, then just missed
second while flattening late. NEVERPOPTHECORK entered the first turn in the five path and raced well back leaving the turn, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide and showed little in the lane. XCELLENT START was bumped inward and into Pinnacle Reef leaving the
gate then saved ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn but showed little more. LORD OF CORK ducked
out at the break, rounded the first turn in the five path and showed little response. SPARKED A NOTION ducked in and made contact with Xcellent Start,
raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded in the five path of the far turn. PINNACLE REEF stumbled
and was bumped shortly after the start, saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.
COLT ROCK raced with the early pace two deep, dueled leaving the half mile pole but faded past the five sixteenths.
