SILVER EDGE hustled to a good advantage, drifted out in the stretch but stayed clear under steady handling. SEICHE saved ground off the pace, angled
out on the final turn and made a gradual late gain. RON DON SCORESE stumbled slightly at the start, raced in closest pursuit of the winner and continued
willingly. ABUELO NUNO trailed wide on the first turn then angled inside with a mild rally. NO SALT broke sluggishly then passed fading rivals while never a
threat. EXCURSION chased within range wide early then gave way. MONYINTHEBANKSEY raced inside early, moved out on the final turn, was urged but
faded. LOUIE'S WISH stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.

inside, was collared into the stretch and continued gamely to the wire. LONG GRAY LINE lacked speed, moved very wide into the stretch with late energy.
SON OF A SAINT raced within striking range outside then faltered in the stretch. GUSHING OIL settled wide off the pacesetters and lacked a rally.
DUBROVSKY dropped back inside and was never in contention. STILL HAVING FUN prompted the pace outside, bid on the final turn then gave way in the

Footnotes
FLASHING DIAMOND circled her field with a five wide surge on the turn and pulled away through the stretch while kept to her task. DILLY DILLY PHILLY
dropped far behind, advanced very wide and closed strongly while no danger to the winner. LOVE ON FIRE lacked speed, moved wide on the turn and
finished well. MISS PEPPINA prompted the pace four wide down the backstretch and weakened. WORLD GONE WILD settled behind a wall of rivals in the
opening quarter, angled wide and flattened. R AVERIE LYNN prompted the pace between rivals to the turn and faltered. AKEMI hustled to a clear
advantage, was collared near the quarter pole and faded. TWIRLING WIND dropped far behind, faded on the turn and was no factor. ICY REPLY urged
close up between rivals in the two path and stopped. PEAK OF CHIC saved ground close up and began weakening on the turn.

RECRUITER broke alertly, stalked the pace four wide, vied in the two path to the stretch and edged away while kept to a drive. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE
hustled up to duel inside, was outrun on the turn, eased outside nearing the quarter pole then came again to gain the place. WINNING TIME vied three wide
then inside, dueled and continued gamely despite weakening. DAYDREAMING BOY was well placed off the dueling pacesetters but lacked a solid rally.
JOHN DUTTON trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. EL DE CHIMI raced wide off the pace and was never a factor. V MART dropped back inside
and was always outrun. HOT LOVE earned a narrow lead in the two path in the opening quarter and stopped.
