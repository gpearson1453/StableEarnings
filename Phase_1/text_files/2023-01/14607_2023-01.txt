CRAFTY JACK sped to clear advantage early then widened throughout under a steady drive. GOLDEN SPOKE was urged close up wide between rivals
and continued well for the place. E T'S SUPER STAR outrun early, angled wide on the turn and closed well too late. HIDE THE RANSOM chased off the
pace in the two path and flattened out in the stretch. DIZZY GILLESPIE hustled five wide down the backstretch then proved empty in the final furlong. NINE
TOE JOHNNY raced three wide between rivals, moved inside on the turn and faded. MAY WE ALL dropped well behind and was never in contention.

Footnotes
WILLY MC raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, took over, drew off, widened under urging and was in hand
for the final yards. PRIVATE NETWORK vied inside for the lead, shook free on the backside, dueled past the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch drive
and earned the place spot. INDOCTRINATE raced three wide early, stalked the early leaders, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the
stretch and was outkicked for second. AMOUNT was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten.
CATCH MY VIBE raced four wide early, then two wide off the pace and had no rally. SPLITZVILLE raced off the pace inside and was outrun. PASSAGE OF
LINES was bumped at the start, vied outside for the lead, chased and gave way.

SEEKING THE DREAM broke alertly and moved to the front, controlled the pace then pulled away driving in the stretch. TARA'S TALENT dropped back
early, moved inside and closed well for the place. SCHNUER WILL lagged far behind outside, moved wide on the turn then very wide in the stretch.
CONFIRMED GENIUS saved ground within range, moved wide in the stretch with a mild bid. FAIRY DREAMS trailed far behind then offered some late
energy near the inside. SENSE A MILLION hustled close up three wide for half a mile and faltered. EPICUREAN pressed the winner early, chased inside on
the turn then came up empty in the stretch. BESS raced close up between rivals briefly then gave way readily.

Footnotes
TILSA set the pace outside, moved clear into the far turn then held off challengers through the stretch while kept to her task. SUMMARY JUDGMENT saved
ground throughout, loomed a threat and continued gamely to hold the place. SIZZLING ROMA settled off the leaders, bid on the turn and continued willingly.
SEAMIALAUGH raced close up in the two path, faded on the turn and moved very wide into the stretch. EXCITABLE LADY chased wide off the pace and
lacked a rally. PRINCESS KAIRA dropped back early and was always outrun along the inside. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD prompted the pace four wide down
the backstretch and stopped. STARSHIP ROGUE trailed throughout losing contact with her field.
