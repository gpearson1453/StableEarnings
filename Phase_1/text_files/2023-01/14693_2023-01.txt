MARKS PROMISE was placed off the pace on the inside then moved out two wide at the quarter pole to take the lead at the eighth pole and drew clear.
HALF FULL had an early duel for the lead on the inside then inched away at the five sixteenths pole, was headed at the three sixteenths pole and proved
second best. I SEE CLEARLY NOW had no early speed through the turn then split horses and made a late rally for the show. MOR BIG LEE was void of the
early speed, made a four wide bid on the turn for a late rally. FLASHY BOY was forwardly placed early moved out to three wide at the three sixteenths pole
but never made a bid. CLEARLY WAR raced evenly and was not a threat. CUSTOM CRESCENT dueled for the early lead from the three path and gave
way. A'DEBRIS dueled for the early lead from between horses and tired.

Footnotes
CUCINA raced near the back around the first turn then was coaxed at the three eighths, moved up from the two path around the final turn then moved out to
four wide in upper stretch, dug in and prevailed. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. was hustled along to be off the pace around the first turn then tracked the leader
down the backstretch, went three wide at the quarter pole to engage the leader at the top of the stretch and duel inside of CUCINA in the stretch and was
out kicked. MACHO ROCCO was roused to go to the lead through the final turn then was headed at the eighth pole and battled in early stretch but gave way
grudgingly. EXTIRPATOR tracked the leaders from off the rail to the final turn then made a rail bid at the quarter pole, engaged the leaders at the top of the
stretch and fought gamely to the wire. UNION STATION was unhurried around the first turn the steadily advanced from the four path on the backstretch but
faltered. POMEROY HAZE went four wide into the first turn then raced in the middle of the pace from the three path and flattened out. IN THE ARCH saved
ground to no avail. SARCASTIC TONE settled in the middle of the pack from the two path but was never a threat.

XTRAFRIESWITHAT sprinted to the lead and set all the pace, pulled away in upper stretch to prove much the best. CAJUN TRINITY dueled from between
horses in the second flight to the quarter pole then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole and held on for place. BEAUTIFULGUATEMALA dueled from
the inside in the second flight to the quarter pole and was a game third. MARDI GRAS ALARM stumbled to her knees at the start, then moved up down the
backstretch, went three wide at the quarter pole moved to two wide going into the stretch to improve position. BROADWAY PEARL was hustled along and
dueled from the three path in the second flight to the three eighths pole and finished evenly. THIS FRIDAY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside and
passed tiring rivals. BRITNEY B. raced near the back, was three wide at the three sixteenths pole but never made a serious bid. VODKA SUNRISE was
rushed up to press the pace to the quarter pole and tired. SUNNY AND CLEAR was always back.

Footnotes
FLAT ROSE went to the front to set all the pace, pulled away going into the final turn and was an easy winner. ANIME DAY was within striking distance
down the backstretch, was asked at the five sixteenths pole and moved up from the two path but was no match for the winner. I LOVE YOU MORE broke
out and bumped LUMBERJACK EMPIRE after the start then raced near the back, moved out to three wide at the half pole and was up late for the show.
GALAXY AFFAIR pressed the pace from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and weakened. MISS WOW WOW was placed off the pace while saving
ground but was not a threat. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE was bumped off stride at the start by I LOVE YOU MORE and remained back.

Footnotes
ANOTHERINTHEFIRE went to a clear lead to set all the pace, was kept to task and proved best. BRINEE was hustled along to be positioned off the pace in
the two path and chased the winner. TAPIT'S LADY tracked the leaders from the inside but lacked a late response. MARAMA was forwardly placed off the
leaders down the backstretch was coaxed at the quarter pole to make late run but was not enough. MY REBEL GIRL was within striking distance around the
first turn then moved out to three wide at the five sixteenths pole move to the rail at the quarter pole and flattened out. SEGOVIANA was five wide into the
first turn then settled in the middle of the pack made a three wide bid at the three eighths pole and finished evenly. BEAUX TOX raced near the back and
was not a threat. MARILYN'S MAGIC saved ground while racing in the middle of the pace but was not a factor. WHO DAT GREY stalked the pace to the
five sixteenths pole and gave way. CLOCKED IN TYME trailed the field and was out run.

SMOKING GUN saved ground in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved out three wide at the five sixteenths pole, took the lead at the
eighth pole and battled down the stretch with PAYNT BATTLE and cleared late. PAYNT BATTLE was roused to vie for the lead from the three path, was
coaxed at the five sixteenths pole and took the lead at the quarter pole then was collared at the eighth pole and fought gamely to the wire. NATE'S
REVENGE raced near the back around the first turn then moved up on the rail down the backstretch and around the final turn, made a late rail bid to gain
late on the leaders. HIGHTAIL COWBOY went to the lead from the inside to the quarter pole and was empty in the drive. SCREENPLAY settled in the
middle of the pack around the first turn and down the backstretch, moved out to four wide at the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. GOLDEN QUALITY
pressed the pace from the two path to the quarter pole and gave way. DALLAS GOLD reared at the start spotting the field several lengths then went four
wide into the first turn while moving up to contention into the backstretch but was used up early.
