approaching the quarter pole, switched to the outside in upper stretch and gained ground to the wire. DR. ANN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside

Footnotes
THUNDER BUGGY bumped mildly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, led the way up the backstretch, opened up on the field while racing in the
two path around the turn and drew off in the lane under a drive. RAPIDAMENTE raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the three path, began a
bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late between horses. TRULY A DREAM bumped soundly with the horse to her inside at the start,
settled at the back of the pack through the opening three furlongs, navigated the turn from the four path and gained ground late. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN
bumped lightly with the horse to her inside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the
bend and finished evenly. CSILLA raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the early going, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the
stretch. FANCYSOUL stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the four path and faded in the lane.
HELEONORTIZ trailed the field through the opening half mile, came around the turn in the two and three path and never fired. ASPROPODIA bumped with
the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack early, continued around the bend in the three path and was empty from there. BON
FIRE DIVA tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the turn, swung wide into the

Footnotes
KAZACHAN raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the far turn,
kicked clear and held that margin to the wire. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS raced in the four path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the second bend from the three path, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground late. LEGEND'S SONG tracked the
leaders from the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn, began a bid entering the stretch, dueled and gave way late.
GUIDANCE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the inside, came around the far bend in the
four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and gained ground late to the wire. LIBERTALIA hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the three path around
the first turn, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, improved position from the three path coming around the far turn and was
outkicked in the stretch. UNKOALAFIED raced in the middle of the pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the
far turn and finished evenly while never threatening. SHES SKY HIGH brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path early,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far bend and weakened in the lane. FREEDOM
EXPRESS broke slowly, was rank in the early going, raced into traffic and checked slightly the first time by, navigated the first turn from the four path,
floated wide into the backstretch, dropped back to trail the field from the three path around the far turn and was empty in the stretch. TEA'S DREAM brushed
with the horse to her inside at the start, angled over to show the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, gave way while racing
on the rail around the far turn and tired quickly from there.
