Footnotes
EMERALD MAGIC unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker while not far back, tipped three wide at the top of the lane, came within
aim inside of the furlong marker, overtook the top pair inside of the sixteenth-marker and kicked clear in the late stages. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET forwardly
placed in the early stages, pressed the moderate pace while on a hold to the turn, took a narrow lead nearing the quarter marker, battled with HULA KING to
mid-stretch, could not keep pace with EMERALD MAGIC in the late stages and just held for place. HULA KING broke alertly and assumed command in the
early going, contested the moderate pace with GENTLEMAN'S SECRET to the turn, battled with that rival to the furlong grounds, gave way in deep stretch,
was just edged for place and held for show in the final strides. CONTINENTAL UNION away a step slowly, recovered to be just off of the pace nearing the
turn while outside of rivals, chased the moderate pace three wide on the turn, swung five wide for the drive and was outkicked in the final furlong. THAT'S
BIND BABE close up to the early pace, lost ground while two wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
HARCYN sent after an alert beginning, set moderate fractions to the turn, in hand to the quarter marker, quickened in upper stretch and extended the lead
nearing the furlong grounds, given one reminder tap of the crop inside of the furlong pole and was hand urged to the wire. STRUT ON LOUIE away a step
slowly, encountered early traffic behind RACHEL'S COACH, angled to the inside to stalk the moderate pace to the turn, came in tight while advancing
nearing the quarter marker, swung two wide for the drive, was no match for HARCYN in the stretch run but stayed on to be second best in the end.
RACHEL'S COACH stalked the early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn, came four wide into the drive, was outkicked in the final furlong and was
clear for third in the end. STRENGTH OF AUTISM showed early speed and raced close up to the early pace, kept attendance to HARCYN through
moderate fractions while three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way.

DAD BOD crowded EASTER TRIBUTE a bit at the start, was asked to show early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter
marker, battled with GALLAND DE BESOS to mid-stretch, repelled that foe inside of the furlong marker and drew away in the final sixteenth. GALLAND DE
BESOS tracked the moderate early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, confronted DAD BOD in upper stretch, battled with that foe to the furlong pole,
was repelled inside of the furlong grounds and held for place in the final stages. EASTER TRIBUTE crowded by DAD BOD at the start and was away a step
slowly, unhurried to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well in deep stretch and was clear for show in the
late stages. POLLO D'ORO prominent in the early going, pressed the moderate pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and faded in the
final furlong. WAY TOO HOT allowed to settle, steadied in traffic behind the tiring WAKES AND WEDDINGS midway through the turn, raced two wide into
the drive and did not threaten late. WAKES AND WEDDINGS close up to the early pace, chased four wide into the turn, impeded WAY TOO HOT when
attempting to slip to the rail midway through the turn, outrun approaching the quarter marker and tired in the drive.

WORK TO LIVE broke alertly and assumed command in the early going, set moderate fractions while prompted through the half-mile marker, drew clear
along the far turn, drew off approaching the furlong pole and was hand urged to the finish as much the best. MISS MAIA allowed to settle while not far back
in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run, stalked the moderate pace to the quarter marker, was no match for WORK TO LIVE in the stretch
run and held well for place in the late stages. SHE'S A BIT SASSY bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, rushed up to be forwardly placed into the
first turn, prompted the moderate pace to the second turn, could not keep pace with WORK TO LIVE, weakened in the drive and was outfinished for place,
while clear in the end for show. UNWHIRLED unhurried in the early stages, well positioned while two wide through the backstretch run, asked for run
nearing the quarter marker and did not produce a late rally.

DUST MAKER tracked the decent early pace to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, responded to steady urging,
came within aim of ABOVE THE STARS inside of the furlong marker, overtook that rival in deep stretch and powered home in the final stages. ABOVE THE
STARS broke alertly, contested the early pace with TOM'S CHARM, set a pressured pace while outside of that rival to the quarter marker, shook free in
upper stretch and drew clear nearing the furlong pole, could not hold off DUST MAKER in deep stretch and was second best in the end. SHEZA QUEEN
BEE broke in then hit the gate at the start and was away slowly, chased the pace to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, was not able to impact
the top two in deep stretch but finished well and was up for show in the final strides. CUTE RENEGADE chased the decent early pace, raced three wide into
the turn, swung four wide into the drive, was gaining in the final furlong and just missed for third. TOM'S CHARM engaged with ABOVE THE STARS in the
early stages and dueled for pace duties with that rival to the turn, disputed the pace to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and faded in the
drive. ZARAGOZA slow into stride early on and was unhurried, raced two wide along the turn, swung five wide for the drive and did not factor in the late
stages. RED HARBOR chased the early pace from the inside, well positioned approaching the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and tired.

MISS ARROWHEAD tracked the early pace, raced two wide into the turn, came in tight and lacked room nearing the top of the lane, shifted inside in upper
stretch, determinedly rallied along the rail in mid-stretch, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker and held safely in a drive at the end. JAYCEE hustled
leaving the break and carved the early fractions, set the pace off of the rail to the quarter marker, was set down for the drive, overtaken by MISS
ARROWHEAD inside of the furlong pole and held well in the final stages to be second best. TROPICANA GIRL broke out at the start but was away in good
order and was prominent in the early going, pressed the pace outside of JAYCEE to the quarter marker, weakened in upper stretch but stayed on well in the
end to be clear for third. TIZ A TIGER forwardly placed in the early stages, raced close to the decent early pace, lost ground on the turn, was outrun in upper
stretch and gave way. NAN ELIZABETH broke awkwardly and was off a step slowly, chased from the rear in the early stages, raced three wide into the turn,
swung five wide for the drive and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
PRETTY THIRSTY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while well handled to the quarter marker, extended the lead nearing the
furlong marker and drew away in the late stages. NIGHT CRUISER allowed to settle early on, saved ground on the turn, was not able to impact the winner
in deep stretch but finished well in the final furlong and was up for place in the final strides. DALLAS ALICE chased the solid early pace, saved ground on
the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and just held for show in the final strides. SHE'S SO FANCY prominent in the early stages, pressed the pace
while outside of PRETTY THIRSTY on the turn, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch, weakened in the drive and was edged for show in the final strides.
LILY PAD LAKE broke in and bobbled at the start and was off slowly, spotted the field in the early stages and trailed to the quarter marker, came two wide
for the drive, closed willingly and challenged for third in the final strides. FOREST ACCLAMATION bothered at the start by FOREVER LOVELY then
bumped PARTING WAYS in a chain reaction, recovered to be not far back from the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, could not sustain that run
in the final furlong and gave way. FOREVER LOVELY broke out at the start, bothered FOREST ACCLAMATION and was off a step slowly, chased from the
second flight, raced three wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive and did not offer a late rally. PARTING WAYS bumped by FOREST
ACCLAMATION at the start and was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn, raced four wide to the quarter marker and did not threaten in the stretch run.

SALLY'S SASSY allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide on the turn, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, closed fast inside of the furlong
marker, confronted ROUSING JEWEL in deep stretch, traded bumps with that rival in the final strides and determinedly won the nod on the wire. ROUSING
JEWEL tracked the early pace, advanced two wide on the turn, came within aim nearing the furlong pole, closed determinedly to confront ELECTRIC
LETTUCE in deep stretch, held a brief lead before being confronted by SALLY'S SASSY, exchanged bumps with that foe in the final strides and was gamely
bested, while clear of the rest. ELECTRIC LETTUCE prominent in the early stages and pressed the decent pace to the turn, kept close attendance to
KETANJI to the quarter marker, overtook that foe in upper stretch, assumed command and led to inside of the furlong marker, could not hold off the closing
top pair in deep stretch and was well clear in the end for third. MAJESTIC OOPS allowed to settle in the early going, raced three wide on the turn, swung
four wide for the drive and did not factor in the late stages. KETANJI broke alertly and showed good early speed, set a pressured pace to the turn, shook
free nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off ELECTRIC LETTUCE in upper stretch, chased that rival to the furlong grounds and weakened late.
THREAD COUNT bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to chase the decent early pace to the turn, was asked for run nearing the quarter
marker and came up empty in the drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE BUMPING IN DEEP STRETCH INVOLVING SALLY'S
SASSY AND ROUSING JEWEL. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THERE WAS MUTUAL BUMPING BETWEEN THE
TWO RUNNERS AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT brushed the gate at the break and was off a step slow, had only one beat early, idled behind the field while patiently waiting for
racing room through the far turn, was still last with three-sixteenths to run, found a hole passing the eighth pole and surged ahead when clear. BIG SPIN
unhurried early, remained near the rear of the field through the first half of the race, began a forward move while four wide heading into the far turn, came
under a ride with three furlongs to run, entered the stretch on the far outside of a six-horse fan, closed stoutly down the middle of the track to gain the place.
ASANO'S BACK broke well and had good position into the first turn, ceded the lead to AUSPICIOUS STYLE and backed off the pace for the backstretch
run, got held up behind horses on the far turn but responded to strong handling once clear and finished well but could not threaten the top pair. L'ENFANT
DIT was keen to go from the break and fought the rider into the clubhouse turn, settled well behind the pace racing between horses down the backstretch,
was full of run through the turn and into the stretch while stuck behind horses, swung out to the five path and closed with a rush when finally clear. RIO
KING reserved well off the early pace, stayed to the inside throughout, had a difficult trip from the far turn to the wire, but did finish with some interest when
able to get clear in deep stretch. GABBY HAYES got away from the gate in good order, looked intent on challenging for the early lead, then backed off the
early pace, was keen to go and the moved to a stalking position to the outside of AUSPCIOUS STYLE, engaged at the head of the stretch, held a very brief
lead then was outfinished from all sides just inside the furlong grounds. YOU KIDDING ME broke alertly, gained the inside position and was content to race
mid-pack early, ducked to the inside for clear running near the eleven-sixteenths pole, made steady forward progress after that, was in striking position by
the quarter pole while awaiting some racing room, got clear run past the three-sixteenths pole but was outfinished by a host of closers, finishing somewhat
one-paced. AUSPICIOUS STYLE aggressive from the break and able to clear the field and grab the lead and inside position going into the clubhouse turn,
held sway to the quarter pole then came under pressure, hung in there for a furlong but was done with an eighth of a mile to run and faded. SPROSTON
content to track the pace from a three wide position, launched an early bid from the half-mile pole, loomed a threat at the head of the stretch but stalled and
was unable to keep up down the stretch.
