Footnotes
MY MAN MATTY was last to commence, moved up to take the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while cruising around the
turn in the two path, responded well when set down into upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, shortened stride in the final sixteenth
and held under a strong hand ride. CALLALOO tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased the winner on the outside
while remaining on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that point, lugged in a bit near the sixteenth-pole then was
guided out by the rider and gained willingly late to clearly secure the place. EMPIRE SKY was coaxed along just off the pace while inside of a rival, chased
in the three path around the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. DREAMPOINT dropped back
while urged along, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, angled out some around the furlong marker
and failed to threaten. RED D G P was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide around the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and was no
factor. TREVOR BARDETTE broke well then was hustled hard, came in hand when beaten to the front by the winner, settled just off the pace, saved ground
around the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and capitulated.

FOR GOLD coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside early on before being engaged head to head by the eventual winner into the

Footnotes
CASALSA was restless in the gate, bumped lightly with a foe at the start, was urged along behind the leading duo, fell further behind those opponents late
on the backstretch, went four wide around the turn, gained into upper stretch, took the advantage approaching the eighth-pole, fought outside of the
runner-up into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. POPPY'S PRIDE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in
the three path around the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker, fought on with that foe into
the final sixteenth but was outfinished while clear for the place. LOHENGRIN TWO went to the front, set the pace under heavy pressure to his outside, vied
in the two path around the turn, lost the advantage under strong urging into upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. MIAMI CHROME was
urged along on the outside, went five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MR. PETE made light contact with a foe at
the start, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. MUSICAL AMERICA was ridden along near the back, traveled three
wide around the turn and also was no factor. CAVARADOSSI settled off the pace, dropped from five to three wide under urging on the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
HOWZYOURCASHFLOW coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path into the turn, steadily advanced on the loose leader
coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths and went clear under
a drive. WILL BE FAMOUS coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand three then two wide, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing
nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, dug in under threat and was collared at the three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top one while
running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. AUNT BERRA coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and kept on well clear for the show honors to be along best of the rest while never threatening the top
pair. GERMANY JAYVO broke in at the start bumping INDYAN PENNY in tandem with MY GORGEOUS, chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. MY GORGEOUS broke
out at the start bumping INDYAN PENNY in concert with the aforementioned foe, chased three wide until tucked inside along the inside through the turn
getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. MISS MIA LIA broke out at the start and came under
coaxing, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two wide through the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and
made no impact. INDYAN PENNY got bumped between foes who each broke her way, chased inside briefly and then three to four wide, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHASI was urged along just off the pace, chased four wide around the turn, issued a challenge near the five-sixteenths, dropped to the three path into the
stretch, moved closer to the runner-up while battling with that foe at the eighth-pole, dueled with that opponent to the wire and narrowly prevailed under
strong urging. QUEENS OVER THREES displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, dueled with
the winner while inside in the stretch and just missed while well clear for the place. AERON WARRIOR showed speed then chased the pace, went three
wide around the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and weakened but earned the show. PAUCILOQUENT broke a step slow, raced well back on
the outside, went around the turn in the six path and failed to rally. APEROL SPRITZ brushed the inside of the gate at the start, was urged along just off the
pace, saved ground around the turn, moved out outside the furlong marker and came up empty. BLANCHIMENT tracked the pace on the outside, was
asked four wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. MIDNIGHT ROSIE was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, raced at the
rear under urging, traveled around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
SPIKED raced under tight restraint into the first turn, traveled inside to the two path around that bend, moved up early on the backstretch to prompt the pace
on the outside, vied in the three path around the far turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear outside the furlong marker, shortened stride
into the final sixteenth, drifted out late and bumped SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN and just held. MOMMASGOTTARUN went five wide on the first turn, tracked
the pace on the outside, dropped back significantly from the half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths, was asked four then five wide on the far turn, came six
wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead while gaining at the sixteenth-pole, was kept off bumping
opponents by the rider late and just missed while able to get second. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN went four wide on the first turn, settled near the back,
moved closer late on the backstretch, was urged three wide around the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch, rallied on the inside of the runner-up
into the final furlong, closed strongly into the final sixteenth, was bumped by the unofficial winner late then steadied and missed while well clear for the
show. CARAGATE tossed her head early on the first turn, was rated two to three wide around that bend, established a good position for the journey down
the backstretch, was urged along in the two path around the final turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. BABY MAN dropped in
entering the first turn, showed the way on the inside, was asked under threat while inside on the far turn, lost the lead coming to the quarter-pole and tired.
INTO HAPPINESS bumped with a rival at the start, went three to four wide on the turns and failed to threaten. MERCY MERCY went four wide on the first
turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, dropped back under urging in the four path around the far turn and capitulated. VIENNA CODE bumped with a
rival at the start, was caught six wide around most of the first turn then tucked into the two path, moved in down the backstretch, saved ground under urging
on the far turn and was no factor. BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path around
the far turn and failed to respond. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS? INQUIRY, SPIKED WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH

outside, tucked inside through the turn, spun two to three wide for home, dug in and was collared a furlong out, ran on to be along clear for the place honors.
CARLY HUSTLE coaxed from the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and continued
just off the inside into upper stretch, then offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors. LONDON GOLD coaxed from the gate, chased briefly three to
four paths off the inside before tucking inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. PRINCESS PINKY coaxed from the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. KNOT ANYMORE bobbled at the break, dueled three then
two wide with SWEET AS SUGAR to her inside, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. IDAKA hustled from the start, chased five
then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. MORE MANGO coaxed from the start, chased just
