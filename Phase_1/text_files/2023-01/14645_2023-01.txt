Footnotes
SWIFT TEMPLE widest run first turn trailed to the half with a steady wide run into far turn and stretch to be along in time under good handling.
CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY just off leader to far turn, led into stretch, could not contain the winner and run down on the wire. STAR OF SHANGHAI rated
off leaders throughout, ran on evenly in the stretch run. BIA BOLT RUNNER unhurried to far turn, bid far turn, flattened out in the stretch. SPLIT DECISION
wide run first and far turn with no response when needed. WILMORE antsy in the gate, broke slow when opened, never a real menace. MIDNIGHT FLYER
had speed from two path to the half, backed up from far turn. TRACKER JACKER good position to the half, gave way readily from that point. MAMITA
LINDA never menaced throughout, returned bleeding to the wire and subsequently vanned off.

stayed to deep stretch but proved no match for the winner late, held the place spot gamely. STRIKE PRICE tracked top pair to deep stretch, angled out late
but missed place. DOWN TO BIZZNESS caught between horses first turn and shuffled back, went on to race evenly thereafter. OVER PROTECTIVE
bumped at the start, widest run into stretch with no late gain. LAGERFELDT tried to keep up to far turn but surrendered in the stretch run. MONEY PIT
never menaced throughout. RUBINSTEIN was rambunctious in the gate and never menaced from the start.
