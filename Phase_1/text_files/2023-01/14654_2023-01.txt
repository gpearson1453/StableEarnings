Footnotes
RAYRAY stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued near rail most of the turn, eased out four wide into the lane and edged away late under
strong urging. SURPLUS bumped by outside rival at the start, stalked pace in between rivals on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, eased
three wide to advance midway through the turn, took command in upper stretch, led late and ran down by outside rallying rival. TROMADOR away cleanly,
lacked initial quickness to keep up exiting the chute, fell all the way to the rear on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and responded well late on
the turn and in the lane to finish up strong in between rivals. VERMEER vied for lead outside of rival on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, in
contention in the lane and gave way late under urging. ELUSIVE VIRTUE settled off the rail near the rear of the field on the backstretch, continued off the
rail on the turn, swung very wide into the lane and finished up well when straightening out in the lane. COJO tossed head and thrashed when gates opened,
came away very very slow, galloped along the rest of the race and passed tiring foes late. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA away very fast and easily cleared early,
unable to match strides with rivals when they caught up, stayed well off the rail on the turn and steadily faded in the lane. BATTLING GERVINHO broke in
and bumped rival at the start, vied for lead along the inside on the backstretch, continued contesting the pace on the turn and weakened into the lane.
