Footnotes
ANYOTHERQUESTIONS took a brush from an inner rival at the start, was void of early speed, trailed two wide into the far turn, picked up stride turning for
home before fanning to the six path entering the lane, then sustained a rally outside of foes to reel in the leader at the wire. DEMON HUNTER laid off of the
pace in the three path, gained in the four path around the far turn, rallied to reach the front inside the final sixteenth, but was caught at the wire by an outer
oncharging rival. JUJU NINETEEN came out at the start, tracked two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, led at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked
inside the final sixteenth, and yielded. BLUE RIDGE RED broke in, rushed clear nearing the first turn, showed the way around the far turn, but was headed
in upper stretch, and weakened in the final furlong. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT was slow leaving the gates, trailed, and made little impact. MAGNOLIA RIDGE
stalked along the inside, but came under a stiff drive entering the far turn, failed to respond, and weakened through the lane. K T'S JILTED GROOM raced
in midpack three wide into the first turn, tucked behind foes nearing the backstretch, then gave way. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS
ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED BUT CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW, THE UPDATED FINAL TIME WAS COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY.

Footnotes
CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA stalked the clear leader from the outside, assumed command with five sixteenths to go, drew clear turning for home, and held
sway. DREWSILLA tracked two to three wide, took aim on the new leader turning for home while claiming place, but was only second best. STARSHIP
NOLA tracked along the inside, chased under urging in the two path around the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and ran on on while best
of the rest. QUEEN OF THE MOON laid off of the pace in the four path, and failed to factor. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN was bumped by an inner rival into an
outer foe at the start, set a clear pace, but was headed leaving the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. I'D BE RICH broke out and bumped an outer rival,
then never got involved before being done early. SANGIOVESE took a bump from an inner rival at the start causing him to take back from between rivals
soon after and trail the field in the early stages, then showed little thereafter before being eased in the lane.

Footnotes
PLEMMONSTON tracked two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, split the leaders three wide at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. MAX
PANDOWDY trailed, improved in the three to four path around the far turn before swinging five wide in upper stretch, stayed on to bid along with inner foes
in midstretch, but failed to match strides with the eventual winner in the final furlong while pulling clear of the rest. OKUDAH set the pace in the three to two
path around the first turn, met DA GOLD ROOM's rail challenge at the five furlong pole, sparred with that one around the far turn and through upper stretch,
but was outkicked by outer rivals at the furlong grounds, and yielded between horses. BLURT brushed the outer part of the gate while breaking a bit slowly,
rushed forward into the first turn to press the leader from the four to three path and between horses, backed off to stalk after an inner rival supplied pace
pressure down the backstretch, pursued outside of the top pair around the far turn, produced a bid while a path away from them coming to midstretch, but
flattened out while getting outkicked by rivals on both sides at the furlong grounds. DA GOLD ROOM tracked along the inside, produced an early bid for the
lead inside of the pace setter with five furlongs to go, dueled around the far turn and into upper stretch, but was outkicked by outer bidders at the furlong
grounds, and gave way. LUCKY CRUSADER rushed outside of foes to stalk the leader from the five to four path around the first turn, but gave way down
the backstretch, and was done early.

BARTULIA showed the way unchallenged while well in hand, maintained a margin from pair of chasers around the far turn, drew away from them when set
down entering the lane, felt a left handed crop at the furlong pole, then again at the sixteenth marker before coming under wraps soon after. MAASAI
WARRIOR laid off of the pace three wide, tracked around the far turn while gaining place with five sixteenths to go, but failed to keep pace with the leader
entering the lane, clung to place from his inner counterpart through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, then edged away after changing over late.
JEEPER stalked two wide, lost place to an outer foe turning for home, battled for that postion while proving no match for the leader in upper stretch, but was
bested. ACTION SEEKER chased along the inside, and faded. ICE AXE was outrun.

Footnotes
FIELD OF VISION bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing rival while tucking to the rail after the opening stages, vied with that
one turning for home, shifted out while maintaining a margin leaving the quarter pole, then shook free of his outer counterpart at the furlong grounds.
CHECK ME OUT prompted the pace three to two wide down the backstretch, vied with the pace setter turning for home, got herded out slightly by that foe
while battling in upper stretch, then yielded at the furlong grounds, yet held place from an inner rival late. LIL WOADIE laid close up along the inside early
on, stalked into the turn, but failed to progress on the top pair in upper stretch, kept on to bid for place inside of a tiring CHECK ME OUT in the final
sixteenth, but missed reaching that position. RISKTAKER took a slight bobble while leaning inwardly at the start, tracked four wide, then from the four path
in pursuit of the top pair around the turn, but failed to threaten them through the lane. BIG BOO was outsprinted soon after the start, laid off of the pace in
the five path, came into the lane in the eight path, and failed to factor. INFINITESIMAL broke slowly, trailed in the five path, and passed tired rivals late.
ROYAL UNLIMITED was jostled between a pair of rivals before being pinched back at the start, raced forwardly while keen and between horses early on,
checked back once rank at the half mile pole, then steadily gave way. ONDATRACKPIMPERNEL bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide and
between horses, then weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
BELEOUT rushed after a bit of a flat-footed beginning to set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of mild bidders turning for home, kicked
away from them entering the lane, and drew off while kept to task under a busy ride. FIRST I'VE SEEN chased from midpack along the inside, but failed to
sustain position into the turn, yet regained stride in upper stretch, produced a grinding rally along the fence to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, and forged
that position late. SPEEDY DUDETTE broke a bit out at the start, tracked two wide, then from just off of the inside around the turn, gained place from an
outer rival while shifting to the three path to be outside of the clear leader coming to the three sixteenths pole, but failed to threaten the leader before
meeting an inside challenge for place at the sixteenth pole, and got bested by that rival late. WHOLELOTTAMO broke multiple lengths slow, trailed in the
four to three path around the turn, improved inside of rivals in midstretch to gain fourth before altering course outwardly at the sixteenth pole, and leveled off.
OURS AND THEIRS laid off of the pace two wide, got floated three to four wide around the turn, shifted out to the seven path in midstretch, and improved
late. SIENNA BREEZE stalked three wide, inched closer to striking range at the five sixteenths pole, but drifted six wide entering the lane, and yielded on
her left lead. GATOR PROUD laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out and between horses turning for home, came into the lane five wide, but lacked
a kick to split rivals thereafter. HALF KOO KOO pressed outside of the leader, but failed to keep pace in the four path at the quarter pole, weakened
between horses in midstretch, and shied mildly from an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. AKIANE'S SOLDIER laid off of the pace three to four wide, got
floated five wide at the five sixteenths pole before fanning seven wide entering the lane, and was outrun.

MERCY WARREN tracked three wide, quickly overhauled the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, and drew off under a moderate hand ride before being
geared down late. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR trailed in the three path, shifted outside of foes in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach place late. MISS
DISTINCTIVE laid off of the pace in the two path, then split foes three wide in the final furlong to gain show. CAVE CREEK laid off of the pace in the four
path, and failed to menace. BRAGANZA set the pace along the inside, but offered little resistance to MERCY WARREN's bid at the five sixteenths pole,
shifted out and maintained place through midstretch, but faltered between horses in the closing stages. RUBIANA chased two wide, and tired through the
lane. DANCE IT broke multiple lengths slow at the start, tracked along the inside while saving ground, but faded.

Footnotes
CHARLI MICHAEL stalked two wide, bid entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead leaving the sixteenth pole, and held
sway. NOSY BANKER tracked in the three path, took aim on the leader while gaining place nearing the furlong grounds, but was only second best.
GALLANT STAR was reluctant to load, then broke a step slow, raced far back in the four path around the turn, floated to the twelve path in upper stretch,
and rallied willingly while hanging on isr left lead to reach show late. GUITAR TRIBUTE raced towards the rear along the inside, gradually shifted out to the
ten path coming to the three sixteenths pole, and moved up mildly for a minor share. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER sped clear, but offered little resistance to the
eventual winner's bid leaving the quarter pole, and weakened through the final furlong. ADIEU LE CHAT saved ground off of the pace, and improved inside
of foes in midstretch. ZONG TOUGH tracked along the inside, then lacked a bid. DONNA'S COURT tracked two wide and between horses, came into the
lane three wide, and faded. C'MON VE tracked from midpack four wide, drifted to the five path at the five sixteenths pole, then tired between horses through
the final furlong. PERFECT PERIGEE lacked speed in the four path, shifted to the eight path entering the lane, but gave way. BITSY'S CUSTOM C raced in
midpack in the three path, but tired nearing the lane.
