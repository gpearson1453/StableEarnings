Footnotes
TIZ OF THEE off rail advance to turn, took over stretch, went clear late. ROCKET DAWG outside run to turn, four-five wide run quarter pole, no match. ONE
LAST HAND inside speed, dueled to turn, weakened in the stretch for show. WIMOWEH shuffled back start, no speed to turn, improved position late.
BRENTSPENCE slow into stride, well back to turn, finished well late. MR. CUNNINGHAM no speed to the turn, mild bid in stretch, faltered late going.
CONTRACTOR BILL broke well, through early from the turn, dropped back. ONE MORE BABY awkward start, never menaced thereafter. MY GOLD
MIRROR outside speed to the turn, gave way readily in the stretch run. SEVEN AND SEVEN off slow, rushed between horses to turn, came up empty
stretch. RIKIO never a real menace. TRAPPE THE GOLD brief speed outside, gave way abruptly in the turn.

Footnotes
SCOOBIE QUANDO stalked outside to the turn, hooked in a duel, dug in tenaciously through the final furlong to prevail on the wire. RETAINED speed to the
front, well handled to the stretch, hooked and stayed game to the finish. SCHIFTY'S HALOID raced between horses to the turn, rallied on in the stretch for
show spot. ACCIDENT off tardy from gate while racing inside throughout with no late kick when needed. PROVE RIGHT pressed pace to quarter pole but
gave way with no resistance in the stretch run.

show spot. NOTREALLYNOTREALLY unhurried trip from inside to stretch, angled out to move up late. TOO CROWDED no speed to far turn, angled out

factor. MY ANGELICA raced along while back of the pack with no response when needed. SUPORB raced rank into first turn while never a menace.
