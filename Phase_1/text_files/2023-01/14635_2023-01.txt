Footnotes
HANS GRUBER settled just off of the moderate early pace, advanced along the backstretch run and stalked the pace to the quarter marker, mounted a
three wide bid in upper stretch, overtook ROARING TIGER inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the final sixteenth. WILL IS CHILL allowed to
settle, three wide into the first turn, slipped to the inside nearing the top of the lane, finished well, was not able to reel in the winner in the late stages and
was clear for place. ROARING TIGER sent leaving a good beginning, set a pressured pace off of the rail to the second turn, held foes at bay to mid-stretch,
could not hold off HANS GRUBER inside of the furlong pole, weakened in the final stages and held for show. HARBOR SKY rated off of the moderate early
pace, never far back to the second turn, steered four wide into the drive and lacked a late rally. COMMAND A PREMIUM showed early speed, prompted the
moderate early pace while three wide on the first turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, dropped back nearing mid-stretch and
tired. MR BOTANICALS forwardly placed into the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run, within range to the quarter marker, outrun to the furlong
pole and gave way in the final furlong.

HONEYMOONZ OVER hustled to the early lead, raced off of the rail into the turn, set quick fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, extended the lead
in upper stretch and kept to task to hold sway in the final stages. TORPEDO AWAY tracked the quick pace, saved ground on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, could not make headway on HONEYMOONZ OVER in the late stages and held for place. BLAZING JAMIE chased the early pace, saved
ground to the top of the lane, improved position in upper stretch, finished well in deep stretch and was clear for show in the end. AMANOFMYSTATURE
chased the fast early pace, raced two wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive and lacked a late response. I'M CORFU showed early speed, pressed

PIROLI allowed to settle, improved position nearing the second turn, roused three wide approaching the top of the lane, assumed command inside of the
furlong pole and pulled away in the late stages. NICKEL NICKEL NINE forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the reasonable fractions into the second
turn, advanced to vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch, could not match strides with PIROLI in the final furlong and stayed on
to be second best. ACCLIDER crowded a bit at the start and off a step slowly, showed early speed and dictated terms into the first turn, ceded the lead to
COUNT ASHER into the backstretch run, tracked that rival to the second turn, lacked room nearing the quarter marker, angled three wide in upper stretch,
could not make headway on the top pair in deep stretch and passed tiring rivals to secure third. COUNT ASHER prominent in the early going, assumed
command of the early pace along the first turn, set decent fractions to the half-mile marker, confronted nearing the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch and
faded in the final furlong. SIXTYFOUR G T O unhurried, never far back through the backstretch run, raced two wide to the quarter marker and did not

TEAM CONCEPT showed early speed, contested the early pace with LAST INNING, pressed that rival to the second turn, assumed command in upper
stretch, drew clear approaching the furlong pole and kept to task in the final stages. DANCE LADY a bit keen in the early stages while tracking the top pair,
raced close to the decent pace to the second turn, came two then three wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied under firm
handling in the late stages and was up for place in the final strides. ALESHA allowed to settle, two wide along the first turn, not far back along the
backstretch run, four wide on the far turn, closed with good interest in the final furlong and just missed for place, while clear of the rest for show. LIGHT UP
stalked the pace into the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run, maintained position while along the rail to the quarter marker and did not offer a
late rally. LAST INNING prominent into the first turn, disputed the early pace with TEAM CONCEPT, raced three wide into the backstretch run, assumed
command and set pressured fractions to the second turn, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, chased to the furlong pole and tired late.
NORTHERN ROSE off a step slowly, unhurried in the early stages, three wide into the backstretch run, three then two wide along the second turn and did
not threaten in the late stages.

Footnotes
MATCHLESS allowed to settle, advanced four wide on the turn, loomed in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong pole, battled with DANZIGS
STAR STORM to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. DANZIGS STAR STORM tracked the solid early fractions, raced three wide on
the turn, advanced to vie for the lead inside of the furlong pole, met the bid of MATCHLESS and battled with that foe to deep stretch, was gamely bested in
the final strides and held for place. LOVE LOST chased the pace from the second flight, raced two wide to the quarter marker, came in tight in upper stretch,
angled widest leaving the furlong marker, closed with a rush in the final stages and just missed for place, while clear of the rest for show. JERSEY BIRD
forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker, took a narrow lead to mid-stretch, stubbornly gave way inside of the
furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. MY YAMMY LADY bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, trailed in the early stages, advanced
while saving ground on the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, rallied nearing the furlong pole, encountered traffic in mid-stretch and did not produce a late
response. JERSEY STAR chased the early pace, lost position three wide on the turn and finished evenly in the drive. LADY ATTA TUDE broke alertly and
showed good early speed, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted and overtaken in upper stretch, chased while still in aim nearing the
furlong marker and faded in the final stages.

COUNCILWOMAN JILLY showed early speed and prompted the pace into the first turn, kept close attendance to BOSSY PEGASUS through modest
fractions to the half-mile marker, confronted that rival nearing the quarter marker, battled under firm urging to mid-stretch, shook free from a game BOSSY
PEGASUS in deep stretch and just lasted over the oncoming runner-up. KITTEN CALLS unhurried in the early going, raced two wide into the backstretch
run, came three wide into the second turn, rallied six wide for the drive, closed with a rush inside of the furlong pole, came within aim of COUNCILWOMAN
JILLY in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding safely for second. BOSSY PEGASUS broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set
modest fractions while prompted to the quarter marker, was confronted by COUNCILWOMAN JILLY in upper stretch, battled with that foe to mid-stretch,
could not keep pace in the final stages, was gamely bested and held well in the end for third. BIG JOLT prominent in the early stages, saved ground while
stalking the early pace, maintained position to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. PEACEHAVEN bothered
at the start and off slowly, unhurried in the early going, three wide on the first turn, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
was gaining in the final stages but lacked the needed late response. ON VACATION allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, rallied in upper
stretch, could not sustain that bid in the final furlong and flattened out. CAL ROUGH bumped at the start and away a step slowly, was a bit keen while
tracking the pace on the first turn, maintained position to the half-mile marker, lost ground two wide on the second turn, swung four wide for the drive and
gave way. BEA MISCHIEF bumped CAL ROUGH and bothered PEACEHAVEN at the break, forwardly placed in the early stages, three wide along the first
turn, stalked the modest pace to the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened.

GRIGORO allowed to settle, saved all of the ground to the second turn, rallied five wide in upper stretch, closed determinedly inside of the furlong pole,
matched strides with CLASS CODE in deep stretch and gamely won the nod on the wire. CLASS CODE raced in the second flight into the first turn,
maintained position to the second turn, roused four wide leaving the quarter marker, closed fast in mid-stretch, matched strides with GRIGORO in deep
stretch, had a narrow lead in the final strides and was gamely bested on the wire for the win. FANTASTIC SECRET showed early speed and dictated terms
to the first turn, was well handled while setting reasonable fractions to the second turn, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, widened the lead
approaching mid-stretch, was all out in the final sixteenth, was overtaken by the top pair in the final strides and held safely in the end for show. RUNNING
LUCK forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run, lost position on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was
gaining in the final furlong but did not offer the needed late response. NICOLE GRACE rated off of the early pace, well positioned through the backstretch
run, raced two wide to the second turn, rallied in the drive but lacked the needed late response. BRITE TAN forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the
decent pace to the second turn, ran in pursuit of FANTASTIC SECRET to the top of the lane, chased that rival to mid-stretch and weakened in the final
sixteenth. DEL MAR FLASH tossed her head at the start and was away slowly, settled in the early stages, advanced along the backstretch run, saved
ground to the top of the lane, gained ground in the drive but was unable to threaten. STEIN'S GIRL settled in the second flight in the early stages, raced
three wide on the first turn, lost position nearing the second turn and was not a late factor. HALF HOPING settled off of the early pace, raced four wide into
the backstretch run, lost position nearing the second turn, could not keep pace while three wide approaching the quarter marker and did not offer a late
response.

Footnotes
FIRST PREMIO settled in the second flight, was well placed through the backstretch run, ran two wide to the quarter marker, angled four wide approaching
the top of the lane, assumed command inside of the furlong marker, attempted to hang in deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. NOLDE
was a bit fractious in the gate, broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, settled in the second flight through the backstretch run, advanced three wide
nearing the quarter marker, came within aim in mid-stretch, could not match strides with FIRST PREMIO nearing the sixteenth-marker, came again when
the winner attempted to hang in the final strides and was gamely bested for the win, while besting the rest. CLAIM OF PASSION unhurried in the early
going, advanced two wide on the second turn, continued that bid to mid-stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and was up for show in the final strides.
BRONZE WARRIOR raced three wide into the first turn, tracked the loose pacesetter to the second turn, advanced two wide in upper stretch, came in tight
between runners nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace in the final sixteenth and was just edged for show in the final strides. SKY DINSKI allowed to
settle, saved all of the ground to the second turn and offered a mild late rally. DIAMOND BLITZ showed early speed and was sent to establish the pace,
sped to a long lead on the backstretch run, carved out solid fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final
stages. MUAY THAI (IRE) tracked DIAMOND BLITZ through solid early fractions, advanced in upper stretch, could not sustain that run in the final furlong
and flattened out. MOUNT PELLIAR unhurried, three wide along the first turn, trailed while three wide on the second turn and did not factor in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
A ROUSING BABE forwardly placed early, moved up to challenge BRONZE LADY for the lead passing the three furlong marker, engaged that one with a
quarter mile to go, battled from there to the wire gaining the upper hand in the last strides. BRONZE LADY broke sharply and went straight to the front,
established a clear lead to the turn, held the lead to the top of the stretch, met the challenge of A ROUSING BABE from the quarter, dueled gamely to the
end but was outfinished in the shadow of the wire. GET MY POINT away well, was allowed to settle into a stalking position while saving ground through
early going, shifted out to the four path for clear running at the top of the stretch and finished well but came up a bit short. RAUCOUS TIZZY raced in the
back half of the field through the early stages, stayed in the clear through the turn, begin a sustained bid with three furlongs to go, swung out six wide at the
top of the late, took the path of LUCKY LOCKETT near the 1/4 pole, was gaining but had too much ground to make up. STANDFORGRIT broke well and
angled over from the outside, settled off the flank of BRONZE LADY down the back stretch, switched to the inside approaching the turn, responded to heavy
pressure three furlongs out and remained a threat mid-stretch and weakened late. MO TOWN GAL was up with the chasing pack through the first quarter
mile, began a strong bid through the turn and loomed boldly at the top of the stretch but flattened out with a furlong to go. SHE'S FANCY LIKE got a good
position early, saved ground through the turn, came under pressure from the five-sixteenths and finished with some interest while never a serious threat.
HOT LINK unable to keep up in the early stages, moved to the rail to save ground, was ridden from the half-mile pole but lacked a response. HALLELUJAH
BABY devoid of early speed, fell well behind and chased the field to the stretch, kept on and managed to pass one in the late stages. LUCKY LOCKETT off
slowly, settled into stride at the back of field for the first quarter, made a mild middle race move, steadied near the eighth pole off the heels of RAUCOUS
TIZZY and was not persevered with from there.
