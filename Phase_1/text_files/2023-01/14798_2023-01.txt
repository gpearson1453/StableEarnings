MAD GENIUS took the lead two deep into the first turn and rated clear from the nine sixteenths pole, came pressure toward the five sixteenths pole,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. TAPIT TO THE WIRE rated close to the earlier pace in the three
and four paths, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, contested at a disadvantage two deep through the far turn and proved no match in the lane
while dueling for second. FIVE STAR PHIL rounded the opening turn in the five path then stalked from the half mile pole, gave chase toward the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then relented second in the duel through the stretch. URBAN WARRIOR settled close off the rail on the first
turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn but flattened the final sixteenth. SCINTILLIO
raced with the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded in the three path of the far turn. INGREIDO saved ground off the pace then
bid only mildly approaching the five sixteenths pole. UNIMPEACHED rated close inside on the first turn but showed little response through the backstretch.

DULCIMER DAME stalked three wide, took aim nearing the five sixteenths pole and contested the far turn two deep, moved to the lead approaching the
head of the lane, raced clear past the eighth pole and was mildly hand urged in the lane. BETCHA BY GOLLY stalked off the rail the first turn, took over at
the half mile pole and came under pressure leaving the three eighths, contested the edge nearest the rail most of the far turn, but was met toward the head
of the lane and ceded leaving the eighth pole. DIVINE FASHION rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out toward the head of the lane but showed little further. MY JUBA saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and finished evenly to improve her position. CHINA CAT became a bit
fractious in the gate then hesitated at the break, saved ground racing well back from contention, improved in the four path of the far turn, left the turn outside
and finished evenly. TARGE was not a factor. HIDDEN IDENTITY rounded the first turn in the four path then stalked leaving the turn, picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole but flattened while losing ground on the far turn. VALID REASON set the pace inside, was met leaving the first turn, gave chase
through the backstretch then faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
SWEET VALERIA rounded the opening turn in the five path then stalked into the backstretch, started her bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced
close four wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear late yards. WHY LEA rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up
the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced five wide on the far turn, dug in from the eighth pole and took second the final strides. CAN'T
FIGURE settled close in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, left
the turn on the heels of NOBLE PRESENT, eased out from that point and briefly occupied second place, but flattened in the final yards, while the latter
stalked off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn and remained a close factor to mid-stretch
before flattening stride. OUR GOLDEN COLLEEN rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested even terms at
the rail on the far turn, was met mid-stretch and flattened stride. MANGORITA raced well off the early pace about the four path, left the turn outside and
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran evenly in the lane. KOKOLORES raced off the rail on
the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. LICENSE TO CARRY saved early
ground and showed little response through the backstretch. BODIE'S STORM rounded the opening turn in the four path and showed little response.
AMERICAN LEGACY was through after three eighths.
