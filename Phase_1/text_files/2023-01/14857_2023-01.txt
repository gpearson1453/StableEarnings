Footnotes
FROSTED GRACE away in good order, prompted the pace from the three path, asked along far turn after falling back a bit, bid into the lane, took over,
shook clear, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. ANTIGRAVITY off a step slow, trailed as a result, continued back the middle half, angled
four wide into the lane, getting to the winner in the late going. RED KNOBS in the second flight while racing in the two path, continued race within striking
distance into the final turn, angled three wide when called on for run entering the stretch, raced flat late to finish up best of the rest. EASTSIDE COOL took
command along the inside soon after the start, set the pace while firmly in hand up the backstretch, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted
entering the stretch, faltered soon after when headed by that one. ZOOMER in the second flight along the inside, failed to respond in the drive.
WINDCRACKER pressed the leader in the two path, brief bid between horses and inside the winner late in that bend, stopped in the drive to trail home.

Footnotes
DRIFTER broke back, lacked speed outside, angled five wide into the lane, roused soon after, challenged widest past the sixteenth pole and proved best
under continued firm handling. IMMORAL behind the first flight toward the inside, steered out three wide turning for home, bid between horses and inside
the winner, could not match strides with that one late to prove second best. PENETRATOR with the early pace in the three path, vied through the turn, clear
into the lane while in hand, outkicked by the top two late while closest to the inside of that first flight. AMERICAN SMOOTH in mid pack while outside, four
wide turning for home, finished up evenly in lacking a closing kick. SHAKEDOWN STREET off a step slow, trailed toward the inside, asked along while three
wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR in the main body along the inside, moved to the two path
turning into the stretch, improved a bit in upper stretch, flat late to be going evenly at the end. SAINT PIO dropped to the inside when lacking speed early
turn, remained back in the run through the lane. FREER with the early pace closest to the inside, fell back into the turn, moved out in the two path late in the
turn, came up empty for the stretch run. UPTOWN HUSTLER moved up to vie between horses the opening furlong, continued to battle early turn, chased
into the lane when beginning to weaken, continued give way to the wire.

Footnotes
LOOKIN HIGH settled off the early pace, closer three wide into the far turn when asked, bid entering the stretch, edged steadily clear the final furlong under
firm handling. SPACE ODESSEY shook clear into the first turn, continued to set the pace up the backstretch in the two path, responded and dueled with the
winner upper stretch then gave ground grudgingly the final furlong, clearly second best. MR. TIP broke back, lacked speed, outside, four wide onto the
backstretch, four to five wide second turn, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top two. HIGHER AUTHORITY in the second flight in the first
turn in the four path, continued outside while remaining in a striking position up the backstretch, four wide again in the second turn, went evenly through the
stretch. FIRST LINE broke back, trailed much of the way, passed some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. EVEN THUNDER saved ground through the
first turn, moved out, three wide through the second bend, lacked a response. BAYOU SARGE chased the leader from along the inside early, began to tire
after a half. SONIC CITY forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, began a steady retreat after four furlongs.

Footnotes
HELLORHIGHWATER close from the start, ranged up to challenge in the three path second turn, shook clear into the lane, drew out, driving. FLATOUT
WINNER in the second flight off the inside, continued three wide the middle half, roused for the drive, proved no match for the winner, edged away for the
second spot. ESKENFORIT dueled between horses past the wire first time, clear before a quarter, vied middle half, weakened drive, saved the show.
COLOSI behind the pace toward the inside, in traffic turning for home, lacked a closing response when clear for the drive. JINGLE slow to settle when in
traffic first turn, moved through to race forwardly up the backstretch, continued forward second turn, faded through stretch. PROMISING SHOES back off
the pace out in the strip, four wide onto the backstretch, continued four wide while between horses far turn, tired in the drive. LEADER OF MEN last to
leave, trailed most of the way, failed to menace. ZOFFA four to five wide first turn, continued well wide and raced in the five path again through the second
bend, lacked a rally.

Footnotes
TRULY A ROCKET broke with the leaders, dueled into the first turn off the inside, continued to alternate into the far bend, disposed of the other speed into
the lane, drew out steadily through the stretch under a left handed crop. C. C. HARBOR off a step slow, trailed well back for six furlongs, angled out three
wide when beginning to move turning for home, staged a willingly rally through traffic to annex the second spot. COURTNEY FAY in tight, squeezed and
jostled into the first turn, mid pack onto the backstretch, closer with a mid move in the two path far turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive, saved the
show. BLOW SUM SMOKE in mid pack early outside, four wide when improving in the far turn, also failed to follow through to finish up evenly. WAR MUSIC
in the second flight outside, four wide late in the first turn, continued in the four path second bend, also found lacking in the run through the lane.
HAMAZING DEBATE broke on top, cleared toward the inside when showing the way into the first turn, dueled the middle half while continuing closest to the
rail, gave way in the drive. CHAI TEA in mid pack early, steadied when in tight entering the far turn, steered out five wide after recovering, no kick.
SWEETNESS TO brushed in tight quarters into the first turn, continued in mid pack and made little impact. RIVERCREST GIRL broke back and failed to
menace. MOCHA KISS chased the dueling leaders for a five furlongs and began to weaken. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL restless in the gate, broke back
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BAND broke with the leaders, fell back off the first flight inside, moved off the rail midway on the turn, called on for run into the lane, dropped
back inside past the furlong marker and finished up willingly to prove best. COLLECTED GLORY broke back and lacked speed outside, four wide into the
turn, three wide exiting when beginning to advance, bid, willing second. TRUE EMOTION took control after the start to show the way up the backstretch
inside, dueled turn, continued to vie upper stretch, weakened from between the top two the final sixteenth while remaining clear for the show. FREE WILL
pressed the issue up the backstretch off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path then weakened when the real running began entering the stretch.
THROUGH THE CRACKS went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. OLD SCHOOL FLASH broke outward and a step slow, raced back,
four wide into the stretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. WINEHOUSE restless prior to the start, reloaded, broke back
and never threatened. STEPONTHEFOOTFEET broke out, settled in the second flight, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
JEDREK lacked early foot, moved closer in the four path second turn, drifted out slightly in upper stretch when challenging to compound the runner up's
traffic foes, was straightened and showed good determination to prove best between rivals. DEPUTY CONNECT off a step slow, moved up closer into the
first turn, in hand, traffic late in the second turn, continued to lack room upper stretch, blocked when straightened for home, angled in, not enough in the late
going to outkick the winner. STAND PROUD in tight, checked up early first turn, trailed, three to four wide far turn, advanced, bid nearing the furlong
grounds, not enough late while between rivals. ASSET BASIS within striking distance off the inside, three down to two wide second in some traffic late in the
final turn, came up empty for the stretch run. ABSOLUTE COURAGE showed the way early along the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, vied into
lane, weakened while continuing inside. CYCLONE pulled while tracking the pace inside, had little for the drive. COLONEL BARTON pressured the leader
off the inside, shuffled back and steadied from between horses late in the final turn, fell back, trailed home. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RUNNER UP AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
LICHITA broke on top, showed the way early inside, dueled through the turn, headed, battled back in showing grip to edge clear late. CHASING SHADOWS
raced in mid pack and off the inside, came three wide for the drive, rallied late to be up for the place while getting to the winner. SO IT WOULD SEEM
chased the winner up the backstretch in the two path, moved up to duel and put a head in front by late in the turn, continued to hold a narrow advantage a
furlong out, faltered in the late going to be outkicked by the winner and lose the place late. SIMONA'S CHOICE lacked speed while racing outside, four wide
trip through the turn, displayed some mild interest to improve position. BETCHA raced closest to the two leaders while three wide into and through the turn,
had little left for the stretch run. BECKY'S TATTOO off a step slow, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. CARELESS
HEIRESS in mid pack while saving ground, tired from those early efforts. DISTORTED SECRETS in the second flight while racing three wide, faded.
CAGED BEAR void of early foot, dropped inside turn, had nothing for the drive.
