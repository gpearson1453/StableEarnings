that bend, angled three wide near the quarter pole, split rivals in upper stretch, reached near even terms in midstretch, dueled outside through the final
furlong and was edging further ahead late. GIRLY THE BUTCHER settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled in nearing the quarter pole, bid inside
of foes nearing the eighth pole, battled on inside of the winner through the final furlong and was narrowly outfinished. TRUE MARTINI bumped at the start,
set a clear pace in the two path, led to midstretch and held well enough to preserve the show. KIT CAN RUN saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in
upper stretch and had a mild rally. OPENTHEGATE saved ground well back early, advanced five wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. ALWAYS
CONNECTED chased the pace two and three wide and faded in the lane. RAMADHAAN (IRE) failed to menace while racing three and four wide.
TEMERITY bumped at the start and never threatened while racing three wide. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER steadied entering the first turn, saved ground
around that bend, advanced outside down the backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. SET SAIL CARLIN steadied
at the start, raced two wide and was never involved. PUBLIC SERVICE chased the pace in the three path, checked near the five-sixteenths marker and was

Footnotes
STARSHIP RENEGADE got bumped on both sides at the start, trailed along the inside into the turn, angled out under rousing and was in the five path
passing the three eighths pole, swung out to the seven path going into the lane, rallied past a trio of inner rivals near the sixteenth pole and went clear.
AVANT GLORY tracked in the four path, was coaxed passing the three eighths pole, took aim from the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place.
MAGICAL WARRIOR pressed the pace in the two path, was cued to take the lead passing the quarter pole and was under right handed urging from the five
path turning into the lane, but evened out passing the eighth pole, and held on to show. FLOKI'S FLIGHT set the pace inside, was coaxed from said position
nearing the five sixteenths pole, was driven from the three path into the stretch, but yielded going into the final furlong. ROUGH ENTRY bumped with
STARSHIP RENEGADE at the start, stalked in the three path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but was tired. SONG RUNNER bumped into
STARSHIP RENEGADE out of the gate, chased in the two path but was no menace.

Footnotes
ROYAL MENDE set the pace in the two path, drifted into the five path turning for home, dug in inside of foes while drifting out a bit in the lane and was
edging further ahead late. NATE THE GREAT tracked the pace three wide, bid four wide around the far turn, reached near even terms near the quarter
pole, was floated seven wide into the lane, vied outside of the winner through the stretch and was turned back. COAST ALONG stalked the pace inside, had
aim inside of the top two finishers through the lane but was one-paced. CURLINS INCHARGE raced off the pace two wide, swung nine wide in upper stretch
and had a mild rally. HIGHLAND LORD prompted the winner in the three path, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, was floated into the six path
turning for home, steadied when in tight near the eighth pole and lacked a further bid. AMERICAN RAIDER was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two
and three wide and lacked the needed rally. DITHER was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. HARRINGTON failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. DONTONIO hesitated at the start, saved ground and made little impact. LYTE CRUDE chased the pace four and five wide and
lacked a closing bid. MAKE 'EM TAP was outrun while racing four wide. FREE BIRDS raced off the pace three wide, had no response and was eased in the
lane. OBEJCTIONS LODGED BY THE RIDERS OF HIGHLAND LORD AND NATE THE GREAT AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WERE NOT ALLOWED.

GLORIOUS TRIBUTE raced three wide in midpack, advanced three wide around the far turn, steadily gained under left-handed urging, took over near the
sixteenth pole and drew clear late. DRUM AND DRUMMER stalked the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and held well
for the place. BLUTO'S CANDY was shuffled back not long after the start, trailed inside, raced three wide around the far turn, swung widest in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied belatedly. BACH raced off the pace three and four wide and finished evenly. NATURE BOY set a clear pace
in two path, was collared in upper stretch and weakened inside. SAVAGE SAILOR played no factor while racing two wide. MORETHANICANHANDLE
steadied along inside through the opening half, chased inside around the far turn and retreated through the lane. DANLEY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
MUSICAL JOURNEY was prompted along in the four path, took the lead passing the quarter pole and was cued from said position turning into the lane,
opened slightly into the final furlong, began to shorten passing the sixteenth pole, and just held on under right handed urging. BEAUTY DESTINY had an
awkward start, stalked in the three path, waited for room before being angled out to the seven path under rousing turning into the stretch, and ran on for
place. LIGHT AND PATH chased in the five path, was ridden around the turn and swung out to the eight path into the lane, and kept on for show. WOLF
RAYET trailed in the three path, was under a drive while being floated out to the nine path going into the stretch, and finished evenly. ST. JOE JET raced
prominently from the five path, made a bid around the turn and was coaxed in the six path going into the lane, but faded. CAMILLA tracked in the four path,
was cued passing the quarter pole but had to steady turning into the stretch, and was no factor. WICKED ICE was sent to lead from the two path but
gaveway around the turn.

Footnotes
CANDIDATE set the pace in the two path, kicked clear nearing the quarter pole, angled to the rail turning for home, spurted clear and held clear under a
drive. MAJOR DUDE tracked the pace two wide, tipped three wide near the quarter pole and rallied through the lane. WORTHINGTON prompted the winner
while firmly rated in the three path, could not match strides with that foe nearing the quarter pole and weakened while herded in by the runner-up in the final
furlong. CONGRUENT was bumped between foes at the start, raced in range four wide and faded in the lane. SOUZAK (FR) was bumped at the start, raced
off the pace inside, steadied near the three-eighths pole, hit the rail in upper stretch and never threatened. CHEERFUL CHARLIE broke outwardly and
bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace and had no response. BARZINI was bumped between foes at the start, was rank nearing the first turn, raced
four wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
CAIRO CONSORT was reluctant to load, bobbled at the break, settled off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, steadily gained, was
up near the sixteenth pole and held safe. STEPHANIE'S CHARM saved ground well back, advanced three wide around the far turn, angled five wide in
upper stretch and finished fastest off all. NAVY GOAT broke awkwardly then bumped LADY AZTECA soon after, saved ground in midpack, went two wide
between foes around the far turn then rallied between rivals to gain the show late. ERNA stalked the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole,
led to the sixteenth marker and weakened late. ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) saved ground in range and was blocked through the final furlong. SHOWGIRL
LYNNE B set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. LADY AZTECA was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace two wide, made a four wide
gain around the far turn but lacked a closing bid. BEL PENSIERO was pulled up midway down the backstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
PICKING UP PENNIES led from the five path into the turn, was coaxed passing the five sixteenths pole, opened slightly from the six path in upper stretch,
and held sway. TWELVE VOLT MAN tracked in the three path, was ridden around the turn and swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, and kept on
for place. PAPPACAP stalked in the four path. was driven while tipping out to the six path turning into the stretch, shifted back in to the four path, and
flattened out for show. LOOKIN AT ROSES bumped with TARTUFO out of the gate, trailed from the five path early and never factored. GREAT KING (FR)
was prominent early in the two path but faded in the stretch. TARTUFO bumped with LOOKIN AT ROSES at the start, was wellback in the six path and
never threatened. SECRET ALLIANCE bobbled at the start, chased in the five path but was empty and eased at the top of the stretch, jogged across the
wire and walked off.

Footnotes
MOON CAT chased in the four path, drifted out to the eleven path turning into the lane, and rallied down the center while shifting slightly inwards under right
handed urging to get up in the final strides. JUSTIN'S LEGACY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the two path, bumped with COOLER KING
while in the three path turning into the stretch, ran on to take the lead just past the eighth pole, but drifted out and was caught late to place. MUTAAWID was
unhurried along the inside, tipped out to the two path going into the lane, drifted out passing the eighth pole and bumped BLAME D RULE MAKER, and kept
on for show. BLAME D RULE MAKER raced in midpack from the five path, was roused around the far turn, bumped with ONE FAST DREAM turning into
the stretch and was under a drive in the eight path, stayed on but got bumped by MUTAAWID passing the eighth pole, and evened out late. JAMESTOWN
set a loose lead from the two path, was cued entering the stretch, but yielded passing the sixteenth pole. MY SANCTUARY bumped with an outer foe at the
start and was behind in the two path early, was ridden from the three path into the lane, but was never able to challenge. ONE FAST DREAM stalked in the
three path, bumped with BLAME D RULE MAKER out in the seven path turning into the stretch, and flattened out. COOLER KING raced prominently in the
two path, bumped with JUSTIN'S LEGACY in the four path turning into the lane, and faded. COMPOSER'S DREAM had trouble negotiating the first turn and
was steadied in the six path early, trailed into the far turn and never threatened. FABLED PRINCE bumped with an outer foe at the start, was reserved along
the rail early, angled out to the five path down the backstretch, floated out to the seven path around the far turn, but was no factor. HARDY CHOICE
bumped with an inner foe leaving the gate, was held up from the six path around the first turn, shifted into the four path down the backstretch, had to steady
near the three eighths pole, and was empty going into the stretch. EVENTFUL had an awkward start and never menaced racing around the three path. AN
OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF COOLER KING AGAINST THE RIDER OF JUSTIN'S LEGACY FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS
DISALLOWED.
