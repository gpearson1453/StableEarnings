Footnotes
UNEEDTOCOMEHOME had good position on the inside, awaited room on the turn, angled out two wide in the stretch, drew off late under a hand ride.
MIXTER JENSEN dueled early, gained a clear lead on the turn, remained clear in mid stretch, could not match strides late with the winner but held place.
TWINSPIREDJOEY tracked three wide and went evenly late. RED HEAD KID pressed the pace until the stretch, then weakened. HAPPY TAKEOVER
allowed to settle, failed to menace. ORLEANS STORM saved ground and was no menace. MUCH TIMES TWO wide early, was outrun. SWEET JILL'S
JACK was no factor.
