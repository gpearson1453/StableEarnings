FACTOTUM set the pace two to three wide early, made a two wide bid to draw clear on the turn, then was roused leaving the turn and drew off to prove
much the best, driving. CAIRO BOOGIE was off slowly, reserved early, advanced on the inside, then shifted off the inside and made a three wide move on
the turn, proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. HE CAME TRUE was settled early towards the inside, then was between rivals
leaving the half mile marker, two wide by the quarter pole and bested the rest. SIMILAR TASTE lacked a rally. ADY'S MUNNY tracked the early pace, then
was three to four wide on the turn and tired. GRATITUDE ATTITUDE chased the pace three wide and stopped. YANKEE EMPIRE pressed the pace on the
inside and stopped.

furlong to prove much the best under a drive. MISCHIEF MELODY vied for the lead three wide, then set the pace and moved to the inside on the turn, then
was headed leaving the quarter pole and was no match for the winner while clearly second best. ELEGANT TASTE was settled early, advanced three to
four wide on the turn but lacked a late rally to best the rest. WIN FOR LAILA chased the pace on the inside and weakened. ASGATA pressed the early pace
on the inside and weakened. CRIMSON LILLE was settled early and between rivals on the turn and had no rally. SKIPOVER lacked a rally. JO AMY chased
the pace four wide and weakened. SANTAFE EXPRESS failed to menace. AWESOME TAP was not a factor.
