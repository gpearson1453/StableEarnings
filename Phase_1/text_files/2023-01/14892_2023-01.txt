was outrun early, was carried out eight wide though the second turn, was closing fast and finished second best. FLAXY LADY was off slow, rushed to be not
far back, drifted out seven wide through the second turn, drifted in late and held for third. DELIA was unhurried early, raced four wide into the second turn,
angled in mid stretch and offered no rally. DESERT SPIRIT was reserved early, made a five wide middle move into the second turn and flattened out.
SHORT POCKETS was void of any speed, raced four wide into the second turn and never fired. PLATINUM GREEK was allowed to settle early, raced
between rivals and was no threat. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS followed the early pace from off the rail and faded. SHUGS CHARLIE was eased back while
racing far wide and tired.
