Footnotes
READY ON THE LINE set the pace in the two path, opened up and was cued from the five path turning into the lane, and held sway. HEART BOY stalked in
the four path early, tipped out to the six path down the backstretch and moved up going into the far turn, was driven from said position into the stretch, and
chased home the winner for place. DREAM OF BLESSINGS tracked along the inside, evened out from the the two path in the stretch, but dug in late to hold
on to show honors. COLLISION chased in the four path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but flattened out and hung late. NAPA DUDE raced off
the pace in the four path, angled out and was coaxed from the seven path turning into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, and was no factor. BUDDHA
BOY broke in a tangle, was behind in the three path early and never threatened. GO GO GREEN prompted the pace in the five path but dropped back
around the far turn.

Footnotes
MAJOR WAGER pressed the pace two wide, took a short lead near the quarter pole, dueled outside of RED FLAG ALERT to deep stretch and held on
between foes late. OUR COUNTRY steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace two wide around that bend, checked late on the turn, raced three wide
between foes around the far turn, closed outside and just missed. RED FLAG ALERT set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the
quarter pole and fought on inside to the wire. UNO TIGER was bumped soon after the start, tracked the pace two wide, kept trying through the lane but was
outkicked. SO STREET stalked the pace three wide and was one-paced between foes in the lane. FREEDOM MATTERS raced off the pace three and four
wide and never threatened. ATTENTIVE was bumped soon after the start, raced well back inside, angled out in upper stretch but never found a clear path
and was hand ridden through the lane.

POUNCIVAL set a pressured pace inside and drew off under a drive. SOLOMONS GOLD raced off the pace four wide and was along for the place.
SMOKIN CLOUD had early speed inside, could not keep pace around the turn and bested the rest. ALL ABOUT LUCKY chased the pace three wide,
angled to the rail near the five-sixteenths pole and had no response. ART HANDLER was fractious in the gate, hit the starting gate and was always far back
inside. SURPRISE PAYOFF pressed the winner two wide, bore out in upper stretch, pulled up just short of the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
ENGLISH PAINTER tracked in the two path, was roused around the far turn and angled out to the six path under left handed urging into the stretch, and
rallied to get up in the final sixteenth. RIGHT ON RICHIE set the pace in the two path, was coaxed turning into the lane, and dug in to hold place.
MCMONEY was held up in the four path early, was roused to move up around the far turn and bid from the six path into the stretch, and hung for show.
LIGHTNING TONES rated along the inside, was driven from the three path into the stretch, shifted back inside in upper stretch, and evened out. SUPER
SPREADER was reserved in the two path early, was ridden from the seven path into the stretch, but flattened. MEHLEK stalked in the five path, took aim
from the four path turning into the lane, but faded. CABAR SUL brushed the side of the gate then bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed along the
inside early and was no factor. COMMANDER FLYNN bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, but backed up around the
far turn, was eased into the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
RIDING PRETTY was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace two and three wide, angled in near the quarter pole, closed inside, took over near the
sixteenth pole and dug in to prevail. METAPHYSICAL rated up close inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes and just missed. AGUA
DULCE (GB) set the pace along the rail, drifted out through the stretch, yielded near the sixteenth pole but kept on between for third. SCOTTISH
SYMPHONY was bumped nearing the first turn, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, was brushed nearing the sixteenth pole,
switched back to the left lead and flattened out. THIRTY THOU KELVIN was fractious in the gate, was bumped and checked nearing the first turn, raced
well back inside and rallied belatedly. MOHAWK TRAIL pressed the pace two wide, drifted out in the stretch, brushed near the sixteenth pole and
weakened. MAROON BELLS chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. PALLOTTA SISTERS broke outwardly and bumped foes at
the start, raced three and four wide and went evenly. STATE OF MIND was shut off at the start, trailed in the three path early, steadied late on the first turn,
saved ground around the far turn and never threatened. FIRING BULLETS was bumped at the start and made little impact while racing two and three wide.

DOUBLE PLAY KING chased in the six path, shifted in and ranged up in the four path around the turn, was cued to bid going into the stretch, lost the whip
approaching the eighth pole, was ridden to a clear win, pulled up after the wire, and was vanned off. BIRD WILDCAT pressed in the four path, took the lead
going into the turn, was roused from the two path into the lane, got caught by the winner in upper stretch, but held on to place. BADBADBOBBY got bumped
by an outer foe at the start, rated in the two path, shifted out to the five path and was under right handed urging going into the stretch, and finished evenly
for show. MR. BOUMA stalked in the five path but faded from the six path in the stretch. ONE AMERICA set the pace in the two path but yielded around the
turn. SHASTREE broke in and bumped an inner foe, and trailed throughout around the six path.

Footnotes
OVER THE CHANNEL settled off the early pace in the four path, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three wide around most of the far turn, took
over two wide near the quarter pole, vied past the eighth pole and drove clear. J P HELLISH set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the
quarter pole, fought on inside of that foe past the eighth pole and held second. TIMMY M. was bumped nearing the first turn, saved ground off the pace and
ran on for the show. MARISA'S MISSION raced in range two and three wide and was one-paced between foes in the lane. THE MAR was bumped early,
trailed in the three path, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. BACKCHAT raced off the
pace four wide, bid four wide midway around the far turn and weakened in the lane. DRILLOMATIC failed to menace while racing three and four wide.
SUNSET PROVISION pressed the pace two wide, stopped nearing the quarter pole, was pulled up in deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
BEST DEFENSE set the pace in the two path, was given a right handed cue to open up from the four path entering the stretch, responded well and held
sway. MR. AMERICAN was prompted along in the four path, took aim from the five path and was under left handed urging turning into the lane, and chased
home the winner for place. LAWFUL tracked in the five path, was driven from the six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. PORTOFINO stalked along
the inside, was roused from the the three path into the lane, but flattened. BOY O' BOY was reluctant to load, chased in the six path but was never able to
factor. VICTORY LINE was held up in the two path but never threatened. DON'T ANSWER dwelt out of the gate, trailed throughout and drifted out through
the stretch.
