Footnotes
WHAT A KNOCKOUT raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a
bid from the four path coming around the far bend, dueled in the lane and edged clear late. HOLLYWOOD HONEY led the field from the two path around
the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn still in the two path, dug in in the lane and gave way late. BRYCENS GOLD saved ground
around the first turn, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and chased the top two home. MAY
BEAU raced in the three path at the pack of the pack through the opening half mile, improved position while racing in the two path around the far turn and
finished evenly. BLUSHING KEYLEN raced in the three path early, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path
coming around the far turn and faded in the stretch. C'EST PARTI raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace,
saved ground around the second bend and was empty in the lane. A FOOLISH FANCY saved ground at the back of the pack around the first turn and up
the backstretch, trailed the field from the two path around the far turn and was never a factor.
