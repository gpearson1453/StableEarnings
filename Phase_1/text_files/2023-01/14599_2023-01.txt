Footnotes
SASSY SAGEY broke in good order, moved up to show the way into the turn, headed by the runner up midway on the bend, fell further back off that foe into
the stretch, set down, came again while remaining inside to be clear at the wire. HAIL COLUMBIA bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to contest the
pace four wide up the backstretch, shook clear late in the turn, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late while
lasting for the second spot. SHIP IT forwardly placed, moved closer three wide late in the turn, saw that progress stall in upper stretch, getting to the runner
up late. GRAYDAWN DAY shuffled back when in tight a furlong in, continued back and three wide through most of the turn, steered out widest for the drive,
improved position. NO DRAMA MOMMA checked up in traffic midway up the backstretch, also fell back, three wide through the stretch, failed to muster a
bid. AIN'TNOSWEETIE within striking distance for a half along the inside, tired stretch. MI CRESCENDO bothered to be off slowly, was never involved.
CAMARADERIE pressed the issue three down to two wide for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
SOBRIETY bumped at the start, raced well behind the first flight, angled out to be four wide when advancing on that group late in the turn, continued to rally
on the outside through the lane to be up in time. IMPOVERISHED broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way midstretch, could
not contain the winner, well clear for the place. DANCIN ROCKET broke out, bumped, pressed the runner up from between horses and outside the runner
up, dueled with that one upper stretch, weakened a bit the final furlong, saved the show. CYBERTOWN back off the pace and the inside, two path through
the turn, staged a mild rally to be gaining for the show. DIESEL FUEL pressured the issue up front for a half three wide, had little left for the late going. MR.
WULLY BULLY went one paced while racing four wide through the turn. WORK ALL DAY broke in, steadied, lacked speed as a result, three wide through
the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. FINBARFUREY broke back, lacked speed, three to four wide turning for home, widest through
the lane, improved position by passing tiring rivals. POINT BLANK in mid pack while racing three wide, had little left for the drive. HEART HEADED ARKY
within striking distance while four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, gave way. ACCEL JOE was finished early. ROSIE'S BOY slight bother then ducked
in sharply to unseat rider just after the start. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
TWITTY CITY off a step slow, raced unhurried for five furlongs, steered out four wide when advancing late in the final turn, lost some ground to the leader
into the lane, engaged that one late and wore that same foe late to be up in time. GENERATOR set the pace in the two path through the first turn, continued
to show the way the middle half, shook clear when straightened for home, responded when confronted by the winner late, proved stubborn in the waning
strides. EGOMANIAC settled off the pace and the inside, raced in the two path throughout, gained the nod for the show with some mild late interest, no real
threat to the top two. ESKENFORIT restless in the gate, broke with the field, advanced to race forwardly and three wide, steadied from between horses
turning into the stretch, fell back, went evenly to the wire to miss the show. SPARK (PER) broke alertly, with the first flight, continued to press toward the
inside up the backstretch, moved out in the two path far turn, weakened from between foes into the stretch. KEESAWAH void of speed, four wide through
the final turn, made little impact through the stretch. ARRIVAL off a step slow, lacked speed, improved position middle half mile, weakened in the drive.
GOLD VERMILION forwardly placed early, bit rank, steadied first turn, stopped, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
SUPER WONDER GIRL in the second flight early, followed the leader into the stretch just off the inside, dropped in for the stretch run, rallied up the inside
to be in time. PRINCEDREAMCESS worked way clear and toward the inside the opening quarter, large lead early turn, shrugged off foe into lane, could not
contain the winner, clear second. A REAL JEWEL dueled early inside the winner, chased that one into the turn, closer outside that one turning for home but
then failed to follow through. ITALIAN JUSTICE forwardly placed while racing three wide, lacked a closing kick. MOHAYLADY lacked speed outside,
continued three wide through the turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. LADY ASTRID in the second flight just off the inside, had little for the
drive. CHASING SHADOWS saved ground to no avail. A GIRL LIKE ME off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

TITLE SHOT outrun for a half toward the inside, some traffic into lane, knifed out and hit a seam between foes past the furlong marker, up in time outside
the leader. LAPIS LAZULI forwardly placed while well out in the strip in the run up the backstretch, advanced and challenged four wide through the turn,
shook clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner late while remaining clear for the runner up spot. SEASIDE BOY slammed at the
break to spot the field a couple of lengths, fell further back the opening quarter, came three wide through the turn, steered out widest when beginning to
advance approaching midstretch, closed with a rush to be up late for the show. CITY LEGEND broke out, bumped, lacked speed, three wide through the
turn, rallied with some interest the final furlong, nipped late for the show. COLE SPUR forced in and was bumped at the break, settled in mid pack while off
the inside, lacked a serious response in the drive. JESUIT in the main body well out in the strip, five wide turning for home, also lacked a closing kick.
GALACTIC EMPIRE dueled early off rail, continued to vie while between horses through the turn, faltered when the real running began at the head of the
lane. PRACTICAL MAN prompted the pace three wide, challenged inside the runner up and between horses turn, gave way in the drive. CALIPARI broke in,
forced rival inward, was straightened to race outside, floated out five wide exiting the turn, no rally. MARK THE MOOSE saved ground to no avail. BRASKA
was finished early. HELLEPHENT with the early pace along the inside, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
ALEXANDROS lacked speed, called on for some run while in the two path into the lane, finished with good late energy to be in time while inside the late
leader. ONE FOR RICHIE broke alertly, shook clear, gained a larger advantage when nearing the furlong marker, failed to contain the winner, held sway for
the place. SOARING BIRD closest to the leader up the backstretch, continued to pursue that one through the turn and into the lane, had little for that one
the final furlong while also no match for the winner. JACKMAN settled well off the pace, raced three wide through the turn, improved a bit while not proving
dangerous. FREUDIAN FATE within striking distance outside, four wide into the stretch, came up empty for the stretch run. STEFANO one paced while
racing four out to five wide through the turn, failed to menace. LT. JUNIOR GRADE forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat before a half. JIM AND
JIM off a step slow, remained always back. ERNIE BANKER was never a factor.

Footnotes
ROCK STAR PARKING forwardly placed from the start, advanced and challenged the early leader from the outside late in the turn, dueled past the furlong
marker then surged clear late. KANT BELIEVE IT showed the way up the backstretch, responded when challenged late in the turn, dueled through upper
stretch and past the furlong marker proving stubborn until late, clearly second best. SUE ELLEN MISHKIN asked early, closest the leader while off the
inside for three furlongs, brief wait behind the top two five sixteenths out, could not keep up with that pair through the lane, saved the show. BLACK KAT
TAPS off a step slow, remained sluggish up the backstretch, came widest for the drive, slowly gaining for the show. PIPELINE GIRL made little impact while
racing inside. LA MORENA failed to menace while also saving ground to no avail. CANT BE TOUCHED in mid pack for a half, backed up through the
stretch.

Footnotes
VICTORY FORMATION broke on top, was used a bit to clear early in the first turn while crossing to the inside, rated well in hand when cruising up the
backstretch, still under light restraint through the final bend, remained clear through the lane under a single left handed crop to win ridden out. ANGEL OF
EMPIRE broke back, dropped to the inside to save some ground first turn, moved closer before a half, asked along second turn when advancing closest to
the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one while comfortably holding the second spot. DENINGTON lacked early foot while four wide in the main
body through the first turn, remained back up the backstretch, asked along three wide second turn, some late interest to be along for the show, not a threat
to the top two. WESTERN GHENT away well, stayed inside the winner into the first turn, bothered when that one took the rail, moved out, chased that same
foe the middle half mile, had little for the runner up in upper stretch, caught late for the show. HOW DID HE DO THAT settled off the pace, fell back after a
half to trail, raced inside through the second turn, improved while continuing inside, no real threat. TEN DAYS LATER last away, trailed well back, picked off
a couple of tiring rivals while three wide after the issue had been decided. COMMUNICATION MEMO mid pack and three wide early, came four wide out of
the final turn and faded in the run to the wire. C. J'S STORM slow to settle when racing toward the front early, continued in the second flight, was finished by
midway on the final turn.

Footnotes
GAR HOLE broke well, set the pace firmly in hand, was let out slightly in upper stretch to extend advantage, won race up in handy fashion. MRS. BEANS
within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground when closest to the winner late in the turn, proved no match for that one, edging clear for
the place. NAVY SEAL in the second flight after being brushed at the break, lacked a significant closing kick in failing to run with the runner up, all out to
save the show. ONE TEN STADIUM in mid pack while toward the inside, two path turn, steered out to tighten up outer rivals turning for home, moved out
further, launched a late run to be gaining for the show. BANDIT POINT raced back off the pace well wide, five path through the turn, went evenly through the
stretch. YOU VEE CEE within striking distance early, off the inside through the turn when tiring. BIG SUCCESS back off the pace and the inside, in tight,
bothered turning into the stretch, failed to muster a rally after recovering. TWISTED DIXIE void of speed, four wide, in traffic exiting the turn, remained back
after being clear. MORE THAN BLESSED off slowly, remained always back. BLAME J D off a step slow, four wide through the turn, tired.
