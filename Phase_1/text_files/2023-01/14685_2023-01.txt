good position early, rallied,on the turn and drew even, was outfinished late but held place. GARRETT was allowed to settle early, rallied in the stretch and
closed willingly. KINGOFTHEBUCKEYE allowed to settle, failed to menace. MUTINY pressed the early pace, rallied at the quarter pole and gained a slight
lead, put in his bid, then flattened out. PATIO PARTY had brief foot on the inside and gave way.
