Footnotes
COLLIN'S GREY LADY stalked the pace outside, moved easily to the front into the stretch then pulled away and was being geared down late.
JOHNNYSLITTLEGIRL chased in the clear off the pace, rallied wide, was no threat to the winner but was easily second. SCARF lacked speed, advanced
wide and closed well while no match for the top pair. POOR NO MORE dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. VANISHING FAITH
prompted the pace outside, vied through the turn then came up empty in the lane. CATALON flashed speed along the inside and began fading on the turn.
GOLDEN BOW hustled to a clear advantage, was collared before half a mile and stopped. BELLA MARIA lacked speed and trailed throughout. BE LIKE
BETH fell and ran off during the post parade and was ordered a late scratch.

PYLON quickly took control and remained clear throughout while well off the inside driving. TWO PRINCES lagged far behind then advanced very wide with
good late energy. ILOVECHARLYBROWN trailed briefly then closed well through the stretch. GOLDENLINEOF moved wide to contention on the turn then
weakened in the final furlong. DRONE SWARM moved closer four wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. SHOWING OFF saved ground raced
close up to the stretch and faltered. CAPE MAY STYLE raced outside, moved five wide on the turn and weakened. INDIRECTLY dropped back early and
was never a factor. SCOTCH ROCK'S was urged close up between foes, stopped abruptly, returned lame and was vanned off.

ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE settled outside, bid to the front midway on the turn, angled in through the stretch and lasted under a steady drive. PEYTON'S
COLLEGE was blocked briefly into the far turn, angled out, bid wide with a gradual late gain. SCINTILLATING STAR prompted the pace three wide then
flattened out in the stretch. LOUELLA STREET chased between rivals much of the backstretch, moved wide and lacked a rally. SNAPPY RIDE dropped
back at the start then passed rivals without menacing. HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY sprinted to a clear advantage, was collared midway on the turn and gave
way. ANNA VOLANTE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then stopped on the turn. PROSPECTIVE CANDY gave way readily losing contact with her
field.

EQUISTAR broke alertly and controlled the pace, moved clear in midstretch and lasted while kept to her task. DANCING ON MY OWN pursued the winner
throughout and made a gradual late gain. SOCIAL LADY chased outside, moved very wide in the stretch and closed well. HOP ON ME lacked speed,
angled inside with a mild rally through the stretch. BRUNO BARBER GIRL trailed early then passed rivals without menacing. THENDARA'S LOST chased
within range and weakened steadily. DREAM CHASER broke slowly, rushed to contention then began fading on the turn. TELL ME IM AWESOME broke
slowly then raced far behind throughout. A LITTLE BIT suffered an injury near the three eighths pole, was eased then vanned off.

Footnotes
STRONG BREEZE took control inside, repelled challenges then remained safe under steady handling. TOMATER GATOR saved ground throughout, rallied
into the stretch with a mild gain. TACTICAL PLAN far behind early, advanced steadily with good late energy. FIRE'S FINALE raced within striking range
outside, remained wide and lacked a bid. TOWN JAK prompted the winner for half a mile and weakened. SOMEBODY chased extremely wide, made a brief
bid on the turn then faded. EMPIRE'S SCORE moved closer outside before half a mile then proved empty in the lane. HEALY'S HOPE trailed far behind
then passed rivals without menacing. PATEGORY ONE dropped back outside and was never in contention. ORBERT saved ground off the leaders and
gave way readily. PANSTER raced outside and weakened steadily.
