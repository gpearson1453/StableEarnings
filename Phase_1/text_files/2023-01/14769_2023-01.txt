Footnotes
CAPTURE THE LION set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. MOONCAPTURE pressed the pace between foes in the three path, continued
on the left lead in the lane, was no match for the winner but stayed on to secure the place. VANISHING INTEREST prompted the pace four wide, could not
keep pace with the winner in the lane and just missed second. CATALINA EXPRESS chased the pace in the two path and lacked a closing bid. SILVER
STYLE hit the starting gate, raced three wide and never threatened. NATURAL VIBES was outrun while racing two wide. NO ILL WILL was off a step slow,
chased the pace four and five wide and came up empty in the lane. EVENTFUL raced well back inside, swung widest in upper stretch and had no response.
PER FGCC CASE# 2023-009304, DATED 3-24-2023, MOONCAPTURE WAS DISQUALIFIED DUE TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

Footnotes
PASAJERA was up close along the rail around the first turn, took back to stalk in the three path down the backstretch, tipped out to the five path around the
far turn and took aim from the six path under a ride turning into the the stretch, bid in upper stretch, took over passing the eighth pole, and drew clear under
left handed urging. BLACK ICE bumped with an inner foe out of the gate, tracked in the four path early, moved up in the five path down the backstretch, was
cued to bid in the three path around the three eighths pole, was even in the stretch, but got up for place late. PRINCIPIA vied from the five path around the
first turn, set the pace in the four path down the backstretch, was roused when headed in the two path passing the three eighths pole, dug in to fight off that
foe turning into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong for show. MARISSATHEPRINCESS bumped with an inner rival at the start, rated in the four path,
swung out to the eight path entering the lane, but flattened. CARAVANA bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, was reserved along the inside early,
shifted out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, but was no factor. ANTRIM dueled for the lead in the two path around the first turn,
prompted the outside pacesetter from said position down the backstretch, but was empty from the three path turning into the lane. SPRINT BREAKER
bumped with an outer foe at the start and trailed throughout from the two to four paths.

SHE'S CLASSY settled off the pace while racing three wide, angled in nearing the quarter pole, split rivals to take the lead in midstretch and held firm under
a drive. AUNT NADINE had early speed, rated back to stalk three wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane, continued on the left lead and was
gaining widest late. ONEZY'S DREAM raced off the pace four wide and rallied between foes to gain the show late. QUEEN CALYPSO had speed inside,
angled out near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished evenly. DREAMING OF AUDREY saved ground off the pace, bid at the
rail in midstretch but was outkicked. SIX FEET APART set the pace in the two path and weakened through the final furlong. RED WIND clipped heels soon
after the start, raced well back three wide and never threatened. BALI BABY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SHANKAR got bumped between foes out of the gate, raced prominently in the four path, took the lead from said position around the far turn, opened up
while shifting in to the two path in upper stretch, and held on under right handed urging. FOR THE CHIEF bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed from
the three path early, was coaxed while moving up between a pair of tiring rivals passing the quarter pole, swung out to the seven path into the lane and
rallied down the center for place. VICTORIA'S CHIEF bumped with an inner foe out of the gate and was out in the five path around the first turn, tracked
from said position down the backstretch, ranged up under coaxing around the far turn, but evened out in the final furlong for show. GET KHOZY raced in
midpack from the two path early, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and was one paced. CUTIE bumped with an inner foe out of the gate, was up
close in the four path around the first turn, prompted the pace in the two path down the backstretch, was roused to bid around the far turn, tipped out to the
three path in upper stretch, but flattened. HOLIDAY FANTASY bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the four path early but was no factor.
CHROMOTION set the pace along the inside but yielded turning into the stretch. FIRST PLACE G stalked in the three path but was done going into the far
turn.

pressed the pace in the three path, took over two wide near the three-eighths pole, drew clear in midstretch and led until deep stretch. CASH CALL KITTEN
tracked the pace two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and had a mild gain between foes. MOON OVER
MONTANA raced in range three wide and had a mild stretch kick. DAZZLING TRUTHS had his head turned at the start, raced well back two and three wide,
swung six wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. OFFICER COUNTRY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. HEAT OF THE NIGHT
prompted the pace four wide and faded in the lane. SILENT CHAOS was outrun inside. DUCHOSSOIS saved ground well back, went three wide around the

CALIBRATOR raced prominently in the three path, was cued to bid in the five path entering the stretch, took the lead while drifting out in the final furlong,
and drew clear under right handed urging. QUITE READY set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside rounding the far turn, dug in while
floating out to the three path entering the lane, but yielded to the winner inside the final furlong for place. LAND MARK DEAL rated in the four path, was
ridden from the three path into the stretch, and kept on to the inside of rivals for show. GUILDSMAN (FR) prompted the pace in the four path, was roused in
the three path around the far turn and into the stretch, but evened out approaching the eighth pole. BOURBON THUNDER stalked in the five path, was in
the four path around the far turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND tracked in the four
path, swung out to the seven path tuning into the lane, but faded in the final furlong. ROBINTAKINCHARGE bobbled at the start, raced off the pace in the
four path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but was no factor. NO NEEDS NEVER (IRE) broke in a tangle and trailed in the three path early,
fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but never threatened. CAUSALISTIC chased in the two path but was tired from said position turning into
the stretch. PLEASECALLMEBACK raced wellback along the inside early and was no menace from the seven path in the stretch.

YES I AM FREE set the pace in the two path, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, and dug in gamely to just hold on and get the winning bob.
PANTHER ISLAND stalked along the inside, had to steady slightly going into the turn, shifted out to the four path into the final furlong, and ran on between
rivals to get up for place. MAMBA ON THREE prompted the pace in the three path, bid from the four path into the stretch, drifted out slightly under left
handed urging passing the eighth pole, and kept on to hold show. OUR SHOT was reserved in the two path, was looking for a gap before tipping out to the
ten path into the final furlong, and rallied down the center late. AGENT PETER GRAVES pressed along the inside, bid from the two path into the stretch, but
hung late. CHESS MASTER broke out and bumped with an outer foe, raced prominently in the two path, had to steady into the turn, was roused from the
five path into the stretch, and stayed on. MAYA PRINCE steadied at the start and was bumped by an inner foe, rated in the four path, swung out to the
seven path into the lane, and was gaining late. AIRSPEED VELOCITY chased in the four path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but finished
evenly. CITY DRIFTER trailed from the three path into the stretch and was no factor. CHARMED (GB) tracked in the three path but was no menace.

Footnotes
PERFECT PROVISION pressed the pace outside, drew off in the three path around the turn and held clear under a steady drive. ALICE HARPER chased
the pace two and three wide, was no match for the winner but fought on between foes to hold the place. DIVINE CONNECTION had the rider lose an iron
soon after start, raced off the pace outside with both feet out of the irons from there and finished willingly. BLUSTERY raced off the pace three wide, angled
in near the quarter pole, bid between foes in upper stretch but was outfinished for the minor awards. KUKARO lacked early speed, saved ground off the
pace, tipped out in the stretch and rallied belatedly. BULLET ON TAP hit the starting gate, raced four wide and never threatened. TANK TOP bumped with
HEIRESSTRAY at the start then had only brief speed two wide. HEIRESSTRAY bumped at the start, set the early pace along the rail and retreated nearing
the lane. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.
