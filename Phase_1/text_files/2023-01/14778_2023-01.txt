out to four wide at the three eighths pole to make a late rally and was gaining on the leader lat in the stretch but was too late. CABOCHON TREASURE was
placed off the pace through the final turn but didn't make a bid. MR. WIMBLEDON BAY raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn the made a rail
bid on the backstretch to the three sixteenths pole and angled out to two to three wide and finished evenly. UNCLE BRAD was forwardly placed around the
first turn, made a mild rebid on the final turn and flattened out. TWIRLING CHIEF was five wide into the first turn then was allowed to settle down the
backstretch while racing three to four wide but failed to menace. SONG SPECTACULAR tracked the leaders from three wide to the five sixteenths pole and
