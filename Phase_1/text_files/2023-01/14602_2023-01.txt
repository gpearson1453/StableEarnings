well behind the field up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path racing around the far turn and gained ground to the wire. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS
saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming
around the far turn and gained ground while drifting mildly late. BALI MOON chased the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the
second turn from the four path and finished evenly. BARBARA dueled from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path
around the second bend and tired in the lane. GLITTER BAY raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, angled in
