Footnotes
DAIZY DOOZY set the pace two wide, kicked clear in upper stretch and firm under a drive. SURE CAN had early speed inside, checked near the
three-eighths pole, chased inside around the turn, waited for room near the quarter pole, tipped out in midstretch and finished willingly. LEXI'S SPIRIT
pressed the winner three and four wide, could not quite match strides in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the show. SOVIET EXCESS raced in range
three wide and was one-paced through the lane. ACCOMPLISHED GIRL raced well back two wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole and had a mild
rally. STRICTLY TABOO saved ground and failed to menace. CALLING ALL ANGELS (IRE) played no factor while racing three wide. LAKESIDE
GETAWAY was forced to check not long after the start, saved ground well back, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. OLYMPIC ARTIST
vied inside of the winner down much of the backstretch, abruptly dropped back for no obvious reason nearing the turn, raced two wide around the bend and
had no further bids. AMANDA'S CHALLENGE was outrun while racing three wide. SEEKING STARDOM made little impact while racing two wide.
BAHAMIAN SKY had early speed outside, appeared to be trying to get out around the turn, raced four and five wide around the bend and retreated.

Footnotes
SMALL REASON had a slight bump with READTHETRANSCRIPT out of the gate, raced prominently along the inside, tipped out around the turn and bid
passing the quarter pole, swept past RHYMES LIKE DIMES under a drive from the four path in upper stretch, and was driven clear. RHYMES LIKE DIMES
was prompted along in the three path, took the lead passing the three eighths pole, was overtaken by the eventual winner going into the lane, but held on to
place. SARAWAT hopped inwards at the start and bumped with LEE ANN'S WARRIOR, tracked in the four path, took aim and was ridden from the six path
into the stretch, but flattened out and hung late for show. READTHETRANSCRIPT bumped with SMALL REASON at the start, chased in the two path,
angled out around the turn and was driven from the six path into the lane, but was tired. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR bumped with SARAWAT out of the gate,
stalked in the two path, was floated out to the seven path going into the stretch, and faded. GILLIGAN set the pace in the two path early but yielded around
the turn. JOYFUL CANDY was reluctant to load and trailed throughout from the center.

HELLO JACK stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, was floated out a bit turning for home, moved to the front leaving the eighth and drove clear.
TOP MAVERICK set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out turning for home, led to midstretch and was clearly second best. CAROLINA TRAFFIC broke in
a tangle, advanced between foes down the backstretch, angled to the rail early on the turn, chased the top two inside and bested the rest. SEAX broke out
and bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and had no response. HARD TO FATHOM was bumped hard on both sides at the start, chase the pace
three wide and was through after a half. PURE OF HEART was bounced around at the start and never involved while racing two wide. GO GREEN broke in
and bumped at the start then had only brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
RESERVENOTATTAINED dueled for the lead with BRIT'S CANDYMAN in the three path, edged away from said foe passing the eighth pole while drifting
out under left handed urging, and got the bob against a late surging outer foe to just hold on. URANIUM chased in the five path, was under a drive while
swinging out to the seven path going into the stretch, and rallied down the center but lost the photo to finish with place honors. THE PREDICAMENT stalked
in the two path, shifted out under coaxing to the five path turning into the lane, had to steady nearing the final sixteenth, and kept on for show. BRIT'S
CANDYMAN dueled for the lead from the two path, was under a drive from the three path entering the stretch, and yielded in the final sixteenth. VILLEGAS
SWING prompted the early pace in the four path but faded in upper stretch. FAMOUS GENT had his head turned at the start and trailed throughout.
RESERVENOTATTAINED WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD AFTER AN INQURY AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF THE PREDICAMENT,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT RESERVENOTATTAINED DRIFTED OUT INTO THE PATH OF THE PREDICAMENT COSTING HIM A CHANCE OF
BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
BREATH AWAY (GB) hopped at the start, quickly recovered to gain forward position inside, remained in range inside to upper stretch, split rivals leaving the
three-sixteenths pole, closed determinedly outside and as up in deep stretch. TYPEY set the pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. MAKE THE
BOYS WINK saved ground off the pace and rallied along the rail to gain the show. OLYMPIC PRANK raced two and three wide in midpack, angled five wide
turning for home and lacked the needed rally. ELYSIAN FIELD saved ground in midpack, edged closer two wide between foes around the far turn, angled
four wide turning for home, bumped with SASSINESS nearing the eighth pole and was one-paced through the lane. WAY TOO EARLY raced off the early
pace two wide, steadied near the three-eighths pole, raced three wide around the far turn and never threatened. WORST BEHAVIOUR prompted the pace
three wide, was clipped behind nearing the eighth pole and faded through the final furlong. SASSINESS saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in
upper stretch, bumped with ELYSIAN FIELD nearing the eighth pole, was pushed inward, clipped WORST BEHAVIOUR'S heels and was not urged from
there. STARSHIP SIGRUN failed to menace while racing four and five wide. MYSTIFY tracked the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane.
MIRANDA'S ROCKY trailed in the two path. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF SASSINESS, ELYSIAN FIELD WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND PLACED EIGHTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
BOURBON READY brushed with JACKSON'S WEBB out of the gate, was coaxed along in the three path, moved up from the five path around the turn, took
command going into the stretch, and went clear while drifting slightly inwards late. CLEVER ENOUGH broke out and bumped ADMIRAL'S WAVE, chased in
the three path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and ran on to secure place. ALPHA BLUE led from inside into the turn, lost the lead going
around the turn, but held on to show. CHIEF ROCKA stalked along the inside, angled out around the turn and was in the six path going into the stretch, and
was one paced. JACKSON'S WEBB got bumped between foes out of the gate, trailed from the four path into the turn, swung out very wide entering the
lane, but was no factor. ADMIRAL'S WAVE bumped with JACKSON'S WEBB at the start, was wellback in the two path and passed tired foes in the stretch.
BOBBY'S CANDY was unhurried from the five path, floated out to the nine path entering the lane, and was tired. GRANDE SOIREE broke out and bumped
CAJUN PUZZLER, tracked in the five path early but was never a threat. FROSTED FAITH pressed in the four path, led around the turn, but yielded from the
three path into the stretch. CAJUN PUZZLER was bumped by an inner foe out of the gate, was prompted along from the six path but gaveway around the
turn.

Footnotes
CARAMEL CHIP exchanged several brushes with HANDSOME PRINCE down the backstretch, stalked the pace inside, angled four wide near the
three-sixteenths pole, kicked in and powered clear. EARTH lacked early speed, launched a four wide move around the turn, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths pole, led past the eighth pole and held for the place. JOE DI BAGGIO dueled two wide to midstretch, was no match for the winner from there
and stayed on well enough for the show. EXAMINER raced off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the
lane and faded. BEN COPENHAGEN played no factor while racing four and five wide. HANDSOME PRINCE was in tight between foes down the
backstretch, steadied near the half-mile pole, raced two and three wide and lacked any further bids. DEL GRIFFITH failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. CACTUS JACK dueled along the rail and stopped in the lane.

Footnotes
BE MY SUNSHINE got bumped by ARMONIA at the start, was unhurried from the four path, was floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, and
rallied down the center to get up in the final sixteenth. LOVE RHAPSODY broke out at the start, recovered well around the first turn and shifted in to set the
pace in the two path, stayed on and opened up slightly in upper stretch, but was caught late to place. ARMONIA was bumped by an inner foe into an outer
foe at the start, was wellback in the three path, swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, and ran on for show. POR UNA CABEZA was reserved
early in the three path, angled out to the five path going into the stretch, and was gaining. BE HERE NOW was held up from the five path, was driven from
the eight path into the stretch, and mildly improved. MORAL TURPITUDE tracked in the three path, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch, and
flattened. MYSTIC SUNRISE prompted the pace in the four path but yielded from the five path in the stretch. MO TOWN MADISON bumped an outer foe at
the start, raced in midpack from the five path, was under urging from the eight path in the stretch, and was no factor. HER LADYSHIP rated in the three
path, was in the two path entering the lane, and lost the rider while trying to avoid a fallen foe just before the eighth pole, and walked off. POSHLY stalked
along the inside, lost ground around the far turn, tripped and unseated the rider while trying to avoid a fallen foe in the three path before the eight pole, got
up and walked off. BO DEREK raced prominently in the two path, was roused from the three path going into the stretch, went wrong and fell just before the
eighth pole, and was vanned off. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN FOR THE INCEDENT THAT OCCURED JUST BEFORE THE
EIGHTH POLE.

CYCLONE MISCHIEF settled off the early pace inside, angled three wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, bid between foes soon after, took over near the
quarter pole and readily drew off under a drive. LITIGATE raced off the early pace outside, moved four wide around the turn, briefly led late on the turn, was
no match for the winner in upper stretch and lasted for the place. MR. RIPPLE pressed the pace two wide, could not keep pace with the top two finishers
near the quarter pole, angled four wide in upper stretch and churned on nearly regain second. WELAKA failed to menace while racing four and five wide.
RUDDER'S MEN set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing the quarter pole. TALK OF THE NATION trailed in the two path.

STORMY VICTORY rated in the two path, was coaxed while angling out to the six path going into the lane, rallied under right handed urging in the final
furlong to get up in the final strides. BLIND EYE bumped with an outer foe out of the gate, was prominent in the three path, was ridden from the four path
into the lane, got carried inwards by a challenging outer rival into the final furlong, and dug in to hold place. EMPIRE ATTRACTION bumped with an inner
rival, rated in the five path, moved up to take aim from the six path going into the stretch, bid while drifting in passing the eighth pole. and hung to share
place. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK was held up from the four path, floated out to the nine path turning into the lane, drifted out to the center of the track, and
finished evenly. STRAIGHT TIME raced in midpack from the four path, swung out to the eight path turning into the stretch, drifted out, and flattened.
TRUPIA was up close in the two path early, led going into and around the far turn, and was bothered by a pair off in-drifting foes while fading in upper
stretch. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP bumped with an inner rival, stalked in the four path but was outrun in the stretch. SMART JOKER was unhurried along the
inside, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch, but weakened. MR. CELLULAR chased in the six path but was empty going into the lane. BLUEY
bumped with an inner foe, showed brief speed to lead along the inside but was done after a half. MUD BUG bumped with an outer foe and trailed throughout
around the six path.
