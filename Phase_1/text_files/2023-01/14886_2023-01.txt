Footnotes
SENSEI LAWRENCE stalked in the two path, was ridden from the rail around the turn, bid entering the lane, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and held
sway. ROUGH ENTRY was up close under a hold in the four path, tipped out to the five path around the turn, was cued right handed passing the quarter
pole and took aim from said position at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. RESERVENOTATTAINED raced prominently in the five path, was driven
around the turn and angled out to the six path entering the lane, drifted out under left handed urging passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly for show.
ADVENTURE SEEKER set the pace from the four path into the turn, was roused from the three path turning into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong.
MIGHTY TOUGH rated in the two path, was under urging from the six path turning into the lane, but was no factor. GET SET trailed throughout around the
two to four paths.

AMAZIN QUEEN raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, took the lead in midstretch, could not hold off
the winner but outfinished a foe for the place. FLASHY TOO raced in range inside, bid at the rail in midstretch and was outkicked. BRAVO ZULU set the
pace in the two path to midstretch and weakened. BAYOU WIND stalked the pace two wide and faded in the lane. GOLDEN VOICE chased the pace two
and three wide and lacked the needed rally. INDICIA was outrun inside. GREY CHARLOTTE broke awkwardly and slowly, saved ground well back, tipped

Footnotes
BANDITA set the pace while shifting inside into the turn, was coaxed from the three path into the lane, opened up rapidly while shifting back to the rail in
upper stretch, was much the best, and was wrapped up in the final sixteenth. OCEAN CLUB stalked along the inside, was roused from the two path into the
stretch, and kept on for place. ARROW BOLT broke outward at the start, tracked in the three path, was cued into the turn and ranged up in the four path
passing the three eighths pole, was under right handed urging in the five path entering the stretch, and evened out for show. LA PACHANGA broke out
leaving the gate, was up close in the two path early but backed up around the turn. TAKE A BREAK trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STAT set the pace inside, was roused from the two path into the stretch, opened up and held sway. SKI PATROL tracked in the four path, was driven from
the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) hopped out of the gate and was bumped between rivals just after, stalked in
the two path, was ridden from the four path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. MEYER trailed in the two path early, fanned out to the seven path
under urging into the stretch, and kept on. WORLDS ON HIGH bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, raced in midpack from the three path, was under
left handed urging and shifted inside into the lane, but flattened. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD had his head turned at the start, was held up along the inside
early and was in the two path entering the stretch, but was no factor. CAPE COD broke in a tangle, raced in range from the five path but never threatened.
OUTPERFORM had his head turned at the start, was unhurried in the three path early and was one paced. RESTORED ORDER bumped with an inner foe
out of the gate and steadied around the first turn, raced off the pace in the four path and faded in the stretch. SWEEPING GIANT prompted the pace in the
three path but yielded turning into the stretch. HASHTAG NO WONDER rated in the six path but was no menace.

Footnotes
TITUBA set the pace along the rail, was collared nearing the head of the lane, bumped with CREATIVE DI in upper stretch, battled back inside under
left-handed urging and regained command late. MEDAGLIA FOREVER stalked the pace three wide, bid four wide around the far turn, took the lead late on
the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and hung. BILOXI BLUES steadied along three wide around the first turn, raced in range three wide around
the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. NOTHING BUT PUMPS saved ground off the pace, angled three wide to bid between
foes midway around the far turn, reached even terms turning for home then weakened. CREATIVE DI dueled outside of the winner, bumped with that rival in
upper stretch and gave way. JELLICLE KATZ was rank and getting out early, saved ground in range and was through after a half. SEEKING STARDOM
pulled up late on the turn and was vanned off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE NON-FINISHER AND FOUND NO REASON TO
TAKE ACTION.

Footnotes
WICKED FINN set the pace in the three path, was cued from said position entering the stretch, was headed by an outer foe going into the final furlong, and
dug in to hold on for the win. MOMZA prompted the pace in the four path, bid turning into the stretch, ran on and took a narrow lead into the final furlong, but
hung to place. CONGLOMERATE brushed with an outer foe just after the start, tracked in the two path, was roused while shifting out around the far turn and
was in the five path entering the lane, and ran on for show. POPPY'S BOYS steadied around the first turn, chased in the six path, was in the seven path
entering the stretch, and stayed on. SWING LOW rated in the five path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, and finished evenly. TIMMY M.
brushed between foes just after the start, raced in midpack in the three path, was ridden along the inside into the lane, and flattened. SUMMER SHANDEE
stalked in the five path but faded in the stretch. BURNING MAN brushed with an inner foe early, trailed from the five path and never menaced. TOLKIEN
was unhurried along the inside and never threatened.

DANGEROUS RIDE set a pressured pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. COOL KISS bobbled at the start,
steadied early, raced four wide around the turn and rallied outside to gain the place in the final strides. DIAMOND COOL stalked the pace from the rail,
angled three wide to split rivals nearing the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch but flattened out and lost second late. BANK
FRENZY raced well back three and four wide and had a mild belated rally. MY MAN IRA tracked the pace outside, bid four wide around the turn and faded
through the lane. SPLENDOR BEAUTY was hard held in range down the backstretch, chased two and three wide around the turn and came up empty in the
lane. ENGLISH BOB pressed the winner in the three path and faltered after a half.

Footnotes
MRS. ASTOR settled off the pace while racing four wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, seized command leaving the eighth pole and powered
clear under confident handling. SUN BEE stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in upper stretch and rallied between foes for the place.
PENUMBRAS MAKER settled off the pace while racing two wide, made progress two wide around the far turn, tipped three wide turning for home and
stayed on to gain the show. SRI LANKA steadied after the start, raced well back inside, advanced four wide around the far turn, swung widest in upper
stretch and had a mild rally. MILIEU set the pace in the two path, led past the eighth pole then weakened. PEDIGEEK steadied early, saved ground and
never threatened. CUMBERLAND FALLS prompted the pace three wide and faded through the lane. TELENDOS was off slow, raced three wide and made
little impact. FANCY was pulling early, raced up close four wide and tired in the lane. HEIRESS hit the starting gate and trailed inside.
