Footnotes
CAPTAIN QUINT , away alertly, prompted the pace outside the leader while in hand, moved four wide under confident handling to engage with a quarter to
go, opened up after being roused left handed in upper stretch then cruised home through the final seventy yards. LUIGI'S SPIRIT , off last after having his
head turned as the gates sprung then hopping, regrouped and settled off the pace, moved up to the inside of a rival leaving the three eighths, angled four
wide with momentum into the lane, straightened and finished up willingly to gain the place. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE chased the pace while saving ground,
eased out in mid stretch but lacked a serious finish. HERE AND NOFURTHER was steadied along off heels from the three quarter pole to the five and a
half, eased out to chase two wide but lacked a stretch kick. OPEN THE BOOKS was sent clear early, secured the inside and set the pace under some
urging, met the winner's challenge nearing the quarter pole, failed to go with that one leaving the three sixteenths then faded through the final furlong. GIG ,
three to four wide with early pursuit, dropped back around the turn then drifted in through the drive.

Footnotes
CURLINGTON , four wide stalking the pace, ranged up to threaten mid way on the final turn, saw ALBERTANO get away a bit in upper stretch, came back
under a drive to re engage that one past mid stretch, dueled while being floated out through the final sixteenth and just got the bob. ALBERTANO , three
wide early, edged up and dropped in towards the rail past the half mile marker, aggressively knifed his way between runners nearing the quarter pole,
spurted clear soon into the lane, wandered outward when joined by the winner leaving mid stretch, continued to drift while dueling and just missed in a game
effort. SHOOT THEMESSENGER settled off the pace while saving ground, angled four to five wide advancing past the quarter pole, straightened and edged
up to loom past the three sixteenths, had his rider lose the whip soon after, raced on his left lead and hung under some hand encouragement. CARTE
BLANCHE , under a firm hold two to three wide outside CLOSER LOOK, moved to the attack leaving the far turn, took command past the three eighths,
failed to resist pressure from both sides nearing the lane and gave way. CLOSER LOOK cleared early and set the pace towards the rail, was joined near the
three eighths, ceded command soon after, stayed on to about the quarter pole then faltered. VIRGINIA FULLA dropped off the early pace, raced two wide
past the five eighths and failed to respond.

MO CO GOLD rated three to four wide within range, took closer order under some asking past the five sixteenths, overtook the leader into the lane,
responded when put to firmer insistence and kicked clear in mid stretch, kept on under stout handling through the final furlong and dug in to fend off MISS
FUSSY PANTS. MISS FUSSY PANTS dropped back to the inside of rivals while scrubbed upon leaving the far turn, came off the inside and gathered steam
five wide into the lane, straightened away for the drive, drifted in sightly past mid stretch and closed gamely. NEVER DONE , hustled along while off the
pace and well off the inside, shifted out leaving mid stretch and found her best stride too late. MUSICMANSANDY , off a bit slow, was hard sent inside and
took command after a furlong, cleared and set the pace, drifted two wide once collared nearing the stretch, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then gave
way grudgingly. ANGELOFCANTERBURY , pushed along three wide prompting mid turn, failed to kick on with the leaders leaving the three sixteenths and
faded.

TOP BOSS rated between rivals while not too far back early on, edged closer under some nudging past the five sixteenths and set his sights on the
embattled leaders, shifted out four wide for the drive, leveled off under right handed asking with a sixteenth to go and forged ahead in the final yards. IT'S
SIZZLING TIME tracked the leader two to three wide, moved up under urging to engage mid turn, dueled on near even terms from the head of the lane past
mid stretch, led leaving the sixteenth pole under a stiff drive but just could not contain the winner. BIGMANCAN saved ground, edged up a bit near mid
stretch, eased out and rallied between foes. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN , four wide outside rivals past the five sixteenths, shifted a bit wider for the drive but
lacked the needed finish. LADNEEDSAHANDLER displayed sharp speed to go clear soon after the break, set the pace towards the inside, dug in when
confronted mid turn, battled gamely twio wide and to the inside of IT'S SIZZZLING TIME from the head of the lane past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. ROYAL SPY rated off the pace, crept a bit closer leaving the five sixteenths, swung out to be five to six wide in upper stretch, made progress
outside runners inside the sixteenth pole but was out kicked late. NASHVEGAS , off the pace, raced four wide mid turn, angled out and failed to menace.

HAPPY CLOUDS , confidently rated four to five wide outside rivals, moved up in hand around the turn, responded when asked soon into the lane, took
control leaving the three sixteenths, cleared under a drive soon after then eagerly pulled away while solidly hand ridden the final sixteenth. LARAMORE
exchanged a slight brush at the break, was sent up between foes and gained a slim lead, set a pressured pace just off the inside, drifted four wide when
being confronted into the stretch, corrected to battle past the three sixteenths, was no match for the winner through the final furlong but stayed well for the
place. BOSSYNESS drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, raced off the early pace while saving ground, was under a strong ride past the five
sixteenths, stayed inside through the lane and churned on. BAYLIS STREET , brushed at the break, had speed inside runners then was rated back off the
leaders heading to the turn, eased out with pursuit in upper stretch and came up empty. ICE CUBE BABY broke slowly, angled out leaving the far turn,
circled four wide into the stretch, wandered inward, came back out but failed to generate the needed finish. BOSSERATI vied three wide between rivals,
failed to kick on near the three sixteenths and gave way. OJITOS BELLOS , bumped at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground, angled out in the
lane and failed to menace. HEARDITALL angled in some early but lacked a bid. GOLDEN NEVE vied between rivals into the turn then faltered past the
three eighths.

CATS INTHE TIMBER , prominent while three wide, responded when given her cue and went up three wide between rivals mid turn to dispute the pace,
emerged in a battled to the inside of GORMLEY'S GABRIELA leaving the three sixteenths, went head to head while exchanging contact through the final
furlong, gained a slim advantage in deep stretch, was guided out some and was resolute to the wire. GORMLEY'S GABRIELA , four wide and well within
range, edged up between foes to apply more pressure past the three furlong pole, gained a slim lead in upper stretch, dueled while alternating contact with
the winner through the last eighth, ceded the advantage late but stayed gamely. COVER THE SPREAD rated behind rivals leaving the far turn, advanced
three wide between foes approaching the stretch, shifted out, gave hard pursuit of the dueling leaders past mid stretch, came out further in deep stretch and
kept on willingly to gain. GENIEINABRIDLE made a quick run towards the inside leaving the chute then steadied off heels, regrouped to only steady again
nearing the turn, tracked then angled out mid turn, chased the top pair from the head of the lane but went evenly in the final furlong. LIQUIDATOR rushed
up between rivals in the opening three sixteenths and joined the pace fray, sparred outside MO MARTHA into and around the turn, was overtaken into the
stretch, shifted in, stayed on past the furlong grounds then faded late. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY , under a firm hold early, angled five to six wide around the
turn but lacked a rally. MO MARTHA , with the pace from the start, dueled towards the rail to the five sixteenths then tired. ANGEL ART , five wide outside
foes, moved up mid turn, lacked a kick entering the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
MISS DILLINGHAM took a short lead early and disputed the pace two to three wide outside FOLLY, raced under confident handling into the lane, was
nudged clear in mid stretch and was only under mild handling through the final seventy yards. FOLLY vied inside the winner, held a slim advantage past the
three eighths, failed to match strides past the quarter pole while under pressure, had her rider misjudge the wire with a sixteenth to go but stayed on well to
be clear of the rest. VIKING QUEEN was hustled up early along the inside, rated back a bit, stalked the leaders while saving ground around the turn, came
out for the drive, made a mild run then flattened out. WITTY BANTER , sluggish from the gate, saved ground off the pace into the turn, angled out mid turn,
circled five wide into the stretch and had belated action. UNADULTERATED , well placed four wide outside rivals, took closer order mid turn, failed to kick
on under asking past the five sixteenths and faded. GOLD TIME VIXEN stalked three wide, moved up between foes leaving the far turn, had aim past the
three eighths, came out a bit for the drive and faded. BESS had speed and chased two wide, failed to go on leaving the far turn, retreated and was eased
late. PER RULING FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, FOLLY IS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
DREW'S GOLD broke in the air and was away last, recovered then pulled his way forward behind foes, steadied briefly heading to the half, eased out to be
in the clear leaving the three eighths, rolled up and joined the fray four deep near the quarter pole, responded when put to firm asking and forged to
command soon into the lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch then powered away from there while under vigorous hand urging. LOST WEEKEND
got into a pace battle between rivals soon after the start, carried that scrum to the head of the lane, emerged as the closest pursuer of DREW'S GOLD in
mid stretch and kept on nicely to the wire. R B'S THE BOSS tracked the embattled leaders while three to four wide, was put to serious pressure mid turn,
shifted out and needed more. NOAH CHANCE disputed the pace inside a pair of rivals then a trio heading to the quarter pole, stayed on willingly to mid
stretch then faded. LANDON JACK , three deep contesting a solid pace, was caught between rivals into the lane, began a retreat past the three sixteenths
then faltered.

Footnotes
GRAND MANNER stalked three wide, steadied back off off ESPRESSO LUNGO heading into the turn, regrouped and moved up under coaxing mid turn,
shifted four wide into the lane and closed in, leveled off when set down left handed in mid stretch, took over outside foes with a sixteenth to go then edged
clear in the final yards. NOTIMELIKEPRESENT cleared early and set the pace just off the inside, was joined nearing the turn and took pressure past the five
sixteenths, spurted clear while guided two wide under a drive in upper stretch, kept on past mid stretch, ceded the lead a sixteenth out, gave way grudgingly
and saved the place. ESPRESSO LUNGO rushed up four wide while getting in some past the half, pressed the pace outside NOTIMELIKEPRESENT
around the turn, shifted in near the eighth pole and kept on willingly. SECRET SANCTUARY pulled his way between foes early, dropped in and stalked
inside a rival mid turn, came out for the drive but lacked a bid. SEE OUT broke a bit slowly, raced three wide leaving the far turn, lacked a kick past the five
sixteenths and gave way. MR. COWBOY BRADLEY flashed speed inside and gave way before going a half mile.
