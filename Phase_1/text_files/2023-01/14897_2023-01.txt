THANKSDAD chased early, dueled around the turn and until late stretch, edged clear late under strong handling. WHO CAN WIN set the early pace and
dueled on the lead, held stubbornly in the drive and weakened slightly late. GOING PRIMETIME had good position early, swung three wide in the stretch
and closed willingly. PLAYING BALL had good position just off the speed on the inside, lacked a bid late and went evenly. JUST INSPIRED saved ground
and was no threat.

much the best. ASHWICKEN was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch and split horses, was no match for the winner but held place. IMA SURE BET was
allowed to settle and failed to menace. SUPER GEUSE chased the winner for three quarters, then gave way.
