Footnotes
CHARM WEAVER ducked in and made contact with Ms Big Spring leaving the gate then pressured the pace, raced close off the rail through the turn and
dug in to take over late yards. CAPTAIN SAM took the lead at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn near the rail, dug in under
steady stretch encouragement but reluctantly ceded late yards. SECRET AFFIRMATION gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the four path and ran
evenly down the lane. BIG AL'S GAL chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. WINDSOR'S
CHAMPION gave chase inside and faded at the rail on the turn. MARY'S LISTED NEXT was bumped at the break, gave chase through the backstretch then
eased outward on the turn, left the turn about the five path but had little left. MS BIG SPRING was bumped inward and into Mary's Listed Next, picked up
the chase leaving the chute, but was never a factor.

Footnotes
A FAREWELL YODEL took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met
and dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, but dug in determinedly to inch ahead of POSTED through later yards, while the latter
stalked off the rail leaving the first turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole and contested the edge two deep on the far turn, dueled gamely leaving
the turn but relented the final sixteenth. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS settled in the two and three paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and raced two deep on the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for third. CHASE LIL ME saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. MASTER THIS saved ground racing well off the pace, picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted leaving the turn and showed little more. MASTER YOO showed little
response.

Footnotes
THUNDERTURTLE rounded the first turn four wide and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, bid leaving the seven sixteenths and raced close
two deep on the far turn, dueled at even terms leaving the turn and took the nod in the final yards. PARTY MONSTER rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure and raced at mostly even terms leaving the three eighths pole, dueled clear of Fonda Romana past the quarter, dug in to the challenge of the
winner at that point and reluctantly yielded the final yards. LIFE IN FLASH came away awkwardly and settled in the three path, bid leaving the three eighths
pole, raced close in the four path of the far turn, finished well and just missed second. MISS HEART saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and
raced near the rail on the far turn and could only improve her position. SHE FIGURES settled off the pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the half mile
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little more. UPSY DAISY DO rated off the rail and was through early. FONDA ROMANA stalked the
early pace from the three path then challenged and dueled with a slim brief lead leaving the half mile pole, but dropped back into the far turn and gave way
in the lane.

eighth pole and took the lead in the final yards. MIGHTY MINION became fractious in the gate, raced with the early pace inside then stalked leaving the first
turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, contested the far turn near the rail, dug in to a brief slim lead past the sixteenth pole but was caught in the final
yards. ARROGANT RIDER tapered in and raced with the early pace three wide, dueled with a slim lead leaving the half mile pole, was met past the five
sixteenths but remained a close factor two deep on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and held on for third. HOME SCHOOL raced with the early pace two
deep then stalked into the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. URBAN
BANDIT raced with the pace three wide on the opening turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole and took the lead passing the five sixteenths,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught just inside the sixteenth pole and flattened late yards. REAL RAMBO settled in the three path
the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, was blocked past the eighth pole but finished evenly.
SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY saved ground well back from early contention, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail,
angled to the outside past the eighth pole and ran evenly in the lane. CHROME HEIR settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole,
raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. MALIBU ROCK STAR hesitated leaving the gate then closed toward contention and raced
close five wide on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but dropped back past the three eighths and faded in the three path of the far turn.
SHARP STYLE rounded the first turn in the three path then faded through the backstretch.
