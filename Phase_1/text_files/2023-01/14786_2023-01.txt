reserved early, made a wide bid leaving the turn but flattened out late, bested rest. KNOCKDOWN KID stalked the pace three wide and weakened.
BUMBLE MONSTER chased the pace three wide and had no rally. ABHAR dueled for the lead and made a two wide bid on the turn and then was empty.
LIONESQUE failed to menace on the inside. POP POP SUSI dueled for the lead on the inside and then went bad leaving the turn and lost the jockey,

Footnotes
MR. PETE was well placed on the inside, then found room leaving the three sixteenths two wide to make a bid and drew clear in the furlong grounds to
prove best, driving. CALCULATED THINKIN vied for the lead on the inside, then came off the inside leaving the turn and still vied for command by the
furlong marker, but could not go with the winner while holding on to the place award. I SEE THE STARS vied for the lead two wide, then was between rivals
on the turn and four wide off the turn and faded late, held show award. AGAINST THE ODDS was allowed to settle early, made a inside bid leaving the turn
but flattened out late. BOURBON MISSION was bumped at the start, saved ground on the turn, then shifted off the inside in the lane and improved position.
SCARY LARRY chased the pace three wide and weakened. HIGH HEAT pressed the pace three wide, made a bid between rivals by the quarter pole and
weakened. BERHANU pressed the pace four to five wide and then was empty in the drive. SHADOW BOAT was settled back, came five wide into the lane
and had no rally.

Footnotes
ACT OF VALOR set the early pace on the inside, was well handled on the turn and then kicked away in the drive to prove best under a drive. VIOLENT
PASS was well placed early on the inside, then was two wide by the quarter pole, tipped three wide leaving the turn for aim on the front runner but could not
gain on that rival, second best. TUCKABUCKAWAY was reserved early three wide, then advanced three wide by the quarter pole, then had a belated rally
to gain the show award. DREAMERS REWARD chased the pace five to six wide and had no rally, missed show award. MYSTIC POINT chased the early
pace between rivals, then made a mild four wide bid by the quarter pole and weakened. KAZTHAROS chased the pace four to five wide and weakened.
WINNERS WIN was between rivals and was bumped hard and rider had to check hard around the nine sixteenths and dropped back. WOW RUN tracked
the pace between rivals and weakened. SPEED SLOT showed little.

Footnotes
ORGANIZED CHAOS was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while clear, then drew off in the stretch after one pop right handed with the riding crop
to prove much the best. LADY LIGHTFEET was rated early four wide, made a three wide move on the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while
clearly second best. I CAME TO DANCE was reserved early on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally to best the rest.
WAR'S END KISS chased the pace on the inside and weakened. BEA BEA KAZ tracked the pace three wide and weakened. SHARP CATCH tired.
FLAMINGO FAZE failed to menace. DOCTOR ABBIE broke in the air at the start causing the jockey to fall off, walked off.
