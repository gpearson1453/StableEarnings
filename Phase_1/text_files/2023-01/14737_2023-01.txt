Footnotes
PARTY FOUL broke alertly, established the early advantage and showed good speed into the turn, drew clear nearing the quarter marker, extended the
lead in upper stretch and kept to task in the final furlong. MYSTIC TBILISI rated off of the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, responded to firm
urging inside of the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in the late stages but finished well to get up for place. SYNNIN AND WINNIN stalked the
solid early fractions, chased his stablemate while two wide on the turn, lost ground to PARTY FOUL in upper stretch, raced on the left lead in deep stretch
and was outfinished for place, while clear of the rest for show. WHISPER AND WINK a bit slow into stride early on, chased the pace from a two wide path
on the turn, improved position in the drive but was unable to threaten in the late stages. RANCHO RED forwardly placed in the early stages, chased the
solid pace from the rail on the turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MR NAVIGATOR rated nicely off of the early pace, well positioned through the backstretch run, saved ground to the quarter marker, angled three wide
nearing the top of the lane, full of run approaching the furlong pole, overtook the battling top pair in mid-stretch, drew clear in the final sixteenth and was
geared down in the final strides. SUMO forwardly placed in the early going, attended to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, pressed NIGHT
PROOF to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, was outrun in the late stages by MR NAVIGATOR and stayed on in the final strides to
dead heat for place. NIGHT PROOF broke alertly and assumed command of the early pace, set prompted fractions along the backstretch run, battled with
SUMO to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the winner in deep stretch and held for a share of place on the line. STAR SAILOR stalked the pace
into the first turn, raced three wide into the backstretch run, was outrun nearing the half-mile marker, chased three wide to the quarter pole, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and lacked a late kick in the drive. SPEED GRAZY crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace, raced three wide
into the first turn, asked for run four wide on the far turn, ran on the left lead inside of the furlong marker and did not produce a late rally. BROOKYS TAPIT
unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, trailed into the second turn and did not threaten in the late going.

Footnotes
MCGEORGE allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground along the turn, mounted a steady inside bid commencing in upper stretch, came within aim
inside of the furlong marker, assumed command in deep stretch and held in a drive in the final strides. SINGLE ME OUT chased the fast early pace from the
inside, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, angled three wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was outfinished by MCGEORGE in the late
stages but rallied in the final strides to secure the place. HOLIDAY HUSTLE took back off of the fast early pace, raced two wide on the turn, swung widest
for the drive, finished well in deep stretch and just missed for place while securing the show. FURY KAP broke alertly, showed good early speed while
disputing the pace inside of DIAMOND RANGER, contested the quick fractions with that rival to the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch, drifted out in deep
stretch, impeded DIAMOND RANGER and weakened in the final stages. DIAMOND RANGER forwardly placed in the early going, contested the fast pace
with FURY KAP to the turn, took a narrow lead from that rival approaching the quarter marker, battled outside of FURY KAP to the furlong grounds, took up
while in tight when that rival drifted out in deep stretch and gave way. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM chased the fast early pace, advanced two wide on the turn,
swung four wide for the drive and tired in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN DEEP STRETCH
INVOLVING FURY KAP AND DIAMOND RANGER. IN A UNANIMOUS RULING, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED FURY KAP DRIFTED OUT NEARING
THE SIXTEENTH-MARKER, IMPEDED DIAMOND RANGER AND COST DIAMOND RANGER THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. FURY KAP
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED FIFTH. THE RIDER OF DIAMOND RANGER ALSO LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST THE
RIDER OF FURY KAP.

Footnotes
LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH broke alertly and showed good early speed, set a pressured pace to the turn, shook free nearing the quarter marker, drew clear
into upper stretch, felt late pressure and dug in in the final strides to prevail. REFI NOW allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground along the turn,
rallied in upper stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker to pressure LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH, could not get by the determined winner in the final
strides and held for place in a head bob on the wire. ALEXANDER'S DREAM chased the fast early pace, raced two wide on the turn, swung four wide for
the drive, gained ground nearing mid-stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth and just missed for place while well clear of the rest for show. OH GREAT (IRE)
stalked the fast early pace, raced three wide while in pursuit on the turn, swung five wide for the drive, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the late
stages. THISMUSTBETHEPLACE showed early speed and disputed the fast pace to the turn, pressed LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH to the quarter marker,
encountered traffic and steadied while dropping back in upper stretch and was not a late factor. HANDR'SDREAM chased the fast early pace, raced in tight
approaching the turn, clipped heels with OH GREAT, fell and unseated the jockey and was vanned off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO
THE INCIDENT INVOLVING HANDR'SDREAM APPROACHING THE TURN AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT HANDR'SDREAM CAME
INTO TIGHT QUARTERS, CLIPPED HEELS AND LOST THE RIDER ON HIS OWN ACCORD AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH BASED ON THE INCIDENT.

Footnotes
DR WYSONG bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried heading to the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the
drive, improved position nearing the furlong pole, closed with a rush in the final furlong, overtook BOUNDFORJAMAICA in deep stretch and was up in the
final strides to prevail. BOUNDFORJAMAICA crowded GARDEES WORLD in the opening stages, chased the fast early pace, gained ground two wide on
the turn, swung four wide for the stretch run, loomed nearing mid-stretch, assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker, was all out to hold off DR
WYSONG in deep stretch, was tagged for the win in the final strides and was second best in the end. DEVINE DANCING hard sent after the break and set
the fast pace to the turn, raced off of the rail while carving out quick fractions to the quarter marker, held foes at bay while on a clear lead to mid-stretch,
weakened inside of the furlong pole and held for show. TAKES A VILLAGE forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the quick pace from a two wide
path on the turn, swung three wide for the drive, chased DEVINE DANCING to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. KISS RIDE GOODBYE settled in the
second flight in the early stages, saved ground through the turn, swung two wide for the drive, improved position in the final sixteenth but did not threaten in
the end. GARDEES WORLD fractious in the gate, was a bit slow into early stride then was crowded by BOUNDFORJAMAICA in the first furlong, lagged
through the turn, swung two wide for the drive and improved position in the final stages but was not a factor. DESERT SMOKE prominent in the early going,
lost ground while along the inside on the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. BADGER GAL not far back in the early going,
lost position while two wide on the turn, swung three wide for the drive and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
INDIANERA tracked the fast early pace, saved ground on the turn, angled out and was roused four wide at the top of the lane, closed fast inside of the
eighth pole to overtake RICKENBACHER and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. THE CALABRESE KID allowed to settle early on, raced two wide on
the turn, swung four wide for the drive, mounted a bold late rally inside of the furlong pole, could not reel in INDIANERA in the late going but finished well to
be second best in the end. DRUMADOON tracked the fast early pace, raced three wide on the turn, swung five wide for the stretch run, re-rallied inside of
the furlong pole, could not match strides with the top pair in the final sixteenth but stayed on in the final strides to secure the show. TIZ A THRILL lunged at
the start and was off a step slowly, settled in the second flight while not far back early on, advanced two wide on the turn, continued that bid to upper stretch,
was outkicked in the drive and just missed for show in the final strides. SASQUATCH RIDE shuffled at the start and was off slowly, allowed to settle in the
early going, raced three wide on the turn, swung six wide for the drive and closed willingly in the final stages. AWESOME CURLIN unhurried in the early
going, raced two wide on the turn, trailed to the furlong marker, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch but improved position while gaining late.
HOLYJAZZ tracked the fast early pace, saved ground while in pursuit of the loose leader on the turn, chased RICKENBACHER to mid-stretch and tired.
RICKENBACHER broke alertly, showed good early speed and set fast fractions to the turn, sped to a long lead nearing the quarter marker, was in hand to
mid-stretch, shied from the crop inside of the furlong pole, stopped nearing the sixteenth-marker and was overtaken in the final stages. TOM'S MOON
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten in the drive.

FREEPORT JOE settled off of the early pace while well positioned, saved ground into the backstretch run, remained in range to the half-mile marker, lost a
bit of ground while waiting for racing room nearing the quarter marker, tipped out three wide nearing the eighth pole, chased I'MGONNABESOMEBODY to
the sixteenth-marker, surged in deep stretch and determinedly prevailed. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY forwardly placed on the run into the first turn, prompted
the moderate pace while outside of CRAZY DREAMS to the half-mile marker, confronted that rival nearing the quarter pole, drew to even terms in upper
stretch and dueled to the furlong grounds, shook free and met the bid of FREEPORT JOE nearing the sixteenth-marker, was gamely bested in the final
strides and was second best. CRAZY DREAMS assumed command in the early going and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted
by I'MGONNABESOMEBODY to the half-mile marker, confronted by that rival nearing the quarter pole, dueled to mid-stretch, weakened in the final furlong
and just saved third in the final strides. LAMMAS (GB) allowed to settle in the early going while in a good position, raced two wide into the backstretch run,
advanced three wide nearing the quarter pole, outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. RIMPROTECTOR unhurried in the early stages, not far back to
the half-mile marker, steered two wide to the top of the lane and finished evenly in the drive.

AMERICA GREAT tracked the runaway leader from well behind while racing clearly in the second position, launched a bid from the three-eighths pole under
a hard ride, gradually cut into the lead through the run to the wire, drifted out mid-stretch under left-handed urging, appeared to hang late when Orozco lost
his crop, then found another gear when HOUSE OF LORDS was making a run to his outside and surged ahead yards from the finish line. HOUSE OF
LORDS was content to settle at the head of the trailing pack behind TRIBAL NATION and AMERICA GREAT, bided time well into the far turn, launched a
serious bid from the quarter pole, made a bold run on the outside, shied when AMERICA GREAT drifted into his path, continued to run on to gain the place.
TRIBAL NATION hustled from the gate and sprinted clear of the field into the first turn, had a six length lead turning into the backstretch, widened into the far
turn, hit the top of the stretch with a seemingly insurmountable lead then began to shorten strides in the final furlong yet managed to hold on for third. CHIEF
WILD EAGLE got away a step slow then was pinched back and forced to steady near the seven-eighths pole, thereafter stuck behind a wall of horses into
the first turn while eager to go on, settled down but was last through the first turn, angled over to the two path down the backstretch, relaxed nicely but
remained at the rear of the field to the far turn, awaited racing room through the far turn, tipped out a path into the stretch but was still behind horses, found
some room passing the eighth pole and finished with a rush. KODIACTION was away well, held good position near the front of the trailing group, moved out
to the four path for the stretch run and finished well but came up a bit short. BIG FLAME last away but saved ground throughout, steadied near the
five-sixteenths pole then rallied under urging, closing stoutly to be part of the blanket finish at the wire. GALLANT WARREN broke well and saved ground
through the clubhouse turn, launched a rally from the seven-sixteenths pole while still on the inside, sustained that rally to deep stretch and finished with
good energy. BUENISIMO off a bit slow, three wide and near the rear of the field into the first turn, seemed content with the position for the backstretch run,
attempted to rally three furlongs to run but was unable to quicken and was not persevered with late. SUPERMAZEL broke out after the break, got hung out
four wide into the first turn, remained wide down the backstretch, was getting out and drifted even wider on the far turn then was allowed to gallop out to the
wire while hopelessly beaten. DEL MO raced three wide into the first turn, then was reserved early, traveling with the trailing pack well behind the early
leader, was asked to pick up the pace on the far turn but had no response and was outrun from that point.
