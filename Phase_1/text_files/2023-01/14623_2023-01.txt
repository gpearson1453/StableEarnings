Footnotes
HULEN sprinted to a clear lead to set all of the pace, pulled away into the stretch and held late. GALAXY BUILDER dueled in the second flight, made a two
wide bid at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner. KING OF THE COURT raced near the back early then moved three wide at the five sixteenths
pole to close late but was not enough. SMOOTH COLLIERY dueled in the second flight from the inside, weakened in upper stretch and passed tiring rival.
TAPIZARS SECRET rushed up to be placed off the pace through the turn and tired. B W P SPECIAL had lack of speed and was not a threat, bled and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
EMPIRE KID sprinted to the lead and was kept to task in the drive. SUIT OF WANDS stalked the leaders from the three path, made a late run in the stretch
to be second best. CREEKSIDE broke in at the start then tracked the leaders from the inside, made a rail bid in the stretch to be just up for the show.
STEAUXLIT chased the leader from the two path and weakened. EL IT saved ground through the turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch and
finished evenly. ONE MORE SLEEP was void of speed and not a threat. WAR SABER hopped at the start then was hustled along from three wide but was
not a factor. DIXIELAND STORMING broke in at the start and was always back.

Footnotes
MR LIBERTY went to the lead from the inside to set all the pace and held on late. CLEVER PRINCE tracked the leaders from the inside, made a rail bid on
the final turn then moved out to the two path in mid stretch but couldn't catch the winner and proved second best. CONFESS stalked the pace from the two
path then move out to three wide at the five sixteenth pole and fought gamely in the stretch. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY settled in the middle of the pack then
made a rail bid at the three eighths pole, moved out to three wide at the three sixteenths pole and flattened out. CAPTAINS COVE lugged out on the first
turn and lost action then settled near the back into the backstretch moved up going three wide in the final turn and improved position. DOUBLE BOGEY was
forwardly placed on the inside but was through after a half. CROOKS REBEL was four wide into the first turn, raced near the back down the backstretch and
passed tiring rival in the stretch. BARNEY'S PASSION raced in the middle of the pack from the two path and retreated. SASSI ASPEN went five wide into
the first turn, raced widest of all and was not a factor. MARKETBOOK settled in the middle of the pack from the three path but was not a threat.

final strides. CREEKMORE went to a pressured lead to the final turn then pulled away to take a clear lead but was nailed at the wire. BET AGAIN was
allowed to settle to the final turn then move to the two path to move up on the final turn and was a game third. HARDCORE FOLKLORE was unhurried to
the final turn then was coaxed at the quarter pole move to three wide at the three sixteenths pole for a late rally but was not enough. LOVETHATCAUSE
raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then move out to four to five wide on the final turn but lacked a late response. HOT LE ROY saved
ground to no avail. PARLAY PETE pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn then led briefly between calls then vied for the lead to the three
sixteenths pole and weakened. PLATINUM EQUITY was rushed to contention from three wide and vied for the lead around the first turn and gave way after

Footnotes
THUNDERTAKESDALEAD broke well and went to a clear lead around the first turn then was pressured on the backstretch but pulled away again and just
lasted. CHEERFOR MSHAWISH settled in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved between horses at the three eighths pole, drifted out in
the stretch drive and just missed. HOLIDAY DIAMOND was allowed to settled in the three path around the first turn then was five to six wide at the quarter
pole to make a late rally. HEZA SEXY ZONG stalked the pace from the two path to the final turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch and passed
tiring rivals. CABOCHON TREASURE tracked the leader around the first turn then pressed the pace on the backstretch to the quarter pole and tired.
JOSAN was forwardly placed while saving ground and faded. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS was unhurried to the final turn then moved out to four wide at the
quarter pole and gave way.
