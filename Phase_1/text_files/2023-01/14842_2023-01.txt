Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FLING settled off the early pace outside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved, rounded the turn about the three path, dug in
from the head of the lane to take over later yards and raced clear under the wire. RED PRIESTESS dueled for the lead and set a pressured pace, rounded
the turn at the rail, was steadily handled leaving the turn but gave up the lead in the final yards. SUPERSNAKE chased inside, raced near the rail on the
turn, eased out leaving the turn and came along to take third nearing mid-stretch. ULTIMATE BREEZE chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on
the turn then eased out toward the head of the lane and finished well to close the gap. JESS FOR KICKS pressured the early pace but flattened stride at the
rail on the turn. VEGAS SLIPPERS popped the gate open pre-break, was through early and raced wide on the turn.

PRINCE OF FENTON took a quick early lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far
turn and was kept alert in the lane. FEARNOUGHT stalked the early pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn,
dug in through the stretch and held on for second. STORMIN ROCKET rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, raced three wide on the far turn and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. DANCIN IN DUBAI stalked off the rail, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened inside the eighth pole. NO ME DIGAS rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase from
the three eighth pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR settled off the rail on the first turn, gave
chase into the backstretch and raced in the five path of the far turn. LIGHTNING LAD rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the three
eighths pole then flattened at the rail approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
LUCKY BOP closed to the lead at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and held on well under steady
stretch handling. LOVE OF GRACE chased the pace through the backstretch, came in a path or two nearing the quarter pole and raced close on the turn,
dug in leaving the turn and finished well to take second in the final stride. POLISH THE DIAMOND chased through the backstretch and raced at a close
disadvantage two deep on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane but was nipped from second the final stride. SMOKIN LADY chased inside, raced close
at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. CANDY LOVES HONEY chased the pace toward the inside, pulled herself to the heels of Love Of Grace
midway on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. CARMELIZED gave chase then faded nearing the turn. VAN HOOK chased through the backstretch, raced
in the three path on the turn, drifted leaving the turn and weakened. LET'S DO THIS chased the pace inside, steadied at the inside flank of Love Of Grace
into the turn and weakened. ONLY ROMANCE gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path. SNEAKY LYNK saved ground. A Stewards
inquiry resulted in the disqualification of Love Of Grace to seventh place for impeding the progress of Let's Do This entering the turn.

SARGENT KOBE stalked the early pace off the rail, took the lead nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was kept sharp in the
lane. ACASHA'S INTUITION rated off the pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, angled to the five
path leaving the turn and dug in to take second the final strides. LEG UP rounded the first turn in the three path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up
the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride late yards. TIMMY raced in the four path the opening turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and flattened in the lane. RED HOT TODDY saved early ground, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, altered course to come between horses mid-stretch but showed little more.
TALKING TEDDY cleared the field and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even
terms from that point, but was met approaching the three eighths pole and faded at the rail into the far turn. ROCKET'S CASTLE settled off the rail on the
first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
TOMMY SHELBY raced close four wide through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead three
wide toward the five sixteenths, drew off at the rail on the turn and was geared down to win handily in spite of throwing a shoe mid-stretch. FINAL SAY
raced off the early pace in the three and four paths, gave chase from the nine sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and settled for second best.
SUNMAN raced well off the pace and off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily improved and raced off the rail on the far turn,
eased out toward the head of the lane then lugged in and finished evenly for third inside the sixteenth pole. FORT FORTITUDE settled toward the inside on
the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn four wide then flattened stride. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL rated the pace
inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole but was caught toward the five sixteenths, dropped back approaching the quarter pole and
flattened off the rail on the far turn. MEGA MILLIONS broke in the air then saved ground racing well back, could only improve his position and rounded the
far turn about the three path. UNIDENTIFIED MAN raced with the early pace three wide and between horses then stalked into the first turn, gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths and weakened midway on the far turn. ELLIE'S LIL MAN raced with the early pace two
deep while between horses then stalked into the first turn, gave chase from the half mile pole but faded through the backstretch. PANSTER bore out into the
first turn, left the turn outside and was not a factor.
