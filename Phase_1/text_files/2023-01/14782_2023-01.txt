MANHATTAN WEAVE took the lead two deep midway on the opening turn and rated the pace, was urged clear at the quarter pole then kept to steady
urging in the lane. STRINGFELLA rated close inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced two deep while between horses on the far turn,
then dueled through the stretch for second. EISELE rated close off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn then
relented in the stretch duel for second. GARITOFF raced with the early pace inside then stalked toward the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths but dropped back at the quarter and flattened the final sixteenth. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE rounded the first turn in the three path, gave
chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. A FAREWELL YODEL dropped back and saved ground early,
eased out leaving the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. DOMINANT FACTOR saved ground.

CEDAR'S WISH pressured the pace off the rail, took over two deep toward the top of the stretch and held on well under steady handling. DIXIE YODELER
chased inside, raced close in the three path of the turn, dug in for second mid-stretch but ran out of ground. SHENANDOAH CAT set a pressured early pace
inside, was met at the rail approaching the top of the lane but dropped back toward mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. FIFTY GRAY SHADES
chased the leaders from the inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. HANDSOME JOANIE chased through the backstretch, raced
in the three path of the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. TINA'S SONG gave chase then faded near the rail on the turn. LADY SPARROW became quite
fractious in the gate, steadied at the start and never factored.

Footnotes
PROUD UNION saved ground off the early pace, bid leaving the half mile pole and improved in the five path of the far turn, left the turn outside, dug in for
the lead later yards and raced clear nearing the wire. MY MIRACLE MAN moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in leaving the turn, but was caught in later yards. PLAYBOY ROY rounded the first turn about the five
path, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. BET ON BITZ
stalked the earlier pace from the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then outfinished in the
stretch duel for third. RAYO NEGRO rated close off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced at a slim disadvantage
off the rail on the far turn, then flattened inside the eighth pole. BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn. NEW SOUTH loped along.

Footnotes
OUTLIER rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, left the turn off the rail and dug
in under right hand encouragement, came in on the runner-up in late yards and held on well. DIXIE DRAWL stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, moved to the rail leaving the turn but had to steady off the inside flank of Outlier late yards and
flattened stride. SOUND OFF saved ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, dug in down the lane and held
on for third. MIDNIGHT ACT stalked the early pace from the three path, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. MAXIMUM IMPACT settled toward the inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of
the far turn then flattened in the lane. HOBE SOUND settled in the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. RRACE DAY WARRIOR
rated close inside for three eighths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul
against the rider of Outlier for interference in late stretch, lodged by the rider of Dixie Drawl, and disqualified the former to second place for coming in on the
latter. ONE MILE AND FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
GORUN saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched
clear in the final strides. DADDY Z stalked from the three path on the first turn, challenged and took the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew clear
toward the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met mid-stretch and grudgingly ceded the final sixteenth. STEADY EDDIE took a slim lead at the rail
into the first turn, drew briefly clear past the seven sixteenths pole but was met approaching the five sixteenths, dropped back nearing the quarter, raced off
the rail on the far turn and flattened later yards. DEVIL'S CANYON raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the turn about the four path and raced evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. SLOE GIN BIZ raced off the rail on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. BROTHER MERLE raced in the seven path the first turn
and showed little response through the backstretch. VELOCITO was not a factor. BUCKS LODGE tapered in and raced with the early pace two deep, gave
chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths. DOMINANT DESTROYER rounded the opening turn in the six path and left
the turn toward the outside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the five path of the far turn. PRINCE'S REWARD rounded the first
turn in the six path, left the turn outside and gave chase, but showed little response.
