Footnotes
VIOLET STORM brushed the gate then got forced in shortly after, settled in the two path, raced between foes then took aim three wide into the stretch, drew
alongside the top pair late and got up. TIERGARTEN raced up close in the two path to the outside the pacesetter, challenged for command around the far
turn, raced on even terms into the stretch, took over with a furlong left to run but got run down in the final strides. CLASSY sped to the front and moved
inside, challenged from outside on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, lost command at the eighth pole, fought back from inside and stayed on well to the
wire. VULIN stalked the pace on the inside, roused on the far turn, tipped two wide leaving the bend and lacked further response in the final furlong. ABOVE
SUSPICION broke a step slow, tracked four deep into the first turn, remained wide and rounded the second bend four then three wide and weakened down
the stretch. AMAGE stalked three deep early on, dropped back to last on the far turn and angled to the inside and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT JOY was off a bit slow in the beginning, stalked the top trio in hand early, took the turn two then three wide, tipped out widest at the top of the
stretch, drew alongside SATURDAY HEIST with a sixteenth remaining and dug in late to edge the runner-up. SATURDAY HEIST pressed the pace three
deep, challenged for command around the turn, took over at the top of the lane, inched ahead from HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN but was overtaken by the
winner in the closing moments. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN dueled between rivals early, continued to battle with rivals on both sides through the turn, carried a
short lead into the stretch, was overtaken by SATURDAY HEIST at the top of the lane and kept on gamely for the show. SOUL SWEET dueled for
command inside a pair of rivals, fought through the turn while holding a slim lead, lost command into the stretch and flattened in the furlong grounds. LITTLE
RACHEL broke cleanly then dropped back, chased along the inside into and around the bend and never responded to urging.

CHAOS THEORY stalked the speed battle from off the rail, went two wide into the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leaders entering
the furlong grounds and kicked clear to win going away. FINALLY HERE broke inward then was sent for the lead, vied inside rivals into and around the turn,
dueled with MAVEN in upper stretch, put that rival away but was soon overtaken by CHAOS THEORY midstretch and stayed on to secure second. FULLY
LOADED chased at the back early on while still in range, had to steady behind a troubled TED and alter out at the three-eighths pole, traveled three then
four wide around the turn, tipped out further in the drive and rallied for the show. MAVEN bumped leaving the gate, vied five deep up the backstretch, four
deep on the turn, dueled with FINALLY HERE in upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. TED vied between rivals early, got pinched entering
the turn and clipped heels, steered down to the rail and kept trying through the lane while unable to threaten. WINDING bumped leaving the gate, vied four
deep to the turn, three deep around the bend between rivals, lost touch with the top pair in upper stretch and weakened. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB)
bobbled leaving the gate, went up to fight for the lead three deep, battled two wide and between foes around the bend, failed to kick on in upper stretch,

Footnotes
AGREE TO SETTLE stumbled and bumped with KISS MY KAT leaving the gate, had to steady shortly after, stalked three wide, closed in and collared KISS
MY KAT at the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. KISS MY KAT broke in and bumped rival, vied three deep then shook free on the turn, continued clear into
the final furlong but was collared at the sixteenth pole, yielded to the winner and held second. CHEVY GIRL broke a step slow, trailed early off the rail, ran
up on heels briefly at the seven-sixteenths pole, drifted and bumped rival at the five-sixteenths pole, spun four wide into the lane and finished willingly for
third. LINGER vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, pressured KISS MY KAT to the three-eighths pole then chased along the rail around the turn and
weakened in the lane. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY showed early speed then stalked the top trio up the backstretch, got bumped while four wide midway around
the bend, moved inward in the lane and lacked a rally. ANNA'S MUSIC stalked widest up the backstretch, rounded the bend five wide and drifted out a bit
while weakening down the lane. CAT BANDIT vied between rivals for command early, could not keep pace and chased two wide into and around the turn
and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN KING stalked the pace along the rail inside a rival, waited patiently on the far turn, slipped through along the fence into the stretch, kicked clear
and held well in the late stages. OVERDUE hit gate at the start, settled at the back on the inside, went two wide into the far turn, came three wide into the
stretch, drifted in to bump rival in upper stretch, finished well in the furlong grounds but could not reach the winner. LARRY'S LEGEND sprinted to the front
and moved inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, felt pressure from outside then responded to coaxing by moving clear again, lost command at the top
of the stretch, got bumped by OVERDUE outside the eighth pole and churned on to hold the show. NILES CHANNEL chased two wide and outside a rival
off the pace, continued in the two path around the far turn, steered to the inside in the lane and lacked a bid. BIG BUZZ tucked inside early near the back,
took a bad step near the three-eighths pole, continued next to the fence to the stretch and failed to menace. EAST RAND stalked along the two path,
applied pressure at the three-eighths pole but failed to sustain the bid around the far turn, raced three wide at the top of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
HARLOCAP sped to the front on the inside, cleared outer rivals on the backstretch, challenged VEGAS BURNER at the three-eighths pole, shook free again
at the five-sixteenths marker, coaxed along into the stretch, roused in upper stretch, urged left handed at the sixteenth pole and drew away. YELLOW
BRICK was off slow to begin then bumped with outer rival, moved into range in the two path, moved to the rail for the far turn, traveled a bit off the inside
into the lane, kept on through the lane but had to settle for a clear second. TEXTHELEGEND bumped with YELLOW BRICK in the beginning, raced three
wide into the first turn at the back, traveled outside a rival then between foes in the middle stages, angled out leaving the far turn and was along for the
show. NAVY MAN pulled four wide around the first turn and early backstretch, continued to give chase from the four path on the second bend and could not
rally. TIZ TOK bumped leaving the gate, pressed three wide early, chased the pacesetter to the far turn, rounded the final bend in the two path, moved
inward in the lane and flattened. FLAT ON reserved early on the inside then began to pull and became rank on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch,
then moved out and failed to menace. VEGAS BURNER bumped with inner rival at the start, stalked four wide early, three deep up the backstretch,
challenged with three furlongs left to run but could not keep up near the five-sixteenths pole and retreated in the lane. QUINCY MARKET was hard to load,
chased in the five path early, dropped back to last nearing the far turn, went three then two wide around the bend and had little left for the drive.

FORGIVING SPIRIT bobbled leaving the gate, rushed up inside then ceded control to the leader, challenged between into the turn, dueled around the bend,
drifted in while putting away CONCH DADDY in upper stretch, drifted back out under the left hand and held well in the end. KING APOLLO broke a step
slow, bumped with inner rival while between foes then steadied off heels on the backstretch, gained two wide between rivals on the turn, tipped out in the
lane and finished with late run to whittle the gap on the winner while earning the place honors. DANIEL'S MAGIC stalked three deep into the turn, continued
in the three path leaving the bend, moved out in the lane and finished evenly late. STOTLAND steadied when crowded crossing over the dirt, got bumped by
KING APOLLO up the backstretch, stalked on the inside through the turn, tipped out in the lane and kept on to earn a minor share. CONCH DADDY sped
clear and crossed over to the inside, pressured into the turn, dueled around the bend, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
SANTA CRUISER bumped shortly after the start, tracked three deep and drifted in to bother rivals early, stalked three wide into the turn, lost ground around
the bend, entered the stretch four wide and faded. SAVILE ROW settled at the back outside rivals, traveled three deep then four wide into the lane, was
rank in upper stretch and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
AMERICAN LILY stumbled leaving the gate, tracked outside a rival early, ranged up outside the top pair four wide with a quarter mile remaining, took over
past the eighth pole, dueled with PRINCESS ADALEIGH through deep stretch and dug in to prevail. PRINCESS ADALEIGH away quickly in the beginning,
pressed the pace to the turn, dueled around the bend and gained command at the five-sixteenths pole, put away MANORELLI at the top of the stretch then
fought with AMERICAN LILY, relinquished the lead past the eighth pole but battled back gamely through deep stretch and stayed on well to the wire. BOWL
OF CHERRIES settled off the pace, steadied behind rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, angled five wide leaving the turn and gained the show. MANORELLI
sped to the front and set the pace with company alongside, dueled with PRINCESS ADALEIGH on the turn and lost command at the five-sixteenths pole,
stayed on to the stretch, then lost touch at the top of the lane and weakened. TOO BOSSY stalked the top pair up the backstretch, traveled along the inside
then tipped out and came three wide into the stretch and weakened. YOUTEYOURHONOR broke a step slow on the outside, tracked four wide into the turn,
came six wide into the drive and could not rally. LASTING LOVE was off slow in the beginning, tracked three wide leaving the backstretch, angled in around
the bend and failed to menace.
