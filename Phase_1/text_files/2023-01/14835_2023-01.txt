Footnotes
UNA PALABRA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, quickly opened a clear lead, increased that
margin into the lane and was under wraps to the wire. TOP HAT TIGRESS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. STAR FINALITY broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way in the drive.
GEEJAYTEE hopped at the start, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. LUTE'S DIAMOND
raced five-wide through the first turn, pressed the pace while racing four-wide, lugged out through the second turn and weakened after going three-quarters.
WE WANT ANOTHER pressed the pace from between foes for six furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
HINDU MISS CHEF broke sharply to open a clear lead before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by
WILD ARCH in mid-stretch, vied with that foe and edged away late. WILD ARCH was off a step slow, rushed to contend, tracked the leaders from the inside,
moved up for vie with the winner with a furlong to run but could not get by that rival in the drive. BIG HEAT was away in good order to chase the leaders
while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. CIVIL SUIT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly late.
FIRST PROMISE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. HOLY TUTTA BELLA was void of early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. BOOZE RUNNER lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not
menace. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

LITTLE LILY LU was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing six-wide, drifted in with a furlong to run and was up in the closing yards.
GRANDIOSE SUMMER was off a step slow, rushed to contend, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run, gained a brief lead but
could not resist the winner late. MIZHIPZLETUS dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. PENNY'S ANNIE settled off the
leaders from the inside and finished evenly in the drive. TED'S CANDY GIRL lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a
belated bid. DADDY'SFAVORITESON showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MAMALONA pressed the pace while
racing five-wide and gave way through the final furlong. DOWNTHESTREETDEBBY dueled for the lead from between foes, moved four-wide through the
turn and gave way through the final furlong. FACE OF GRACE raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

HI HO CHEERIO settled off the leaders from the inside, moved up to gain command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off
through the lane while being ridden out. TRICKY LEE was off slow, lagged early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. STAY
HAPPY broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing six-wide, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. DR. TROUTMAN disputed the pace while
racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. FIRE WHEN READY vied for the lead while racing four-wide from between foes and gave way
after going a half. FASCINATED pressed the pace while racing six-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. UNLEASH THE BEAST lacked early foot,
raced eight-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SILVER DASH disputed the pace while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half. TIMES

Footnotes
DISCERNMENT was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened
a clear margin approaching the stretch and drew off as a handy winner. RED NOON RISING settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn
and finished with a steady bid. MISSCZECH broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, was no match match for the winner in the drive
and gave way late for the place. CRIMINAL RECORD lacked early foot, raced between foes early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly.
MISS RENO was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually gave way. BORN TO REIGN showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and
did not threaten. UNSINKABLE MOLLY B showed brief speed from between foes, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole and was eased through the lane.

BRIX settled off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with CITY AT NIGHT and drew clear of that rival in
the final furlong. MAJOR ATTRACTION raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and
rallied late to gain the place. CITY AT NIGHT was away in good order to track the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage the winner nearing the
quarter, vied with that rival but could not match strides in the drive. NO SLO MO showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached
a contending position but finished evenly late. HEIR (FR) was fractious at the gate, lacked early foot, checked nearing the quarter, saved ground through the
turn and finished with a belated bid. XTREME V. I. P. disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT raced four-wide
through the first turn, was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. NORTHCUT vied for the lead while racing
