Footnotes
BUNNY BONUS quickly moved clear then extended her margin throughout under moderate urging and was being geared down late. FANCY SCEPTER
raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and proved no match while holding the place. LORD JOAN saved ground throughout, moved closer before half a
mile and tired. TREASURE SEEKER trailed the opening half mile then passed tiring rivals. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL chased within range early then gave
way readily. OVERTHEBLUESKY chased inside and was finished into the far turn. COLLEGE TRY was urged off the leaders three wide then always far
behind. MAGNOLIA ROAD moved closer outside to the three eighths pole and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
LIKE A PRO was outrun early, advanced on the far turn, angled out for the stretch run, closed steadily outside, dug in gamely in deep stretch and surged
outside rivals for the win. TIZ A SHARPIE raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied, closed steadily
late and got second between rivals. MOONCHILD showed good early speed, opened up on the backside, responded when roused, dug in gamely in upper
stretch, battled on through the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly late. TRIBORD raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and rallied
mildly. TILSA raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and had no rally. TWIRLING WIND tracked on the inside, chased on the far
turn, raced between rivals at the quarter pole and faded. MINDING MILLIE raced four wide early, then stalked two wide, chased and gave way.

SPECIAL REWARD was bumped at the start, showed good early speed to take command, showed the way on the turn, responded when roused, widened
in the lane and was ridden out. TAKE IT TO THE MAX was off slowly, then in tight between rivals in the early stages, stalked, chased two wide on the turn
and rallied outside a rival for second. BACK TO D' FUTURE tracked close up on the inside, chased inside on the turn and was outfinished for the place spot.
BLUE SKY TUNE chased outside, went four wide into the turn, continued four wide and lacked a rally. DISCREETLIN JONES was reluctant to load, then
fractious in the gate, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. THEARCHERORTHEPREY was bumped at the start, chased three wide, continued
three wide on the turn and faded.

STRAWBERRY CONE pursued the loose pacesetter, took over in midstretch and edged clear while kept to his task. ALMOND CIDER broke alertly and led
inside, widened before the half, was collared in the stretch, resisted briefly then tired. MAJOR CAM raced just off the leaders, moved inside and lacked a
solid response. STAFF SERGEANT saved ground, was put to urging into the far turn then moved out with a mild bid. DUBROVNIK broke slowest and trailed
early then passed rivals while no threat. SIR CUPID dropped back early and was never a factor. JEKYLL ISLAND outrun early, angled inside after the
opening quarter and weakened. LIGHT WORK chased wide and was never in contention. FACTUM LOVE STYLE lacked speed along the inside and was
always outrun. ASH OF MY ENEMY raced in midpack and gave way readily. SEVENTYTIMESSEVEN was asked for run after the initial quarter but stopped
abruptly.

HOTPOT chased off the leaders outside then closed strongly through the stretch to get up in time late. FLAG set the pace, was briefly clear on the turn, was
engaged again in the stretch and raced gamely to the finish. BUCKS ARE MOVING prompted the pace inside early, angled out on the turn, loomed a threat
but could not get by the runnerup. YO NESSROUNDONKERN broke sluggishly and dropped back inside then rallied mildly. IMAGINE THIS lacked speed,
moved wide and failed to menace. BOKERMIN 'was urged within range early then faded very wide on the turn. MARATHONER prompted the pace outside
to the far turn then stopped abruptly.
