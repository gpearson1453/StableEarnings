STREET SHADOW hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in tandem with SECRET MISTRESS
nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied with that rival and drew clear through the final yards. SECRET MISTRESS was reserved just off the leaders from
the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the leaders into the lane, vied with the winner but could not match strides with that rival through the
closing yards. FAST TO FORTUNE broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way through
the final furlong. LADY LANA lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly. PLUMA pressed the pace while racing three-wide,
weakened after going five furlongs, weakened and was eased.

PLUM ROSE was off a step slow, rushed to contend, moved up four-wide to gain command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew off with complete
authority. TED'S CANDY GIRL sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, yielded to the winner into the lane but finished well to be clearly
second best. DOWNTHESTREETDEBBY chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gave
way in the drive. GRANDIOSE SUMMER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DOWNTOWN CUTIE settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. MUCH ABOUT ONE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, did not
threaten and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
DOZO was away in good order to duel for the lead with BENGAL TIGER, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run
and held off the closing IN THE VAULT by a narrowing margin. IN THE VAULT was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn,
remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid. RODEO ROSE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
rallied late. ELDORADO DREAM lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. BENGAL TIGER
disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. BURNADEBT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. APART OF MY CHARM showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
PIRATES CROSS broke sharply to duel for the lead with SUNNY LANE while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and was ridden out to
be kept to task. JACANA was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold
the place. LADY JADE raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. QUEENS RANSOM was forwardly placed
early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SUNNY LANE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
SHE'S BLUE DIAMOND was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
BARBARIAN sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased his advantage into the lane and was ridden out to the wire.
GUARDSMAN PASS showed no early speed, advanced from the inside through the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly
second best. HIGH FLYIN TIGER raced six-wide through both turns, lacked early speed and finished evenly in the drive. MORE ACTION was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. BEL RAGAZZO raced four-wide through the first turn, was never far
back, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened in the drive. ATLATL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn
and weakened. TWIST OF FATE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. LAZARUS COME FORTH raced
five-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot and did not offer a bid.
