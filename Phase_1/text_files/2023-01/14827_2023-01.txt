Footnotes
DURANGO JESS dueled for the lead with OUR EMPIRE while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and held sway to the wire. OUR

off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly late. INDIAN GAMBLER pressed the pace while racing three-wide from
between foes, checked nearing the three-eighths marker and failed to gain late. DEMOCRAT settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. MINDSHARE raced off the leaders early, moved eight-wide through the turn and did not menace. PROFOUND ONE was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave way. UNBRIDLED TIGER was off slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did
not offer a bid. SQUARE ROOT lacked early foot, raced eight-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and did not menace. TWO

Footnotes
TICK TOCK sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by CLUBHOUSE SAINT nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, brushed with that foe into the lane, vied and edged away late. CLUBHOUSE SAINT stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved
up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained a brief lead, brushed with the winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied but could not match
strides late. LILA'S LUCKY LADY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, angled in through the closing yards and
finished willingly. GOLD INCLUDED was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and rallied late. RED VENUS settled off the leaders
from the inside throughout and finished evenly. SUPERSTAR BEA was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with a
belated bid. LADY PHYLLIS chased the leaders from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. ALL NATIVE was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE RIDER OF CLUBHOUSE SAINT LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST TICK TOCK
CONCERING THE BRUSHING BETWEEN THE TWO AT THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS MARKER AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO
CHANGE. THE RIDER OF LILA'S LUCKY LADY LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST CLUBHOUSE SAINT AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS
MADE NO CHANGE. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
LEAD OFF broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, vied into mid-stretch and drew off late.
YOU'RE MY BOY KAT pressed the pace while racing four-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished with good courage to gain
the place. TAP THE BANK lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. SUPER CREATIVE was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished evenly. FLYING WINCHESTER disputed the
pace with the winner from off the rail and gave way through the final sixteenth. SARGE'S SERMON lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and did not threaten. MANFORALLSEASONS was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground and did not reach contention. MEGA MEAT settled off the
leaders throughout and lacked the needed closing response. LEA COSTA ME raced off the leaders early, lugged out through the turn and did not offer a bid.
GABE'S MONSTER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. SUPER INTENSE raced off the leaders early, moved six-wide
through the turn and gradually weakened. HERMISTON was never far back, raced six-wide through the turn and weakened. TIMES CHANGED UPON

Footnotes
BRUIN MAGIC was away in good order to duel for the lead with CAUCUS RULES from the inside, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run, remained in
control through mid-stretch and held off the closing ABRAAJ MIRAGE to prevail. ABRAAJ MIRAGE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside and
rallied late to just miss. POVERTY BAY stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. TOIL AND TROUBLE
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in late and finished with good courage. TEMPTED MISSION raced off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. GIVE EM HECK BECK lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and
failed to gain late. POPS AWESOME was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CAUCUS RULES broke sharply to
duel for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. BECKHAM JAMES was off a step slow, lagged early, raced
seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DRAW THE FOUL raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into
the stretch and weakened. NEW CHASER was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch
and did not offer a bid. LESLIE'S GOLD raced off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
BARNFIELD pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the half, responded when challenged by GUEST CHECK nearing the quarter
and edged away from that rival in the drive. GUEST CHECK pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, could not
match strides with the winner late but finished well to hold the place. TOUR THE WORLD settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch
and rallied late. SOLANDER lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with good
late energy. HANKY PRANKY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the quarter and failed to menace. PRINCE
OTTO was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and gave way. ATTORNEY LOUIS lugged
out through the first turn, lagged early, angled far out nearing the quarter and did not reach contention. MINNESOTA RED raced six-wide through the first
turn, lacked early speed, drifted out nearing the quarter and did not threaten. LIE AND DENY raced four-wide through the first turn, raced just off the leaders
early, drifted out nearing the quarter and weakened. MORE ACTION set a pressured pace for five furlongs and weakened. TIMES CHANGED UPON
REVIEW.
