drive and was second best in the end. RESOLUTIONIST was allowed to settled while two wide on the backstretch, rallied three wide on the far turn making
a bid but came up empty in late stretch. HOT TICKET was unhurried early then rallied on the far turn, swung out to be five wide in upper stretch and was no
