Footnotes
STEAL IT BACK tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair at the three sixteenths pole, rallied in the final furlong to bear down on them in the
closing stages, and gained an advantage in the shadow of the wire. INTHEALY set a clear pace while in hand around the turn, held sway from a chasing
rival through midstretch, but began to tire entering the final sixteenth, met a pair of bids in the closing stages, and was caught nearing the wire before
holding place. ARCTIC ROSE stalked three to two wide, took dead aim on the pace setter in upper stretch, but failed to progress until the final sixteenth,
attempted a bid soon after while an outer oncharging STEAL IT BACK menaced, and was outkicked late before failing to reach place.
HEREWECOMETOGETYOU saved ground off of the pace, shifted out in upper stretch, angled further out to remain outside of leading foes approaching
midstretch, then lacked a kick. ARGYBARGY BUCK tracked two to three wide, came into the lane in the five path, herded a few paths further out coming to
midstretch, and faded. DATSWHATILIKE broke a step slowly, and got outrun.

LADY AVE dueled for the lead inside of a vying rival around the turn, shook free at the quarter pole, and drew off under driving pressure.
OURPERFECTPRINCESS vied for the lead two wide, sparred around the turn, but proved no match for her inner counterpart at the quarter pole, and held
place thereafter. GALAXY THIRTYSIX trailed along the inside around the turn, came into the lane in the four path then improved between horses while
shifting ground outwardly in the final sixteenth. SERIOUSLY SASSY stalked along the inside, but lacked a bid. ZYDECO MUSIC bobbled at the start while
last away, lacked speed four wide, inched closer turning for home before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and flattened out in the final furlong
without menacing. FORBIDDEN FRUIT stalked three wide, spun into the lane in the five path, and gave way.

PLANTS AND BIRDS acted up in the starting gates, saved ground off of the pace, gained in the four path turning for home, bid outside of the top pair
leaving the furlong pole, and drove clear. AVENDORE stalked the top pair from the two path, gained place into the far turn before chasing the clear leader
around that bend, sustained a rail bid in midstretch, but was outkicked inside the final furlong, and secured place in the late stages. JACKIE FLASH broke
out, vied for the lead outside of the pace setter, inherited the fore approaching the far turn, inched clear around that bend, but met challenges from rivals on
either side in midstretch, and yielded in the final furlong. MISS TONALIST broke a step slowly, trailed, moved out of last in the four path around the far turn,
then failed to threaten the top trio thereafter. LA CHAPEAU set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed with seven sixteenths to go, and weakened
around the far turn. JIG TIME BANDIT tracked in the four path, but was through after a half mile.

STOCKPILER settled far back along the inside, tracked from behind rivals while in the three path around the far turn, split foes in the five path at the three
sixteenths pole while commencing a rally, yet shifted ground inwardly while picking up stride in midstretch, dove to the rail leaving the furlong grounds to
produce a bid inside of the leaders at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. RONITHELIMODRIVER tracked four wide, bid for the lead three wide around the
far turn, vied through midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole before gaining place. COSTELLO'S KITTEN stalked in the two
path, then two wide and between horses down the backstretch, sustained a bid along with an outer rival turning for home, clung to an advantage through
midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but was outkicked by a rail bidder at the sixteenth pole, and yielded. MASQUERADE BALL pulled clear, but was
headed by a pair of bidders at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. MOSH PIT tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn, shifted out to the
four path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. EXCLAIM rated at the rear two wide, improved in the four path and between horses entering the far turn, but
stalled out entering the lane in the six path, and yielded. KEYS INCLUDED tracked three wide and between horses, but faltered entering the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG BEEMSTER tracked along the inside, shifted three wide and between horses entering the lane, rallied in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong,
surged alongside that one while drifting outwardly nearing the wire, and narrowly prevailed. GALLANT BUCK dueled for the lead along the inside, drew off
entering the lane, maintained a wide margin into the final sixteenth, but was caught at the wire. BACK BEAT stalked three wide, chased under strong
coaxing around the turn, got floated four wide entering the lane, delayed his lead change until reaching the furlong grounds, and ran on. SPECIAL
OPERATOR saved ground while trailing, produced a rail rally to attempt a place bid leaving the furlong pole, but flattened out. BELLO CREEDO dueled for
the lead two wide, but yielded entering the lane, and weakened between horses. TOP NOTE lacked speed in the four path, came into the lane in the seven
path, and was outrun.

MYREDWHITEANDBLUE tracked along the inside, shifted outside of a rival nearing the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane while ranging up, bid at
the three sixteenths pole along with an inner DESERT DUKE, dueled with that foe through the final furlong, and narrowly prevailed. DESERT DUKE stalked
along the inside, tipped outside of the top trio entering the lane to bid along with an outer rival in upper stretch, led from that foe entering the final furlong,
sparred gamely while clinging to a margin in the late stages, but was caught at the wire. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) tracked two to three wide, bid around the
far turn, led entering the lane, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in upper stretch, and chased them home. FUJIN pressed two wide, vied between
horses around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart and a pair of outer bidders entering the lane, and gave way. SIMPLY WOW laid
off of the pace in the three path, came into the lane in the six path, and made little impact. CAFE RACER set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a
pair of bidders around the far turn, and weakened in upper stretch. FOE was outrun.

Footnotes
ROMANTIC BEAST stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path while closing in on the clear leader at the quarter pole, drew clear at the furlong
grounds, and held off an outer bidder late. IZEONPOINT trailed along the inside, moved out of last two wide and between horses around the far turn, rallied
three wide through midstretch, took aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, offered a late bid, but was denied. GLANCE tracked two wide, tucked to
the rail down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, chased to bid for place two wide and between horses at the furlong grounds, gained that
position soon after, but was outkicked in the final sixteenth while flattening out. QUINN MURPHY raced far back in the four path, fanned six wide in upper
stretch, and moved up. FASHION MERIT stalked in the three path, chased in the four path leaving the quarter pole, but yielded among foes at the furlong
grounds. SUFFRAGETTE laid off of the pace in the two path, retreated to trail into the far turn, drifted out to the center of the track in upper stretch, and
never got involved. QUEEN'S MISSION opened up to a wide margin, maintained a clear advantage entering the lane, but was caught nearing the furlong
pole, and weakened.
