Footnotes
SERMONONTHEMOUNT vied along the inside around the first turn, got rated back under firm restraint entering the backstretch, rebid outside of the leader
as outer foes inched closer as well leaving the nine sixteenths pole, vied nearing the far turn, led at the three furlong pole, drew off turning for home, and
was driven home to seal the deal. COLOR FAST leaned outwardly and was taken in hand to avoid contact at the start, trailed and became detached around
the first turn, gut the gap two wide around the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes on his left lead, and gained place while
changing over at the sixteenth pole. MISHKO tracked along the inside, moved forward outside of an inner bidding foe to press leaving the nine sixteenths
pole, but failed to keep pace with that rival into the far turn, chased around that bend, bid for place entering the lane, gained that position in upper stretch,
but was outkicked by an outer rival in the final furlong. MUSCADINE laid off of the pace along the inside, tracked entering the far turn, progressed to bid for
place two wide and between horses entering the lane, but tired. EAST LEX tracked three wide, got floated four wide down the backstretch, and faded
around the far turn. THE GRAY BLUR was lightly brushed by rivals on either side at the start, lacked speed in the four to three paths around the first turn,
and was done early. CAP ROCK MINER set the pace two wide before clearing an inner rival entering the backstretch, but was headed by that foe's outer
re-bid at the three furlong pole, weakened entering the lane, was eased up in the final furlong, and walked off.

LIL WOADIE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, wrestled an advantage while dueling entering the lane, and drove clear entering the final
sixteenth. HEZA SEXY ZONG set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, dueled turning for home, got headed at the quarter pole, fought on through
midstretch, but succumbed at the sixteenth pole. TRADER PRICE was herded outwardly by an inner foe at the start, tucked while off of the pace entering
the turn, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up in the final furlong. CHECK ME OUT broke a bit outwardly, laid close up along the
inside, but was put to firm restraint while failing to secure position inside of the leader at the five furlong pole, wrangled back and shifted out to settle leaving
the nine sixteenths marker, then stalked the leaders from the three to two paths around the bend, then chased through the lane before being outfinished for
show. SILVER CHALICE broke a step slow at the start, rushed outside of rivals to press the top pair leaving the nine sixteenths pole, but yielded to those
rivals entering the lane, and gave way. PARTY LITTLE BOY hopped before taking back from crowded quarters between horses at the start, trailed along the
inside, fanned to the nine path in upper stretch, and was outrun while hanging on his left lead.

Footnotes
G'WILDCAT pressed two wide, bid turning for home, led at the quarter pole, and drew off under moderate urging. HOORAY AUSTIN laid off of the pace in
the three path, then rallied between horses in midstretch to gain place. BINDING AGREEMENT stalked the top pair from the three path, but drifted to the
four path entering the lane, and yielded. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK set the pace as an outer rival pressed around the turn, got headed entering the lane,

WARRANT stalked two wide, snagged the advantage from a wide rival at the three quarter pole, showed the way down the backstretch, clung to a margin
from a trio of bidders turning for home, shook free in upper stretch, held sway through midstretch, flopped back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth,
and kept an outer chaser at bay. MAILMAN MONEY tracked along the inside, checked slightly while rating back entering the backstretch, yet pulled forward
to a stalking position a furlong later, shifted outside of the leader to bid for the lead two wide and among foes turning for home, but failed to keep pace with
the pace setter in upper stretch, and chased that foe home willingly through the final furlong. CASH LOGISTICS tracked in the four path, floated to the
seven path entering the backstretch, ranged up four wide around the far turn to bid turning for home, but yielded to an inner pair in upper stretch.
RIGHTANDJUST pressed outside of the leader and from the four path, drifted to the seven path entering the backstretch, but required urging to sustain
pressure from the three path around the far turn, got outmoved by bidders on either side turning for home, and weakened entering the lane. DUST EM set
the pace in the three path, but was headed by rivals on either side at the three quarter pole, chased from between horses into the far turn, but faded while
fanning five wide entering the lane. THE FINAL TIME WAS CORRECTED ELECTRONICALLY.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA READY tracked two to three wide and between horses, ranged up outside of the top pair turning for home, spun into the lane in the four path,
wrestled an advantage from an inner rival at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. ZIPPIN GIGI set the pace inside of a pressing rival, shook free from a
group of chasers entering the lane, held sway through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds, and held place thereafter. TWIRLING ROSES
pressed two wide, vied around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder while chasing the leader in upper stretch, kept on to bid for place late, but was
fended off. GREYS THE BOY stalked along the inside, then chased evenly while lacking the needed kick. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL never got involved.
UNDERHILL'S TAB broke through the starting gate pre-race, but was quickly re-loaded without further incident, chased four wide under urging around the
turn, then yielded in the five path entering the lane, and weakened on his left lead.

Footnotes
COFFEE COUNTY bumped an outer rival soon after the start, stalked along the inside, pulled to press between the top pair at the nine sixteenths pole,
relaxed behind them around the far turn, yet split them in upper stretch, gained an advantage from an outer rival coming to the furlong grounds, and drove
clear leaving it. SCORING DRIVE tracked in the four to three paths and between horses around the turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, stayed
on between foes to claim place late, and held that position from an outer rival thereafter. ONEFORVIVI stuttered a step before being bumped by an inner
rival at the start, trailed in the six path around the first turn, pursued from the five to six paths around the far turn, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch,
stayed on to bid for place along with an inner foe late, but was fended off. SINGLE SHOT vied for the lead in the three path, led from an inner rival around
the far turn, showed the way entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner bidder nearing the furlong grounds, gave way, and lost place to a pair of outer
rivals while faltering late. PERRINS tracked in the four path, pressed among rivals around the far turn, but chases inner foes in upper stretch, and was
outkicked by outer rivals in the final furlong. MO CREDO lacked speed in the three to four paths, swung to the eleven path in upper stretch, and surpassed
tiring rivals. NORTHERNREFLECTION leaned out at the start, laid off of the pace in the five path, inched closer to striking range nearing the far turn, but
faded in the seven path and between horses in upper stretch. COURTMAN vied along the inside, failed to keep pace with outer rivals entering the lane
before steadying in tight quarters at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
BLUE CHEESE settled off of the pace along the inside, was buried along the fence towards the rear with plenty of run in reserve turning for home, tipped to
the four path entering the lane, remained blocked behind traffic leaving the quarter pole, yet smoothly split foes when a seam opened at the three sixteenths
marker, surged to bid at the furlong grounds, and inched clear. DREWHUSTLE set the pace, gamely clung to a margin from outer rivals in upper stretch, but
was headed at the furlong grounds, and tenaciously saved place. SMARTY ALEX took a bump from an inner rival soon after the start, raced at the rear two
wide, attempted to gain four wide around the far turn before being fanned seven wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival while launching
a rally in upper stretch, and sustained a charge to miss reaching place. OAK HILL SOLUTION leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, pressed two wide,
bid between horses in upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and yielded. BIND FAITH stalked three wide, chased four wide leaving the
quarter pole, drifted five wide at the three sixteenths marker, and yielded between horses in midstretch. PLAY MO tracked two wide, chased from between
horses around the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. DRILLING REPORT steadied from tight rail quarters around the first turn,
tracked from the inside thereafter, but encountered mild traffic leaving the quarter pole, and tired.
