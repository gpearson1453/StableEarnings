Footnotes
ROYAL JESTER hustled leaving the start and dictated terms to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch and drew
clear nearing the furlong pole, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive in the final stages to prevail. HARBOR KITTY stalked the early
pace along the inside, was shuffled back in tight quarters entering the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth to put mild pressure on the
winner and was up for place in the final strides. TIZ VICIOUS lost a shoe in the early stages, tracked the pace to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the
quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, rallied in the late stages and just missed for place, while earning the nod for show. RHODIUM RUNNER
rushed up in the early stages to be close to the pace, pressed the moderate pace between runners to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch,
was outkicked in the final sixteenth and just missed for show in the final strides. FLY BUDDY FLY chased the moderate early pace from the rear, raced
outside of rivals along the turn, swung six wide for the drive and lacked a late rally. TRABIESO AVELITO away alertly, pressed the moderate pace to the
turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides with ROYAL JESTER in upper stretch and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
JEDI KNIGHT assumed command in the early going, set modest fractions to the half-mile marker while well rated, confronted by SUGAR BEETS nearing
the quarter marker, held that foe at bay to mid-stretch and determinedly held sway in the final stages. SUGAR BEETS raced close up to the early pace, kept
close attendance to JEDI KNIGHT to the second turn, drew even with that rival nearing the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch, was held at bay by JEDI
KNIGHT in deep stretch and just held for place in the final strides. POUR ON THE COLE raced under a snug hold in the early going, tracked the moderate
pace from the inside to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, made a mild late rally and just missed for place while holding for show. COOLCROSS
stalked the early pace, raced between rivals to the second turn, came in a bit tight while between runners nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide for
the drive and finished evenly in the late stages. IMPLICITLY allowed to settle while not far back, three wide along the first turn, came within aim while three
wide on the far turn, swung four wide for the drive and did not offer a late rally.

DREAM A DREAM sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while well handled to the quarter marker, extended the lead in upper stretch, felt late pressure
from EXTINGUISHER and held in a drive to prevail. EXTINGUISHER stalked the pace to the turn, came in tight entering the turn and was shuffled back
leaving the three-furlong marker, waited for racing room in upper stretch, closed with good interest in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner in deep
stretch and was second best. GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, chased the decent early pace, advanced two
wide on the turn, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch but rallied in the late stages to secure third. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY fractious in the gate,
traded bumps with DREAM A DREAM leaving the start, raced close up to the early pace, lost position on the turn, chased to mid-stretch and faded.
TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE lacked early speed, advanced three wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive and did not threaten in the late stages. MY
MOONDANCER forwardly placed in the early stages, advanced three wide on the turn and pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker, dropped back in
upper stretch and tired.

BLACK ZABAT broke alertly and showed early speed to dictate terms, set decent fractions while well handled to the quarter marker, raced in hand to upper
stretch, was green in the final stages while reacting to the crop and kept to task to prevail. DANIELLE'S SECRET allowed to settle in the early stages, two
wide into the turn then slipped to the rail nearing the top of the lane, rallied to come within aim nearing the furlong marker, could not make headway on
BLACK ZABAT in deep stretch and held well for place in the final stages. YODERANDO a bit slow into early stride then advanced to track the pace to the
turn, saved ground into the turn then steered three wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong
and missed for place, while holding for show in the end. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA rated off of the early pace, advanced outside of rivals on the turn, raced
four then five wide into upper stretch and finished evenly in the stretch run. BET DE VRON chased the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, swung
four wide for the drive and lacked a late response. BOB'S VAI broke out at the start and was away slowly, trailed into the turn, raced three wide to the
quarter marker and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
TROJAN CLUBHOUSE away alertly and cleared the field into the first turn, carved moderate fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, was in
hand to upper stretch, drew clear nearing mid-stretch while given a few reminder taps of the crop and pulled away in the final stages. ZABAVA bobbled at
the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to be not far back into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from a ground saving path to the quarter
marker, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well in the end to secure second. MISTY CAT forwardly placed in the early stages, raced three
wide into the first turn, stalked the pace outside of foes to the second turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, chased TROJAN CLUBHOUSE to
mid-stretch, did not produce a late rally and held for show in the final stages. IMPERIAL CREED unhurried in the early going, two wide along the first turn,
slipped to the inside along the backstretch run, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and finished evenly in the final
furlong. SEN SEN prominent on the run into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, chased TROJAN CLUBHOUSE to the quarter
marker, lacked a response in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. TARANTA (IRE) took back off of the early pace, raced four wide into the first turn then
was steered two wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the half-mile marker, lost contact nearing the top of the lane and tired in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
SNOW HILL forwardly placed into the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run, well placed heading to the second turn, roused three wide nearing
the top of the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, drew clear inside of the furlong marker and kept to task in the late stages. FLIPLIT unhurried in the
early going, raced three wide into the far turn, swung five wide for the drive, closed with good interest in the final furlong and was second best in the end.
GOLD RUSH GAL settled in the second flight early on, raced three then four wide into the backstretch run, was well positioned nearing the half-mile marker,
came four then three wide approaching the quarter marker, rallied in upper stretch and came within aim nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace in the
final stages and held safely for show. LASSAROCK allowed to settle in the early stages, two wide along the first turn, gained ground approaching the
second turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, angled out approaching mid-stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final sixteenth. FILLY PELLI
unprepared at the start and spotted the field leaving the break, trailed to the second turn, improved position while along the inside nearing the quarter
marker, rallied in upper stretch, came in tight nearing the furlong grounds and lacked a final response. DADDYS NINA contested the early pace while under
a snug hold, dueled with LADY BLACKBIRD while outside of rival on the far turn, could not match strides with SNOW HILL in upper stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. LADY BLACKBIRD assumed command in the early going, set a pressured pace while carving moderate fractions to the half-mile marker,
dueled with DADDYS NINA to the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch and faded in the late stages. KIND BUT SHE LIES hustled in the early
stages, stalked the moderate pace while three deep on the first turn, close up through the backstretch run, still within aim while three then two wide on the
far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
AMERICAN FARMER took back off of the early pace while well positioned, never far back through the backstretch run, roused three wide on the far turn,
drew to even terms with STORMY SAMURAI in upper stretch, battled with that foe to the furlong grounds, shook free inside of the furlong marker, was kept
to steady urging in deep stretch and held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. LONG LANCE unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the
backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed
in the final sixteenth to pressure the winner, could not reel in AMERICAN FARMER in the final strides and was second best. MR. IMPOSSIBLE allowed to
settle early on, raced in the second flight while saving ground to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked the needed late response but stayed on
late to secure the show. STORMY SAMURAI showed good early speed and dictated terms to the first turn, set solid fractions to the half-mile marker, was
confronted nearing the quarter pole, met the bid of AMERICAN FARMER to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. KIWI'S DREAM (AUS) forwardly
placed in the early going, stalked the decent fractions to the half-mile marker, advanced two wide on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in
the late stages. TARANTINO allowed to settle, raced two wide into the backstretch run, lost contact on the second turn and did not threaten in the drive.

Footnotes
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER showed early speed and set the fast pace to the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, held foes
at bay to the sixteenth-marker, determinedly dug in in deep stretch and lasted over the oncoming runner-up. TIGER QUEEN prominent in the early going,
tracked the quick fractions to the turn, pressed REDSTWIRLINGDANCER to the quarter marker while outside of that rival, lost ground in upper stretch,
re-rallied in the late stages, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and was up for place. SWANEE forwardly placed in the early stages,
pressed the pace three wide on the turn, chased REDSTWIRLINGDANCER to mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed for place,
while holding for show. KITTY'S CANDY took back off of the fast early pace, saved ground along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and closed willingly in
the late stages. PERSUASIVE LIPS bobbled at the start, chased the quick pace to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung four
wide for the drive and found her best stride late. LADY IN A HURRY was fractious in the gate, broke a step slowly and lacked early speed, raced two wide
on the turn and did not threaten in the drive. KITTYHAWK LASS lacked early speed, raced three wide along the turn, lost position in upper stretch and did
not factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
STAR RACER broke well but outrun for the lead, settle nicely behind PAPA TIGER for the first quarter mile, easily cut into the lead around the turn, was
even-up at the three-sixteenths then drew off as the rider pleased under a mild hand ride. DISKO TRIBUTE broke well, then settled well off the early pace
down the backstretch, took a clear path around the turn while saving some ground, then swung out to the three path for the stretch run, finished well and
was clearly second best to the streaking winner. I'M A LUCKY MAN broke a little awkwardly, spotting the field a couple of lengths, raced mid-pack down the
backstretch, kept to the inside while gaining some ground on the leaders through the turn, swung out a path for the stretch run and finished well to gain a
minor award. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL lacked early speed, began to move forward into the turn, steadied slightly near the seven-sixteenths pole then had to
wait for racing room through the turn, was six-wide at the top of the stretch and made a nice run down the lane. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF threw the rider
off balance at the break, giving the field a head start, struggled to keep up with the pack for the first quarter, had to steady briefly around the three-eighths
pole when TERRY'S BOY took his path, then found a good rhythm from that point and made a wide, sweeping and sustained run through from there and
down the stretch but had too much ground to make up. PAPA TIGER broke best and was hard sent to establish the early pace, held the lead to the quarter
pole while being dogged by STAR RACER, could not fend off the challenge of that one at the head of the stretch and tired in the final furlong. TERRY'S
BOY reserved early, moved forwardly through the turn while four wide, had clear run at the head of the stretch but could not find another gear and flattened
out with a furlong to run. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) showed good speed for a quarter mile, was close to the pace to the turn, then could not keep up, still
managed to beat one rival home in the end. LUCKY LAD broke well from the outside post but veered out after the break, quickly got into stride and was
close to the pace while four wide down the backstretch and to the turn but was done at the five-sixteenths pole and trailed the field home.
