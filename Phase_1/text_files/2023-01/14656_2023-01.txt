Footnotes
HIGHER AUTHORITY away in good order, showed the way along the inside into and through the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, turned back
a bid from GOLD BUCKLE entering the stretch and steadily drew clear. GOLD BUCKLE forwardly placed three wide early, in hand up the backstretch,
closer second turn, briefly challenged outside the winner into the stretch then proved no match, weakened late but managed to last for the place.
PROMISING SHOES void of speed toward the inside, remained in the main body the middle half, came in the two path for the drive, steered out widest and
finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. LOOKIN HIGH settled off the pace and the inside, three wide and between arrivals turning for home,
failed to muster a closing response. RYE HUMOR in the second flight outside, four wide turning for home when with the second flight, lacked a closing
response. FLOWERS FOR LISA broke back, four out to five wide in the turn, tired through the lane. SONIC CITY chased for five furlongs while in the two
path, rider dropped in the saddle just before a half, continued to pursue into the far turn then gave way. MAKE NOISE off a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ARTHURIAN gained command soon after the start, set a pressured pace into and through the turn, turned back the runner up inside the furlong marker and
edged clear under steady handling. GRAPNEL away in good order, pressed the winner from the outside, crept a bit closer turning for home, could not keep
up the final furlong, clearly second best while also being kept to pressure. COAL TRUTH broke back, lacked early foot, began a mild rally in the three path
midway on the turn, between foes into the lane, edging away late for the show while not a threat to the top two. NEWS BOX asked for some run early,
dropped inside early turn, continued one paced along the rail through the turn, flat late to finish up evenly. WITH VERVE settled in mid pack while off the
inside, three wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. BACKDOORPARTY void of speed in the two path,picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
threat. BEND IN THE RIVER in hand early, moved out a bit to race four wide through the turn, tired through the stretch. WIPE THE SLATE forwardly placed
for a half while in the three path, backed up through the stretch. GRAZEN IN THE PARK off a step slow, trailed throughout in a dull effort.

Footnotes
MAMZOOJ showed the way into the first turn, set a forced pace up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed early far turn then turned back bids from a
couple of foes soon after, clear again into the lane, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. ATLANTIC DANCER off the pace
along the inside, continued to save ground, began to advance in the second turn when called on, continued to save ground into the lane, finished willingly to
gain the place. PATROLMAN broke with the leaders, settled in the second flight off the inside, closer then lodged a brief bid between horses midway on the
final turn, failed to follow through in the short stretch run. ANDY CANT void of speed, four wide in the first turn, advanced, four wide move second turn,
outside bid midway on the bend, weakened through the stretch. JEDREK lacked speed while off the inside, continued back, three to four wide turning for
home, finished up evenly in lacking a serious kick. ONTHESTAGE in the second group toward the rail, boxed in traffic far turn, came up empty when clear
for the drive. UNSTABLE PRINCE in mid pack early, fell back before a half, four wide second turn, failed to rally. ORDER OF MERIT pressed the winner off
the inside, stopped far turn, continued to give way through the stretch, jogged in late.

Footnotes
BECKY'S TATTOO behind the early pace inside, crept closer turning for home, rail bid with a furlong to run, dueled to the wire, proved narrowly best in a
determined effort. LADY SHAMAN with the pace from the start, dueled in the two path through the turn, showed the way into the stretch, larger lead a
furlong out, continued to lead late, outfinished for the win while holding the place. LEGENDARY GIFT forwardly placed while racing outside, three wide turn,
lacked a closing punch to be outkicked for the second spot. NOSTALGIA took control just after the start, vied up the backstretch in holding a slim
advantage, dueled turn closest to the inside, faltered in the drive. CAGED BEAR in mid pack while outside early, angled toward the inside turn, two path into
the stretch, went evenly through the stretch. C C THE BARTENDER bothered at the break to be off a bit slowly, lacked speed, steered out five wide late in
the turn when improving a bit in upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. PUT A BOW ON IT broke in, fell back after a quarter, trailed turn, improved
while passing tiring rivals. DORITA'S HEART remained always back. BRIAR THICKET hesitated at the start, was always outrun. CATECHISM bothered to
be off slowly, moved up outside, midpack turn, backed up stretch.

Footnotes
TWIRLING TIGRESS broke alertly, set a lively pace up the backstretch, was given a bit of a breather through the turn, remained clear through the stretch
under steady handling. WREAKING HAVOC void of early foot outside, raced three out to four wide turn, rallied widest down the lane to finish up evenly and
be clear for the place. TRIBAL SPIRIT bothered by a stumbling THORN CROWN, raced well back early, moved off the inside when advancing midway on
the turn, dropped back in and continued to improve through the stretch, nod for the show. TRUE EMOTION hesitated at the start to be slowly away,
advanced three down to two wide turn, closest a furlong out then flattened in the late going. THORN CROWN stumbled at the break, recovered to race in
second flight early, moved closer and chased the winner off the inside through the turn and much of the stretch, faltered late to lose several positions.
LOVELY JOYCE off a step slow, fell well back while trailing, two path turn, improved position through the lane with some belated interest. UNIFIED GURL in
the main group early, moved a bit closer in the turn off the inside, three wide into the stretch and weakened. SUPER SPIRIT was finished before a half.
SCAT LOGIC in the second flight while racing outside, steered in a bit to save some ground turn, had little left for the stretch drivde. FLY CONDOR
forwardly placed while racing three wide, began to retreat before a half. FANCY HILL was finished early, well back.

Footnotes
SPEED BIAS sprinted clear soon after the start, rated in the run up the backstretch, shook off a couple foes turning for home, drew out through the lane
while being kept to task. B SUDD in the second flight toward the inside, advanced along the rail turning for home, could do little with the winner in the run to
the wire, proved game for the place. BEN DIESEL closest to the winner, moved closer and tried that one from the outside turning for home, no match
stretch, outfinished for the runner up spot. TEN GAUGE settled early while three wide, advanced closer four wide turning for home, flattened out through the
stretch. CAWKAB went one paced while three wide most of the way. JOLLY TOMMY off a step slow, remained back. BROOKLYN DIAMONDS in the main
group inside, two path second turn, tired in the drive. BELLAMYS ROAN off a step slow, was always outrun. FINAL TIME PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
ROLLING FORK outrun in the early going, four wide through the turn came five wide for the drive, accelerated inside the furlong marker when set down,
challenged late, dueled final strides, narrowly gained the nod at the wire. MEAN JAKEY behind the leaders early inside, two path turn when moving a bit
closer, lacked clear room in traffic late in the turn, split foes nearing midstretch, took over, led late, dueled, missed nod. UPSTRIKER pressed the leader
early, advanced and took over in the two path late in the bend, showed the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the top two late, saved the
show. MOJO MAN bothered a bit just after the start, raced back, four to five wide turn, turned in a late run down the middle of the strip to improve position
and to be gaining for the show spot. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE also bothered slightly just after the start, mid pack and outside, four wide and in some traffic
turning for home, continued in traffic approaching midstretch, altered course to the outside, improved slightly late while not a serious threat. BELFAST BOY
lacked speed, remained back turn, passed some faltering foes while also not posing a major threat. SHACKLEFORD STRONG underwent a shoe repair in
the paddock, came out after start to bother a couple of outer rivals, raced forwardly, vied four wide through the turn, gave way in upper stretch. WHOOPING
JAY broke sharp, cleared toward the inside, set the pace four just over three furlongs, gave way when headed late in the turn. IBERVILLE lacked speed,
was five wide midway on the turn, remained back in lacking a closing response. COST BASIS vied up front for a half between rivals, gave way through the
stretch.

Footnotes
KEYSTONE FIELD stalked the pace under confident handling along the inside, tipped out three wide when moving to challenge late in the final turn,, took
over when straightened for home and drove well clear. GREAT ESCAPE broke on top, got clear in hand into the first turn, set the pace along the inside,
offered little resistance to the winner in upper stretch, remained clear for the place. OPEN ROAD prompted the pace off the inside, continued to apply
pressure the middle half, challenged between the top two late in the final bend, no match for that same pair for the drive, narrowly saved the show. TIZ RYE
TIME void of speed, asked for run midway on the final turn, steered out three wide for the drive, found best stride too late to be gaining for the show spot.
SPANKSTER in the second flight while well off the inside into the first turn, two path second bend, lacked a closing response in the drive. SILVER DUST
fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke with the field, settled mid pack off rail, dropped inside final turn, went evenly through the lane to come up empty.
CALIBRATE fell back to trail the opening quarter, asked along second turn while three wide, not a threat through the stretch. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC void of
early foot, was never a factor. BYE BYE BOBBY gave way after a half outside, trailed home.

Footnotes
LOVELY RIDE broke alertly, got clear into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, let out a notch turning for home and would not allow
the runner up to challenge. ICE ORCHID broke with the winner, pressured that one from the outside, asked for run late in the final turn, could not get to that
same rival while fully extended to hold the place. LE DA VIDA (CHI) settled in mid pack while off the inside, raced the two path through the final turn, set
down for the drive and closed with good energy to be getting to the top two while well out in the strip. TRAVERSE one paced inside, encountered some
traffic in the second bend, continued in some traffic upper stretch, moved out a bit and improved slightly while not a threat to the top three.
GRAYSONSMACHO GAL in some traffic while in tight first turn, pulled in the run up the backstretch, closer into the far turn, asked along 2nd turn after
dropping inside, came up empty for the stretch drive. WILL'S SECRET lacked speed off the inside, three wide through both turns, made little impact through
the lane. MISTY VEIL void of speed, improved slightly three wide while also not a serious threat. COACH forwardly placed in the three path, had little left for
the stretch run. FOREVER DREAMING veered out at the break, remained well back throughout. FAMILY TIME off a step slow, was through early.

Footnotes
HAMAZING DEBATE behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground turn, steered out for the drive, collared the leader inside the furlong
marker and kicked clear late. KOKOMO STARLET broke sharp, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way into the stretch, responded when
confronted by the winner past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to that one, remained well clear of the others. TIZ A STRATEGY void of early foot,
moved inside for the turn, continued to save ground into the stretch, rallied for the show, not a threat to the top pair. INDIAN IRISH pressed the the runner
up while off the inside, continued to apply pressure through the bend then began to weaken. CALYPSO STREET in the main group while outside, was four
wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. DIXIE GIRL TO last to leave, trailed early, four to five wide turn, improved position, not dangerous. FLY LIKE THE
WIND lacked speed, angled out in some traffic turning for home, improved slightly while not a serious threat either. DANCIN N THEPULPIT prompted the
issue early while outside, faded. MIRACLE SHOES in the main body off rail, steadied into the turn, failed to respond when asked for the drive. PRINCESS
HADLEY saved ground into and through the turn, tired. BONNIE LASS in the second flight early, steadily faded. FORTIBUG back off the pace outside,
fanned five wide in traffic exiting the turn, trailed home, jogged in.
