Footnotes
FANCY AZTECA led early on before conceding the front to NIGHTSABER content to track that rival latched on to the outside while three wide, tucked to the
two path into the turn advancing to take command with seven-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch set down for the drive, went clear
under a drive to prevail. COOKIE CRUMBS five then four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. MEAN
MONGOL coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home, tired and was along best
of the rest. GERMANY JAYVO coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, tired.
DENIECE OF DEGRACE coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.
NIGHTSABER (GB) coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside before advancing to take command just inside six furlongs to go, showed
the way under pressure and yielded near the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
LOHENGRIN TWO moved to the lead early then went clear, drew off while inside around the turn, responded well when put to a left-handed crop outside
the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady urging. ALCOOLS settled under
some urging, was roused while moving from the rail to the two path around the turn, came out three wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner under
strong urging in the drive and was second best. ZERTZ was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide around the turn and came up empty while
just able to get the show. HAGLER dropped back after the start, was urged along at the rear, moved from the two path to the rail around the turn and was no
factor. MARVIN chased the pace on the outside, dropped back two then three wide on the turn and retreated. THE FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

Footnotes
SHIDABHUTI chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth
pole, then edged away to the finish kept to task. LA VITA SOFIA chased three to four wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish to secure the place honors. CRYPTO MAMA broke out at the start under coaxing, showed
the way briefly just off the inside before tucking to the rail settling in hand through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch under growing threat from a pair, got collared nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. DIVINE CROSS
chased just off the inside coming under a prolonged drive half a mile from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. GOLD MEDAL
ANNA bobbled at the break, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SHE CAUGHT MY EYE was away alertly and showed in front early, relinquished the lead then tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the
two path around the turn, gained the advantage at the five-sixteenths, kicked clear when asked for her best in upper stretch, drew away under the crop to
the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. PONCHO SONG was coaxed along off the pace, came under
stronger encouragement in the three path around on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and narrowly got up for the place while no match for the winner.
RACING COLORS was coaxed along on the outside, ranged up in the four path on the turn, made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the
winner in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and was caught for the place while well clear for the show. PRINCESS PINKY settled off
the pace, moved from the two path to the four path under urging around the turn and came up empty. VOICE OF SPRING settled on the outside, was urged
four then five wide around the turn and failed to respond. SHAOLIN was last to commence, raced towards the back under urging, went around the turn in
the two path and was no factor. STORMI CAT LADY was urged along at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn and showed little. PAVE MY WAY
was restless in the gate, came away in good order, moved to the lead then showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the
advantage to the winner at the five-sixteenths and faded. EXFILTRATION was restless in the gate, raced towards the front under urging, dropped back late
on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and faltered.

inside route into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. AMUNDSON five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the

speed, vied between foes passing the nine-sixteenths then inside of a foe, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, dueled gamely with the

around the turn, pursued the top two in the stretch, gained on those foes late and finished willingly for the show. SPOOKY LADY bumped with an opponent
at the start, showed good speed on the inside of foes, dropped back near the half-mile pole, chased inside around the turn and tired. MISCHIEF MOTION
moved out under urging early, saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten. VIRTUAL BEAUTY raced well back in the field, dropped from the four
path to the two path early on the turn and was no factor. HAIL BRITANNIA was reluctant to load, broke a step slow then was taken up significantly, went five
wide on the turn and faltered.

TOUGH STREET away to the front, showed the way early on nine paths off the inside down the backstretch, had a pair of rivals advance inside and was
displaced from command but content to track them in close range latched on to the outside, tucked three wide through the turn stacked outside that pair and
came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole taking back control, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and edged clear under a drive to prevail. MY
FIRST LOVE just off the inside down the backstretch, advanced in tandem with SHADOLAMO and took command near the half mile pole, tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to
procure the place honors, then was reported to have bled. SHADOLAMO forwardly placed four paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced tucked
to the two path and prompted the pace between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the late
stages while along best of the rest. DUCKPHAT chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch
and tired. KEEN DANCER six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn before going six wide into upper stretch, made
no impact. SALSA A PARTE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide at the head of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
STONEWALL STAR bumped with a rival at the start, moved in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the
two path, responded well when set down into upper stretch, drew off under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best.
LITTLE LINZEE broke out at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn and got up for the place while
no threat to the winner. SECURITY CODE bumped with foes on both sides at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back near the
half-mile pole, went three to four wide around the turn and lacked the needed response but just earned the show. BANTERRA broke out and hit the gate
then bumped with a foe, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn and tired. LOCKBOX bumped with a rival at the start, was
urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. STARRY MIDNIGHT bumped with a rival at the start, angled to the outside while
climbing a bit early, went five wide around the turn and failed to respond.
