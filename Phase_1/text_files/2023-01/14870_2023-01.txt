RIVER MALBUMOONRVF took a quick lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was hand urged to draw off on the far turn then taken in hand for the
stretch run. NICE BUT NAUGHTY stalked off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and proved no match.
DON'TCALLTOOEARLY settled back off the rail on the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened
later yards. IT'S ONLY MONEY rounded the first turn in the five path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and showed
little in the lane. COLONIAL ROAD entered the first turn in the four path, moved inside leaving the turn but showed little response through the backstretch.
IRISH FLIGHT rounded the opening turn in the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded nearing the far turn. SWEET T saved ground
and faded through the backstretch.

turn and held well under steady stretch handling. K K CAN chased toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch and
just lasted. BET THE QUEEN briefly settled after coming away a bit awkwardly, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and entered the turn near the rail,

turn at a close disadvantage two deep, drifted leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride. MI YAYIS chased the pace, raced in the four path of the turn and
finished well outside. CAN I GET AN AMEN chased outside, raced in the five path of the turn, left the turn outside then flattened the final sixteenth. RIDE

TARAASHOQ settled inside and picked up the chase nearing the nine sixteenths pole, steadily improved at the rail on the far turn, came inside the drifting
runner-up at the eighth pole, took over mid-stretch and inched clear the final yards. ADARA took over into the first turn and rated the pace, came under
pressure to draw clear of Zinfatuation toward the quarter pole, drifted leaving the turn, was met mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. SHAKIN IT BIG
TIME saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn and cleared third mid-stretch. ZINFATUATION
steadied at the rail midway on the first turn then rated close, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back approaching the quarter and
faded through the far turn. SHANNONRUN raced off the pace in the three and four paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the
far turn.

final yards. DEEMED ESSENTIAL chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail into the turn, left the turn at the rail and dueled to a brief slim lead deep
stretch, though, proved best for second. ALWAYS SOMETHING set a pressured early pace, was met at the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear through the
turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in the final yards. INCLUDE THE BEAST engaged in close chase and dueled from the five
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the turn then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. AYKIZ exchanged contact with Super Wildcat leaving the

the five sixteenths pole, raced close five wide on the turn but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. SUPER WILDCAT exchanged contact with Aykiz leaving
