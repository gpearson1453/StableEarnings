Footnotes
VOODOO MISTRESS broke on top to set a pressured pace around the first turn, went to a clear lead to late stretch, dug in and held off the late closers and
prevailed. LILY'S CREED tracked the leaders down the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn then angled out in upper stretch to gain late on the
winner and proved second best. JU JU VIP was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a middle move on the backstretch and made a rail bid
around the final turn for a late run at the top two but was too late. CAJUN TRINITY pressed the pace around the first turn then chased the winner home.
SHE'S MY LOUIE V. was forwardly place around the first turn while racing three wide and tired. LYRICAL MUSIC was five wide into the first turn then raced
near the back and was never a threat. PREACH IT GIRL went six wide into the first turn and raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then gave
way.

STEPHEN'S ANSWER shot to the lead drew away and proved much the best. MUFFIN NUTS was allowed to settle in the two path around the first turn then
made a three wide bid at the three eighths pole but was no match for the winner. INDIMAAJ was forwardly placed in the two path around the first turn the
chased the leader home. MISTS OF TIME was off the pace from three wide around the first turn then tracked the leader down the backstretch and tired.
SHIPPINGPORT tracked the leaders around the first turn while saving ground but to no avail. WISE GUY showed little.

Footnotes
LUTIE MO was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a four wide bid at the three eighths pole to engage the leader at the quarter pole, took over
at the three sixteenths pole and dug in late to hold on. COURTLY DOC saved ground to the final turn then moved out to two wide at the three sixteenths
pole, went between horses late in the drive and just missed. GEORGIA DAWN was off the pace around the first turn then moved up to vie for the lead down
the backstretch then took the lead at the five sixteenths pole and weakened. K V SQUARED saved ground down the backstretch moved out to two wide on
the final turn, went three wide in upper stretch but lacked the late kick needed. GYPSYROSELEE was roused to the lead around the first turn then was
headed at the five sixteenths pole and gave way. MO CLASSY raced in the middle of the pack but was not a threat. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX pressed the
pace from the two path to the first turn and retreated.
