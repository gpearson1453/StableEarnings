Footnotes
ROMANTIC BEAST set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the far turn, failed to keep pace turning for
home, altered course outside of that foe while sustaining stride in upper stretch, rebid at the furlong grounds, and edged away. WHATS UP SWEETS was
bothered by an outer rival and squeezed back when put to tight quarters after breaking a step slowly, raced at the rear three wide, gained five wide and
outside of foes down the backstretch, to vie at the half mile pole, forged an advantage while tucking down to the two path entering the far turn, drew clear
turning for home, but encountered ROMANTIC BEAST's outer re-challenge in midstretch, and was bested soon after before fending off an inner rival for
place. QUINN MURPHY tracked along the inside, but yielded inside of a group of rivals at the half mile pole, raced well back into the far turn, yet stayed on
through the lane, sustained a rail grind in the ate stages, but was denied reaching place. IZEONPOINT broke inwardly, bumped and bothered an inner rival
in the process, tracked two wide around the first turn, chased along the inside around the far turn, shifted out to the four path while in range in upper stretch,
and finished up one-paced. SUFFRAGETTE prompted outside of the leading pair from the four path, but was outmoved by an outer bidder down the
backstretch, chased under urging around the far turn, then faded in the six path in upper stretch, and weakened while hanging on his left lead.
HAVINFUNYET took a bump from an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside, failed to progress in the five path around the far turn, and was no
factor. ABBEY LANE vied two wide and between horses, chased her inner counterpart down the backstretch, but was tentative among foes leaving the nine
sixteenths pole, and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
MADISON LUVS DUKE stalked outside of the top pair around the first turn, tugged past them at the five furlong pole, opened up approaching the far turn,
and was driven home with an insurmountable advantage. SPINSTRAWINTO GOLD vied two wide around the first turn, but was outmoved by an outer
bidder at the five furlong pole, proved no match around the far turn, yet held place late. SUMMER LOVER raced at the rear in the five to four paths, and
moved up. KEEP ON set the pace inside of a pair of rivals around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with his outermost counterpart at the five furlong
pole, chased into the far turn, but weakened around that bend. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY saved ground in midpack, but faded. NORWOOD rated back from a
bit of crowded quarters early on, laid off of the pace in the four path, but was done entering the far turn, eased to the outside and pulled up in upper stretch,
then walked off.

Footnotes
UNANIMOUSLY laid off of the pace in the four path, gained five wide around the far turn to bid outside of foes in upper stretch, and drove clear nearing the
furlong grounds. LIKE MIKE tracked two to three wide, inched closer four wide along with an outer rival around the far turn, but failed to match rallying stride
with that foe in upper stretch, and kept on to gain place at the sixteenth pole. IZZY'S BABY BOY vied for the lead inside of a rival, pressed that foe around
the far turn, sustained vying position in upper stretch, but proved no match for an outer foe approaching the furlong grounds, and lost place a sixteenth from
home. STEAL IT BACK leaned inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked two wide, pursued three wide and between horses around the far turn,
yielded entering the lane, and lacked a bid. WAR COUNT was fidgeting about just before the gates opened, vied for the lead two wide, led into the far turn,
but was headed among foes in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds. STANDING MAN was bumped by an outer rival at the start, tracked
along the inside, chased around the far turn, tired in upper stretch, and was eased through the final furlong. GREELEY WENT WEST trailed outside of
kickback, but became detached from the rest leaving the five furlong pole, and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
KEEN LADY pressed outside of the leader and from the three path, vied into the far turn, led turning for home, drew off in upper stretch, and widened under
moderate urging. ZING trailed in the three path, rated while patient behind rivals saving ground around the far turn, then sustained a rail charge to gain
place approaching the sixteenth pole. SWIZZLECITY set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, vied with that foe into the far turn, got
headed at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way in upper stretch. PLANTS AND BIRDS laid off of the pace in the four path, the top pair from the three to
four paths around the far turn, then lacked a bid. SECRET MELODY got severely rank while stalking behind the top pair entering the first turn, finally settled
into stride at the five furlong pole, tugged in the two path behind the top pair entering the far turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
FIRST I'VE SEEN brushed an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the clearing leader at the three sixteenths pole, sustained a
grinding charge to range up to that foe entering the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. RUE LALA took minor contact from an inner foe at the
start, dueled for the lead along the inside, shook free entering the lane, held sway through midstretch, but met a challenge at the sixteenth pole, and was
bested late. SPEEDY DUDETTE stalked three wide, pressed from the four path around the turn, gained place entering the lane as the leader shook away,
but was outkicked for that position while drifting out subtly at the three sixteenths pole, then held show from an inner rival through the final furlong. OURS
AND THEIRS laid off of the pace two wide around the turn, shifted out to the five path and between horses in upper stretch, but lacked a bid while hanging
on her left lead. SIENNA BREEZE tracked outside of the top trio while taking the turn in the five path, then yielded in the six path in upper stretch while
hanging on her left lead. INAWIC trailed along the inside, and got outrun. SCAMPERING GRAYCE dueled for the lead two wide while taking the turn in the
three path and between horses, but caved entering the lane.

SERIOUSLY SAM broke in at the start, set the pace, got a bit keen from restraint entering the backstretch, showed the way in the two path as an outer rival
pressed into the turn, shook free of that foe entering the lane, and drew off under driving pressure. LEAD ME tracked from the four path, pursued the top
pair around the far turn, gained place in upper stretch as the leader kicked away, and was second best. CZAR'S BALLERINA stalked two wide, pressed
from the three path around the far turn, but gave way in upper stretch. TARGET VISION tracked along the inside, trailed passing the three furlong pole, then

BARTULIA prompted the pace setter from the three path, vied with that foe into the far turn, led turning for home, and drew off under driving pressure.
GUNTOWN settled far back in the four path, came into the lane in the five path, then stayed on in the final furlong to reach place late. DOCTOR NASH set
the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, vied with that foe into the far turn, got headed approaching the five sixteenths pole, gave way in
upper stretch, and lost place in the closing stages. RICKY BOBBY stalked along the inside, chased the top pair while failing to keep pace around the far
turn, and was no threat. FAIR DINKUM tracked two wide, chased around the far turn, then lacked a rally between horses. TRIVISTA was outrun.

Footnotes
RUN ROCKET stalked two wide and between horses around the first turn, inched closer to bid along with an outer rival turning for home, and drew off in
upper stretch. PAYDAY TOO was slow into stride, trailed early on, knifed between foes while gaining three wide turning for home, and sustained a rally
between horses to gain place in the final sixteenth. GALLANT STAR tracked four wide, improved to a stalking position entering the backstretch, ranged up
three wide along with an inner foe around the far turn, but yielded while delaying his lead change in upper stretch, sustained stride after changing over in
midstretch, bid for place in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an inner rival for that position. GUITAR TRIBUTE settled far back in the four to six paths,
fanned to the eight path in upper stretch, and moved up late. C'MON VE vied two wide, led into the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper
stretch, and gave way. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted out while between horses around the far turn, came into the
lane in the five path, and lacked a rally among foes. UNWANTED INTRUDER laid off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn in the five path, fanned to
the seven path entering the lane, and only produced a mild kick between horses. LOUISIANA MOON stalked three wide and between horses, but gave way
turning for home. CRUSADER EXPRESS tracked along the inside, got slightly keen while asked to rate back nearing the backstretch, shifted out to the five
path down the backstretch, chased from the four path around the far turn, and weakened. ADIEU LE CHAT vied along the inside, but weakened around the
far turn. SEMI CHARMED LIFE lacked speed along the inside, was done early, and eased through the lane.
