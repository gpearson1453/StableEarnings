Footnotes
COMMERCIAL FLASH settled at the rear in the three path, moved forward between horses entering the lane, split foes while tipping three wide in upper
stretch, rallied in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong, drove past that one at the sixteenth pole, and kicked clear. BET ON BOURBON stalked along
the inside, bid for the lead through an opening inside of the top pair entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer oncharging
foe entering the final sixteenth. ENDURING PEACE chased from midpack in the four path around the turn, came into the lane in the six path, but was
outkicked by an inner rival while chasing in upper stretch, and kept on for a minor share. KASEN'S SISTER lacked speed while hung in the five path around
the turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up while hanging on her left lead. AMERICAN REBEL bumped with an inner rival at the
start, settled far back in the two path, shifted three wide approaching the furlong grounds, and improved position. GILDED APPLE made contact with an
outer rival at the start before receiving a brush from an inner foe soon after, chased from midpack while under urging and saving ground, but failed to factor.
CANDY'S PRIDE dueled for the lead inside of a rival while a path off of the inside, which allowed for her to be headed by a rail bidder at the quarter pole,
then caved between horses. CHARLIE'S PEAK brushed an outer rival soon after the start, dueled for the lead outside of a foe while kept in the three path
around the turn by that rival, then weakened in the four path and between horses at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SHE'S JERSEY TUFF stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, briefly failed to keep pace entering the lane, yet sustained
a chase thereafter, began to close in once more in the final furlong, bid in the final sixteenth, and edged clear. KEEP LEFT vied for the lead two wide, led
into the turn, showed the way in the two path around the bend as an outer rival pressed, inched clear entering the lane, maintained a margin through
midstretch, but met her outer counterpart's re-challenge a sixteenth from home, and was bested late. HIGHER NOTE vied for the lead along the inside,
rated back to stalk entering the turn, then only managed to chase along the rail through the lane. CORONA DEL MAR chased the leader from the three
path, but gave way while hanging on her left lead. SWEETASBAILY was coaxed along while racing off of the pace and in the two path into the turn, shifted
out to the five path in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. MARIA GONE WILD broke slowly, trailed around the bend, and never got involved. LITTLE FAIRY
broke a step slow and brushed the outer part of the gate at the start, then lacked speed in the four to five path around the turn, and faded.

CARNELIAN bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked the clear leader from the three path, took aim outside of her in upper stretch, but drifted out at
the three sixteenths pole, corrected and sustained a bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. ONE MORE LAUGH set a clear pace in the two path, held
sway through upper stretch, but met a rival's bid at the furlong grounds, and was bested entering the final sixteenth. CHROME RACER raced at the rear two
to three wide, then rallied between horses to gain show at the furlong grounds. JACKIE FLASH lacked speed in the five path, and ran on while one paced
through the lane. TERRANOVA tracked in the four path, but yielded between horses in the final furlong. WAR ENSIGN bumped an outer rival at the start,
raced at the rear along the inside, and made little impact. BALI DOVE (FR) tracked along the inside, but faded. DUXONTHEPOND laid off of the pace two

Footnotes
ROYAL TAKE CHARGE stalked outside of the pace setter, inched closer to press into the far turn, ranged up to vie entering the lane sparking a duel,
battled determinedly through the lane, wrestled an advantage in the final furlong, and edged away in the final sixteenth. NON VIOLENCE set the pace while
in hand around the first turn, showed the way around the far turn as an outer foe applied pressure, met that foe's bid entering the lane, dueled while gamely
clinging to an advantage through midstretch, but was headed in the final furlong, and gave in a sixteenth from home. ZING trailed along the inside, improved
inside of rivals into the far turn, gained show from a tiring foe at the quarter pole, and evened out without threatening the leading pair. CHAMPAGNE
AFFAIR bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three path, but faded in the four to five path around the far turn. FINE COTTON got rank
entering the first turn, stalked behind the leader while pulling in the bit, chased the top pair from the three path around the far turn, but weakened entering
the lane. JUDY'S WAY bumped an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path, trailed in the five path around the far turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BASALT STREET tracked two wide and between horses, pursued from the three path around the turn, tipped outside of the leading trio leaving the quarter
pole, rallied with a clear LAKE MARIE to catch in the final furlong, surged up to her nearing the wire, and prevailed at it. LAKE MARIE broke outwardly, set
the pace in the two path, inched clear entering the lane, held sway into deep stretch, but got nailed at the wire. BOX OF PICTURES stalked along the inside,
was pocketed around the turn, gained place from an outer rival entering the lane as the leader kicked clear, took aim outside of that one approaching the
final furlong, but was outkicked for place while chasing the leader home. SHE'S GONE D'WILD took slight contact from rivals on either side at the start,
lagged behind around the turn, came into the lane in the four path, and moved up between horses while hanging on her left lead. G'S SQUEEZE broke a
step slowly at the start, tracked in the four path while outside of the top pair, but yielded between horses in midstretch. IRONIT was brushed by rivals on
either start, lacked speed in the four to five paths, and gave way. HALF KOO KOO pressed the leader from the outside, chased in the three path around the
turn, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
UPHOLD THE LAW bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the pace setter, pressed around the turn, bid entering the lane, dueled
through upper stretch while neck-neck with the early pace setter, forged an advantage at the furlong pole, inched clear a sixteenth from home, and kept an
outer bidder at bay. OMAHA RED stalked three wide, chased the top pair while not progressing through upper stretch, began to close in nearing the final
sixteenth as the new leader edged away, sustained a grinding charge in hopes of producing a late bid, but did not have enough. HIGHER STANDARD set
the pace along the inside, felt pressure from an outer rival around the turn, dueled with that foe entering the lane, sparred gamely through upper stretch, but
was headed at the furlong grounds, and yielded at the sixteenth pole. BROKEN RIB settled far back in the two path, and moved up between horses in
midstretch. AWE SHACKLE laid off of the pace in the four path, and failed to factor. RUSSIAN TANK bumped with an inner rival at the start, trailed two
wide, and was outrun. HUNTER JOHN stalked along the inside while tugging under a firm hold early on, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
GIRL NAMED CHARLIE bobbled and bumped an outer rival at the start, then took back when put to tight quarters between horses soon after, settled far
back along the inside, pursued in hand in the four path around the far turn, moved forward between horses entering the lane, but encountered a wall of
traffic while taking a brush from an outer rival leaving the quarter pole, shifted in for clear sailing in upper stretch, offered a good kick to surge past the
leaders at the furlong grounds, and was driven home to seal the deal. JUST SAY SO settled off of the pace three wide, then five wide around the far turn,
floated to the seven path entering the lane, rallied in the final furlong while lugging in slightly, yet sustained her charge to bid for place late, and narrowly
prevailed. BEST PERFORMER tracked three wide, got floated to the five path at the quarter pole while producing a bid, but was outkicked by an inner rival
at the three sixteenths pole, chased that rival through the final furlong, but was caught at the wire for place. DON'T GO CHANGING broke a step slowly
before taking a bump from an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three path, moved out of last six wide around the far turn, shifted out to the eight path in
upper stretch, and moved up late. PAINT ME PERFECT tracked in the two path, shifted four wide into t he far turn, came into the lane in the six path, leaned
inwardly leaving the quarter pole to shut the door on an inner rallying rival, then lacked a kick himself thereafter. AUDACIOUSNESS stalked two wide, bid
for the lead while floated to the four path and between horses at the quarter pole, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides in upper stretch, and faltered
coming to the furlong grounds. LA PERLA NERA saved ground off of the pace, but failed to respond to urging around the far turn, and faded. GOLDEN
STAR severely resisted restraint while showing the way through the lane for the first time, pulled away to a clear margin around the first turn, shifted out as a
pair of rivals bid entering the lane, and was swallowed up between horses at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
RISKTAKER vied for the lead two wide and between horses, then inside of a trio of rivals after an inner foe faltered into the turn, shook clear entering the
lane, and held sway. MR. CROMWELL tracked in the five path, gained place at the three sixteenths pole, and was second best. MINE YOUR BIZ broke in
and bumped a rival at the start, lacked speed in the three path, then stayed on in the six path. PARTY LITTLE BOY bumped an outer rival at the start,
rushed to vie for the lead five to four wide into the turn, but failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart entering the lane, lugged in while flopping
back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and weakened. IRON FORTUNE was bumped and crowded by rivals on both sides at the start, raced far back
along the inside, and improved along the fence. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY vied for the lead four to three wide and among foes, but gave way turning for home.
LIT A SHUCK sparred for the lead briefly inside of a host of rivals, but faded entering the turn. LANDRY AND LUCAS bumped with an outer rival at the start,
dueled three to two wide and between horses, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. OAK HILL MO broke in and bumped a foe at the start, and got
outrun.
