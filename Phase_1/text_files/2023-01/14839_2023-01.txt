Footnotes
BRI was placed off the pace on the inside to the first turn then cut the corner to take the lead around the first turn, slowly pulled away and proved best.
LUMBERJACK EMPIRE stalked the pace into the first turn then moved up from three wide entering the backstretch, steadily advanced through the final turn
but was no match for the winner. I LOVE YOU MORE was forwardly place from three wide into the first turn then settled in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch, saved ground around the final turn and improved her position in the stretch. VANCOUVER SNOW was unhurried around the first turn and down
the backstretch, made a three wide at the three sixteenths pole and passed tiring rival in the drive. SARATOGA KAREN was rushed up to take a brief lead
before heading into the first turn then pressed the pace to the three eighths pole and tired. MISS WOW WOW was allowed to settle near the back around
the first turn then moved out to three wide around the three eighths pole but didn't make a serious bid while racing evenly. ANIME DAY was close up on the
leaders from the two path going into the first turn then retreated.

Footnotes
SARCASTIC TONE was rushed to contention to the first turn then tracked the leader to the quarter pole and took over at the three sixteenths pole and drew
clear. CORVETTE SPIRIT broke well and went straight to a clear lead, was engaged at the three sixteenths pole but couldn't match strides but was able to
hold on for the place. MEDITATE was forwardly placed in the two path down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn for a late run and missed
the place. OUTLAW X. stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch then moved out to four wide at the quarter pole for a late run but came up
empty in the drive. DEALIN' STELEN was allowed to settle to around the first turn then made a three wide bid at the three eighths pole and improved his
position. HOLDING FAST was within striking distance on the inside to the final turn and gave way but finished evenly. HUMPHREY was restless in the gate
then raced near the back around the first turn then moved up on the backstretch and flattened out. GREELEY'S DEALER raced in the middle of the pack
while saving ground but was not a threat. SUMMER APPEAL was never close.

JAZZY JUSTIN vied for the lead from the two path to the top of the stretch, dueled and wore down the leader to be up in the final strides. CRIMSON
STORM sprinted to the lead from under pressure on the inside then had a stretch duel and gave way grudgingly. CLEAR HUMOR raced in the middle of the
pack to the final turn then moved out four to five wide in upper stretch for a late run to be up for the show. LOVETHATCAUSE was within striking distance to
the final turn then moved out to three wide to make a run at the leaders but lacked the late response needed. FAR BEYOND bobbled at the start then was
allowed to settle to the final turn, moved out five to six wide into upper stretch to make a late gain but was too late. HOSTILE AFLEET was unhurried around
the first turn then made a rail bid at the three eighths pole and faltered. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE settled in the middle of the pack but was not a threat.

a late run to be up in the final jumps. ABBEY CAKES was hustled along then went five wide into the first turn, pressed the pace from three wide to the
quarter pole then made a late kick to be second best. BROADWAY PEARL broke well and went to a clear lead then pulled away on the final turn and tired in
the stretch. CREEK RAIN saved ground while racing near the back then moved between horses at the three eighths pole, moved out five to six wide in
upper stretch to be the best of the rest. PAYNT THE MOON was six wide into the first turn while racing near the back around the first turn then made a
middle move on the backstretch, going three wide around the final turn and improved her position. SUNNY AND CLEAR raced in the middle of the pack
around the first turn, moved between horses at the half pole to be off the pace on the backstretch but gave way in the final turn. GRACE'S SOLDIER was
brushed by BIG TOUCH at the start, pressed the pace around the first turn then dropped back. BIG TOUCH broke in and brushed GRACE'S SOLDIER at
the start, tracked the leader from three to four wide to the three eighths pole and weakened. PINCHING PENNIES saved ground but was never involved.
