Footnotes
THUNDER BUGGY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to led the field on the inside up the backstretch, inched clear while saving ground around
the turn and drew off in upper stretch. MAGICGIRL raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, began a bid from the three path coming around the
bend and gained ground late. MELANCHOLY BLUES pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and chased
on to the wire. WHISKARITA raced off the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and improved
position mildly in the lane. KERIK raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and made no bid. AUBURN
chased the leaders up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the turn and tired further in the stretch. SIMONELA raced in
the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ISLE OF SKYE broke sharply, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, kicked clear in the stretch and held that
margin to the wire. RISK VS REWARD bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and chased the winner home in the stretch. WINTER'S GHOST bumped with the
horses to both sides at the break, trailed the field early, saved ground around the bend, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position to the
finish. SHANGHAI WARRIOR chased the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and faded in the lane.
CONFIDENT N ELITE bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the
turn from the three and four path and finished evenly while never threatening. PAPA JIMMY bumped repeatedly with the horse to his outside leaving the
gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. DON H was reluctant to load, broke well and raced off the
pace on the outside early, continued around the turn in the three path and was empty in the lane.

took the lead outright while racing on the rail around the far turn and held that margin to the wire. OKLETSGO saved ground around the first turn, continued
up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, began a bid from the two path coming around the second bend and gained ground late. IMAGOODFELLA
saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and kept on from there.
SUMMER ALL YEAR brushed mildly with the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to duel from the two path through the opening half mile, navigated
the far turn from the three path and weakened in the lane. COCO SHELL raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace between horses for
the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and showed no kick. CESAR raced in the two path early, stalked the pace setters on
the outside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the three path and faded in the stretch. GODS GLORY raced off the pace on the
outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and flattened out in the lane.

of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, was in minor traffic headed into the turn, continued around the bend in the three path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and gained ground mildly through the final furlong. ANNA'S IMAGE raced at the pack of the pack on the inside in the early
going, saved ground around the turn and made a mild improvement of position in the lane. WIFEY MATERIAL hopped up and was pinched back leaving the
gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. SARA KALI
bumped lightly with an outside horse at the break, recovered to chase the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two

at the wire. GAMBLING TZAR raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far bend, began a
bid nearing the quarter pole, bumped with MOON MISCHIEF in midstretch and dueled on to the finish, just missing. MOON MISCHIEF raced in the three
