Footnotes
SCANDALISSIMO stalked the dueling leaders three wide, led midway on the turn and pulled away under moderate urging. SHADOW CHASER vied inside
rivals, proved no match for the winner but lasted for the place. SHADOW BAY settled inside the pacesetters, moved wide on the turn and closed well late.
PAGETT led well off the inside early, vied in the two path and weakened. PER KEY D P lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention.
BEFRIENDTHEENEMY was squeezed back soon after the start and trailed badly throughout.

Footnotes
CRAFTY DON led along the inside, vied to midstretch, was placed in tight in the stretch but came again and drew clear. TANKINATOR dueled outside,
drifted in stretch crowding foe then steadied slightly while tiring. HORSE BE WITH YOU settled off the leaders three wide and continued willingly. MUSK
raced off the pace between foes and came up empty in the stretch. HOMETOWN HERO saved ground within striking range and retreated on the turn. ANTE
UP ALEX dropped well behind wide and was never a factor. MISCHIEVOUS JONES was shuffled back near the half mile pole and gave way readily. A
claim of foul by the runnerup against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

kept clear under urging. CAN'T COMPLAIN stalked the pacesetter, chased on the turn, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, rallied inside in the stretch drive
and came up second best. MISS CINNAMON raced off the pace, angled out, rallied mildly outside and was along for the show spot. MAP OF LIFE raced off
the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and lacked a rally. LADY SICARIA stalked the pace, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
BUFFALO SHUFFLE pursued the loose pacesetter, took over midway on the turn then drew away eagerly through the stretch. GUSHING OIL lacked speed
then closed strongly to get up for the place. ONE SLICK START chased off the pace outside and continued well in the stretch. SPLITZVILLE dropped back
inside then passed rivals without menacing. LOAD UP MOE dropped back early and rallied past rivals in the stretch while no threat. GOLDENLINEOF
chased wide, his rider lost his helmet near the quarter pole and continued well. CAPE MAY STYLE raced far back inside and was never in contention.
CALCULATED BREEZE quickly sprinted clear, was collared midway on the turn and gave way. HOPE FOR GOLD settled off the pace three wide, made a
brief bid on the turn then stopped. ILOVECHARLYBROWN dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WEEKEND IN COURT was outrun early, advanced on the far turn, split rivals at the quarter pole, rallied, angled in at the eighth pole, closed willingly inside
and was up late for the win. SOMEBODY pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with SON OF A SAINT,
battled heads apart with that rival in in midstretch, dug in gamely and earned the place spot. SON OF A SAINT set the pace racing with a clear early lead,
showed the way, dueled inside on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and yielded late. NIGHT OPS raced four wide on the first turn, stalked four
wide, chased three wide on the far turn, lacked a bid and finished evenly. LONG GRAY LINE raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and
gained mildly inside. MASTER OF WAR tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. RONIN WARRIOR stalked three wide, chased
between rivals on the far turn and faded. CALL FITZROY raced two wide off the pace, chased four wide on the far turn and gave way.
