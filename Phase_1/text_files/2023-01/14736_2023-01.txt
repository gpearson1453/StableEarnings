Footnotes
HIGH VALUE TARGET set the pace, shifted to the three path entering the backstretch, showed the way from a sternly pressing foe turning for home,
shrugged off that rival entering the lane, and held sway. STAR'S DREAM shifted outside of the pace setter to stalk two wide nearing the backstretch, applied
pressure from the four path approaching the far turn, attempted a bid turning for home, but was turned away entering the lane, and kept on to prove second
best. ZEEROCK raced far back two wide, shifted three wide entering the lane, and surpassed inner rivals in upper stretch before drifting in and flattening
out. I DONT KNOW EITHER tracked in the three path, chased two wide around the far turn, and faded. CRAFTY PRINCESS saved ground off of the pace,
vied for show inside of a rival around the far turn, but tired. KAITLYN'S COURT broke slowly and got outrun. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS
OMITTED AND IS PENDING REVIEW

Footnotes
SONO bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace inside of a vying rival, inched clear turning for home, then drew off under driving pressure while
steadily drifting out through the final furlong. COMPUTERIZED was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start before taking back from crowded quarters,
lagged behind into the turn, picked up stride entering the lane, rallied two wide in upper stretch, then sustained an inside charge to reach place at the wire.
BUCK DOLL TAYLOR chased the top pair from the three path, wandered about through upper stretch before gaining place inside the final furlong, but tired
late, and got caught at the wire. MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT pursued from midpack two wide and between horses around the turn, then was outkicked for minor
placings while lacking a bid. ALL TOGETHER was restless in the starting gates awaiting the off, then took bumps from rivals on both sides when they
sprung, raced far back in the two path, swung to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally on her left lead. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE prompted the
pace setter from the outside, but proved no match entering the lane, and stopped. HENNY'S TURN leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, then saved
ground off of the pace, but weakened. CARROLL CREEK broke a bit outwardly, lacked speed three wide, and faded while fanning to the seven path
entering the lane.

SERIOUSLY SAM set the pace inside of a pressing foe while in the three path, drew away turning for home, widened under moderate urging through
midstretch, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. THE CALLING STONE tracked along the inside, gained place entering the lane, and failed to
threaten the leader thereafter. AVIE J pressed outside of the leader and from the four path, required urging to sustain pressure around the turn, but
weakened nearing the lane, and was eased through the final furlong.

place in upper stretch as the leader kicked away, and ran on to prove second best. CARSON'S PRINCESS bumped an inner rival at the start, set the pace
inside of a pair of forward foes, got headed by the eventual winner into the far turn, battled for place entering the lane, got outkicked at the three sixteenths
pole, yet pulled away from rest in the final furlong. WHATS UP SWEETS was off slow while breaking a bit out, tugged forward to a two wide tracking
position, split foes to bid for place among rivals entering the lane, but yielded after being outkicked in upper stretch. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE tracked
around the turn and faded around the far turn. ANGEL OF VERDUN stalked the top pair from the four path, then weakened between horses in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ LIGHT THE WAY tracked along the inside, pursued the tiring clear leader from the three path around the far turn, took aim on him from the four path
entering the lane, then kicked past at the furlong grounds, and drew clear. ONE TIME GEM stalked two wide, got outmoved by an inner rival down the
backstretch, chased under urging in the five path around the far turn, then ran on while hanging on his left lead to gain place in the final sixteenth. PAYDAY
TOO broke a step slow at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, sustained a rail grind to bid for minor placings in the final furlong, and leveled off.
TRIVISTA lagged behind the field around both turns, swung from the three path to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. ROCKDALE
sped to the fore into the first turn, but ran off nearing the backstretch, opened up a wide margin, but tired turning for home as his margin diminished, got
overhauled by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds, and weakened. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG lacked speed two wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
FLINT RIDGE set the pace two wide and between horses early on, inched away from those rivals entering the turn, showed the way in hand while in the
three path around the bend, then drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch, and was put to wraps in the closing stages. ONCOMING TRAIN pressed
three wide, chased the leader from the four path while between horses around the turn, lost place to those rivals turning for home, yet sustained stride in
upper stretch, regained place at the furlong grounds, and ran on. MORNING CUP tracked four wide while taking the turn in the five path, claimed place at
the five sixteenths pole, but tired approaching midstretch, and lost that position to an inner rival at the furlong grounds. COURTHOUSE COVE prompted the
pace along the inside, chased the clear leader into the turn, but lacked a kick while hanging on his left lead through upper stretch, and gave way after
changing over at the furlong grounds. SCHMOOZIN rated at the rear two wide, and moved up between horses through the lane. ARABIAN PRINCE laid off
of the pace in the four path, altered course to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. MULTI PLATINUM pursued from midpack two wide, shifted
from the three path to the five path turning for home, but failed to change leads, and weakened in upper stretch. FRENCH COMPOSER was outrun along
the inside.

STRAIGHT ANSWER (GB) settled off of the pace two wide, tracked in the four path around the far turn, floated to the eight path while ranging up entering
the lane, sustained a bid in the ten path at the three sixteenths pole, drove clear at the furlong grounds, met an outer rival's challenge late, and just lasted.
RISING EMPIRE hopped severely and spotted the leaders many lengths at the start, trailed, gained in the four to five path around the far turn, floated to the
nine path entering the lane, fanned to the eleven path in upper stretch, surged down the outside fence through the final sixteenth, but just ran out of ground
to reel in the leader. BIZZEE CHANNEL set the pace in the two wide, shook free down the backstretch, was guided out to the five path entering the lane to
deter outer bidder, drifted further out while meeting bids in upper stretch, got outkicked leaving the three sixteenths pole, yet held show through the final
furlong. NEW YEAR SURPRISE pulled to a three wide tracking position nearing the backstretch, gained place into the far turn, but was floated out to the
seven path by the leader entering the lane, got outkicked by an outer rival while in the nine path in upper stretch and chased evenly. ARTIE'S RUMOR
stalked two wide, tucked entering the backstretch, tipped back outside of the leader nearing the lane, but was floated to the six path and between horses
while attempting a bid at the quarter pole, checked once floated further out in upper stretch, and chased thereafter. UNINVITED GUEST pressed the leader
from the outside, but failed to keep pace with nine sixteenths to go, chased between horses around the far turn, but faded turning for home. MY BARILEY
laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed nearing the far turn, and failed to factor. SURFER DUDE saved ground while tracking, but weakened in upper
stretch before being eased.

Footnotes
DIXIE STREET bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked three wide, grinded away on his left lead in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds, and
kicked clear. YOUNG TUSCAN set the pace along the inside, shook free entering the lane, but was outkicked by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds,
and saved place late. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT raced forwardly outside of the pace setter while inside of a pair of foes into the turn, then chased two wide while
hanging on his left lead, sustained a bid for place late, but missed. CRYPTOZONIC saved ground off of the pace, but lacked a punch. RECKLESS
RANSOM settled off of the pace in the two path, swung seven wide in upper stretch, and moved up late. SECRET VISTA bumped with an outer rival at the
start, pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses around the turn, then lacked a bid. ALTERANA bumped with an inner rival at the start,
tracked four wide, then chased before yielding. GOLDEN PALACE bumped an inner rival at the start, pursued form midpack five wide and outside of rivals,
and failed to factor. MY AMIGO CHARLIE bobbled slightly at the start, and got outrun.
