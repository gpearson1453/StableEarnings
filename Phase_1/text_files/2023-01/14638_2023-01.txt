Footnotes
RUNYONESQUE , three wide the first turn, advanced three deep leaving the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and drew off under urging. PUDGE
BOY PALACE disputed the pace outside ITS OVER and gradually weakened through the stretch run. WONDER WATER , three wide entering the first tur,
drifted in mid way on the bend, stalked the pace, saved ground the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. ITS OVER hugged the inner
rail, disputed the pace to the stretch and gave way. GOD IS LOVE raced well off the inner rail throughout and was not a factor. BALTIMORE BULLEIT ,
always outside horses, was outrun. SPIRITUAL GHOST was taken up in tight quarters along the inner rail mid way on the first turn. NOTION TO TAPIT was
steadied on the heels of WONDER WATER mid way on the first turn. Objections by the riders of SPIRITUAL GHOST and NOTION TO TAPIT against
WONDER WATER for alleged interference on the first turn were not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run around the first turn but no
action was taken.

Footnotes
ALBERTANO drafted back from between runners early on then settled well back, picked up momentum mid turn and advanced between rivals soon after,
shifted out four wide for a clear run soon into the lane, rallied under left handed asking and poked a head in front with a sixteenth remaining, dueled outside
ANTIPOISON and was fully extended to prevail. ANTIPOISON rated closest to the well clear leader early on, steadily advanced three wide nearing the lane,
altered in and moved up to command in mid stretch, was overtaken by the winner near the sixteenth pole, battled gamely from there and just missed.
SHOOT THEMESSENGER , four and three wide between rivals, edged up past the three eighths, had aim under asking nearing mid stretch, raced on his
left lead and came up empty late. OFF THE MEDS , off the pace and off the inside, angled five wide for the drive, moved up past the sixteenth pole, was
floated out a bit and churned on. FREE SQUARE , keen leaving the chute, opened up a lengthy advantage while two wide, saw his lead dwindle soon into
the lane, failed to contain ANTIPOISON past the three sixteenths, drifted out some and gave way. OTHER THINGS EQUAL , two wide and to the inside of
runners leaving the far turn, was pushed along mid turn, failed to kick on and faded. MIRACLE SILVER , shoved on from the gate, dropped in towards the
rail and raced off the pace, lacked a kick around the turn and faded. CAMP PENDLETON , five wide outside rivals early, continued well wide mid turn, failed
to go on nearing the lane and dropped back. TOMMY SHELBY saved ground and gave way.

Footnotes
GENERAL NOOZ , sent to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, floated to the two path entering the stretch, remained on his left lead and dug in
determinedly to prevail. CAPTAIN CREED chased the winner, bid for the lead entering the stretch and was out finished. QUICK QUICK WHIT bumped with
OROCOVIX at the break, circled the turn, was four wide turning for home, had aim on the lead and hung. TERMSOFENGAGEMENT raced along the inner
rail chasing the pace around the turn then weakened in the drive. MARGIE'S FUN SON lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and passed
tired ones. COLLECT REDEMPTION bumped with OROCOVIX soon after the break, saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and
lacked a rally. CODE OF KINGS was outrun. OROCOVIX bumped with QUICK QUICK WHIT at the break, bumped with COLLECT REDEMPTION soon
after the break, circled the turn three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EKATI'S VERVE moved up to the inside of an embattled trio past the three quarter pole, vied to the half, rated back off rivals and gave up a couple lengths
around the far turn, angled out with three furlongs remaining and found more to make a four wide run to re engage into the lane, spurted clear under a drive
in mid stretch, wandered outward from there and dug in gamely to fend off EXCALIBUR. EXCALIBUR found a nice stalking trip behind the quarter of
leaders, came under pressure leaving the far turn, angled out and moved up five wide into the lane, ranged up outside the winner past mid stretch, was
floated out some late, switched over to his left lead and missed in a gritty try. MAMAIGOTTHIS , pinched back at the break, regrouped and settled well back,
advanced inside and under asking past the three eighths, shifted out some and churned on with interest. UNIDENTIFIED MAN , hung out four wide outside
rivals and contesting the pace, dropped in a path while dueling three deep past the three eighths, held a slim advantage into the lane, shifted in and faded
through the final sixteenth. MINECRAFTER , used hard three wide and between foes, disputed the pace to the quarter pole and gave way. BAPTIZE THE
BOY , two wide between runners attending the pace, fought on to the inside of a pair of rivals past the three eighths, failed to kick on near the quarter pole
and retreated. TRIPLE JEOPARDY came out at the break tightening a rival, raced well wide, faltered around the final turn and was eased through the
stretch.

Footnotes
DULCE KIARA made the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, was under urging in mid stretch and readily drew out.
UTTERLY ENCHANTING saved ground on the turn, drifted to the three path turning for home and rallied inside horses. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL , four deep
on the turn, fanned five wide entering the stretch and flattened out. FORTES prompted the pace outside the winner, raced between horses entering the
stretch and weakened. MY BOSS LADY , four deep leaving the turn, angled wider in upper stretch and came up empty. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , taken to
the inner rail shortly after the start, remained inside horses and failed to rally. CONGRESS HALL hugged the inner rail on the turn and in the stretch and
weakened. LIGHTFOOT MISS was no factor. HAD THE NOTION , outrun, five wide on the turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch. EIFS , three wide
chasing the pace for a half mile, faltered and was eased.

SHAFT'S BULLET edged up early and relaxed nicely about five wide, had a duel develop in front of him after a half mile, responded to coaxing and steadily
progressed past the three eighths, bid five wide outside runners soon into the lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, dug in when challenged from
his inside by FRIGHTLAND through the final sixteenth and proved resolute under right handed encouragement. FRIGHTLAND dropped in after a quarter
mile and took to rating, edged up behind rivals nearing the lane, awaited room from the quarter to the three sixteenths, found a seam to advance through in
mid stretch, bid inside the winner a sixteenth out, fought gamely but was kept at bay. TATE settled off the pace and off the inside, lost ground four to five
wide when making some headway mid turn, swung seven wide for the drive and closed steadily. JARDANI , unhurried early, gained four wide into the
stretch, continued progress inside a rival nearing the eighth pole, altered sharply towards the inside and kept on with good energy. GALLANT GOLD rated
forwardly, came four wide for the drive, had aim pursuing past the quarter pole but lacked a solid finish. MAGIC MULE , under a snug hold early, moved up
and bid three deep heading to the turn, sparred to about the three sixteenths and faded. ELUSIVE AGENT rated towards the inside, eased out with some
run mid turn, swung six wide and to the inside of TATE entering the lane, kept on to about mid stretch, failed to sustain and faded. SEA GHOST , urged

GERRYS GEM was hustled a bit from the gate and quickly opened up, took to rating heading to the turn, responded when shaken up two wide entering the
lane, kept on under solid asking past mid stretch and held firm to the wire. SUPREME LAW , taken to rate off the loose leader, moved up three wide to have
aim entering the lane, gave valiant chase from there but had to settle for second. ZEN MASTER bobbled slightly at the break, regrouped and found himself
well back into the turn, was pushed along while saving ground past the three eighths, eased out through the drive and continued on with interest while
garnering the show. ROCK THE BOAT saved ground and edged up a bit past the five sixteenths, swung out four wide entering the lane, lacked a punch in
mid stretch and faded. MONSTER MASON failed to menace. BOMBOLONI veered out at the break and was away last, corrected and was used four wide
nearing the turn, chased to mid turn then gave way.
