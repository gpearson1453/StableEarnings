WORLD PARTY , unhurried early, advanced inside leaving the three eighths, swung four wide into the lane, closed in under strong handling and joined
VIKING QUEEN from her outside in mid stretch, switched over to her left lead when floated out a bit near the sixteenth pole, sustained to take command in
deep stretch and proved best. VIKING QUEEN exchanged a bumped with a rival when rank soon after the break, continued to be rank and steadied while
four wide through the opening three sixteenths, settled past the five eighths then progressed into the far turn, bid three deep past the five sixteenths, dueled
into the stretch, took over while under a drive past the three sixteenths, wandered outward a bit when clinging to command a sixteenth out, straightened and
kept on gamely while just not quite good enough. RED QUEEN rated in the two path, edged up leaving the far turn, bid between foes to take command
nearing the quarter pole, battled inside VIKING QUEEN past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. IMAGINE THE MOJO , three wide between
rivals through the backstretch turn, chased past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide and faded. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE , bumped early, moved clear past
the seven eighths, dropped in and opened up, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by foes leaving the five sixteenths then weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WELLING settled off the early pace three to four wide, was scrubbed upon leaving the far turn, dropped in towards the rail past the five sixteenths while
starting a run, continued a rail advance and took command past mid stretch, kicked clear under a drive nearing the sixteenth pole and widened from there.
MUCHACHO MACHO prompted the pace three wide, took closer order leaving the far turn when put to asking, gave hard chase then reeled in the leader
past the three sixteenths, dueled on near even terms leaving the eighth pole, failed to contain the winner and had enough left to save the place.
MONYINTHEBANKSEY drew clear early and set a rated pace, came under a ride two wide into the lane, dug in when collared, battled past mid stretch then
gave way grudgingly. HOT N SPICY LOVE stalked the pace while about four wide, edged up into the far turn, was under a hearty ride soon after, gave futile
chase three to four wide approaching the stretch, failed to kick on from there and dropped back. POCO CHARLIE , off the pace while saving ground, failed
to rally. SHOULDA HAD IT saved ground, made some headway into the far turn, failed to go on as the pace picked up and gave way. WHIRLIN CURLIN ,
off slow when lunging, raced three wide early, lacked a kick past the half mild marker and faltered.

FIND FAITH quickly went clear then angled down a few paths, set a rated pace off the inside, responded when put to some hand urging entering the stretch
and eagerly opened up, was kept alert with one right handed ask near the sixteenth pole then cruised home in hand the final yards. YOUR ANALYSIS ,
taken to rate, worked his way three wide between runners approaching the stretch, gave game chase from there and held down the place. CELTIC
COUSEN rated off the inside early on, dropped in around the turn then was caught behind rivals past the five sixteenths, came back out to advance
between foes near mid stretch, shifted in and finished up with good energy. THE GREAT GAZOO chased inside, stayed on willingly to about the sixteenth
marker then faded. SURPRISE HELLO prompted the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on under pressure entering the lane and gave way. OPEN THE
BOOKS was lightly steadied back from rivals leaving the chute, angled out four to five wide making some progress heading to the stretch but failed to
sustain. DOMINGUEZ , brushed at the break, raced four then three wide pursuing, stayed on to about the quarter pole then gave way. NOT AS LUCKY AS
US , brushed at the break, was outrun. ORIGINALIST saved ground, was lightly steadied nearing the turn and gave way. UNION LEAGUE , three wide early
stalking the pace, was under pressure between rivals mid turn, faltered in upper stretch then was eased through the final yards.

Footnotes
UP AGAINST IT stalked the pace in the two path down the backstretch, eased out three wide near the three eighths pole, closed determinedly outside
FROSTED INDIAN in the stretch run and was up late. FROSTED INDIAN , sent into contention soon after the break, disputed the pace outside
FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY, sprinted clear mid way on the far turn and gave way grudgingly in a sharp effort. THORNY TALE , unhurried inside horses down
the backstretch, swung four wide turning for home, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and weakened late. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) lacked speed, was four
deep on the far turn and passed tired horses. BOBBY G , no factor, was four wide leaving the far turn and passed tired rivals. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY
raced along the inner rail, dueled to mid way on the far turn and faltered. CRUSH IT , four wide the first turn, was no factor and raced along the inner rail on
the far turn. BATTALION ran off with his rider about three furlongs during the post parade, raced in three path on the both turns, chased the pace and tired.

Footnotes
BLAME THE BOURBON sprinted clear early and dropped in to set a rated pace towards the rail, had rivals close in a bit past the five sixteenths, opened
back up after being put to solid hand pressure, was kept alert with a right handed ask near the sixteenth pole and held firm. DART , bumped and pinched
back at the break, advanced three to four wide to take aim past the five sixteenths, saw the leader kick away in upper stretch but stayed on well to hold
down the place. SMART AND FAST , off the rail early, saved ground mid turn, eased back out to progress between runners leaving the three sixteenths,
shifted out for the final furlong and churned on. DREAMS DELIVERED , three wide pursuing past the three eighths, shifted out four wide for the drive but
lacked a serious response. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE came out at the break tightening rivals, chased between runners mid turn and weakened. I ONCE
STOOD ALONE saved ground with some early pursuit, was shuffled back entering the turn, dropped back to last, swung well wide but failed to make
significant headway. HOPE HE'S FAST , pinched back at the break, was sent up between foes nearing the turn then angled in, chased to the head of the
lane then faltered.
