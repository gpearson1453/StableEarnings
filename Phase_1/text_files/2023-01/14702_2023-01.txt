Footnotes
DANCING SOPHIA moved off the rail early then settled off the pace, pursued the leader in the two path for most of the turn, shifted four wide inside the
five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid coming to the quarter-pole, jostled with BRISKY FROLIC while carried six wide into upper stretch, gained the lead
before the three-sixteenths, responded well into the final furlong, drifted out late and held under strong urging. RUN DEVIL was hustled from the start,
tracked the pace on the outside, came under urging outside the half-mile pole, went three then four wide early on the turn, moved to the five path late on
that bend, came seven wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong, made a bid in the middle of the track at the sixteenth-pole but was turned
away and settled for the place. APRIL ANTICS bobbled outward at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths then dropped
back, went five then six wide around the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. BRISKY FROLIC
went to the front then moved clear, extended the advantage near the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide around the turn, was challenged by the
winner outside the quarter-pole, jostled with that foe while floating five wide into upper stretch then lost the advantage, dropped back into the final furlong
and weakened. SYNONYMOUS was last into stride, moved up under urging on the outside, went four then five wide around the turn, dropped to the three
path coming to the quarter-pole and came up empty. IN TRAFFIC settled off the pace, dropped back while saving ground around the turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path and had nothing left.

SCOOTSCOOT broke out at the start bumping WARRIOR RICHARD into STEADY PROGRESS, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. WARRIOR RICHARD broke in at the start and
was bumped by SCOOTSCOOT and in turn bumped STEADY PROGRESS, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. STORMANDY chased three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. STEADY PROGRESS got bumped at the start by
WARRIOR RICHARD due to pressure from SCOOTSCOOT, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped four wide at the top of the
stretch and improved position. SCREEN DOOR hustled from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and weakened. EL GRAN CUYAYA chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper

off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn and went six to seven wide into upper stretch, then trailed throughout when eased
home to the finish well behind the rest.

Footnotes
MY FIRST LOVE stumbled at the start but broke with the field, stalked the pace down the backstretch, issued a challenge in the four path around the turn,
took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear under a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop at the
sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under strong urging. SA FORADADA was hustled from the gate, moved out then was urged along off the pace,
went three wide early on the turn then shifted five wide in pursuit of the leader, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, fought outside of the
runner-up into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. DIAMOND COLLECTOR disputed the pace on the outside then in the three
path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. GAGLIANO was urged along on
the outside, dropped from the four path to the two path around the turn and was no factor. ALPINE QUEEN was hustled from the start, contested the pace
on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path while inside rivals around the turn and faded. RAFFINITY drifted out at the start, tracked the pace on the outside,
dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, went five to six wide around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
KING ANGELO was hustled from the gate, chased the leader on the outside, engaged that foe in the three path around the turn, took the lead in the four
path into upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. TWELTH MAN was urged along off the pace, traveled four wide around the turn, was driven five
wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. MIDLANER was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the inside,
saved ground while making a bid around the turn, pursued the winner in upper stretch and also proved no match then narrowly lost the place while just able
to get the show. HANDSOME CAT was restless in the gate, settled off the pace, was asked while two to three wide around the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and narrowly missed the trifecta. ZERTZ went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was headed by
the winner into upper stretch and gave way. MAGIA NERA was ridden along on the far outside, went six wide around the turn, came eight wide into the
stretch and was no factor. SHIPSATIONAL was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
RYAN'S CAT was urged along off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and capitulated.
