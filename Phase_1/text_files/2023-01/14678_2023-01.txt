Footnotes
ROYAL DRAGOON was fractious in the gate prior to the start, stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch, got through along the rail to make the lead
under right handed urging nearing the furlong marker and edged clear under a strong hand ride. BLOOD MOON away alertly, set the pace while getting
slow fractions until mid stretch then couldn't handle the winner. ZERO GRAVITY moved up three wide before a half, inched closer three wide in upper
stretch then leveled off. BOURBON WISDOM offered a mild bid five wide into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. FAHRENHEIT pressed the pace two
wide until deep stretch then weakened. KRAMDEN failed to menace.

FLECK trailed into the stretch, swung wide, circled her field under right handed urging in the middle of the racetrack and got up in the final strides.
GALILEO'S AFFAIR allowed to settle, closed willingly five wide through the stretch and just missed. TURN TO ME SUCREE set the pace off the rail until
deep stretch then was outfinished. PRANCIPANTS vied for the lead along the inside and went evenly. PAO DE QUEIJO had a brief lead on the first turn,
prompted the pace in the four path and faded in the stretch. TIZ THIRSTY hopped at the start, moved closer outside rivals before a half then failed to
sustain that bid. CASCABRIA close up early, was through after a half.
