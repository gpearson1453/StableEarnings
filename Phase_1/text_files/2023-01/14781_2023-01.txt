Footnotes
THE KHOZAN ONE brushed with an outer foe out of the gate, stalked in the three path, was under right handed urging from the five path turning into the
stretch, ran on and surged between rivals inside the final furlong to get up for the win. LOOKINASSAH rated in the five path, ranged up under rousing
around the far turn and tipped out to the nine path entering the lane, and rallied down the center for place. O GANGSTER tracked in the five path, was
driven from the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. PHOBIA was held up in the four path early, angled inwards around the far turn and was
coaxed from the rail into the lane, and finished evenly. RED'S REVENGE brushed with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, was in
the three path around the far turn, bid from the six path into the stretch, but flattened out inside the final furlong and had to steady late. BLUE MAVERICK
set the pace in the two path, tucked in to the rail around the far turn, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but yielded into the final furlong. VOICE
AN OPINION trailed throughout around the inside.

Footnotes
TEMERITY was unhurried in the three path early, was roused around the turn while being fanned out to the ten path into the stretch, rallied down the center
under right handed urging and nailed the pacesetter on the wire to win. GRACE CANDY set the pace inside, opened up late around the turn and was cued
from the four path into the stretch, responded well and stayed on, began to shorten stride inside the final sixteenth and was caught at the wire by a late
surging outside foe to place. THEODOROPOULOS chased in the five path, tipped out to the seven path around the turn, was driven from the nine path into
the lane, and ran on for show. WILDCAT STAR pressed in the three path, was in the five path in upper stretch, and finished evenly. NYSSA tracked in the
five path, was roused from the six path around the turn and driven from the seven path into the lane, and was one paced. KATZ THAT GAL trailed in the two
path early, was coaxed from said position turning into the stretch, but was no factor. VELOCISSIMA was held up in the three path, was driven from the four
path in upper stretch, and was never a threat. ROSEISALWAYSRITE prompted the early pace in the four path but faded from the six path into the stretch.
INTERESTING GEM stalked in the two path but yielded going into the stretch. SONGTELLER rated along the inside but was no menace.

Footnotes
KIKILOVE stalked in the four path, loomed up from said position around the turn, was cued right handed and bid while floating out to the six path at the top
of the lane, and drew clear. OLGA set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path into the stretch, yielded to the winner into the final furlong,
and held on to place. MISS UCRANIA chased in the three path, was driven from said position into the stretch, evened out passing the eighth pole, drifted
out under left handed urging inside the final furlong and bumped an outer foe while passing her near the sixteenth pole for show. TRIBUTE tracked in the
five path, was ridden from said position into the lane, drifted out going into the final furlong, got bumped by a drifting inner rival passing the sixteenth pole,
and flattened. CARLOTUK rated inside, was urged from the four path into the stretch, but was no factor. PACHANGA LOCA trailed in the five path early and
never threatened. NUCCI pressed the early pace in the two path but was done after a half.

MEGACITY set a rated pace inside and held clear under a drive. OLYMPIC RUNNER tracked the pace three wide and finished willingly for the place.
THERAPIST settled off the early pace while racing two wide, angled in in upper stretch and had a mild rally at the rail. YAMATO raced off the pace two
wide, steadied midway down the backstretch, continued two wide around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and ran on. CARROTHERS broke inwardly,
was forced in and hit the rail not long after, angled out early on the first turn, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. LIGHT FURY
prompted the winner two wide and weakened in the lane. BORDER TOWN steadied along inside through the opening half, continued to save ground around
the far turn and went evenly. SPLIT THE WICKETS played no factor while racing four wide. A ROSE FOR RAVEN saved ground in range, stopped around
the far turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MILLIKEN raced off the pace in the two path, advanced when cued while shifting out around the turn, was in the eight path entering the stretch, and rallied
down the center to split the win. PETULANTE set the pace in the two path, kicked away from an outer foe at the top of the lane and opened slightly in the
four path under right handed urging, and held on to a share of the win. DESERT RULER stumbled at the start, rated along the inside, moved up from the rail
around the turn, tipped out to the two path entering the stretch, and finished evenly. STRONG QUALITY stalked along the inside, took aim under a ride
while floating out to the seven path into the lane, and flattened. MONTAUK POINT chased from the three path into the turn, was driven in the five path into
the stretch, but was tired. TROUBLESHOOTER trailed from the four path into the turn and was no factor. CAUSIN' MAYHEM prompted the pace in the
three path but yielded around the quarter pole. CODE RUNNER was wellback in the six path early and empty in the stretch. ICONIC ADVENTURE tracked
in the four path, began to fade in the six path around the turn, was eased entering the stretch, jogged across the line and walked off.

Footnotes
FRENCH FRANC (FR) raced three wide in midpack, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied while getting in,
took over leaving the eighth pole and inched ahead. DEMOGORGON led inside early, rated back early on the first turn, tipped two wide to stalk under a firm
hold down the backstretch, re-bid two wide around the far turn, led between foes in midstretch and fought on gamely inside of the winner through the final
furlong. ANDIE ONE saved ground off the pace, lacked a clear path in upper stretch, swung four wide near the eighth pole and rallied for the show. SISTER
NELL raced off the pace three wide, made some progress five wide around the far turn but lacked the needed stretch kick. TRUE BLUE PEARL was off
slowly, raced well back two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, made progress between foes in upper stretch, was bumped near the eighth pole
and dropped back. BOSTON PRINCESS was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled in turning for home, hit the rail and bumped
CRICKET WEST squeezing through inside near the eighth pole and dropped back. CRICKET WEST set the pace two wide, battled to midstretch, was
bumped near the eighth pole and faded. C C'S FREEDOM was off a step slow, saved ground and failed to menace. OAXACA stalked the pace three wide,
was bumped near the eighth pole and had no further bids. QUEEN CASHMERE was bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide and was through after
a half.

Footnotes
CONCRETE GLORY set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue to open up along the rail entering the stretch, responded well and held clear.
CARAMEL CHIP brushed with an inner foe early, chased in the five path, was ridden around the turn and in the three path behind a wall of foes entering the
lane, shifted inside passing the eighth pole, and rallied under right handed urging for place. UNCORK THE BOTTLE stalked along the inside, was coaxed
while tipping out to the two path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. STRAIGHT SHOT brushed the outer part of the gate at the start,
tracked in the three path, steadied slightly around the five sixteenths to tip out around the turn, was roused from the four path into the stretch, but flattened.
BOLDNESS prompted the pace from the four path into the turn but yielded from the three path in the stretch. OLD TOWN ROAD trailed from the six path
into the turn and never threatened. MALIBU SECRET brushed with an outer foe early, rated in the three path but was empty from the seven path in the
stretch.
