Footnotes
THUNDER OF ZION tracked the moderate early pace, waited for racing room while along the rail nearing the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch,
assumed command inside of the furlong marker and kept to task in the final stages. UNION GIG forwardly placed in the early going, pressed the moderate
pace to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, could not match strides with THUNDER OF ZION in the final furlong and held safely in the end
for place. NEXT JOURNEY allowed to settle in the early stages, raced along the rail to the quarter marker, angled out inside of the furlong pole, closed well
in deep stretch and was up for show in the final strides. GATOR SHINING broke alertly then took back to the track the pace, raced outside of rivals on the
turn, swung four wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and was just edged for show in the final strides. JUST
WATCH ME NOW showed early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the winner in
mid-stretch and gave way late. BIG STORY chased the moderate pace, raced three wide on the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
COUSIN RICHIE lacked early speed, trailed along the turn, circled the field to go five wide into the drive, closed with a rush inside of the furlong pole while
on the left lead and overtook LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO in deep stretch to prevail. LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO hustled to establish the early lead, set
moderate fractions to the quarter marker, drew clear nearing the furlong marker, felt pressure from COUSIN RICHIE inside of the sixteenth-marker, could
not hold off that quickly oncoming rival and held for place. ALTITUDE chased the early pace, raced between rivals while in pursuit on the turn, was outrun in
upper stretch, re-rallied in the late stages but was outfinished while well clear in the end for third. WOLF'S LIFE forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked
the moderate pace inside of LOOKSGOODONYOUTHO entering the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. HOT ROD
JIMMY close up in the early stages, raced four then three wide on the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. PASSION OF JOE'S
rated off of the moderate early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not factor in the stretch run.

EXCESSIVE CAT broke alertly then took back to press the solid early pace, kept close attendance to DARKSABER while outside of that rival to the quarter
marker, battled to mid-stretch, overtook DARKSABER inside of the sixteenth-marker and determinedly kept to task to prevail. UNCLE WILBUR chased the
solid early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, closed fast in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while getting up
in time to secure place. DARKSABER sent to dispute the early pace, assumed command and set solid fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, held
EXCESSIVE CAT at bay to mid-stretch, stubbornly yielded in deep stretch and was just edged for place. MINOSO crowded a bit at the start but recovered to
be close to the early pace, saved ground while stalking the pace to the quarter pole, ran evenly while within aim to the furlong marker and was outkicked in
the final stages. THIRSTY ALWAYS chased the solid early fractions, raced four wide to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and did not factor in
the drive.

CARSON'S LEGACY tracked the early pace, well placed through moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, roused four wide nearing the top of the lane,
drew to even terms in mid-stretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. SHANAGOLDEN hopped at the start and was off slowly, allowed to settle, mounted
a five wide rally leaving the far turn, closed with good interest in the drive, could not impact the winner in deep stretch but finished well in the end to secure
the place. TIGER'S ARROW forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate pace to the second turn, made a steady advance nearing the
quarter marker, continued that bid to mid-stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, was outkicked in the final stages and held safely for show.
AFRICAN PRINCE unhurried early on, trailed to the quarter marker, was unable to impact the top three in deep stretch but was gaining in the final sixteenth.
MANY AMBITIONS broke alertly and showed good early speed, set a pressured pace along the first turn then disputed the moderate pace with KING ROB
through the second turn, shook free of that rival in upper stretch, battled to the furlong marker and faded in the late going. VIVA LEON JODIDO crowded at
the start by KING ROB and was away slowly, was a bit rank in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn and did not produce a rally in the stretch
run. PICK BYMY FRIEND settled off of the early pace while not far back, advanced nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid in upper stretch, came
within aim in mid-stretch, took up while in tight quarters nearing the sixteenth-marker and gave way in the final stages. KING ROB crowded VIVA LEON
JODIDO at the start, showed early speed and contested the moderate pace, disputed the fractions with MANY AMBITIONS to the quarter marker, lost
ground nearing mid-stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL PROOF broke in good order and set the pace to the turn, well handled while carving moderate fractions to the quarter marker, maintained a clear
lead to mid-stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive at the end to prevail. CIELO DIAMANTE took back off of the early pace,
advanced on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well in the final furlong, put mild pressure on the winner in deep stretch but could not reel in
CRYSTAL PROOF and was second best. MAGICAL LADY away a bit slowly, allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced on the turn, rallied inside of
rivals in upper stretch, raced on the left lead in deep stretch, could not impact the top pair in the final stages but was clear for show in the end. CITY
GLITTER forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace while two deep to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and lacked a
late rally. TAMARA MINE settled in the second flight in the early stages, chased three wide on the turn and offered mild late rally. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU
stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, chased CRYSTAL PROOF to the quarter marker, was outrun nearing the top of the lane and gave way.
SMILIN EVIE chased from the rear early on, dropped back on the turn and was not a factor in the drive.

Footnotes
DIZZY DAZMURA crowded a bit soon after the start, chased from the second flight while along the rail, navigated traffic along the turn, found a seam in
upper stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, took a narrow lead inside of the sixteenth-marker and determinedly prevailed in the final strides.
GRANOLA GIRL bobbled at the start then was shuffled back in the early stages and was unhurried into the turn, trailed to the quarter marker, swung five
wide for the drive, advanced in mid-stretch, closed fast in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while getting up in the final strides for place. RHONDA'S
COOKIN chased the early pace from the second flight, advanced on the turn while between runners, swung three wide for the drive, battled with HANNAH
IN A HURRY to mid-stretch, drifted out in deep stretch, recovered in the late stages but was outfinished in the final strides, while just missing for second.
HANNAH IN A HURRY raced close up to the early pace, pressed the pace three wide to the quarter marker, battled with RHONDA'S COOKIN to
mid-stretch, was outkicked in the late stages and just missed for third. NATALIA chased the moderate early pace, raced four wide on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, came in tight in deep stretch, steadied nearing the sixteenth-marker when RHONDA'S COOKIN drifted out and finished evenly in the late
stages. HEAVEN'S GHOST forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the pace to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and weakened.
FLAPS UP broke alertly, set the early pressured pace, dueled with HEAVEN'S GHOST to the quarter marker, dropped back leaving the turn and tired in the
drive. THERE WAS A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF NATALIA AGAINST THE RIDER OF RHONDA'S COOKIN FOR THE
INCIDENT IN DEEP STRETCH AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER
OF FINISH BASED ON THE INCIDENT.

RAGER took back off of the fast early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, roused in upper stretch, drew to even terms with IRREFUTABLE inside of
the furlong pole, battled with that game rival to deep stretch and determinedly held on for the win over the oncoming runner-up. ULTIMATE BANGO bumped
with HIGHLAND GHOST at the start and was off a step slowly, chased from the rear in the early stages, advanced on the turn, swung four then five wide for
the drive, loomed nearing the furlong pole, chased the top pair to deep stretch, was outfinished in the final strides by RAGER and was up in time to secure
the place. IRREFUTABLE broke alertly and showed speed to dictate terms early on, crowded WAR GAMES a bit nearing the half-mile marker then was
pressed by that rival to the quarter pole, was confronted in mid-stretch, battled gamely to deep stretch and was outfinished in the final strides, while clear of
the rest for third. HIGHLAND GHOST bumped with ULTIMATE BANGO at the start, recovered and tracked the fast pace to the turn, advanced three wide
nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, chased to mid-stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. WAR GAMES prominent in the early
stages, pressed IRREFUTABLE while inside of that rival then came in tight nearing the half-mile marker and took to pressing outside of the pacesetter to the
turn, kept close attendance to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
A DIME FOR ME broke alertly, allowed the pace scenario to play out from a few lengths back, eased towards the leaders with three furlongs to go while
staying in the three or four path, was set down in earnest at the top of the stretch and ran on well despite being on the wrong lead to win going away. DON'T
TELL HYDEE broke well and went immediately for the early lead, seemed comfortable with the pace through the turn, finished strongly and was no match
for the winner but held the place. GET'EM TIGER broke out a bit but quickly straightened out, tracked the pacesetter to the turn, moved up to challenge for
the lead passing the quarter pole, was in the middle of the leading trio turning for home, was outkicked in the final furlong and held well for show in the late
stages. MAYCEE JO tracked the pace while saving ground, tipped out a path for the stretch run and was gradually gaining ground but needed a bit more.
ROSE PRINCESS broke a little awkwardly and spotted the field a head start, went wide around the turn and entered the stretch in the four path, never able
to make an impact. DANCING CRANE close early, had trouble keeping up from the five-sixteenths, came under heavy pressure passing the quarter pole
but had nothing to offer in the stretch.
