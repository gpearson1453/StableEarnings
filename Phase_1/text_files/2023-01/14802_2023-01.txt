Footnotes
MARTIQUE MISS broke up with the leaders, pressed three wide up the backstretch, fell back off the leader late in the turn, rebid past the furlong marker,
repelled the runner up late to win in determined fashion. ALITA void of early foot, continued back into and through the turn, three wide in the bend, roused
drive, late burst outside, bid in the final strides, denied. THE X FACTOR in mid pack while just off the inside, remained in the two path for the drive, inched
closer between foes with less than a furlong remaining, not enough late in lacking a knockout punch. SODDY DAISY well back early, saved ground through
the turn, remained inside when displaying some mild interest through the lane to improve position. LUNCH LADY bumped from both sides at the break but
still managed to be first away, cleared to the inside, narrowly showed the way into and through the turn, larger advantage when straightened for home,
faltered when headed by the winner with less than a furlong remaining. UNIFIED GURL broke through the gate prior to the start, broke in good order, vied
between horses into and through most of the turn, began to weaken in upper stretch. GO GO GO within striking distance outside, four wide into the turn,
three wide into the lane and had little left. FIRST FROST broke out, bumped start, raced outside, four wide through most of the turn, tired in the drive. WILD
BIZNESS fell back to trail after the start, swung out exiting the turn, failed to rally. FANCY HILL broke in to bump LUNCH LADY, back off the pace and the
inside, gave way in the two path turn.

Footnotes
PEACE DOG never far back off the inside, moved closer in the three path turning for home, challenged after drifting in past the furlong marker, edged clear
late under a firm left handed crop. ASPEN CLUB took control just after the start while getting out a bit, dueled into and through the turn, gained a larger
advantage briefly entering the stretch, responded when the winner came alongside with a furlong remaining, gave ground grudgingly to the winner while
clearly second best. LORD M away in good order, dueled up front in the two path outside the runner up for furlongs then began to weaken from between
rivals. SUPER GEEK back off the pace and the inside, angled out to be five wide into the lane, remained widest in the drive, not enough for the show late.
BOTANY behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground turn, roused then rider lost whip three sixteenths out, had little for the run to the wire.
DEPART off a step slow, lacked speed toward the inside, two path into lane, dropped back to the rail, went evenly the final furlong in lacking a closing
response. BRASKA off slowly, trailed well back thereafter, worked way out to widest for the drive, improved position with some mild interest down the middle
of the strip. LOU'S ARROW off a step slow, raced outside, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. DRIVER remained always back. WARNING
LABEL behind the pace while racing off the inside, backed up through the lane. ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH in the second flight early, stopped far turn, well
beaten. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER UP AGAINST THE WINNER FOR AN ALLEGED WHIP STRIKE IN
MIDSTRETECH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA unhurried early toward the inside, steered out five wide when advancing into the stretch, drifted a bit midstretch, bid, proved best
under firm handling. EXPENSIVE LIAISON void of speed along the inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, finished willingly up the rail to
be up for the place. ELI'S GIRL in the second flight off the inside, remained in the two path into the far turn,three wide into the lane, drifted in then out a bit
past the furlong marker, weakened in the late going to be outkicked for the second spot. LADY ENVOY four wide into the first turn, remained back, two path
into the stretch, improved position with some mkild late interest. GRAYDAWN DAY dueled up front while racing the two path, continued to alternate the
middle half, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, faltered when headed. BACHELORETTE in the second flight while between horses, had little
left for the stretch. HAL'S DREAM four wide in the first turn when with the main body, was finished after a half. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL dueled up front along the
inside for six furlongs, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
ADALINE JULIA moved up along the inside to the second flight, covered up through the turn, got through a narrow opening into the stretch, rail bid, dug in
late in game fashion to prove best. HYPERSPORT away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, narrowly showed the way into the lane, continued to
lead late, outgamed in the final stages, clear for the place. COMEDY ACT behind the pace off the inside, in some traffic when within striking distance late in
the turn, clear for the drive, no late gain on the top two. KANT BELIEVE IT lunged in the gate prior to the start, pressed the issue up the backstretch outside,
remained in forward position on the outside turning for home, lacked a closing kick. DANCE IT void of speed, angled four wide turning into the lane, also
lacked a closing response. BYZANTINE last away, void of speed, inside turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
KANCANCUTIE off a step slow, lacked speed outside, four wide turn, failed to muster rally. PIONEER PARADE dueled up front closest to the inside, gave
way from between the top two entering the stretch.

Footnotes
ATTA PARTY broke on top, dueled in the two path, disposed of the other speed turning for home, quickly kicked clear when straightened for home, won
geared down and ridden out. PERIPATETIC raced in mid pack and outside, steered out four wide turning for home, rallied out in the strip to finish willingly
for the place, no threat to the winner. IMPOVERISHED dueled up front closest to the inside, proved no match for the winner through the lane, weakened a
bit and was unable to contain the runner up. WORK ALL DAY in the second flight outside, crept closer four wide midway on the turn, came three wide for
the drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing kick. FETCHS BRAHM in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, also found lacking
while going evenly through the stretch. BLACK APPLE void of speed, four wide exiting the turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest down the middle
of the strip. FLASHY BOY GOES away in good order toward the inside, prompted the issue three wide into and through much of the turn, gradually
weakened in the run down the lane. ROYAL DE BE fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke back and never menaced. ROSIE'S BOY fell back to trail far
back after the start, continued to lag turn, passed some tiring rivals while never a factor. OTHER TIMES off a step slow, remained back throughout in
showing little. KRUSIN ROCKET fractious in the gage prior to the start, began a steady retreat before a half. ALL IN GOOD TIME back off the pace while
racing toward the inside, backed up through the stretch.

duel, proved best under steady handling. I'M THE BOSS OF ME closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch while off the inside, came out a bit upper
stretch to bother SARAH HARPER slightly, responded when the winner challenged soon after, proved stubborn in the drive. SARAH HARPER in the second
flight off the inside, continued to stalk three wide through the turn, bit closer into the lane, bothered slightly by the runner up soon after, finished up evenly
when clear. PERFECT HAPPINESS back off the pace and the outside, angled out four wide turning into the stretch and when inching closer, failed to fire
out in the middle of the strip. CONNIE K broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn while remaining inside, began to weaken
entering the stretch, continued to give way the final furlong. LISETTE last away, trailed throughout and was never a factor. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL
BY THE RIDER OF SARAH HARPER AGAINST THE RUNNER UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

early, swung out widest for the drive, closed with good energy to gain the place while closing the gap on the winner. GRAPNEL within striking distance, four
down to three wide turn, some close late while not having enough for the place. RED LABEL took command soon after the start, set the pace, gained a
larger advantage past the furlong marker, caved in late. R DOC went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. WESLEYAN closest to the
leader, continued to chased through the turn and into the stretch, gave way the final furlong. BELFAST BOY failed to menace while racing off the inside.
POLTERER forwardly placed early while just off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. SPARK (PER) finished early, trailed home.

BEN'S LEGACY within striking distance while off the inside, three to four wide turning for home and moving to challenge, put a head in front inside the
furlong grounds, drew clear. BYE BYE RAY forwardly placed along the inside, got through upper stretch, bid, outkicked by the winner late, held sway for the
place. LARK'S MISCHIEF broke alertly, set the pace just off the inside, continued to lead into the stretch, could not match the top two late, saved the show.
NAUTICAL STAR broke back, lacked speed, three wide through the turn, mild rally to be gaining for the show. J J'S JOKER prompted the leader from the
outside for a half and began to weaken. HARD SPUN FANTASY void of speed, came three wide for the drive, improved position without posing a serious
threat. APRIL FOOLS ANDY behind the pace just off the inside, moved closer then steadied in tight quarters into the turn, had nothing for the drive after
recovering. KINGDOM broke with the field, mid pack and outside, came four wide for the drive, failed to respond. DATS MR. MO was finished before a half.
WINDTAPPER WIN off a step slow, remained back.

SPA CITY pressed a soft pace in the two path, took over turning for home, responded when challenged by the runner up inside the furlong grounds, found
move in the final stages to prove best in a game effort. CADDO RIVER away in good order, lurked just off that leisurely pace in the three path, asked along
second turn, lost some ground to the two leaders turning for home outside that pair, challenged outside the winner with less that a furlong remaining, could
not get by. DECISION MAKER in the second flight three wide, dropped to the inside when straightened for home, some moderate late interest to be up for
the show. BACKGROUND broke on top, set a soft pace while along the ;inside, weakened in the drive. GO EMI settled in the second group along the inside,
came up empty for the drive. TRIDENT HIT four wide into the first turn, tucked in to save some ground, two path second bend after improving the middle
half, flattened out. MYSTIC NIGHT fell back to trail after the start and was never a threat.

Footnotes
PATE bore out early to trigger a chain reaction of interference, moved up to race in the second flight along the inside, two path into the stretch, roused,
kicked down leader to win going away. INTO LOVE came in when clearing early, steadied slightly, extended advantage through the turn while getting a
breather, continued to hold a sizable advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, clear for the place. DIVINELY BOLT bothered slightly
just after the start, within striking distance up the backstretch, asked along four wide turn, modest late interest to be clear of the others. KID'S LAST LAUGH
bothered early, moved up in traffic midway on the backstretch, two path turn, improved a bit into the stretch, flattened late. GOLDCREST pushed out early,
bothered, was straightened to race back, two path into the lane, improved position while not a dthreat. JUST AN ANGEL in the second flight up the
backstretch three wide, weakened in the drive. LITTLE DIXIE off a step slow, remained back. KIRBY KAYE bumped, bothered at the break, maintained
forward position despite that episode, remained within striking distance for four furlongs, gave way in the drive. INSENSITIVE bumped, bothered at the start,
mid pack and three wide backstretch, three to four wide late turn, backed up through the lane.
