J C'S IN TOWN tracked the leader to upper stretch then made a late run to be up in final strides. G'S STORM went to the lead to set the pace through the
final turn and was caught late in the drive. JUSTA BUSTER stalked the pace from off the rail while racing evenly. IT'S A BIRD settled in the middle of the
pace while saving ground through the final turn then moved out to three to four wide but never made a bid. TIN DELAY raced in the middle of the pack from
the two path and was not a factor. HENNING raced in the middle of the pack from the three path and was not a threat. HEATHER'S REQUEST dwelt at the
start and trailed.

REAL ACTION shot away form the gate to set a pressured pace was headed at the quarter pole and dueled around the final turn, drifted out entering the
stretch and brushed with QUIET AS MIDNIGHT but dug in and proved best. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT was allowed to settle around the first turn from the three
path then made a four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole to engage the leader at the quarter pole, dueled around the turn and was brushed entering the
stretch by REAL ACTION but couldn't match strides and was second best. LITTLE ROCKY broke well then raced in the middle of the pack in the two path,
made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole and faltered. SHEER ELEMENT saved ground and failed to menace. UNITEDAPPEAL was hustled along
to press the pace from the two path to the quarter pole and gave way.

placed off the pace down the backstretch then engaged the leader at the five sixteenths pole and dueled around the turn but couldn't match strides and was
second best. MISS CHARLIE GRAS tracked the leaders from the inside and chased winner home. EL CALIENTE LADY raced near the back around the first
turn then made a bid from three wide at the five sixteenths pole and made a rebid in upper stretch to fight gamely to the wire. CASHEW slipped at the start
then went five wide in to the first turn, stayed out wide into the stretch and made a late run but was not enough. US SECOND CUTE PIE raced in the middle
of the pack then moved up from five wide on the backstretch and tired. SUGAR STAR settled in the middle of the pack while saving ground to the three
eighths and dropped back. CUSTOM GUITAR was unhurried around the first turn while racing on the inside but was not a factor.
