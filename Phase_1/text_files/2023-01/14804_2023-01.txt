Footnotes
PERCOLATE (IRE) got put in a bit tight between early, stalked between rivals into the first turn then angled over to the rail, saved ground to the stretch,
moved off the fence, rallied three deep and proved best late. ONCOMING tracked on the inside early, went two wide into the far turn, eased out leaving the
bend and angled widest into the stretch, closed well in deep stretch but was too late. FOOTHILL pressed the pace from outside while in hand, headed the
leader at the quarter pole, dueled down the stretch, took a short lead with a sixteenth to go but was outkicked by the top pair. ONE FAST BRO brushed with
inner rival at the start, steered down to the inside racing near the back, moved out into the backstretch, angled four wide on the far turn, put in a late effort
but needed to find more late. BARSABAS set the pace on the inside under pressure, headed with a quarter mile left to run, fought with FOOTHILL holding a
slim advantage into the final furlong, lost the lead at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. HALFBARBERBINGIE was off slow in the beginning, traveled two
wide towards the rear early on, trailed three wide into the second bend, angled down to the rail and showed a mild response to improve position. LI MU BAI
(IRE) settled on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, moved out in the lane and failed to respond. SPIRIT MAKER prominent early outside the top pair
then stalked three wide, asked right handed three deep on the far turn and weakened in the drive. CREW DRAGON brushed leaving the gate, stalked three
deep then outside a rival, between foes into the far turn and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDENSPA allowed to settle early, entered the turn two wide, eased out to the three path while asked with the right hand, rallied four deep in the lane and
drew clear. STOP AND A TRES bobbled leaving the gate, raced up close between rivals, got put in a bit tight near the seven-sixteenths pole, angled down
to the inside, launched a bid from the fence in upper stretch, gained the lead entering the final furlong but was soon overtaken by the winner in midstretch
and stayed on to secure second. PACIFIC STATES forwardly placed three deep early, chased along the two path through the turn, tipped out and bid three
deep with a furlong remaining but was outkicked by the top pair. TRUSTY RUSTY took control early from inside, kicked clear on the turn, reeled in by rivals
in upper stretch and lost command at the eighth pole, then flattened in the final sixteenth. TAKE CHARGE CURLY was a step slow on the outside, raced in
range widest up the backstretch, bumped with inner rival while four wide at the five-sixteenths pole, continued in the four path to the stretch and failed to
menace. LORD MO chased three wide into the turn, drifted out to bump rival at the five-sixteenths pole and steadied, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
OUR SHINING LIGHT (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, showed speed then ceded command and stalked on the inside, tipped out in the lane, rallied and got
up in the final strides. WHO'S CANDY dueled for command from outside, inched ahead leaving the bend, disposed of inner rival in upper stretch, led clear
into the final sixteenth but was run down by the winner nearing the wire. UNCLE GEORGE hit the gate but still came away fairly well, tracked off the inside,
started the turn two wide, entered the stretch three wide, moved out in the lane and finished willingly to earn the show honors. NAISMITH bobbled leaving
the gate, raced near the back outside rivals, exited the bend three wide and kept on to earn a minor award. REALLY BIG NEWS chased on the inside off the
pace, had to take hold at the five-sixteenths pole, continued along the rail to the stretch, moved off the fence and showed late effort. WYFIRE sat off the
pace and went two to three wide around the turn, moved out in the drive and needed to find more late. ELEVADO stalked the top pair two wide into and
around the turn and flattened in the final furlong. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) was off a bit slow and got bumped back at the start, traveled towards the rear
on the inside into the turn, shifted to the two path late on the bend and showed a mild response in the drive. ENCODE broke in and bumped rival, went up to
duel from inside, kept the pressure on into the stretch, lost contact in upper stretch and weakened. BLAME GEORGE dropped back early, trailed four then
three wide around the turn and was not a factor. RACE ORIGINALLY HAND-TIMED, TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
NEAREST N DEAREST bumped with inner rival early, angled out and moved into range up the backstretch, chased four deep at the three-eighths pole,
took aim three wide into the stretch, rallied four deep and proved best in the end. ROSY EDGE raced up close on the inside, lacked room twice in upper
stretch, found room between rivals and split foes to get up for second. SAPADILLA pressed the pace from outside early, could not keep up into the turn and
chased two wide around the bend, re-engaged the leader in upper stretch, took over midstretch, yielded to the winner and got nailed for the place. SADDLE
UP JESSIE was off a bit slow and bothered leaving the gate, tracked on the inside and was making progress before having to pause into the turn, altered
out around the bend and bumped with inner rival, came four wide into the stretch, rallied five deep in the lane but lacked the needed late punch in the late
stages. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ lacked early speed, went four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally but failed to threaten.
SUGAR SUGAR got blocked early then chased in mid-pack, angled out on the turn and entered the lane four to five wide and could not rally. VEGAS
DREAM set the pace under pressure, moved clear on the turn, challenged again in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. JUSTIN'S LADY
chased off the inside, bumped between rivals on the turn and lost ground and weakened in the drive. FEELING FLUSH bumped with outer rival and
checked early, saved ground at the back on the turn, moved out in the stretch and failed to menace. ALEX'S GIRL chased three deep into the turn, got
bumped and shuffled between rivals around the bend and weakened.

drew clear. EL DIABLO ROJO stalked the top pair up the backstretch, engaged the leaders from between midway around the turn, roused in upper stretch,
took over at the eighth pole, lost command with a sixteenth remaining and held second. BOX OF CHOCOLATES threw his head at the start to come away
last, trailed up the backstretch, went four then five wide passing rivals on the turn, put in a late run and gained the show. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL stalked three
wide into the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, lost his path briefly outside the eighth pole and kept on to earn a minor award. TIZLIGHTNING dueled for
command from inside, vied with outer rivals midway around the turn and into the lane, dueled in upper stretch, lost command at the eighth pole and
weakened in the late stages. CATBERNAY dueled for the lead outside TIZLIGHTNING up the backstretch, fought three deep past the midway point on the
turn, failed to keep up in upper stretch and weakened. KING OF SPEED brushed outer rival leaving the gate, chased on the inside then two wide into the

bend and failed to menace. GOLDEN IMAGE broke in and bumped rival, chased three deep near the back then outside a rival into the turn, got moved out
to the three path briefly then angled down to the inside and failed to threatened. RIVER TIBER got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, climbed early

Footnotes
MITAD DEL MUNDO settled early in the two path, moved out in the stretch, rallied and bested LOTTERY PICK in deep stretch. LOTTERY PICK got
bumped into inner rival at the start, was closest in pursuit through the early going, started to reel in the leader around the far turn and into the stretch, quickly
gained command and cleared in upper stretch but got outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth. BIG FLINT settled outside a rival, rounded both turns
two wide and finished willingly to gain the show. ATTENZIONE got bumped leaving the gate, sat off the pace between rivals, angled to the rail on the far
turn, produced a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. IVORY SKY raced three deep early then moved into the two path for the first turn, spun three
wide into the lane and improved position. ROY C settled inside, suffered a mild shuffle at the seven-sixteenths pole, altered out in upper stretch and never
threatened. DEVIL MOON sped clear and moved inside, opened up a large lead around the first turn, padded the lead in the middle stages, held a rapidly
diminishing lead entering the stretch, gave up command shortly after and folded in the lane. THE KEY IS UNITY broke in and bumped rival, got put in tight
between rivals prior to the first turn, settled three deep, outside a rival into the far turn, two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. TIM'S TRIBUTE was
off a bit slow in the beginning, trailed two wide into the first turn then moved inside, continued at the rear along the rail to the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
NOLO CONTESTO showed speed four wide into the first turn then moved into the three path, fought with QUICK INTRO to the half-mile pole then cleared,
asked right handed entering the stretch, switched to the left hand and responded nicely by powering away and was ridden out in deep stretch. GRANADA
FLAVOR sat off the pace off the inside, asked three wide leaving the far turn and bested the rest. CHRIS FIX took back early, trailed through the early
stages, was on the move on the far turn, swung out into the lane, shifted inward in upper stretch and gained the show. BIG SWEDE chased along the inside
then pulled on the first turn, stalked under a hold in the middle stages, roused on the far turn and asked two wide into the lane but flattened to fourth.
HOODLUM settled inside, tipped two wide with a quarter mile left to run but could to rally. SIPPIN N KISSIN tracked two wide early, moved out and went five
wide on the far turn, entered the lane four wide and never responded to urging. SOCAL RED shifted out while four wide entering the first turn, raced near
the back into the second bend, ran up behind troubled rivals at the quarter pole, steered down to the inside and failed to menace. QUICK INTRO dueled for
the lead from inside to the half-mile pole, chased the leader through the far turn and into the stretch and weakened. CARELESS KITTEN bumped with rival
entering the clubhouse turn, tracked three deep then off the rail, roused on the far turn but got crowded between rivals and four deep at the quarter pole,
then was eased in the lane and walked off. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) bumped with outer rival into the first turn then lost path around the bend, got shuffled
between rivals while three deep at the quarter pole, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
DUVET DAY (IRE) broke a step slow then was guided to the inside to settle off the pace, lacked room in traffic on the final bend and had to angle widest,
came six wide into the drive, flew late and inhaled QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE in the final sixteenth to win clear. QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE stalked the speed
along the inside, angled outside the top pair past the five-sixteenths pole, challenged three deep into the lane, cleared with a furlong left to run but got run
down by the winner late. AUSTRALIA MIA stalked the leader in the two path early, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, raced on even terms at
the quarter pole, vied between foes in upper stretch, could not keep pace entering the furlong grounds and stayed on to hold the show. ALMOST A
FACTOR unhurried in the early going and moved inside, tipped out leaving the final bend but needed to find more in the late stages. WARRENS CANDY
GIRL broke a step slow and was forced in at the start, trailed on the inside then moved to the two path, saved ground around the far turn, tipped back off the
fence in the drive and improved position. NEW HEAT broke a step slow, tracked off the rail then went between rivals, got put in tight past the quarter pole
and could not rally. BARRISTER'S RIDE bobbled leaving the gate, settled outside rivals then in the two path, moved out and traveled three then four deep
on the far turn and failed to menace. LADY CLEMENTINE (GB) stepped to the front to take control early, set the pace on the inside then took some
pressure on the backstretch, headed by outer rival at the quarter pole, vied with outside pair into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and gave way. TIZ
AN EDVENTURE forwardly placed three wide early, remained off the rail to the far turn, started to weaken around that bend, eased in the stretch and
walked off.

Footnotes
STAY IN THE GAME sat off the pace, angled in and saved ground around the turn, moved out with a furlong left to run, closed fast and inhaled the
runner-up. CROWNING GOLD vied for the lead three deep, dueled outside a rival past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared in upper stretch but could not hold
the winner at way. ARMY STAR stalked outside a rival, tipped out but got put in a tight spot near the quarter pole, bumped with rival entering the stretch and
kept on to gain the show. WARRENS WORLD was off slow to begin, traveled two wide into the lane, moved to the inside then back out and summoned a
mild rally to round out the superfecta. KING ADROCK vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, fought back into the
furlong grounds then weakened in deep stretch. TOP OF MY GAME broke a step slow and dropped back, started the turn five wide, moved down to the
three path then angled back out and came five wide into the lane and improved position. BLACK MAGICIAN stalked three deep to the turn, traveled four
deep at the quarter pole and could not rally in the lane. MENTIROSA broke a step slow on the outside, came five wide into the stretch and had little left for
the drive. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) raced off the two wide into the turn, moved out to the four path around the bend, tipped out further at the top of the
stretch but failed to menace. MISTER BEAMS stalked the speedy trio from inside, asked two wide into the lane and faded. MARKS HIP vied between for
command, could not keep up past the five-sixteenths pole, bumped with outer rival entering the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HAWKER stalked the pace from inside, two wide leaving the bend, moved out a bit further to closed from outside and got up in the final strides. CONCLUDE
bobbled crossing over the dirt, was closest in pursuit two wide, bid outside around the turn, took over in upper stretch, moved clear at the eighth pole but got
caught late by the winner. DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) bumped with outer rival at the start, raced off the pace and steered out to go three deep into the turn,
came four wide into the stretch and finished well to beat VALIANCER for the show honors. VALIANCER sat off the pace and moved inside, angled out in
upper stretch and got outfinished for third. PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) away quickly in the beginning, cleared and crossed over to the inside, set the pace
to the turn, challenged by CONCLUDE around the bend, maintained a short lead into the stretch, then relinquished the lead and got put in tight by that rival
in upper stretch and flattened in deep stretch. FLEET FEET bobbled crossing over the dirt then ran up on heels early, raced in mid-pack two wide into the
turn, got boxed in around the bend, found room in upper stretch and kept on to improve position. BALTHAZAR broke in and bumped rival, trailed up the
backstretch, passed rivals while saving ground around the bend, chased through the lane and was unable to unleash the needed rally. ZIO JO chased
outside a rival early on, between foes around the bend, moved out a bit in upper stretch and weakened. ONE OF THESE DAYS (IRE) stalked four wide
leaving the backstretch, went three deep around the turn and weakened in the lane. PIONEER PRINCE settled off the pace outside rival, had to steady at
the seven-sixteenths pole, angled five wide around the bend and lacked a rally. XANDER was off slow to start, chased four deep into the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and weakened. GET KRAKEN was off slow to begin, raced wide early off the pace, went three deep into the turn, trailed two wide into
the stretch and was not a factor.
