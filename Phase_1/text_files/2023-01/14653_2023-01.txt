Footnotes
BOSSYNESS prompted the pace outside SWEET FACTOR, gained a two wide lead in upper stretch and held sway under urging. LEVISA , steadied after
breaking slowly, circled the turn four wide and rallied outside. LADY LANCER , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, lacked the necessary late
response. ICESTORMING , steadied when shuffled back near the five eighths pole, angled five wide entering the stretch and passed tired foes. SWEET
FACTOR showed speed along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. BEST WORST IDEA stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner
rail around the turn and in the stretch until taken to the six path near the sixteenth pole. BREEZY LEIGH showed brief speed, faltered turning for home and
was eased late.

Footnotes
SPEAK YOUR MIND quickly went clear, set a rated pace two wide, opened up after being put to a drive in upper stretch, kept on under strong handling past
the sixteenth marker, got weary late and narrowly prevailed. QUEEN OF CLASS broke a step slow, raced wide heading the half mile marker, dropped in a
bit then steadied briefly mid turn, advanced inside rivals leaving mid stretch, worked outward in the final sixteenth and finished gamely to just miss.
MUSICAL CAT , off the pace while saving some ground, shifted out four wide into the lane, moved up near the sixteenth marker but flattened out very late.
BACKSTREET AFFAIR , a bit rank at the break, regrouped and was sent up towards the rail to gain a forward spot, was under asking mid turn, came out for
the drive, lacked a punch leaving mid stretch and faded. GWYNEDD , urged along three to four wide around the turn, failed to respond. PRAY FOR THE U
S A , four wide advancing outside rivals nearing the half mile marker, took closer order three wide early turn, was under a ride pursuing into the lane and
weakened. BESTLA flashed speed between rivals, failed to keep up leaving the far turn and faltered.

JONES FALLS , three wide the first turn, advanced in the three path leaving the fa turn, split horses in mid stretch and drove clear. GENERAL J R , in hand
waiting for room along the rail entering the far turn, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. RECKLESS AFFAIR , outside horses down
the backstretch, chased the pace, drifted to the four path mid way on the far turn, gained a brief lead and weakened late. UNKNOWN AGENDA lacked
speed, was four wide on the far turn and failed to menace. INSPIRED IRISH launched a challenge between horses mid way on the far turn and gave way
the final furlong. HOP AND SCOTCH raced along the inner rail on the far turn and was not a factor. SUPERR RON set the pace along the inner rail, faltered
leaving the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
INDIAN LAKE had his head turned as the gates sprung, quickly recovered and edged up four wide to contention into the turn, dropped in a path and tracked
the dueling leaders leaving the five sixteenths, ranged up to loom in upper stretch, joined THREES OVER DEUCES from his outside leaving the furlong
grounds, kept on doggedly under strong handling and wrested command in the final yards. THREES OVER DEUCES bobbled at the break, vied between
runners heading to the half mile marker, secured the inside leaving the far turn while holding a slim lead, took pressure around the turn, clung to the
advantage past mid stretch, kept on valiantly to the inside of the winner through the final seventy yards but wasn't quite good enough. EXCULPATORY
rated three wide while not far back, angled five wide under asking into the lane, straightened and churned on to nab the show. GAGETOWN , in a bit close
leaving the far turn, took closer order past the five sixteenths, angled four wide and continued with interest. KADRI , with the early pace three deep, sparred
outside THREES OVER DEUCES around the turn, kept on to mid stretch then faded. MARVALOUS MIKE prompted the early pace inside a pair of rivals,
failed to go on with those two exiting the far turn, dropped back then came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
LIQUIDATOR rated kindly four wide, steadily progressed four wide outside rivals heading to the lane, sustained under left handed asking and engaged MO
CO GOLD leaving mid stretch, kept on grinding, took over in deep stretch and prevailed. MO CO GOLD prompted the pace two wide outside the leader,
moved to apply more pressure nearing the quarter pole, took command soon into the lane, spurted clear after being put to firm encouragement, dug in when
confronted leaving mid stretch, dueled then grudgingly ceded in the final strides. ANGELOFCANTERBURY , taken to rate soon after the start, saved ground
advancing into the lane, eased out near the furlong grounds, worked her way between foes and continued on with interest. MUSICMANSANDY , coaxed
along with pursuit towards the rail, came out for the drive but lacked a serious punch. ROWSIE EXPRESS , urged from the gate, gave chase between
runners early on, angled five wide for the drive but failed rally. BOSSERATI sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure leaving the far
turn, was headed soon into the lane, kept on to mid stretch then weakened. TOUISSET , three wide chasing the leaders, failed to kick on under a ride
entering the lane and gave way. OJITOS BELLOS dropped off the pace while saving ground and never fired. NEED A MARKER broke slowly, moved up
outside a rival leaving the far turn, angled four to five wide while under pressure into the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
GAMESTONKS stalked the duel down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn, took the lead outside MISS DILLINGHAM near the sixteenth
pole then drove clear. MISS DILLINGHAM showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch, sprinted clear in upper stretch, drifted out in
mid stretch and weakened late. CLASSIC COLORS , three wide the first turn, moved up four deep leaving the far turn, had aim on the lead in mid stretch
and flattened out. CLICK TO CONFIRM disputed the pace two wide and gave way in upper stretch. BIG CHEEKS lacked speed, circled the far turn three
wide, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and was not a factor. WITTY BANTER raced along the inner rail, chased the pace to the stretch and tired.
MISTY TASTE , outrun, hugged the inner rail on the far turn. FUNNYBET dropped back on the far turn, was eased in upper stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
PRODIGY DOLL , inside and off a contested pace, angled out four wide under asking into the lane, leveled off under left handed asks leaving mid stretch,
forged to command outside RESPONSE TIME in deep stretch then drew clear. RESPONSE TIME broke on top despite a stumble, regrouped and was
nudged up to the outside of WHISKEY AND RYE to take a short advantage, sparred with that one around the turn and into the lane, spurted clear under a
drive in mid stretch, continued gamely but failed to contain the winner. MOODY WOMAN , between runners into the turn, was under a ride mid turn, shifted
four wide for the drive but lacked a serious response. WHISKEY AND RYE led early then was headed from her outside by RESPONSE TIME, disputed the
pace around the turn to upper stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. PAISLEY SINGING , in the clear chasing the embattled leaders, failed to
kick on while off the rail into the stretch and gave way. SHEISTHEHERO lost ground four wide outside rivals, was under pressure leaving the far turn,
wandered outward without a response entering the lane, gave way and was eased through the final three sixteenths.
