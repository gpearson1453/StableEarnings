Footnotes
SHE FLED THE SCENE was held up in a tracking position from the three path, made a sweeping bid in the four path passing the quarter pole, took the lead
and was cued into the stretch, and went clear under right handed urging. LINNY KATE bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated along the inside, angled
out passing the quarter pole and was in the seven path turning into the lane, and chased home the winner for place. CURRENT SITUATION set the pace
from inside but yielded from the two path to a pair of outer foes in the stretch for show. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced
from off the pace in the three path, tipped out to the five path and was coaxed around the far turn, swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, but was
no factor. MIA AT MIDNIGHT raced prominently in the three path early but faded from the six path in the stretch. PEARLESCENT stalked in the three path
but was empty from the four path in the stretch.

Footnotes
GIRVIN GIRL stalked the pace four wide, took over leaving the eighth pole and drew off while drifting in under left-handed urging. LUNA TUNA set the pace
in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but held on for place. TURN ON THE CHARM
prompted the pace in the three path, was unable match strides with the top two nearing the quarter pole, angled in near that marker, angled back out leaving
the sixteenth pole and churned on for a share. MOON ROSE saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker and never
threatened. OMO TEN GIRL steadily faded two wide. RIVERVIEW STEVIE hesitated at the start and was outrun inside. LAW MACHINE played no factor
while racing three and four wide.

GHOSTLY NIGHT stalked along the inside, tipped out passing the quarter pole and was roused from the five path going into the stretch, took the lead into
the final furlong, and drew clear while drifting out late. KHOZZY VALINTINE prompted the pace in the four path, bid passing the quarter pole, took a short
lead into the stretch, was caught by the winner passing the eighth pole, but ran on to secure place. NO DECAF had an awkward start and trailed from the
two path into the turn, was angled out to the nine path turning into the lane, and improved for show. LA COSTA tracked in the three path, was driven along
in the six path entering the stretch, but was no factor. QUEEN CUPID chased in the five path and was no menace from the six path in the stretch. MABEE
LUCKYNWILD set the pace in the two path but yielded passing the eighth pole.

the start, stalked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane. CONCEPTUS saved ground and lacked the needed rally. CHILD MEMORIES

Footnotes
LISTENTOTHEMUSIC set the pace in the two path, was cued from the four path turning into the stretch, and angled back inside while kicking clear.
HARRY'S ONTHEFLY prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, lugged in passing the eighth pole, and chased
home the winner for place. CERTAIN stalked in the three path, shifted inwards to the rail around the turn, was roused from said position turning into the
lane, and evened out for show. LIEUTENANT STAN bumped twice with ASSUME NOTHING leaving the gate, tracked in the three path but flattened in the
stretch. MUNTALIQ brushed the side of the gate at the start, trailed from the five path into the stretch, drifted out, and was no factor.
ORGANIZEDCONFUSION chased from the six path into the turn and never threatened. ASSUME NOTHING bumped into LIEUTENANT STAN twice at the
start, was hustled along in the five path but was empty entering the stretch. HALF-MILE FRACTION CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

ground well off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. CAJUN BAYOU raced off the pace three wide, angled widest in upper stretch
and was along for the show. MOPED DENNIS pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths marker, was quickly confronted by the
winner, battled inside of that foe to midstretch then weakened. ACTION DREAM set the pace along the rail and gave way near the three-eighths pole.
FEDERAL EXCHANGE had his head turned at the start, was bumped soon after, raced four wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BELLA saved ground off the pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole, closed determinedly and was up on the wire. ABUSE OF POWER
saved ground in range, angled three wide near the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, drew clear leaving the eighth pole and was nailed on the wire.
INDICIA saved ground off the pace and rallied between foes to gain the show late. FRANKIE'S GIRL was pinched back not long after the start, trailed inside
early, went four wide around the far turn, swung eight wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. STARSHIP MALLOMAR failed to menace while racing four
and five wide. SMART SPENDING raced off the early pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and finished evenly between foes. DAKOTA
DANCER set a clear pace inside and tired in the lane. HAZARDOUS HUMOR stalked the pace two wide and faded through the lane. BASILIA stalked the
pace inside and came up empty in the lane. MIZZEN ASH played no factor while racing two and three wide. STREAKING GREY was fractious in the gate,
steadied entering the first turn, raced three wide and was through after a half. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
GABE set the pace in the three path, was roused to open up and kicked away in the four path in upper stretch, and held sway. MEXICOFFEE had an
awkward start and rated in the three path, tucked inside around the turn and was ridden from the rail into the stretch, kept on and dug in for place.
MIDNIGHT GETAWAY raced off the pace along the inside, was in the three path entering the lane, ran on between foes into the final furlong but hung late
to show. REDISUR was prompted along in the three path but flattened in the stretch. AVATAL HERO chased in the four path, shifted out to the seven path
turning into the lane, but was no factor. MINELLA was behind in the five path early, went very wide going into the stretch, and never threatened. COLONEL
CAPPY stalked in the five path but was empty going into the stretch.
