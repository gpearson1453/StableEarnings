SPEED WARNING up to duel early, took over, cleared in the stretch and blitzed the field. GOD OF WINE unhurried to the turn, rallied swiftly into stretch, no
match. PACE no seed to the turn, ran on in the stretch run for show spot. BLANTON rushed inside, dueled to turn, chased stretch run, wilted late. NET
WORTH failed to menace. TEXCOCO never a real menace. EL MUZN broke sharp, raced evenly to stretch, folded in the drive. MO SNOW no speed to
turn, wide quarter pole, no late response in stretch. FAST FALL tracked leaders to turn, nothing left and dropped back readiy. A. P. AVATAR dropped far
back.
