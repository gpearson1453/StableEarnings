Footnotes
BUC N BEAUTY bobbled slightly leaving the gate but recovered well to set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter pole and opened up from
said position turning into the lane, drifted out slightly inside the final furlong, but held sway. ERIN'S MOMENT stalked along the inside, tipped out to the
three path under rousing entering the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. KAREN'S HONOR tracked in the three path, was coaxed from the five
path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, and kept on late to get up for show. CONSTITUTIONALIST was prompted along from the
four path into the turn, was under right handed urging from said position turning into the stretch, and flattened. TINKATWO chased in the five path, was
driven from the six path into the stretch, but faded. VALIA steadied at the start, trailed from the four path before shifting to the two path around the turn, but
was no threat. HIDDEN ROAD broke out at the start, was hustled along in the two path but dropped back early around the turn.

Footnotes
CHIQUIRIN settled off the pace inside, advanced along the rail around the turn, came through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch and drew off under
drive. NATURE BOY set the pace along the rail, lost the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, pressed inside around most of the turn, regained command
nearing the quarter pole, drifted out turning for home, was no match for the winner and held second. THE TWINS SNEAKERS had his head turned at the
start, raced well back three wide and was along for the show. GYPSY KITTEN failed to menace while racing two wide. FISHING FOR FUN stalked the pace
three wide and came up empty in the lane. MISTER J T had only brief speed two wide. MUNDO MIX pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch,
took the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, led two wide around most of the turn, stopped and was eased in the lane.

LIVE LIKE LAURA set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled around the turn and roused from the three path entering the lane, and held on
gamely. AVATAL HERO prompted the pace into the three path, was coaxed right handed from the five path into the stretch, and chased home the winner for
place. PINK PARTY PANTS stalked along the inside under a hold, was cued in the four path turning into the lane, and kept on to hold show. MACASSA
broke out at the start, tracked in the three path, was driven from the six path into the stretch, but evened out. JAZZY JAS trailed from the four path into the
turn and was no threat from the seven path in the stretch. LABOR OF LOVE rated in the two path but never menaced from the five path down the lane.

Footnotes
JAIS'S SOLITUDE settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed strongly and was up in deep stretch. JAVA BUZZ set
a rated pace just off the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch but was unable to the withstand the winner in the later yards. SOUPER ENERGIZER tracked the
pace two and three wide, had aim in upper stretch but evened out while getting in late. DRILLOMATIC saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch
and rallied belatedly. DUE VINI pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. CHESS'S DREAM was outrun inside. UNCLE ARMANDO played no
factor while racing two and three wide. KING ALFREDO steadied along inside and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
HOT BODE bumped with an outer foe leaving the gate, trailed around the first turn, moved up in the five path down the backstretch and was roused from the
six path around the far turn, took aim while fanning out to the eight path into the stretch, and ran on to get up in the final strides. DOWNTON TABBY set the
pace in the two path, was coaxed from the five path turning into the stretch, drifted out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, was corrected, and dug in
to hold place. KESTENNA (GB) tracked in the four path, took aim from the five path around the far turn, bid from the six path into the stretch, was floated out
until the eighth pole, and hung for show. CAPRIDREY brushed with an outer foe leaving the gate, stalked along the inside, was driven from the four path
into the stretch, and evened out. MIA'S AUTHORITY brushed with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path but flattened from the six path in the
stretch. PERFECT KIMBERLY S got bumped between foes out of the gate, was held up along the inside, steadied slightly from said position turning into the
lane, and was no factor. LA COSTA brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack from the three path but never threatened. ROSES FOR
ASHLEY prompted the pace in the four path but gaveway turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
LAY THE GROUNDWORK was steadied into the first turn, raced in midpack from the two path down the backstretch, shifted in and was ridden around the
far turn, and rallied from the rail in the stretch to get up in the final sixteenth. SALS DREAM GIRL stalked along the inside, shifted out to the four path turning
into the lane, and ran on to get up for place late. UNION DOLLY had awkward start, set the pace in the two path, was roused from said position into the
stretch, and kept on but was caught on both sides inside the final furlong to finish with show honors. COCONUT BEACH was out in the five path around the
first turn, raced prominently in the four path thereafter, was coaxed passing the three eighths pole, floated out to the six path entering the lane, and finished
evenly. CHARMED WAY tracked in the three path, was cued passing the quarter pole and in the five path going into the stretch, but was one paced.
SPIDER BELLE bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but was no factor. OCEAN AIR
chased in the four path, was driven from the seven path into the stretch, but never threatened. QUARIA THUNDER had an awkward start and bumped with
an outer foe, was unhurried in the four path but flattened in the stretch. TAPPLE CIDER got bumped around between foes out of the gate, trailed from the
four path early, went very wide into the stretch and was no menace. ZISISIT (IRE) prompted the pace in the three path but gaveway turning into the stretch.

MUNNYS GOLD hit the starting gate, recovered quickly, sped to the front, set the pace in two path and widened in hand. JOLLY MISS JILL led early,
chased the winner inside around the turn, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best.
HIHELLOHOWAREYOU prompted the winner in the three path, angled in in upper stretch and faded. ESOTERIC was outrun inside. EXTRA INDY played
no factor while racing three and four wide. DEFENDED had only brief speed three wide and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
DONTMESSWITHTESS tracked in the four path, was roused into the far turn and ranged up to take aim from the five path entering the lane, and ran on to
get up in the final sixteenth. CHICA BOOM rated in the three path, was ridden around the far turn and fanned out to the six path into the stretch, and rallied
to get up for place on the wire. SHES THE NORTH had to steady into the first turn, raced prominently in the three path, was cued to bid around the far turn,
took the lead and was in the two path going into the stretch, drifted out under left handed urging, and was caught late to show. HARDLY SOCIAL trailed
from the two path into the stretch, angled out to the center and stayed on late. CAGUA was unhurried in the two path, shifted out around the far turn and
was driven from the eight path into the lane, and finished evenly. WICKED MERCURY stalked in the two path, was roused from the three path turning into
the stretch, but was short of room and unable to factor. KENTUCKY PRIDE raced in midpack along the inside but was no factor from the four path in the
stretch. EMIRATES AFFAIR set the pace along the inside but yielded at the top of the lane.
