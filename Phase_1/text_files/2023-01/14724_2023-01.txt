Footnotes
SUPER KHOZAN chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then angled to the five path leaving the turn, dug in under steady stretch
encouragement and got up the final strides. BARB'S PRIDE chased through the backstretch and dueled to a slim lead three wide leaving the turn, dueled
clear mid-stretch but was caught in the final strides. BABY BULLDOG pressured the pace inside and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the
turn, then flattened the final sixteenth. ITCHY PALMS chased outside, rounded the turn in the seven path, left the turn widest and closed well through the
lane. TACOMA AUSTIN hesitated at the break and raced well back from early contention, rounded the turn off the rail, eased outward into the lane and
improved his position. BUY HERE PAY HERE was hustled to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge
two deep on the turn, gave up the nod into the lane and flattened stride. MIMS SECOND CHANCE engaged in close early chase but faded at the rail on the
turn. BAL ROBINSON gave close early chase then faded in the four path of the turn.

Footnotes
DIVINE FASHION settled off the early pace in the three path, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide toward the head of
the lane, dueled clear inside the eighth pole and was steadily handled to the finish. TEMPORARILY raced off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn and dueled clear for second mid-stretch. SHINY PENNY moved to the inside and rated a slim early
lead, was met at the nine sixteenths, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths and raced close two deep on the far turn, but flattened inside the eighth pole.
LIGHTFOOT MISS raced well back in the three path the first turn, bid from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and passed rivals
outside. SOCIAL EXCLUSION saved early ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little
in the lane. CHIT CHAT GIRL showed little response. MAGIC IN ME stalked from the three path early then took the lead three wide at the nine sixteenths
pole and rated the pace, came under pressure at the five sixteenths, was caught at the rail approaching the head of the lane and weakened. HUFFLEPUFF
raced with the early pace two deep, gave chase into the backstretch but faded at the rail approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
BO'S BOURBON took over at the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was hand urged away from the five sixteenths pole, widened
at the rail on the far turn then kept alert in the lane. ISLAND D'LITE tapered in and stalked the early pace two deep, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn but drifted out leaving the turn, lugged in from the eighth pole and flattened stride. TREJO rated close inside,
gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. SLIPPERY WHEN WET was shuffled back at the
start and rounded the opening turn in the four path, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the
far turn and showed little more. HAGGERSDALE rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded
in the three path of the far turn. GABRIEL'S WING raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.
REVERE NOTE raced off the rail on the first turn and was never a factor.

later yards. THELADYISTRUE gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn then closed to take second later yards. WITNESS THE ENERGY dueled for
the early lead and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn but was caught flattening stride mid-stretch. CASTLE LIGHTS raced
with the early pace then gave chase from the three eighths pole, dueled close three wide on the turn but flattened mid-stretch. MY PRETTY EYES chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail, eased outward mid-stretch and finished evenly. IRON LADY AWAY contested the early pace and raced
close off the rail on the turn, then weakened. JUBA'S HOUSE was not a factor and rounded the turn about the four path. ALL WORKED UP gave chase

Footnotes
AT THE GATE checked off the heels of Right To Assemble early on then settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, took the lead three wide approaching the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. SERIOUS MOMENT settled back in the three
path the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dug in to take second in the final strides.
MOHAYMEN DAY settled off the rail on the first turn then stalked three wide into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, entered the
far turn about the three path and took a brief slim lead midway through the turn, but was met into the lane then nipped from second the final strides. I'M SO
EXTRA tapered in and took over toward the three quarter pole then rated the pace, dug in to the challenge of Right To Assemble leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened. REGGAETONI angled out on the first turn and entered the backstretch
outside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE angled in and stalked leaving the three quarter pole,
moved to even terms into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths, but faded past the five sixteenths. JASIRA saved ground on the first
turn and was never a factor. HERECOMESPUDD dropped well back early on and never factored.
