RELUCTANT forwardly placed into the first turn, kept close attendance to the moderate pace, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker,
assumed command in upper stretch, was confronted by PEACEHAVEN nearing the sixteenth-marker, determinedly dug in in deep stretch and held on for
the win. PEACEHAVEN raced four wide into the first turn then was allowed to settle in the two path in the early stages, advanced to be well positioned along
the backstretch run, came within aim nearing the quarter marker, mounted a three wide rally leaving the second turn, closed well inside of the furlong
marker, confronted RELUCTANT nearing the sixteenth-marker, battled against the determined winner while on the left lead and was denied for the win,
while well clear of the rest. CHELINA rated off of the early pace, saved ground to the far turn, could not keep pace with the top pair in the drive but kept on in
the final strides to secure the show. CAL ROUGH stalked the early pace, raced three wide along the backstretch run, was outrun approaching the top of the
lane and did not mount a late rally. FUNKY GREY sent to the early lead, set a pressured pace while carving out moderate fractions, was confronted nearing
the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and faded in the drive. VALDINI bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, unhurried in the
early stages and did not factor in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MIRACLE IN MOTION broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be not far back into the turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker,
mounted a three wide rally leaving the turn, closed determinedly in deep stretch, came within aim of the leading pair nearing the sixteenth-marker and made
a late surge in the final strides to prevail. LION'S LAIR showed early speed and set a contested pace to the turn, dueled with BOLD DAUGHTER to the
quarter marker, continued to battle with that rival to mid-stretch while holding a narrow advantage, was all out while on the left lead inside of the furlong
marker, was nailed for the win in the final strides and held well in the end for place. BOLD DAUGHTER forwardly placed in the early stages, advanced to
duel with LION'S LAIR to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, was held at bay by LION'S LAIR in deep stretch and just missed for the
win and place, while clear for show. DRESS REHEARSAL disputed the early pace while inside of LION'S LAIR, lost ground on the turn and did not rally in
the stretch run. HEAT SEEKING LETA chased the moderate early pace, raced three wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive and did not threaten in
the late stages.

Footnotes
CLUBHOUSE WAVE came under a snug hold while just off of the early pace, advanced while in tight nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide for the
drive, closed in mid-stretch, headed DADDYS NINA nearing the sixteenth-marker and determinedly prevailed over that rival in the final strides. DADDYS
NINA tracked the moderate early pace, saved ground through the turn, advanced in upper stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the furlong marker, met the
bid of CLUBHOUSE WAVE nearing the sixteenth-marker, was gamely bested by the determined winner in the final strides and was second best. PETE'S
INFERNO broke alertly, raced close up to the moderate pace, came three wide to the quarter marker while vying for the lead, battled to mid-stretch, could
not keep pace with the top two in the late stages and held for show in the end. TYCHE AWAITS YOU was bothered at the start when ZAKKIYYAH lunged
leaving the break and was off a step slowly, unhurried in the early stages, steadied off of heels entering the turn, not far back nearing the top of the lane,
swung five wide for the drive, improved position in the final furlong but lacked the needed late response. ZAKKIYYAH lunged at the start, impeded TYCHE
AWAITS YOU and was off a bit slowly, rushed up to the lead in the early stages, set a pressured pace on the turn, could not match strides in the final
furlong and tired late.

Footnotes
COWBOYS DAUGHTER sent after an alert beginning, set modest fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, dictated terms to the quarter
marker, quickened leaving the second turn and drew clear nearing the furlong pole, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task in the late
stages to prevail. MISS EVER READY allowed to settle in the early stages, roused four wide on the far turn, swung widest for the drive, made a prolonged
rally in the lane, put mild pressure on the winner in the final stages and was second best in the end. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) a bit slow into stride early on,
allowed to settle along the first turn, pulled along the backstretch run, chased along the inside to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit of COWBOYS
DAUGHTER to mid-stretch and could not muster the needed late response, while just saving third. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY forwardly placed in the early stages,
stalked the modest fractions to the second turn, could not keep pace in the drive, did not offer a late rally and just missed for show. HARBOR ABBEY
stalked the pace into the first turn, made a steady advance to the second turn, came within aim while three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased to
mid-stretch and lacked a late response. FOCUS FIRST bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, tracked the early pace, lost contact on the second
turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) allowed to settle in the early stages, well placed along the backstretch run, roused three wide nearing the quarter marker,
responded to urging in the drive, came within aim in deep stretch and made a final surge in the final strides to prevail. SHANGHAI MIST prominent in the
early going, stalked the modest fractions to the second turn, ran in pursuit of ARISTEIA to mid-stretch, overtook that rival nearing the sixteenth-marker, held
a narrow advantage to the final strides and was nailed on the line for the win. MOONSHINE CAT unhurried in the early stages, roused four wide on the
second turn, closed with a rush inside of the furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch, finished well and missed for second in the final strides, while
getting up in time to secure third. ARISTEIA assumed command leaving the break and set the early pace, carved out modest fractions to the quarter marker,
held foes at bay to mid-stretch, could not hold off SHANGHAI MIST nearing the sixteenth-marker and grudgingly gave way in the late stages. COCOA
CENTS took back off of the early pace and tracked the modest fractions, saved ground to the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
HAPPY DOES broke out at the start but was away in good order and was allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced while outside of rivals on the far
turn, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, headed MOTHER'S PRAYER nearing the furlong marker, dueled with that game rival to deep stretch and
determinedly prevailed in the final strides. MOTHER'S PRAYER tracked the solid early pace, advanced nearing the quarter marker, met the bid of HAPPY
DOES nearing the furlong marker, dueled with that foe to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides, while holding well in the end for place.
SEA DOG took back off of the solid early pace, tracked the loose leader to the far turn, advanced nearing the furlong grounds, angled out inside of the
furlong pole, was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and held for show in the final strides. MASTERY KAT away a step slowly, allowed to settle in the
early stages, saved ground to the far turn, swung four wide for the drive, advanced in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and just missed for
show. NAUVOO broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while on a clear lead to the far turn, was overtaken nearing the top of the
lane and tired in the drive.

DE LA LUNA allowed to settle early on, unhurried through the backstretch run, roused four wide on the far turn, confronted KIT KAT MAN in upper stretch,
battled with that foe to mid-stretch, dueled inside of the furlong marker against the game runner-up and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. KIT KAT
MAN broke alertly and sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted to the far turn, met the bid of DE LA LUNA in upper stretch, battled
gamely to deep stretch with the winner and grudgingly gave way in the final strides, while besting the rest. BLUEGRASS RYDER forwardly placed in the
early stages, a bit keen entering the clubhouse turn and created traffic issues behind him, stalked the moderate pace to the far turn, chased to mid-stretch,
could not make headway on the top pair in the late stages and was clear for show in the end. TELOS stalked the early pace, raced outside of rivals along
the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, could not sustain that bid in the stretch run and flattened out in the final furlong. SECRET
TREASURE allowed to settle in the early stages, encountered traffic entering the first turn, raced in the second flight through the backstretch run, was asked
for run while within range nearing the top of the lane and lacked the needed late response. G'S LAST CHANCE bumped at the start and away a step slowly,
rushed up to be close to the early pace, tracked the moderate fractions to the far turn, dropped back in the drive and weakened. CORAZON DE LUCIA
unhurried in the early stages and did not factor in the drive. BRONZE ONE encountered traffic entering the first turn and steadied while in tight quarters,
settled in the second flight to the half-mile marker, lost position on the far turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' HOT showed early speed and dictated terms to the turn, disputed the solid fractions with SUBURBAN PRINCE to the half-mile marker, shook free
of that rival nearing the quarter marker, bore out at the top of the lane and lost position nearing the furlong marker, came again in deep stretch and bested
SUBURBAN PRINCE in the final strides to prevail. SUBURBAN PRINCE hustled leaving the break, disputed the solid early fractions with SMOKIN' HOT to
the half-mile marker, lost ground to that rival nearing the quarter pole, assumed command in upper stretch when SMOKIN' HOT bore out, was all out in
deep stretch and was bested in the final strides by the winner, while holding well in the end for place. HOT JOURNEY allowed to settle while not far back in
the early stages, maintained position to the second turn, raced two wide to the top of the lane, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, battled against
SUBURBAN PRINCE in deep stretch but was held at bay by that rival and was outfinished in the final strides, while clear of the rest for show. ITS
THIEVERY unhurried in the early going, improved position on the backstretch run, was asked for run three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not make
headway in the drive and finished evenly in the final furlong. IMPACT ZONE tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, well positioned through the
backstretch run while saving ground, lost position nearing the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
SUNSET PAYNTER broke slow and lagged at the back of the field while saving ground to the turn, began to pass horses inside of the three furlong marker,
swung out and circled the field, entering the stretch run in the six-path, then commenced a bold rally down the middle of the track and was up in plenty of
time. GET MY POINT tracked the dueling leaders to the turn, hooked a game HOT LINK in a battle the length of the stretch, got the best of that rival in the
end but was passed on the outside by the winner in the shadow of the wire. HOT LINK close early, began a bid passing the half mile pole, tipped out to the
three path in the stretch to challenge the leader, was in turn joined by GET MY POINT for the stretch run and battled that one to the wire only to be out
finished for the place. DRINKUP BUTTERCUP broke alertly and was sent to the front, dueled to the turn with STANDFORGRIT to the inside, opened up a
clear lead on the turn, came into the stretch in the two path racing greenly, still fought on gamely but tired in the final furlong. MO TOWN GAL outrun early,
came under a mild ride from the five furlong pole, made a mild late bid and managed to split the field. SHE'S FANCY LIKE stayed to to the inside from the
break, was not able to keep up with the early pace, re-rallied from the half mile pole, tipped out for the stretch run but was unable to find another gear.
STANDFORGRIT away well and contested the early pace, was unable to match strides with STANDFOR GRIT from the three furlong pole, hung in there for
a bit but tired from earlier efforts. WHEREDIDITGO lacked early speed, raced wide down the backstretch, came under a hard ride with three furlongs to run,
steadied briefly when SUNSET PAYNTER passed in front of him, mustered a bit of a late surge while switching to the inside and finished up evenly while
unable to improve position. LUCKY LOCKETT was up close early tracking the dueling pacesetters, never found another gear passing the three furlong pole
and fell back.
