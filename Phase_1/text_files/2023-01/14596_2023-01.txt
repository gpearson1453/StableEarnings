Footnotes
SPY NOVEL pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. CYCLONE RANGER stalked the pace from the rail, got
through in upper stretch and stayed on to be clearly second best. JOHN MACARTHUR hopped at the start, advanced three wide around the first turn to
reach a tracking position, bid three wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner turning for home but weakened in the drive. PONTI PRIDE
exchanged bumps with MATRO the first time through the stretch, raced two and three wide in midpack and never threatened. MATRO exchanged bumps
with PONTI PRIDE the first time through the stretch, saved ground off the pace and made little further impact. KEYSER set the pace along the rail, yielded
near the quarter pole, drifted out in the stretch and tired. IMDABESTINTHEWORLD had his head turned at the start, raced along the rail and was never
involved. SMART N SHARP was outrun while racing three wide. BEFRIENDTHEENEMY played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
RUBYSA got bumped on both sides out of the gate, tracked the pace from the five path, bid from the four path when cued approaching the quarter pole,
took the lead while floating out to the seven path in upper stretch, and held sway. RADIANT GEM rated in the three path, angled out to the eight path under
urging going into the stretch, and rallied down the center for place honors. STRATEGY QUEEN chased in the three path, was ridden from the five path
going into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. LA COSTA broke in slightly and brushed with RUBYSA at the start, raced off the pace in the four path,
was coaxed while taking aim from the seven path going into the stretch, chased RUBYSA in upper stretch before flattening out in the final furlong.
KATIESDREAMGIRL trailed from the four path into the stretch and never factored. HAY HAY PAULA bumped into RUBYSA at the start, prompted the early
pace in the three path, was keen along the inside of rivals passing the half, and was empty going into the stretch. SCENIC VIEW stalked the pace in the five
path but faded from the four path in upper stretch. POLITELY CROWNED set the pace in the four path but gaveway from the three path in the stretch.

three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and finished strongly. HUASTECO set the pace in the two path, led past the eighth and held on for the show.
NOVA FOLHA rated three wide in midpack, bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out in the final furlong. MEHLEK saved ground and failed to menace.

SMOKEY WHITE tracked in the four path, was ridden in the five path going into the stretch, got bumped out to the six path by FROSTED ARMOUR passing
the eighth pole, and rallied in the final furlong to get up in the final sixteenth. MIGHTY TOUGH brushed with FROSTED ARMOUR out of the gate, rated in
the two path, angled out to seven path going into the stretch, and ran on down the center for place. FROSTED ARMOUR brushed with MIGHTY TOUGH at
the start, stalked along the inside into the turn, bumped SMOKEY WHITE while shifting out to the five path under urging passing the eighth pole, and kept
on for show honors. CAMINERO prompted the pace in the four path, bid while in hand passing the three eighths pole, took a narrow lead from the three
path into the stretch, but flattened in the final sixteenth. CARAMEL CHIP chased in the five path, was hustled from the six path into the stretch, but was no
factor. HIGH YIELD KITTEN trailed from the eight path turning into the stretch and was no threat. RAISE THE RENT set the pace in the two path but
gaveway along the inside passing the eighth pole.

SUPER CHOW bumped with CAJUN DREAM at the start, set the pace in the three path, was roused while floating out to the seven path going into the
stretch, drifted out through the stretch, and held sway. TURBO stalked along the inside, was driven from the three path into the stretch, and ran on for place.
TWO OF A KIND got bumped into CAJUN DREAM by an inward breaking DANGEROUS RIDE at the start, pressed the pace in the four path, was urged
from the eight path into the stretch, and flattened while drifting in but held on to show. X Y POINT tracked in the five path but was never a factor.
DANGEROUS RIDE broke in and bumped into TWO OF A KIND at the start, trailed from the six path into the turn, and never threatened. CAJUN DREAM
got bumped on both sides and had to steady at the start, chased in the three path but never menaced.

Footnotes
INFINITE DIAMOND stalked the pace from the rail, cut the corner into the lane to take the lead, shot clear under right-handed pressure then held safe under
minimal urging in the final sixteenth. PADMA tracked the pace four wide, bid in upper stretch, was no match for the winner and just lasted for the place.
LYNX raced off the pace two wide between foes, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and just missed second. ARELLA STAR set the pace in
the two path, was collared turning for home and weakened through the lane. MISS UCRANIA was outrun while racing two wide. LOOKING FOR HOPE
bobbled at the break, hugged the rail for six furlongs, angled out in the stretch and was never a threat. ALMA ROSA failed to menace while racing five wide.
ATTHECROSSROADS stalked the pace three wide and faltered leaving the quarter pole.

Footnotes
HE'SPUREGOLD bumped with BEMMA'S BOY just after the start, raced prominently from the two path, floated out to the seven path under encouragement
turning into the stretch, bid passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. BEUYS (IRE) rated in the two path, swung out to the eight path going into the stretch,
and chased home the winner for place. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) tracked in the two path, angled out around the far turn and was out in the nine path
entering the lane, and ran on to get up for show. BEMMA'S BOY bumped with HE'SPUREGOLD just after the start, chased in the three path, had to circle
out to the ten path turning into the stretch, and mildly gained. EVER DANGEROUS stalked in the three path, was roused to bid from the five path passing
the quarter pole and into the lane, but flattened late. A ROSE FOR RAVEN set the pace from inside but yielded going into the final furlong. EASY TIME got
bumped by a pair of outer rivals at the start, then bumped with FREEDOM MATTERS into the first turn, trailed from the four path, had to steady approaching
the half, and never factored. OMAHA CITY prompted the pace in the two path but faded in the stretch. ROYAL LUCK (CHI) broke in sharply at the start and
bumped FREEDOM MATTERS and EASY TIME, was unhurried form the four path early and never threatened. DIAMOND OOPS raced in midpack from the
three path but was empty going into the lane. FREEDOM MATTERS got bumped by ROYAL LUCK at the start, then got bumped by EASY TIME going into
the first turn, raced from wellback in the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
LEGACY ISLE set a fast pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted out under left-handed urging leaving the sixteenth pole and lasted.
DREAMING OF KONA prompted the pace two wide, was inching closer in the lane, was forced out by a drifting LEGACY ISLE leaving the sixteenth pole,
switched back to the left lead in the process, regained some momentum and was gaining late. LORD MILES settled off the pace outside, raced four wide
around the turn, kicked in leaving the eighth pole and was rapidly gaining late. GENERAL JIM stalked the pace from the rail, tried to angle out nearing the
quarter pole but was hemmed in just behind the leader by DREAMING OF KONA, lacked a path through most of the stretch, found some clear sailing when
LEGACY ISLE drifted late and was outfinished for the minor awards. LAVER tracked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane. MR BOB
bobbled at the start, steadied midway down the chute, raced well back two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and finished with some interest. IL MIRACOLO
raced two wide in midpack and lacked a closing bid. BABY BILLY failed to menace while racing two wide. WINE EMPIRE bumped with FLIPARINO at the
start, steadied near the half-mile pole, raced three wide and was never involved. FLIPARINO bumped at the start, steadied midway down the chute, raced
five wide and was never close. EYES ON THE KING had only brief speed four wide. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER
OF DREAMING OF KONA, LEGACY ISLE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.

Footnotes
KITTEN MISCHIEF raced prominently from the four path, was cued while making a bid from said position passing the quarter pole, took the lead from the
seven path into the lane, and held gamely. INFLATION ADJUSTED tracked in the four path, ranged up from the five path under urging rounding the final
turn, took aim from the eight path entering the stretch, and ran on for place. SIX MINUS was unhurried from the two path, angled out to the six path going
into the stretch, and kept on for show. SHADIZAAR trailed from the four path, swung out to the nine path entering the lane, and improved position.
KARTANO stalked in the three path, got shuffled back near the quarter pole and was driven from the six path into the stretch, but flattened. RACE CRAFT
bumped with WHAT SAY THEE at the start, rated in the three path, cut the corner turning into the lane, but was tired. SURROGATE was held up in the four
path early but never menaced. MALEX (GB) set the pace in the two path, was roused into the final turn, but yielded going into the final furlong. WHAT SAY
THEE bumped with RACE CRAFT at the start, prompted the pace in the three path but gaveway entering the final furlong.
