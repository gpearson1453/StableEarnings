OUR SOUTHERN GIRL was taken back early, advanced eight wide through the turn, was closing fast and was up in time for the win. CITYONTHENILE set
a pressured early pace from the inside, opened up in mid stretch and was tagged in the final strides. GIRONA pressed the early pace, raced five wide into
the turn, drifted out early stretch, was gaining late and finished a game third. GRAN MANNA was void of any early speed, raced between rivals and finished
with a mild late rally. SHE HIT A HOMER was not far back early, went four wide into the turn, took a brief lead, couldn't sustain and gave way. SHELLY
D'ORO tracked the early pace, raced seven wide and flattened out. MINDOFMYOWN was allowed to settle early from the inside, drifted out through the turn
and faded.
