Footnotes
ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE broke a step slow and was a touch rank, found a seam leaving the chute and eagerly pulled his way to the inside of rivals to take
command, set a rated pace two wide and took some pressure, shook clear when roused entering the lane, dug in when confronted from the outside in mid
stretch, kept on tenaciously under right handed asks and proved resolute to the wire. CELTIC COUSEN was rated back off foes soon after the break and
stalked four wide in hand, rolled up four wide under some coaxing into the lane, switched over to his left lead three sixteenths out, loomed outside the
winner in mid stretch but was denied. CROSSLAND , between rivals early disputing the pace, stayed on to force the issue around the turn, fought on
between foes into the lane, shifted in and went evenly through the final furlong. RAPPER ZAPPER , sluggish from the start, was ridden along leaving the far
turn, came three wide for the drive and lacked a serious punch. CLASSIC LEGEND saved ground with pursuit, made a slight move mid turn, failed to
sustain in mid stretch and faded. TO LIVE IS TO LOVE saved ground leaving the far turn and was outrun. HE ROLLS , three deep with the early pace,
dropped back mid turn.

MISS CASEY took over soon after the break, set a rated pace towards the rail, was guided two wide and set down entering the lane, spurted away in mid
stretch, was given a couple right handed asks then eagerly kept on under solid hand urging to the wire. UTTERLY ENCHANTING rated forwardly while
saving ground, edged up inside foes mid turn, eased out for the drive and gave game chase while second best. SHINY PENNY broke a step slow,was sent
up soon after and chased three wide, shifted five wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. HAD THE NOTION lagged back, angled well wide in the drive
and got past tiring rivals. FORTES stalked two wide, was pushed along between runners heading into the lane and gave way. GOLDEN ACCOUNT saved
ground and flattened out. CALYPSO GHOST , three deep pursuing past the three eighths, came four wide for the drive and retreated.

Footnotes
BORUFF , away alertly, prompted the pace two wide outside the leader, dropped back a bit under asking past the five sixteenths, shifted out entering the
lane, came back under left handed asks, took command leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear. BEST CHOICE BABY sped to the front, set a pressured
pace inside and under some rating, spurted away heading to the quarter pole, kept on under a drive leaving mid stretch, dug in when re engaged soon after
and gave way grudgingly. SHERIFF RONNIE was steadily along when pulling his way forward heading to the turn, steadied between runners mid turn,
angled out for the drive and kept on with some effort. RASCALLY REBEL checked sharply when nearing the turn, regrouped and angled in, made some
headway into the stretch, eased out past mid stretch but lacked a solid finish. MOON SIGN , three deep forcing the early pace, gave way. MUNGO MAGIC ,
off the pace, raced between rivals near the quarter pole, shifted out but lacked a bid. ASK HIM OAKEY broke slowly, edged up five wide outside rivals
nearing the turn, chased and gave way through the drive. SPUNKY IRISHMAN saved ground and weakened.

Footnotes
DOPPELGANGER , bumped at the start, rated back off rivals into the first turn and settled four wide, was patiently handled through the backstretch, picked
up some steam without much coaxing leaving the three eighths, edged up three wide to take aim on the leader into the lane, leveled off when put to a sharp
left handed ask past mid stretch, surged to command with about seventy yards to go, cleared and was taken in hand late. NOSTALGIC RUN , five wide
outside rivals to take command near the seven eighths, opened up when keen and dropped in, continued under rating to the lane, responded when set
down, kept on gamely but could not resist the winner's charge. JARDANI drafted back off the pace and saved some ground, raced between rivals around
the far turn, was under pressure past the five sixteenths, angled four wide and churned on. TATE , in a bit tight at the break, settled wide off the pace,
circled five wide into the stretch but failed to sustain. GALLANT GOLD broke outward and bumped the winner, stalked three wide, failed to kick on in upper
stretch and faded. SHOFAR saved ground and dropped back leaving the far turn. ROMP flashed speed between foes, rated off the leader, raced two wide
past the half and faded.

Footnotes
THE CAIRO KID tracked inside and was under coaxing mid turn, eased out to be two wide and inside rivals in upper stretch, closed relentlessly under left
handed urging and just got up between rivals to prove best. KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE , taken to rate three wide early, angled out leaving the far turn and
commenced a run, advanced four wide outside rivals into the lane, came in slightly when gaining in mid stretch, corrected and sustained his rally, moved on
near even terms in deep stretch and just missed in game effort. PIT STOP MAN drifted out at the break and bumped with a foe, righted and accelerated to
the front, cleared and set a rated pace towards the rail, opened up around the turn, remained clear under pressure past mid stretch, dug in valiantly when
confronted by rivals in deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. DIALING DIXIE , four wide early, gave hard chase three wide mid turn, moved up
between foes into the stretch, steadied when in tight quarters in mid stretch, regrouped and kept on trying to the wire. MASAI MAN , four wide, moved up
belatedly but failed to make a serious impact. MOJAC KAT , bumped at the break, drafted back in the opening furlong, chased three wide and to the inside
of MASAI MAN around the turn and into the lane, churned on but failed to really menace. SHOULDA HAD IT broke slowly, raced off the pace, saved ground
into the lane, angled out but failed to threaten. An objection by the rider of DIALING DIXIE against KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE for alleged interference in mid
stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
SWEET ASTA , well in hand four to five wide early on, took closer order past the five sixteenths, shifted out a bit when engaging the leader into the lane,
dueled nose to nose while under pressure from the three sixteenths, gained a slim advantage in the final jumps and prevailed. ONLY CHILD stalked the
leader, moved up and bid from the outside near the five sixteenths, was guided five wide with command into the stretch, battled to the inside of the winner
from there and just missed in a sharp try. ICE BAR broke slowly, raced off the pace while saving some ground early, came four wide under pressure into the
stretch, altered wider and finished with good energy. BADGER TOOTH reared up when fractious in the gate, settled four wide early on, made a mild five
wide move past the quarter pole, gave hard chase in mid stretch but came up empty. BRANCO MARIA , off the pace, came three wide for the drive and had
belated action between foes. CASH KID lacked speed while saving ground, eased out late and was trying between rivals. UNDER FIRE , taken three wide
early then stalked under asking, chased four wide into the lane and faded. STIMULUS MAKER cleared early and set the pace towards the rail, was joined
leaving the three eighths, sparred past the five sixteenths, failed to go on with the leaders into the lane, was cautiously handled from there and faded.
AFTERMATH saved ground a long way and failed to menace. SIR TERRE , three wide, edged up to be in range past the five sixteenths, lacked s punch
past mid stretch and faded.

SEVEN'S ELEVEN vied inside of his stable mate while under nice handling, spurted away when shaken up into the lane, widened under strong handling
near mid stretch then held firm while solidly hand ridden the final sixteenth. NO EASY DAYS tracked a contested pace while about three wide, was shoved
along
mid
turn,
shifted
four
wide
into
the
lane,
failed
to
impact
the
winner
but
churned
on
willingly
to
gain
the
place
outside
rivals.
GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR disputed the pace outside the winner, was under pressure when shifted out into the lane, failed to match strides from there
and gave way grudgingly. DOVER BLUFF was steadied back from between rivals leaving the chute, dropped in and was rated off the pace, awaited room
leaving the three eighths, eased out for room into the lane and finished well. QUICK QUICK WHIT , between foes with pursuit, dropped in for the drive but
lacked a rally. MARGIE'S FUN SON , four wide a long way, was under a ride into the stretch and failed to menace. TREASURER , sluggish from the gate,
settled off the pace while saving some ground, eased out into the turn, crept up then swung five wide entering the lane, appeared poised for a run, raced on
his left lead and came up empty. HE'S PURE TALENT saved ground chasing, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
HOPE HAS A NAME broke slowly, was urged up soon after and gained outside a rival entering the turn, chased an embattled trio past the five sixteenths,
dropped in and responded to strong handling, forged to command along the rail leaving mid stretch, widened and coasted home the final sixty yards.
STARSHIP LAOBAN took command leaving the chute and went clear, set the pace just off the inside, was joined by a pair of rivals from her outside leaving
the far turn, staved off pressure and briefly went clear into the lane, was hooked by the winner along the fence, failed to contain and kept on willingly to be
second best. STAND BY YOU rated in the clear early on, edged up three wide into the stretch, swung out near mid stretch but lacked a serious finish.
HASHTAG LUCKY prompted the pace three to four wide, bid three deep mid turn, pressed and faded through the final furlong. ACADIAN GIRL attended the
pace three wide, moved to apply more pressure while between runners past the three furlong pole, vied to the quarter pole, stayed on willingly past the
eighth pole then faded. LADY MACHO , off the pace and off the inside, came five wide for the drive and failed to menace. CARROLL GIRL chased the early
pace while saving ground, faltered nearing the lane, shifted out and was eased late. TIMES CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

FARTLEK , in close attendance of a contested pace while five wide, was under asking pursuing the dueling leaders past the five sixteenths, drop back a bit
nearing mid stretch, found more under left handed asking, switched over to his left lead, kept on grinding to take over outside foes in deep stretch then was
widening at the wire. SPECTRIER disputed the pace inside rivals while just off the inside, clung to a short lead into the lane, drifted out a bit when headed
near mid stretch, corrected and battled back to re take the lead, fought gamely to the end but wasn't quite good enough. I AM THE MIKE , in the four path
contesting the pace, held a slim lead near mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. CALIFORNIA GHOST , off the pace and off the inside past the five eighths,
angled six wide for the drive, raced on his left lead and closed steadily. FOWL NATION moved up to engage the leader three wide around the first turn,
battled between rivals from the three quarter pole, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. OVER THE BORDER rated back off foes soon after the break,
angled in and pulled his way forward nearing the backstretch, eased back to stalk the dueling leaders, had aim while under pressure past the five sixteenths,
failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and gave way. RUN ROCKY RUN drifted out at the break, straightened then dropped in through the backstretch,
chased along the rail into the lane but lacked a bid.
