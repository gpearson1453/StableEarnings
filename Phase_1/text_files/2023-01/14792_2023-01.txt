turn, was roused for more late on that bend, rallied outside while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and closed well to get up in the final sixteenth
and prevail. TREVOR BARDETTE was hustled from the gate then chased the early pace, made a bid passing the half-mile pole, vied in the two path around
the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch, dueled with ESCAPE MISSION while brushing with that foe, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was
caught while clear for the place. MAKART was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, came out in front of a foe inside the five-eighths,
dropped in late on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, moved off the rail while shaken up in upper stretch, shifted further out inside the furlong
marker, was given one flash of a left-handed crop shortly thereafter then gained under a mild-hand ride late to get the show. ESCAPE MISSION smashed
through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, was hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied along the
rail on the turn, dueled with the runner-up while brushing with that foe in the stretch, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. PATRICK THE
GREAT pressed then chased the pace on the outside, pursued the leader in the four path around the turn and tired. TIZA BROWN bobbled at the start, was
urged towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide at the quarter-pole, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and failed to threaten.
IGOTTAHAVEIT was taken up when MAKART came out inside the five-eighths then dropped back while the rider pulled down her goggles, went three then
four wide under urging around the turn , came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. THE FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS OMITTED DUE TO A

Footnotes
PHOEBE'S FROSTY coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of CENTAVO from the get go and narrowly showed the way under some pressure through the
first turn and down the backstretch, began to shake off that rival at the three-eighths when confronted by B C GLORY DAYS to the outside, had that rival get
on near even terms and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, shook off that foe digging in straightened away, then went clear holding well to the finish
to prevail. KONG LOVES A FIGHT chased inside early on and then two to three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the place honors. B C GLORY DAYS came under coaxing from
the gate and was forced to steady off the heels of GIRAMONTE just after the start when that foe took over the lane in front, raced three then two wide
through the first turn before settling four wide down the backstretch, began to advanced four then three wide through the far turn latching on the top pair at
the three-eighths, offered up a bid to be heads apart for command swinging five wide for home, then got shaken off straightened away and weakened.
CENTAVO brushed the off side stall at the start, came under coaxing and dueled from the two path getting shaken off just inside three furlongs to go, spun
three wide for home and tired. GIRAMONTE four then three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing half a mile from
home, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. LORD BROWNIE five then four wide through the first turn, chased five then four wide down the
backstretch before tucking three wide when placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, briefly raced in the two path midway on the turn before angling back

Footnotes
MAMA'S GOLD showed good speed, dictated terms while inside through the turn, extended the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, was shaken up some
in upper stretch and powered away under a hand-ride while kept to the task. WEST STAR broke out and bumped the hindquarters of a rival then was taken
up, spotted the front a few lengths, was hard ridden at the rear, went four then five wide around the turn and improved to get the place. CAMM' DUKE was
bumped in the hindquarters at the start, brushed with a foe early, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn and weakened
while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch but held the show. LIEUTENANT SAM was ridden along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed
to threaten. MILAGROSO chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back into the turn, went two to three wide around the bend and capitulated. HOT
ROD LINCOLN brushed the inside of the gate at the start, was taken in hand while crowded early then dropped back, saved ground around the turn, moved
off the rail outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. THE CATILLAC KID was urged along off the pace, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and retreated. M. C. DOUBLE R was hustled from the gate then brushed with a rival early, raced on the
outside under urging, dropped back in the four path around the turn and faltered.

AFLEET ARLENE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from DARN THAT SONG to the outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive to prevail. DARN THAT SONG coaxed from the start,
prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, got shaken off by
the top one proving no match in the stretch while running on clear for the place honors. HANDLE THE TRUTH coaxed from the gate, chased three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. AMERICA'S PRIDE chased five
wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. SHEZA RAJUN CAJUN chased four wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, tired. PREDETERMINED stumbled at the start, recovered to chase along the inside coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. MIDMON away well, chased six then five paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch, trailed and was eased home to the finish. PER NEW YORK RACING

Footnotes
GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS dropped back while void of speed then angled out early, lagged well behind the rest of the field, went three to four wide around the
turn, dropped inward in upper stretch, rallied in the two path into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead coming to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear
under good handling. CRYPTO CASH broke out at the start, settled under some urging, saved ground around the turn, came four wide into the stretch then
moved further out, gained into the final furlong, made a bid near the sixteenth-pole, had the rider lose his crop late and was outfinished while just able to get
the place. COOL QUARTET was coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the three path around the turn, was driven five wide
into the stretch, gained while remaining on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, made a bid around the
sixteenth-pole but was out-kicked then just missed the place while able to get the show. MY FRIENDS BEER settled off the pace, was roused four to five
wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, gained outside into the final furlong, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. OPTIC
WAY was fractious in the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, issued a challenge at the five-sixteenths, gained the
lead in the four path in upper stretch, led under a drive until just before the furlong marker then was headed and weakened. AIR SHOW was hustled from
the gate, moved up to set the pace under pressure, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage while off the rail in upper stretch and gave way. DARK
STORM was last to commence, moved up under urging, chased four wide around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and came up empty.
BALLYDOOLEY (GB) was hustled from the gate, moved in while showing speed, pressed the pace down the backstretch, came up empty in the two path
early on the turn and retreated.

WHO HOO THATS ME was coaxed along on the outside, chased four wide around the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong,
gained the lead just inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. EXCELLENT TIMING went to the front, contested the pace on the outside,
shook clear outside the half-mile pole, controlled the action in the three path around the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, led under a drive into
the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. BIG ENGINE dropped well behind under urging, traveled three wide around the turn and
improved for the show. LISTENTOYOURHEART was fractious in the gate then backed out and reloaded, chased the pace down the backstretch, saved
ground for most of the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and tired. BREW PUB was urged along on the outside,
moved in leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS was sent hard from the start, disputed
the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped back outside the half-mile pole, chased in the two path around the turn and capitulated. CHOWDA was urged
along off the pace, dropped back three to four wide around the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. ALL TIMES WERE

Footnotes
BETSY BLUE five then four wide in pursuit, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive steadily
gaining on the leader to take command just inside the sixteenths marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. PIECE OF MY HEART coaxed from the
gate, chased three then two wide and came under coaxing when briefly along the rail three furlongs from home, angled four then three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive between foes from just inside the eighth to just inside the sixteenth pole and ran on to secure the place honors. MISS T TOO
coaxed from the gate, led briefly clear early on before coming under pressure from FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI and SELF ISOLATION, tucked inside through
the turn shaking off one rival while under pressure from SELF ISOLATION, shook off that foe with five-sixteenths to go and spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a new pair of rivals, got collared just inside the sixteenth marker while fighting on to the finish. SELF
ISOLATION prompted the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. FLIGHT
TO SHANGHAI bobbled at the break while under hustling, prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired.

Footnotes
SLIP MAHONEY disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, bumped with a rival near the five-eighths, vied along the rail around the turn, came off the
inside into the stretch, drifted out while battling with the runner-up near the eighth-pole, dueled gamely with that foe in the final furlong and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. CRUPI dropped well behind while completely void of speed, gained midway down the backstretch, advanced inside on the
turn, came out three wide into the stretch then made a bid outside of the winner, dueled with that foe to the wire and just missed while well clear for the
place. GOOD RAPPORT contested the pace between horses, was bumped on both sides near the five-eighths then pinched back, chased three wide
around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and weakened while able to hold the show. ALTERNATE REALITY dropped off the pace, was urged
three to four wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MERCANTE was urged along on the outside, dropped back four
wide around the turn and came up empty. LIGHT THE WAY was urged along off the pace, dropped back two to three wide on the turn and capitulated.
FAST BOAT TO SKYE contested the pace on the outside of two foes, bumped with a rival near the five-eighths, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped
back late on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. WAVE ACTION was ridden along towards the rear, went four then three wide
around the turn and was no factor. YORKSHIRE PRINCE was urged along well back in the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor.
