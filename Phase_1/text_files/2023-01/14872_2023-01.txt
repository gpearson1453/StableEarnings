Footnotes
AWESOME HEIGHTS bumped at the start, saved ground on the backstretch had to pause briefly early on the turn when rival took spot, waited for room and
split foes passing the sixteenth and inhaled tiring leader under confident handling. CHIEF EAGLE EYE sent clear and spurted away from rivals on the
backstretch, continued clear into the turn and into the stretch, drifted out into the three path and began to get weary, implored late by rider but was no match
for strong closing inside rival. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA away best, settled into a outside stalking position, continued two wide on the turn and launched bid
widest, outclosed by inside rival while under urging. ABOVE THE LAW chased sent leader on the backstretch, stayed off the rail on the turn and into the
lane, in range mid-stretch and outfinished by closing rivals. VIVIAN'S BOY stalked leader off rail on the backstretch, went to rail early on the turn and saved
ground into the lane, launched bid along the rail and outfinished by outside rivals. RAYRAY settled off the pace and off the rail on the backstretch, continued
off the rail on the turn, attempted to launched bid in the four path in the lane but lacked needed response to improve. COJO bumped with outside rival at the
start, quickly lost touch with field, entered lane in the five path and never threatened.
