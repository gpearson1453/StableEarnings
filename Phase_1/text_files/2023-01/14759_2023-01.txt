BLUE MOUNTAIN contested the pace inside, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and held on under steady handling. LAS VEGAS BLVD contested the
pace two deep, was met approaching the quarter pole but dug in to remain a close stretch factor. PHANTOM QUEEN chased inside, raced near the rail on
the turn and ran evenly down the lane. SHY BELLA chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. JUJU ON DA
BEAT gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out into the lane and finished evenly. LADY GANGSTER gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. FAR MORE became a bit edgy in the gate then chased outside and rounded the turn in the four
and five paths. A GIRL HAS A NAME saved ground.

Footnotes
JAMMIN JIMTOWN saved ground off the pace and was rated close through the backstretch, eased out with a bid at the quarter pole, exchanged light
contact with Antipoison past the pole, dueled to the front leaving the eighth pole and raced clear inside the sixteenth. HONOR THE FLEET settled close in
the three and four paths, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and had the lead past the five sixteenths, gave up the lead on the far turn but held on for
second. GOLDEN APPEAL rounded the opening turn six wide and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, eased out with a bid into the
backstretch, came through the far turn about the four path and finished evenly to take third the final strides. ANTIPOISON rounded the first turn five wide
and settled off the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, exchanged light contact with Jammin Jimtown in the four path leaving the quarter pole then
flattened stride inside the sixteenth. MIRACLE SILVER stalked inside, gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn.
PROTA took the lead five wide into the first turn then moved toward the inside to rate the pace, was met and dueled Honor The Fleet from the three eighths
pole, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. ONE TWO KID settled off the pace in the three and four paths, raced
wide into the backstretch and was not a factor. NORTHERN RIDGE raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the second turn
but faded through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul for alleged interference past the quarter pole, lodged by the rider
of Antipoison, against the rider of Jammin Jimtown.

Footnotes
MARVELLA NASTY took the lead at the three quarter pole and tapered in to rate the pace, was urged away from the five sixteenths pole, extended her lead
at the rail on the far turn then taken in hand the final sixteenth. ONEPRETTYTHING settled close off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths
pole and rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled to a clear second later yards. SEEDS OF TIME saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, then relented in the stretch duel for second. ONLY REWARD'S settled back off the rail on the
first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and ran evenly through the lane. MY EXPENSIVE GIFT saved
early ground, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM
rated close inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. SO RED THE ROSE rounded the opening turn in the
four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. CATHERINES WARRIOR came away a bit
awkwardly and raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response through the backstretch.
