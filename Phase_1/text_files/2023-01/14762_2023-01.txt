Footnotes
SAILOR SPEED was well rated early on the inside, then made a inside middle move to take over leaving the five eighths marker, drew off on the turn, then
was kept to a mild drive to remain clear to prove best. ICE BAR was allowed to settle early and saved ground throughout, then finished well late to be clearly
second best. BOSSY CAT set a pressured pace early while in the two path, then chased the winner on the turn, ran on to the wire to best the rest.
AMERICAN FORCES pressed the pace three wide, then chased four wide by the quarter pole and faded. PEAKY BLINKERS was off slowly, then saved
ground and had some late gain. LONG TOM was settled three wide and had no rally. PRINCIPALITY stalked the pace four wide and tired.

GOLDEN ACCOUNT was allowed to settle early on the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, then closed full of run on the inside to edge away late
under a drive. REAWAKENED set a pressured pace while in the two path, shook clear leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, but was caught
late by the winner, second best. FALSE RULING tracked the early pace, then made a bid nearing the quarter pole on the inside, tipped out leaving the turn
but weakened, bested rest. LA LENA pressed the pace three wide and came four wide into the drive and was empty. SHASHKA chased the pace three wide
and came five wide into the lane and weakened. OUR JESSICA JOAN broke in the air and was far back and was not a threat.
