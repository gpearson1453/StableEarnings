Footnotes
MR. SWAGGER coaxed from the gate, came outwards bumping TREATY OBLIGATION, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, had PAROS advance inside attempting to tip out five-sixteenths from home and denied the move perching just to that rival's outside, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in gamely to best the runner up to the wire. REGISTER coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared a furlong out, fought on inside gamely to the finish to be along clear for the place honors, second best. TREATY OBLIGATION broke awkwardly
when losing his rear footing, then got bumped by MR. SWAGGER, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the
turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, improved position to procure the show honors.
ASMODEUS broke in at the start under coaxing, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered four then three wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. PAROS chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths and was attempting to tip out but could not due to the presence of MR. SWAGGER to the outside, followed the leader taking the inside route
into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. GOTTA CONNECT broke in at the start and was hustled, chased briefly inside before being put momentarily
in tight and tipped to the two path, grew a bit green but also faced kickback near the nine-sixteenths and began to climb in response before tucking inside
into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled three wide into upper stretch and tired. BIG ELM coaxed from the gate, chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
DATESFREEDOM was coaxed along on the outside, went five wide around the turn under stronger encouragement, rallied into upper stretch, took the lead
coming to the eighth-pole, fought outside of two foes while still on his inside lead in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. CHARGER
followed the clear leader down the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn, gained four wide into the stretch under a drive, took the lead just
inside the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner near the eighth-pole, battled between horses in the final furlong and just missed while able to
get the place. COUSIN ANDREW moved out early then was urged along off the pace, dropped in to save ground around the turn, came off the rail
approaching the quarter-pole, rallied to make a bid inside of two foes outside the eighth-pole, lugged out a bit while battling with those opponents into the
final sixteenth and missed while well clear for the show. TURNSANDCONDITIONS was coaxed along on the outside, chased in the four path around the
turn, gained five wide into the stretch under a drive, pursued the leader under into the final furlong and weakened. ALITE settled on the outside at the rear,
went three wide early on the turn, dropped to the two path then rail later on that bend and failed to threaten. FENWAY went straight to the front, angled in
while speeding clear early, powered away to a sizable advantage, raced inside around the turn, shortened stride late on that bend, was swallowed up while
exhausted in upper stretch and faded.

furlongs from home, remained just off the inside shaking away through the far turn and coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cornered just off the

Footnotes
BUSTIN HOT was urged along off the pace, went four to five wide around the turn, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late.
SHAMAN PRINCESS tossed her head then lost her footing at the start, was well placed towards the front, shifted from the rail to the three path around the
turn, gained into the stretch, chased the leader into the final furlong then made a bid outside that foe, took a short lead just inside the sixteenth-pole but was
caught while clear for the place. SLOW DOWN SUMMER broke alertly and went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail
on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth and was overtaken while clear for the show
then vanned off in distress after the race. KARA PARA was urged along off the pace, saved ground around the turn, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. LADY BANKER bumped hard with foes on both sides at the start then jostled with a rival, moved up to pressure
the pace on the outside, vied in the two path around the turn and tired. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT bumped hard with a rival at the start then dropped back, was
ridden along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. FLAT OUT PHYLLY broke in and bumped hard with a foe then jostled with that same
rival, dropped back under urging, went around the turn in the six path and failed to threaten. DERWIN'S PAYNTER leaned in at the start and was last to
commence, was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back while moving from five to four wide around the turn, lugged inward in upper stretch and failed to
respond. BLANCHIMENT chased the pace down the backstretch, went three then four wide around the turn and capitulated.

contention near the quarter pole and took over command taking the inside route into upper stretch, received a pair of taps from the crop to the left side, then
went clear ridden out to the finish. CUPIDS GIRL five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along
second best. REIGNING CHICK chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, weakened while
along for the show honors. DIVINE WINE coaxed from the start, prompted the leader from the outside four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. TRUE EMPRESS seven paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and made no headway. GAME THEORY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from DIVINE WINE to the
outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded the front spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. DEVILLY broke out at the
start, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. FREDDYMO FACTOR chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch, made no impact.

MY SWEET WIFE settled on the far outside, was asked five wide on the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch and closed well to get up late and prevail.
DAME CINCO showed speed then pressed the early pace before tracking the leader, issued a challenge in the four path around the turn, gained a short
lead at the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to get the place. TONED UP dropped back while showing
no speed, went two then three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch the moved further out and finished with good energy to garner the
show. LIAM'S KISS bobbled slightly just after the start, showed speed then pressed the pace, took the lead in the three path early on the turn, lost the
advantage at the quarter-pole, fought on well to the sixteenth-pole but was outfinished. FLASHNDYNAMITE was rated early then settled off the pace,
rounded the turn in the two path under some urging, was roused for more around the five-sixteenths, chased the leader into the final furlong, moved out late
and lacked the needed kick. CAIRONI settled on the outside, dropped back inside the three-quarter pole, went three then four wide around the turn, came
five wide into the stretch then was carried out and lacked the needed response. MASHNEE GIRL broke a bit awkwardly and was last away, angled in at the
rear then advanced under urging, took the lead just inside the three-quarter pole, lost the advantage under urging while along the rail early on the turn and
faded.

REPO ROCKS settled under a rating hold just off the inside just off the pace, remained patiently handled until tipped three wide placed to urging at the
five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch quickly inhaling the top pair to take over with three-sixteenths to go, then went clear under a drive
proving much the best. LITTLE VIC three to four wide forwardly placed in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, advanced on the front through the
turn three wide to apply pressure when put to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch now between foes, proved no match for
the top one while running on safe for the place honors. DRAFTED chased three wide down the backstretch before tipping five wide briefly at the
nine-sixteenths, went four wide through the turn patiently handled until called upon five-sixteenths from home, swung six wide into upper stretch and kicked
on belatedly to procure the show honors. PIRATE RICK hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths under developing pressure from a pair to the outside, cornered just off the inside for home, got collared with three-sixteenths to go and
weakened in the final furlong. THREE TWO ZONE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, angled six to seven
wide into upper stretch and tired. SYNTHESIS hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went four wide into
upper stretch and tired. MILTON THE MONSTER chased to to three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
BACKED BY GOLD pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, took over in upper stretch, responded well under threat from the
runner-up in the final furlong and held very gamely under a right-handed crop. ROYAL CURRENCY was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, established
a good position just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path around the turn, shifted four wide while roused at the quarter-pole, gained outside to make a
bid inside the furlong marker, reached even terms with the winner in the final sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. JET SET JULIET went
straight to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to
the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. BANKERS DAUGHTER dropped back then settled
on the outside, went five wide around the turn, was roused late on that bend and lacked the needed response. TRY IT AGAIN settled just off the pace on
the outside, was given her cue in the four path around the turn and came up empty. FANCY FELINE bobbled at the start and bumped with a foe then was
pulled off that rival with a tug of the left-rein, raced at the rear under urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was no
factor. STEAL MY HEART was coaxed along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MAKER'S CANDY coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace four then three wide advancing to take over command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. BOURBON CHASE coaxed from the start, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. DUDLEY
DICKERSON hustled from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and improved position to secure the show honors. FACTUALLY CORRECT established the front
and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from a trio in the early stages, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and yielded the front
with five-sixteenths to go to the eventual winner, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. WHO ME broke out at the start bumping OLLIE
CAN DANCE, prompted the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, faded after the opening half mile, angled five wide into upper
stretch and weakened. WYNN GIANT coaxed from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the
turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. AMERICAN GRANT showed brief speed along the inside, faded into the turn and came under coaxing
midway, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and faltered. OLLIE CAN DANCE bumped at the start by WHO ME, who broke outwards, chased
three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FOUR
EYES chased three wide down the backstretch before tipping four then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven to
eight wide for home and made no impact. INCANTATION hustled from the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn ridden along from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and gave way.
