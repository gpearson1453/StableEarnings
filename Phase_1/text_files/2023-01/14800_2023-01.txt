Footnotes
MI AMARE came out and bumped outside rival at the start, vied outside for lead well clear of nearest rival, continued vying two wide on the turn, got the best
of rival in upper stretch, shook clear in the final sixteenth and proved best. AM YISRAEL CHAI vied inside of rival well clear of second flight on the
backstretch, continued vying for lead on the turn, headed in upper stretch, proved no match when asked and saved second. MIGHTY BOISTEROUS broke
out and bumped rival at the start, track duo three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and kept to task in the lane to earn show.
WETHERLY bit antsy in the gate, away ok, chased duo on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, kept to task in the lane and kept on well
enough to hold position. THISONESFORBARRY settled off the pace and off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, mildly brushed with
inside rival entering the stretch and made mild late progress while widest in the lane. GODDESS APHRODITE bit slow and took up at the start, settled well
off the pace and off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and never threatened. MY BELLA CHICK antsy in the gate, bumped by
inside rival at the start, tracked duo in between rivals in the backstretch, put in tight spot early in the turn and had to shuffle out of the spot, mildly ridden on
the turn, brushed with outside rival entering the lane and had nothing when asked.
