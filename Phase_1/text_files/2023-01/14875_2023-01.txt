Footnotes
BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO broke on top, narrowly set the pace up the backstretch, continued to vie into the turn, disposed of the other speed turning for
home, steadily drew out while kept to pressure. NEXT THURSDAY in the second flight early while three wide and between rivals, dropped to the rail late in
the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. GOLD STRATEGY pressured the issue up front while three wide and in the four
path, chased the winner into the stretch, gradually weakened, finished up best of the rest. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN in the second group while between
horses, had little for the drive to finish up evenly. REAUX BINA lacked speed up the backstretch, dropped to the rail early in the turn causing DIXIE GIRL TO
to steady, continued inside and improved position. ICONIC BONNET with the pace for almost four furlongs while between horses, faltered in the drive.
CALYPSO STREET in the second group well out in the strip, raced four wide through the turn and had little left for the stretch. DANCIN N THEPULPIT in
the second group along the inside, shuffled back along the rail into the turn, failed to mount a rally in the drive. FIRST RATE ROMANCE remained back
while racing two to three wide through the turn. APRIL FLOWER BOUND broke slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, continued to trail turn, picked off
a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. MY MOONLIGHT LADY void of speed while three then four wide late turn, tired dthrough the lane. DIXIE GIRL
TO off a step slow, raced back, steadied when in tight quarters along the rail early in the turn, trailed home. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF DIXIE GIRL TO AGAINST REAUX BINA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE FAR TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
PAYNE off a step slowly, raced back in trailing up the backstretch, angled out when beginning to advance late in the turn, finished full of run while remaining
out in the strip to win going away. KAVOD moved up to take control after the start, continued to hold a slight advantage turn and into the stretch, proved no
match for the winner late, remained clear of the others. WAYAKIN broke out and back to bump SEVEN NATION ARMY, began to move closer into the turn,
steadied in traffic while in the three path soon after, closer late turn, stalled, altered course to the outside with less than a furlong remaining, up late for the
show, not a threat to the top two. SEVEN NATION ARMY dueled up front while off the inside, continued to alternate through the turn then began to weaken.
NO SHIRT NO SHOES broke with the leaders, fell back, continued to lag turn when trailing, improved position past the furlong marker, not enough late for
the show. ONE FOR RICHIE in mid pack inside, continued to save ground turn, lacked serious bid. SILK TRADE forwardly placed early while three wide,
began a steady retreat before a half. MUCHO in the second group outside, floated out five wide by the winner exiting the turn, faded.

Footnotes
TALLADEGA showed the way into the first turn inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch, responded when challenged late in the final bend,
disposed of that foe past the furlong marker while drifting in a bit, clear again, enough left late to last. KING RUSSELL bothered slightly after the start,
settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide into the lane, roused, late surge to be rapidly getting to the winner. SEAS OF NORMANDY behind ,the lead
pace toward the inside, continued stalk that group up the backstretch, moved out four wide and advanced far turn, dueled outside the winner into the stretch,
flattened out late, comfortably saved the show. ESCAPOLOGIST back off the pace while saving ground, steered out to be three wide turning for home,
improved upper stretch then flattened out a bit the final furlong. INTERLOCK EMPIRE broke in, ,lacked speed off the inside, raced three to four wide out of
the final turn, displayed mild amount of late interest while also not a threat to the top trio. DELUCA ducked in at the start to steady, trailed well back for five
furlongs, five wide through the second turn, improved with belated interest. TEXAS PRIDE off a step slow, void of speed, passed a couple of faltering rivals
while not a threat. FURTHER EVIDENCE four wide trip, failed to menace. HALLOW POINT came in after start, contested the pace between horses for five
furlongs, gave way far turn. MISSIN HOLLYWOOD pressed the issue while racing three wide, stopped through the stretch, trailed across.

Footnotes
ENCHANTED NILE broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn, extended that advantage in the run up the backstretch, continued to hold a sizable
advantage into the stretch, enough left to withstand a late run by the runner up. LET'S DUET unhurried for five furlongs, advanced after dropping inside late
in the final turn, moved back out for the drive, finished with good courage to be rapidly getting to the winner late. TAKE CHARGE LORIN broke in mid pack,
moved up to race closest to the winner early, chased that one the middle half, had little for that one in the drive nor prove a match for the runner up,
remained clear of the others. SQUILLIONS off a step slow, trailed early, moved up along the inside to a position in mid pack, asked along in the two path
final turn, improved only slightly through the short stretch run. MCMANSION off the pace along the inside, angled four wide turning for home, went evenly
the final furlong. PRETTI XTREME void of speed in trailing early, four wide through the first turn, in the two path second bend, passed tiring rivals. I FEEL
THE NEED broke back, raced three wide into the first turn, continued off the inside, three wide second bend, failed to muster a rally. DUPLICITOUS
forwardly placed along the inside early, continued to save ground second turn, tired. PYRAMID PRINCESS was finished after a half.

Footnotes
WET PAINT last away, trailed to race unhurried for five furlongs, began to move forward in the far turn, steered out three wide into the stretch, finished full of
run to win going away. TAXED forwardly placed outside, continued to prompt the issue three wide up the backstretch, challenged three wide and outside
horses midway in the second turn, dueled through upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, game for the place. DEFINING PURPOSE pressed
the issue from the two path, challenged between foes and inside the runner up second turn, dueled with that foe through upper stretch, also had little for the
winner late, outkicked for the second spot. TAKE CHARGE BRIANA one paced while toward the inside early, angled out four wide out of the final turn, came
up empty for the stretch run. OLIVIA TWIST took control past the wire the first time, set the pace under restraint, offered brief resistance when challenged
second turn, faltered when headed. KEY TO SUCCESS settled in the second group, finished after a half, well beaten.

Footnotes
VULCAN moved up to join leaders after the start, narrowly showed the way through the turn inside, edged clear just inside the furlong marker and held sway
to the wire under steady handling. JACKMAN back off the pace well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, six wide exiting, rallied for the pace while slowly
getting to the winner. BANJO BEAR broke alertly while getting out to bother a couple of outer rivals, was straightened while falling back a bit, raced behind
the pace toward the inside, raced in the two path and in traffic exiting the turn, came out past the furlong marker, missed second. ABSOLUTE CHAOS
bothered early when the winner bore out, moved up to race closest to the leader, continued to press through the turn, continued to chase the winner past
the furlong marker, weakened late to lose a couple of positions. AMERICAN PURE lacked early foot after breaking back, saved ground through the turn,
improved along the rail into the stretch, flattened out a bit late. DON'T FORGET back off the pace and the inside, steered out four wide midway on the turn,
bothered a bit between horses past the furlong marker, improved slightly. NINJA WARRIOR off step slow, raced back, behind some traffic late in the turn,
also improved by cutting the corner into the stretch, failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. HOYA PARANOYA dwelt at the start, well back in trailing,
five wide into the lane, picked off some tiring rivals. TORONTOTORO lacked speed well out in the strip, four out to five wide turn, failed to muster a rally.
SEA TO SUCCESS tired while racing three wide. MYSTERY MAN bothered early, raced forwardly and three wide, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
EASY ACTION forwardly placed from the start, dueled on the outside through the turn, disposed of the other speed while drifting out a bit in upper stretch,
held the runner up at bay the final furlong. SIMOVIC back early after breaking behind the leaders, advanced steadily up the inside into the turn, continued
along the rail to reach a position closest to the winner nearing midstretch, made only marginal progress on that one in the run to the wire. KUPP forwardly
placed while racing in the two path, remained within striking distance into the lane, lacked a winning response to prove no match for the top pair.
COMMERCE COMET away well, set the early pace closest to the inside, dueled with the winner through the turn, began to falter into the stretch, continued
to tire. GUCCI BOY raced in mid pack while outside, four to five wide turn, lacked a closing punch while out in the middle of the strip. THE BOOKKEEPER
broke back, void of speed, dropped to the inside turn, steadied briefly late in the bend then improved inside of several rivals exiting the turn, never really
dangerous stretch. CLAY'S BLACK OPAL lacked speed inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, flattened out bit the final furlong. EYE AM SMART
off the pace well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, lacked a closing response. INTO IT in the second flight early, began a steady
fade in the two path in the turn. STORMIN ARMY settled off the pace and the rail, four wide exiting the turn, had little left for the run to the wire.
JEWELSTOWN off a step slow, trailed, never a factor. LAST WISH was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
GUNITE chased the leader up the backstretch while in hand, moved closer late in the turn under confident handling, collared that same foe into the lane,
took over, well clear under firm urging to the end. TEJANO TWIST last away, raced back early, began to move from between rivals midway on the turn,
came three to four wide for the drive, rallied for the second spot while no match for the winner. MILES AHEAD back off the early pace, fell further back to
trail through the turn toward the inside, roused late in the bend, some late interest to be up for the show in the late going. GAR HOLE broke on top, showed
the way after clearing toward the inside up the backstretch, continued to hold the advantage turn, offered little resistance to the winner when that one
challenged into the lane, steadily weakened after being headed. FLASH OF MISCHIEF settled off the pace while three wide early, floated out by the runner
up exiting the turn to be four wide, came up empty for the run to the wire. ULTIMATE lacked speed while racing three wide, four wide exiting the turn, also
lacked a closing kick.

Footnotes
CALL ME FAST showed the way into the first turn, continued to set the pace up the backstretch inside while in hand, extended advantage when
straightened for home, held the runner up comfortably safe in the late going. TONKA WARRIOR lacked speed while well wide, continued outside up the
backstretch, four wide through the final turn, rallied to be up for the place. TEN GAUGE within striking distance inside, continued in a forward position while
saving ground, chased the winner past the furlong marker, lacked a closing punch and was caught for the place. MAGOO prompted the pace while racing
just off the inside, chased through the final bend, weakened. BARBER ROAD broke back, lacked speed two path, swung out six wide turning into the
stretch, staged a mild rally while widest down the lane to improve position. HEIR TO GREATNESS within striking distance off the inside, three wide into the
lane, found lacking in the final furlong. BANDIT POINT off slowly, raced back and off the rail, four to five wide into the stretch, improved slightly. CATDADDY
also broke slowly, trailed well back off the inside, angled 4-5w into lane, found best stride too late in improving late. MEGAN'S HONOR off a step slow,
lacked speed, failed to muster a rally. BEN DIESEL in mid pack and outside, tired in the drive. BEER CHASER with the main body while toward the inside
first turn, in the two path through the second, began to fade after a half. TWO BY TWO in the second flight between foes, moved inside, backed up.

Footnotes
ARABIAN KNIGHT away in good order, got clear into the first turn, relaxed in the run up the backstretch, let out a notch late in the final turn when FROSTED
DEPATURE lodged a mild and brief bid, shrugged off that rival and kicked strongly clear while feeling a right handed crop one time. RED ROUTE ONE fell
back to trail soon after the start, saved ground when still seeing all his rivals into the far turn, swung out sharply to be four wide into the lane, rallied widest
down the stretch and finished up willingly to be up for the place, not a threat to the winner. FROSTED DEPARTURE asked early to keep up with the winner
into the first turn, chased up the backstretch, moved out, brief challenge to the winner late in the final turn, could not keep up in the drive, caught late for the
place. SUN THUNDER void of speed, continued back far turn, swung out to be four wide turning into the stretch, managed only some mild interest to
improve position slightly while remaining out in the strip. JACE'S ROAD in mid pack and three wide first turn, continued to pursue outside backstretch, briefly
closer four wide midway on the final turn, flattened out through the stretch. CORONA BOLT settled off the issue while saving ground, had nothing for the
drive. EL TOMATE forwardly placed and three wide through the first turn, continued to clock the two leaders into the far turn while in the four path, moved
toward the inside late in the final turn, gave way in the drive. WESTERN GHENT was finished after a half off the rail.

Footnotes
LASSIE MY GIRL forwardly placed and inside, continued within striking distance turn, moved out three wide turning for home, engaged the leader inside the
furlong marker and wore that foe down. MS CARROLL COUNTY off the pace while racing outside, made a strong move four down to three wide to take over
through the turn, clear a furlong out, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, clearly second best. UNCLE SHORTYS GIRL settled off the pace along the
inside, steadied early turn, mild rally to finish up best of the rest. KOKOMO STARLET away well, set the early pace in the two path, relinquished the
advantage to the runner up midway on the turn and began to gradually weaken. BE BO in mid pack in the run up the backstretch, dropped inside late in the
turn, went evenly through the lane. DELTA MOON fractious in the gate, three wide through the turn, continued one paced through the stretch in lacking a
closing response. TIZ A STRATEGY fell back quickly to trail after the start, improved position while three to four wide into the stretch, failed to sustain that
advance in the late going. QUEENIES WAY in the second flight off the inside, tired in the drive. MAY DISCO broke back, three out to four wide through the
turn, made little impact through the lane. ONLYTHREESOCKS off a step slow, raced off the pace and the inside, was not a factor. MO WANNA GO
forwardly placed while three wide early, began a steady retreat before a half. ALTAR GIRL was always outrun, trailed home.
