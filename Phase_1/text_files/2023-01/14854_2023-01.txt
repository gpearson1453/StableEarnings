Footnotes
KUKULKAN drew clear of rivals to his inside and angled in while giving chase, steadied off the inside flank of Impetuous at the three eighths pole and raced
boxed in from that point, regained stride approaching the quarter, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. STAR LUCK
exchanged contact with Bull Shark leaving the gate then chased outside, rounded the turn in the five path and finished well to take second in later yards.
ATTUCK gave chase through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn and finished well to take third late yards. BULL SHARK exchanged contact with
Star Luck leaving the gate then pressured the early pace, took the nod at the five sixteenths pole and dueled clear toward the quarter, but was met nearing
mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. WIZARD OF ODDS chased the pace, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly to late stretch
before flattening stride. VIDMER'S COURAGE was hustled to contention inside then steadied at the inside flank of Kululkan in the vicinity of the three
eighths pole, resumed chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. GAMING JACK was never a factor and
rounded the turn in the five path. IMPETUOUS set a pressured early pace while tapering inward then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, dropped
back approaching the quarter and faded at the rail on the turn. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed claims of foul against the rider of Kukulkan for
alleged interference in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, lodged by the riders of Vidmer's Courage, Wizard Of Odds and Attuck.

BUTTONED UP took the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, was under a hand ride to draw away at the rail on the far turn, then kept alert
in the lane. SPRING THE BEAST stalked off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and settled
for second best. TOP HAT TREASON was shuffled back early then saved ground on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced
at the rail on the far turn and came along to take third inside the eighth pole. TWEET THIS rated close to the early pace inside, picked up the chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted into the lane and flattened stride. MONGOLIAN HERO raced well off the pace in the two
and three paths the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. STALKING, stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase into the
backstretch but faded past the five sixteenths pole. MAKE WAY raced well off the pace inside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IN GOOD TROUBLE took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, kept the edge over the challenge of ME DARLIN KATHLEEN leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, was pressured into the far turn and drew clear midway through the turn, then kept sharp through the lane. The latter settled just off the pace
toward the inside, challenged the winner leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close through the backstretch, but dropped back past the quarter and
settled for second best. CONCERT HALL was bumped leaving the gate then saved ground well off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and improved her position off the rail on the far turn. CREDIT COMMITTEE stalked off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole then faded approaching the far turn. SARATOGA CENTS ducked out and made contact with Concert Hall leaving the gate then settled back in
the three path on the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole but showed little response. BUTTERMILK GIRLZ was not a factor.
PARISIAN SUMMER stalked the early pace from the three path but showed little response through the backstretch.

RUNALDO gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then dug in leaving the eighth pole and got up the final strides. EL LUCERITO
drew clear and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn near the rail, was steadily handled leaving the turn but gave up the lead in the final strides. BORN TO
SIN exchanged contact with Don't Get Caughtup leaving the gate then gave chase outside, raced off the rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch for
third. ROCKIN CHAIR chased the pace, raced near the rail on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. BROAD IMAGINATION chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. TWO ROOM SCHOOL chased inside,
raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the six path toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. COURT TUDOR hesitated at the break and raced well
back while giving chase from the half mile pole, then could only improve his position. DR RENDEZVOUS became fractious in the gate, gave chase through
the backstretch, but weakened while losing ground on the turn. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP exchanged contact with Born To Sin leaving the gate and was not
a factor. LASTWALKTOFREEDOM gave chase outside and bore out entering the turn.

GET OFF MY CLOUD stalked the pace from the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close two deep into the far turn, took the nod
toward the head of the lane and was all out to just last. S S ALASKAN CRUZ settled back off the rail on the first turn then eased out and gave chase into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, lugged in under right hand urging in later yards and just missed. FELICIAS CASTLE saved
ground off the pace on the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and improved off the rail on the far turn, was shut off late yards, altered course from
the heels of S S Alaskan Cruz and finished well. ORANGEBURG rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested
the edge at the rail into the far turn, was met midway through the turn and ceded the nod to the winner, continued close through the upper stretch but
relented later yards. MACHEN'S RIDGE settled inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in
leaving the turn but lacked room in late stretch. ROCKET J. entered the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
showed little response. MISTER DEEKS raced with the early pace inside, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the three
eighths and faded at the rail on the far turn. MADDEYE MOODY rounded the first turn in the six path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened into the far turn. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed, a claim of foul for late stretch interference lodged by the rider of Felicias Castle, against
the rider of S S Alaskan Cruz.
