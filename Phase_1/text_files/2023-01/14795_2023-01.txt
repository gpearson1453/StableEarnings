Footnotes
NEW DESTINY prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses turning for home, dueled through upper stretch, wrestled an advantage entering the final
furlong, and held from an outer rival late. OLIVIA G stalked the top trio from the two path around the turn, shifted outside of them in upper stretch, lacked
true progress through midstretch, but offered a late kick in the final sixteenth, ranged up to the leader nearing the wire, but narrowly came up short. SHES A
LUCKY REBEL set the pace, clung to an advantage from an pair of outer vying rivals turning for home, sparred gamely through upper stretch, but was
headed crossing the furlong grounds, and bested late. MUCHMORETHANREADY stalked three wide, bid turning for home, dueled entering the lane, but
delayed his lead change until the three sixteenths pole, yet weakened soon after. FOR HARPER trailed, swung seven wide entering the lane, and stayed on
while shifting ground inwardly. VISIONISTA bobbled a stride after the start, tracked in the three path, tipped five wide entering the lane, but tired. BAYOU
BEAUTY chased four wide, and faded in the five path around the turn. TWO JET was hesitant to load, broke multiple lengths slow before veering outwardly
leaving the gates, lacked speed two wide around the turn, but refused to change leads in upper stretch, lost action due to a firm rider's request to do so
coming to midstretch, and made little impact. YOCKEY BETTERFLY broke a step slow at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.

Footnotes
SWEET ALYSSA raced forwardly two wide among rivals, brushed an outer foe while shifting ground outside of the embattled leading pair at the three
sixteenths pole, produced a grinding charge to bid with seventy yards to go, and prevailed late. EVERGRANDE pressed two wide and between horses, vied
around the turn, sparred with her inner counterpart through midstretch, led entering the final sixteenth, but was worn down by an outer rival late. GOLDEN
VIEW set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, dueled around the turn, sparred gamely through the lane, but was headed at the sixteenth pole, and gave
way. DESTINE TO RACE stalked along the inside, chased from behind the top pair through upper stretch, got outkicked by an outer rallying rival at the
furlong grounds, shifted course outwardly while staying on in the final sixteenth, but missed reaching show. SOUPER EXPLOSIVE stalked three wide, bid
turning for home, but yielded in upper stretch before brushing with an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole. ICHIBAN broke slowly, leaned outward leaving
the gates, trailed in the four to five paths, and got outrun.

Footnotes
CAGLIOSTRO brushed the inner part of the gate leaving it, but was floated inwardly before steadying back from tight quarters soon after, settled at the rear
in the three to five path around the first turn, circled rivals with a four wide rally around the far turn to bid turning for home, gained an advantage while
shifting inwardly in upper stretch, and drove clear through the final furlong. MO HOPE broke inwardly causing trouble for inner rivals, prompted the pace two
wide, vied between horses turning for home, but was outkicked in upper stretch, battled gamely for place through the final furlong, and prevailed from rivals
on either side late. MIDNIGHT PRANKS set the pace in the two path as outer rivals applied pressure, clung to an advantage from a trio of bidders nearing
the lane, but was outkicked in upper stretch, dueled gamely for place thereafter, but missed. GAMETIME GLADIATOR stalked along the inside, checked
slightly while behind foes as the pace softened nearing the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, shifted four wide coming to the furlong grounds,
stayed on late to bid for place nearing the wire, but ran out of ground. ODDSONTONY was herded into an inner rival by an outer foe at the start, stalked
three wide, bid between horses turning for home, but faltered among them entering the lane. COAL BOSS took a bump from an outer rival soon after the
start, laid off of the pace in the two path, but was shuffled back slightly entering the backstretch, swung six wide entering the lane, but made little impact.
SENSE YOU ASKED tracked in the five to three path around the first turn, came under a firm hold nearing the backstretch, fanned two to five wide entering
the lane, but was green to straighten, and yielded in upper stretch.

MARIAH'S APPEAL pressed two wide, vied before gaining an advantage turning for home, resisted MARLAZZA's menacing outer bid while changing leads
at the three sixteenths pole, gamely clung to an advantage into deep stretch, and tenaciously kept her outer counterpart at bay. MERLAZZA prompted the
pace along the inside, backed off to stalk an outer pair at the half mile pole. tipped outside of them leaving the three furlong pole, took dead aim on a newly
leading MARIAH'S APPEAL entering the lane, bid at the three sixteenths pole sparking a duel, then battled gamely through the final furlong, but was denied
reaching even terms. RAGGITY SAND broke a beat slow, raced far back in the three path and between horses around the turn, fanned to the seven path
entering the lane, shifted out to the ten path approaching the furlong grounds, and stayed on outside of rivals to gain show late. SUPER LUXE hopped
slightly while off slow before being brushed by an inner rival at the start lagged behind, split rivals two wide while rallying in midstretch, and gained a minor
placing. MY AUNT SNOOKIE set the pace inside of a hounding rival around the turn, got headed turning for home, and gave way. UNSUNG MELODY
brushed an outer rival leaving the starting gates, tracked in midpack along the inside, gained fourth while shifting off the rail at the quarter pole, but drifted
out in upper stretch, and wandered about while flattening out in the final furlong. SONG BRIDGE lacked speed in the four path, faded around the turn, yet
surpassed tired rivals alte. CURLIN SERENADE tracked three to four wide, but faded while being floated from the five to seven path in upper stretch. RUN
CHATA broke a step slowly, and was outrun along the inside. L J'S EMMA bobbled at the start, chased two wide and between horses, but weakened
around the turn.

Footnotes
WAVE OF GOODNESS stalked from the three path, pursued from outside of the clear leader and from the five path around the far turn, bid while floated to
the eight path in upper stretch, dueled while striking the front at the furlong grounds, inched away late, and lasted from an outer surging rival. LAKE
LUCERNE rated at the rear in the two path, then the three to four paths around the far turn, tipped outside of foes and to the seven path at the furlong
grounds, offered a good late kick to surge up to the leader late, but narrowly missed. MY PHILLY TWIRL set a clear pace in the three path, moved to the
center of the track for better ground down the backstretch, showed the way in the four path around the far turn, shifted out again to the seven path in upper
stretch as an outer rival loomed a threat, dug in through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds, and gave way late. CHARLIE'S PENNY
brushed an inner rival at the start, tracked from the three path, but lacked the needed kick to bid inside of the leaders in upper stretch, and chased them
home through the final furlong. CARPE VINUM raced at the rear in the four to six paths, fanned to the eleven path in upper stretch, and gave way. FANCY
MARTINI brushed with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, and faded.

Footnotes
HUNTLEIGH set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, shook free from that one in upper stretch, and edged away under
driving pressure. GRAPES FOR ELOISE stalked outside of the pace setter, vied around the far turn, but was turned away in upper stretch, and proved
second best. COMPARATIVE broke a beat slow, raced at the rear in the three path, gained in the two path around the far turn, rallied while shifting to the
four path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. GHOSTLY GIRL laid off of along the inside, tracked from midpack around the far turn, came into the
lane in the three path before shifting back inwardly in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. SPARTAN QUEEN lacked speed in the two to three paths, fanned to
the five path entering the lane, and yielded on his left lead. LURE'EM IN exchanged brushes with an outer rival through the early stages before gaining
inside stalking position entering the first turn, but only managed to chase the top pair turning for home, then faltered between horses in the final furlong.
CUSHEE leaned out at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, but was done entering the far turn, and eased through the lane. MADLY DANCING
bobbled slightly leaving the gates, exchanged brushes with an inner rival moving to the first turn, tracked two wide, but faded in the four path around the far
turn, and was eased through the lane.

FIRST DEFENDER bumped with an outer rival at the start, pressed the pace two wide and between horses, vied with those foes around the turn, then
kicked clear at the three sixteenths pole, drew off under a drive, and was kept busy through the late stages. QUATERNION tracked along the inside, shifted
to the three path entering the lane, but drifted out to the six path when asked to angle outside of the leaders, stayed on while hanging on his left lead, gained
place at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. KIGALI bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked from off of the pace three to two wide, tipped
three wide and outside of tiring rivals at the furlong grounds, and ran on mildly to gain show. GUADALAJARA broke slowly, but avoided being pinched
between horses by doing so, trailed in the two path, tipped to the four path turning for home, then to the six path approaching midstretch ,and stayed on late.
PINFIRE set the pace, sparred with pair of outer rivals around the turn, and gave way at the three sixteenths pole. HEY JACKSON tracked in the three to
four paths before coming into the lane in the five path, but shifted ground inwardly while fading in upper stretch. CITY NIGHTS took a bump from an outer
rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses into the turn, but gave way. EARL OF DASSEL bumped an inner rival at the start,
then made little impact along the inside. GOLDEN NUGGET bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed three wide, vied around the turn, but failed to
keep pace in upper stretch, and faltered among foes in the final furlong. LITTLE STEVEN leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, then was outrun in the
three path.

GENTLE SOUL settled far back in the five to six path, fanned to the eleven path in upper stretch, offered a late kick to range up to the leader at the sixteenth
pole, and forged an advantage late. TWO EMMYS stalked the leader from the four path, bid turning for home, led in the seven path at the quarter pole,
resisted an inner bid at the furlong grounds, repulsed that foe while meeting GENTLE SOUL's outer challenge at the sixteenth pole, and was bested late.
PRICE TALK tracked in the four path, split rivals in the six path in upper stretch to bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds, but was turned away a
sixteenth from home. BIG AGENDA tracked in the five path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, chased before being outkicked by an outer rival at
the furlong grounds, and leveled off. ENGLISH TAVERN laid off of the pace in the five path, and lacked a rally. READY TO PURRFORM broke a step
slowly, raced far back along the inside while in the four path, and failed to factor. AMERICAN HERO trailed in the five path, and got outrun. FREEDOM
FACTOR set a clear pace in the two path, but was headed entering the lane, and caved.

DETERMINEDLY set the pace along the inside, shook free of an outer presser turning for home, held sway in the two path through midstretch, but tired in
the final sixteenth as rivals closed in on both sides, and lasted from an inner bidder. TAPIT'S CONQUEST saved ground at the rear of the short field, then
sustained rail grind, gradually crept closer inside of the tiring leader in the late stages, but ran ut of ground to catch him. SILVER HEIST stalked along the
inside, tipped outside of the clear leader entering the lane, chased form the three path into the final furlong as an inner rival rallied alongside, but was
outkicked for place in the late stages while also closing in on the tiring leader. TAPIT SHOES bobbled a bit at the start, tracked two to three wide, fanned
four wide entering the lane, yielded, then wandered about while flopping back to his left lead in midstretch, and weakened. INVULNERABLE broke a bit
outwardly, stalked two wide, but yielded between horses entering the lane.

SINGLE RULER laid off of the pace in the three to four path, moved closer to track four wide down the backstretch, raced within striking range outside of
bidders turning for home, bid leaving the quarter pole, and drove clear approaching midstretch. BASELINE BEATER stumbled and bumped an outer rival at
the start, trailed early on, gained three wide around the far turn, shifted in and rallied inside of foes in upper stretch, sustained a bid between horses in the
final furlong, and willingly gained place at the sixteenth pole. PRESIDER tracked along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and chased
while one-paced thereafter. MOBSTER stalked two to three wide, bid turning for home, led entering the lane, but was outkicked leaving the quarter pole,
and gave way. FIGHT'N READY took a bump from an inner rival at the start, settled far back along the inside, improved three wide turning for home, chased
between horses approaching midstretch, and bumped with an outer rival at the furlong grounds while leveling off. TWO RIVERS OVER broke a beat slow,
raced far back in the four path, tracked around the far turn, but hung on his left lead, lugged in and bumped a rival in midstretch, and lacked a bid.
BRIARTOWN set the pace along the inside, but was headed entering the lane, and stopped. SILVER BULL pursued from midpack three wide and between
horses, but gave way two wide around the far turn. ONASA stalked along the inside before shifting outside of the pace setter entering the backstretch, vied
between horses turning for home, but weakened entering the lane. KAUAI DAN got rank between horses entering the first turn, steadied back at the seven
furlong pole, laid off of the pace along the inside, but faded around the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

SURVEILLANCE laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer uncovered around the turn, came into the lane in the five path while behind the top pair, yet
decided to shift inside of them in upper stretch, drove past at the furlong grounds, and edged away. BANGO stalked the top pair from the four path, bid in
the five path entering the lane, dueled through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds, and chased that foe home well to
prove second best. MANNY WAH trailed along the inside, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, and rallied to reach show late. YANKEE SEVEN
pressed the leader from the three path, bid turning for home as an outer rival loomed a danger, led in the four path entering the lane, dueled with his outer
counterpart through upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with that one and an inner bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded, and lost show late. BOLDOR
tracked from the two path, but only managed to chase while lacking a bid. SIGN OF WAR set the pace, showed the way from a pair of bidders around the
turn, but was headed nearing the lane, and weakened at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
THE ALYS LOOK pressed two wide, gained an advantage in the three path into the far turn, showed the way as her outer stable-mate applied pressure
around that bend, shifted out to embrace that rival's challenge in upper stretch, gamely clung to an advantage through midstretch, and repelled her
counterpart entering the final sixteenth. CHOP CHOP stalked three wide, engaged her newly-leading stable-mate from the four path into the far turn, came
under a drive turning for home before producing a bid in the seven path at the quarter pole, sparred through midstretch, but failed to gain even terms before
being turned away at the sixteenth pole. HAYUNEVANO set the pace along the inside, but gave way to a pair of outer bidders entering the far turn, gave
way turning for home, yet held place from an outer bidder in the closing stages. FOREST CHIMES laid off of the pace in the two path, then stayed on
between horses in midstretch, bid for show outside of a rival in the closing stages, but hung. COTTON CANDY ANNIE tracked along the inside, but faded.
AMBER CASCADE laid off of the pace in the four path, tracked between horses at the five furlong pole, but only managed to chase the leader around the
far turn before tiring. NORAH G laid off of the pace along the inside, but steadied approaching the backstretch, checked and shifted out to the six path
entering it, and was outrun thereafter.

HAPPY AMERICAN settled off of the pace in the three path, gained in the five path around the far turn, sustained a charge to bid at the furlong grounds,
dueled with a pair of game inner rivals through the late stages, and prevailed. MR. WIRELESS tracked three wide, inched closer four wide entering the lane,
bid for the lead in upper stretch, vied between horses into the final furlong, battled gamely while hanging on his left lead, but was bested by his outer
counterpart. FORZA DI ORO set the pace in the two path, dug in to resist outer bids in upper stretch, but was headed by a pair of rivals at the furlong
grounds, fought on gamely through the final sixteenth after flopping back to his left lead, but failed to regain even terms. RUN CLASSIC stalked along the
inside, but was outmoved by outer bidders while awaiting racing room entering the lane, then sustained a rail chase while lacking the needed kick. ZOZOS
stalked two wide and from the three path, chased between horses turning for home, but only produced a meager bid while getting outkicked by outer foes at
the quarter pole, and yielded between horses in upper stretch. CHESS CHIEF laid off of the pace in the two path, retreated to trail turning for home, swung
out to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. INTREPID HEART trailed along the inside, attempted a rally in the six path around the far turn, but
flattened out without making an impact.

Footnotes
INSTANT COFFEE trailed in the three path early on, gained ground in the four path around the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane, rallied with a
leading TWO PHIL'S to catch in upper stretch, ranged up alongside that one at the furlong grounds, dueled to the sixteenth pole, and drove clear late. TWO
PHIL'S tracked in the three path, moved forward to engage the top pair entering the far turn from the outside, bid entering the lane, led in upper stretch
before changing leads at the three sixteenths pole, but met INSTANT COFFEE's outer challenge soon after, resisted that foe's bid through midstretch, but
was bested entering the final sixteenth. CONFIDENCE GAME stalked three wide, pressed two wide into the far turn after an inner rival faltered, bid along
with an outer rival nearing the lane, but was outkicked at the quarter pole, lost place to another outer rival in upper stretch, and kept on. DENINGTON
tracked along the inside, and chased along the rail after slipping inside of a rival nearing midstretch. BROMLEY hesitated slightly at the start, but was quick
to recover, prompted the pace two wide and from between horses around the far turn, failed to sustain pressure at the nine sixteenths pole, then faded into
the far turn. ECHO AGAIN set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, but was headed leaving the quarter pole, went wrong at the three sixteenths pole, and
pulled up in the final furlong before walking off.
