Footnotes
IRISH PROPHET away quickly and stalked an outside pair into the first turn, went up to challenge around the bend, gained the lead and moved clear,
showed the way under confident handling on the far turn, asked right handed in upper stretch and widened while ridden out late. ADMIRALTY PLACE (GB)
broke a step slow, reserved inside early, lacked room when boxed in on the far turn then tipped between rivals and entered the lane two wide, angled out in
the lane and produced a mild rally to best the rest. RIDLEY'S MAJOR stalked in the two path then between rivals, exited the backstretch three deep,
rounded the far turn four then five wide and gained the show. DANCING RINCA bumped leaving the gate, tracked three wide early, moved up four deep
leaving the backstretch, shifted in and bumped rival while still four deep on the far turn, moved in some entering the stretch and flattened to fourth. THIRTY
FOUR COUPE had to steady twice before the first turn, stalked along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and flattened out. PALAGIO was off slow in the
beginning, settled outside a rival near the back, rounded the far turn in the three path, moved out in the stretch and improved position. WARRIOR ROAD
bumped leaving the gate, showed early speed but drifted out a bit while rank on the first turn, ceded command and chased up the backstretch, got brushed
between rivals on the far turn and weakened in the lane. OVERRULE had to steady behind a rival early, was a bit rank early along the rail, started the far
turn in the two path then moved inside and failed to menace, then walked into the van following the race. CUPID'S CRUSADER showed speed then became
rank and drifted into the first turn, stalked the speed three deep, got bumped between rivals on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
ROMAN EMPRESS stalked the pace from the inside, tipped two wide and between foes with a quarter mile left to run, challenged PARCO from inside in
upper stretch, put a head in front at the eighth pole, dueled with AWESOME PAMELA in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. AWESOME PAMELA trailed
two wide into the first turn, moved closer to stalk the top pair from between rivals on the backstretch, eased out to the three path late on the far turn,
launched a bid from outside in upper stretch, fought with ROMAN EMPRESS in the final sixteenth but could not get by. PARCO raced up close outside the
leader into the first turn then chased into the backstretch, drew alongside again to duel for command, put away NAUGHTY EVELYN nearing the quarter
pole, was overtaken with a furlong remaining and flattened to third. NAUGHTY EVELYN sped to the front from inside, dueled with PARCO up the
backstretch, lost command and could not keep up with that rival nearing the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. SHEMAKESCENTS chased three
wide around both turns, raced four wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
CLOUSEAU stalked from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, drew alongside the top pair with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. DEVIL AMONG US
stumbled and bumped inner rival leaving the gate, drifted shortly after, chased three wide around the bend, engaged SASSY NATURE from outside entering
deep stretch but got outkicked by the winner. SASSY NATURE quickly cleared and moved over, took some pressure before moving clear again on the
backstretch, showed the way two wide around the bend, collared by DEVIL AMONG US in deep stretch and yielded late. TANGLEDUPINGREY stumbled
leaving the gate, chased three deep early, started the turn four wide, exited three wide and weakened. RED CROSS KNIGHT got bumped by DEVIL
AMONG US in the beginning then had to check when bothered by that rival again early, trailed on the inside into the turn, eased off the fence and spun
three wide into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TEMPER bumped with outer rival at the start, stalked along the rail, waited behind the leaders on the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch,
gained an opening along the fence and proved best in the end. POINT AND SHOOT hopped leaving the gate, raced on the inside near the back, moved out
on the backstretch, rounded the far turn two then three wide, angled widest in the lane, closed from outside but was too late. LOVE OUR FAMILY dueled for
the lead inside a rival while racing keenly into the first turn, moved forward to take full control, took pressure again in the middle stages, showed the way
around the far turn and into the stretch, led into the final sixteenth but yielded in the end. SPEAKING SPANGLISH stalked in the two path then started to pull
on the far turn, bid outside the top pair into the far turn but could not sustain the challenge and chased three wide around the bend, kept on willingly through
the stretch run and rounded out the superfecta. TURQUOISE BIKINI dueled from outside while keen early, chased LOVE OUR FAMILY then applied
pressure again in the middle stages, stayed close up to the stretch then flattened in the late stages. VIOLET CROWN bumped early, sat off the pace in the
two path, moved closer up the backstretch, went between foes late on the far turn, chased in traffic in the lane and angled out in the final sixteenth but was
too late to rally. CEE MINUS tracked three deep then four deep on the far turn and flattened. JACQUELINE COCHRAN got bumped and crowded between
rivals early, settled inside, angled out in upper stretch and failed to menace. KIND OF BLUE was off slow and bumped leaving the gate, rank in the early
stages, trailed up the backstretch and far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT VOW vied between then took control up the backstretch, shook free from outer rival past the three-eighths pole, cut the corner into the stretch
and drew off under hand urging. HALF NELSON got bumped between rivals leaving the gate, drifted out and bumped early on the backstretch, chased two
wide into the turn, moved inside then took aim two wide into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the lane but was clearly second best. MAGIC
CAPITAL bumped at the start and dropped back, trailed along the rail into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and was along for the
show. PRESTIGIOUS bumped leaving the gate, raced near the back off the rail, started the turn two wide, exited the bend three wide and improved position.
ONLY LIGHTNING broke well and showed early speed inside a pair of rivals, chased those two into the turn, saved ground around the bend and tired in the
lane. DANCE KID took a bumped from inside then altered out early, stalked four wide into the turn, moved into the three path then was asked four wide
entering the stretch and faded. RUNAWAY SALLY showed early speed from outside, pressed the pace from outside to the three-eighths pole, could not
keep up with the winner and chased three wide into the stretch and retreated through the drive.

SAFFA'S DAY chased off the pace, four deep at the quarter pole, drew alongside OCTOPUS with a sixteenth to go and drove clear. SELF TAUGHT lacked
early speed, raced three then two wide on the turn, angled out leaving the bend, closed well from the middle portion of the track and gained the place.
OCTOPUS bobbled a bit leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from inside, moved clear from AS AMATTER OF FACT in upper stretch, challenged by
SAFFA'S DAY in deep stretch and yielded. AS AMATTER OF FACT dueled for the lead outside OCTOPUS, kept the pressure on through the turn and into
the stretch, lost touch outside the eighth pole and faltered in the late stages. DUTCH BUS broke a step slow, stalked the dueling leaders outside a pair of
rivals, traveled three wide through the turn and flattened in the lane. SONIC BREES stumbled leaving the gate, hustled along and drifted out some early,
chased inside through the turn and weakened down the lane. DARNQUICK stalked the pace outside a rival, chased between foes around the turn, got
shuffled back at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
GENERAL MATHIS broke in and bumped rival, unhurried in the beginning near the inside then shifted to the two path, angled out on the far turn and came
five wide into the stretch, closed fast from outside and edged DERECHO DANDY in the final jumps. DERECHO DANDY set the pace outside SO I'M TOLD
early, raced on even terms past the half-mile pole, fought through the far turn and into the lane, put away inner rival with a sixteenth remaining but got nailed
at the wire. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS took a bumped at the start, stalked the pace on the inside, coaxed along around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch
and finished willingly for the show honors. SO I'M TOLD stumbled leaving the gate, prompted the pace along the inside, moved up to duel on the
backstretch, battled through the far turn and into the stretch, fought to the eighth pole then flattened in deep stretch. CAISSON sat off the pace and steered
to the inside, took closer order leaving the backstretch, tipped off the rail while finding some traffic on the far turn, lost his path and had to steady in upper
stretch and could not regain the needed momentum. FLINT STROLL tracked the speed in the two path, got blocked on the far turn while three deep, angled
to the two path leaving that bend and failed to threaten. BIRTH OF COOL stalked the pace from between rivals, took aim at the leaders two wide into the
stretch, moved out in the lane and weakened. CHICKASAW was off slow to begin, reserved in the early going, traveled on the inside, angled out on the far
turn and top of the lane and failed to menace. OCULUS stalked the top pair three deep and weakened.
