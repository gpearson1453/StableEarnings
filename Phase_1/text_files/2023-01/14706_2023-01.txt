Footnotes
STORMY JOE showed speed and established the early advantage, set moderate fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and drew
clear nearing the furlong marker, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held on for the win. MOMO'S KIDDO tracked the early pace, raced outside of
rivals while three wide on the turn, finished well in the drive while responding to firm left-handed urging, came within aim of STORMY JOE in deep stretch
and just missed for the win, while well clear of the rest. RACER REX broke out at the start and was off slowly, trailed into the turn, raced two wide into upper
stretch, finished evenly in the final furlong and kept on to narrowly secure the show. CHROME'S ORBIT broke alertly, took back to stalk the moderate pace
outside of STORMY JOE, could not keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, gave way in the drive and was just edged for show. IMA CARPE DIEM
forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate pace from the inside to the quarter marker, outrun in upper stretch and weakened. CARRIZO
SPRINGS chased the moderate early pace, outrun on the turn and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
DELUSIVELY allowed to settle, raced two wide into the backstretch run, roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, came within aim in upper stretch,
assumed command nearing the furlong marker, showed a good late kick and held the runner-up at bay in deep stretch to prevail. RIGHT REASONS
unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the backstretch run, steered two wide on the second turn, made a steady advance in the drive,
responded to firm handling in deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the late stages and was second best. OH ANGEL stalked the modest
early fractions from the inside while a bit keen, waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead in upper stretch, could not keep pace
nearing the furlong marker and held for third in the late stages. PROOF SHE ZIPS allowed to settle in the early going, three wide into the backstretch run,
advanced to stalk the pace into the second turn, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker to vie for the lead, took a narrow advantage in upper
stretch, could not match strides with DELUSIVELY nearing the furlong pole and weakened in deep stretch. A LITTLE GRACE lunged at the start and was
away a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the modest pace to the the half-mile marker, assumed command along
the second turn, was collared leaving the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. SASSY TINKERBELL assumed
command in the early stages, set modest fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole and gave way in the
drive.

SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS broke alertly and dictated terms early on, came under a snug hold while setting modest fractions into the turn, held foes at bay to
the quarter marker, drew clear nearing the furlong pole, kept to task in deep stretch and was geared down in the final strides. ZAFFERANA not far back in
the early going, two wide along the turn while in a good position, outrun in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong, could not impact the winner in deep
stretch and was up for second in the final strides. GETAWAY CHARM showed early speed and tracked SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS through moderate early
fractions, kept attendance to the winner to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch, ran evenly through the final furlong and was just edged for place
in the final strides. LOOKIN AT SWEETIE was hard to load, unhurried in the early stages, advanced three wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive
and found her best stride late. ACHROMATIC lacked early speed, was caught four wide into the turn, raced three wide into upper stretch and did not
threaten. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE chased the moderate early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane, could not keep pace in the drive and gave way.

well for place in the final strides. MONEY MUNCHER unhurried in the early stages, saved all of the ground to the second turn, came in tight nearing the

LOVE forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, was outrun on the second turn and gave way in the drive.
HADLEES HONOR close up to the early pace, took back to stalk the pace from a rail position into the backstretch run, raced in a good position to the
half-mile marker, chased NAUVOO to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TEX HANLEY well placed in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground while along the rail on the far turn, angled three
wide in upper stretch, closed well in the drive, came within aim of UPSTART YANKEE in deep stretch and outfinished that rival in the late stages to prevail.
UPSTART YANKEE forwardly placed in the early going, prompted the moderate fractions while outside of the pacesetter, took a narrow lead nearing the
quarter marker, slipped to the rail for the drive and extended the lead nearing mid-stretch, raced on the left lead in the final sixteenth, could not hold off TEX
HANLEY in the final stages and held safely for place. BIG BROTHER stalked the early pace, raced three deep into the first turn, advanced nearing the
half-mile marker, chased UPSTART YANKEE along the second turn and into upper stretch, was held at bay through the drive and was outkicked in deep
stretch, while holding for show in the end. LOOKOUT POINT unhurried in the early going, saved all of the ground to the second turn, tipped out two wide for
the drive and offered a mild late rally. RIVER'S BEHEST hopped at the start and was away slowly, raced three then four wide along the first turn, rallied
three then four wide on the far turn, could not sustain that run in the drive and flattened out. SHANAGOLDEN sent to the early lead, set modest fractions
while prompted to the half-mile marker, was overtaken by UPSTART YANKEE along the second turn and faded in the stretch run. THE SANDY SURPRISE
bobbled leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle, raced two wide into the backstretch run, maintained that position to the second turn
and did not threaten.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE DIVA forwardly placed into the first turn, raced three wide outside of rivals into the backstretch run, roused leaving the three-furlong marker and
loomed three wide nearing the quarter pole, assumed command in upper stretch, kept to task in the drive and held safely in deep stretch over the oncoming
runner-up. NOSHEWONT lacked early speed, raced two wide into the backstretch run, roused four wide for the drive, finished well in the final furlong, came
within aim of the winner in deep stretch but could not reel in ULTIMATE DIVA and was up for second in the final strides. ROSE ROSE ROSE shuffled at the
start and was away slowly, unhurried in the early going while saving ground, swung three wide for the drive, made a steady bid in the final furlong but could
not make headway on ULTIMATE DIVA in the late stages and was just edged for place in the final strides. MISS ACCELERATE contested the early pace
with OTTER POP then ceded the lead to that rival into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. OTTER POP a bit keen into the first turn, contested the early pace with MISS ACCELERATE then assumed command into the
backstretch run, set moderate fractions to the second turn, held foes at bay to the quarter marker, overtaken in upper stretch, chased ULTIMATE DIVA to
mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY allowed to settle in the early going while in a good position, raced three wide into the
far turn, asked for run in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. VACANT SEAT a bit keen in the early stages while forwardly placed, stalked the modest
fractions to the half-mile marker, dropped back on the far turn, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) was prominent into the first turn, prompted the moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, drew even with WARD 'N JERRY nearing
the quarter pole, overtook that rival in upper stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong grounds and drew clear under right-handed urging in deep stretch. OUR
SILVER OAK stalked the early pace from the second flight, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, chased
BLACK CASPIAN to mid-stretch, could not make headway on that rival in deep stretch and just held for place in the final strides. MEMO DADDY (CHI)
hopped at the start then lost his path leaving the break and was away a step slowly, was a bit keen in the early stages while not far back, tracked the
moderate pace to the second turn, came in tight and steadied nearing the three-furlong pole, lacked room nearing the top of the lane, swung four wide for
the drive, rallied in the final furlong and just missed for place, while securing the show. LOVE CANDY forwardly placed in the early going, saved ground
while stalking the pace into the backstretch run, well positioned into the far turn, chased the leaders to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. WARD 'N
JERRY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, carved out moderate fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, could not hold off BLACK
CASPIAN in upper stretch, chased that rival to the furlong grounds and weakened in deep stretch. JEFFNJOHN'STHUNDR lunged at the start and was off
slowly, unhurried in the early going while saving ground, advanced three wide on the second turn, swung five wide for the drive, could not sustain that effort
in the stretch run and flattened out.

Footnotes
ALMANERA (IRE) broke well, settled into stride and sat just off the pace setter SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS while traveling comfortably, moved to challenge
near the quarter pole, matched strides with that foe for the length of the stretch before gaining the upper hand in the final yards. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS
broke sharply from the inside and went straight on to set the pace, responded when challenged by ALMANERA (IRE) with a quarter mile to go, battled hard
down the lane while racing on the wrong lead and just missed in a gutsy effort. MR. MASON raced in the middle of a trio of horses tracking the leading pair,
responded when asked to go forward with three furlongs to go, swung four-wide into the stretch and rallied strongly but came up a bit short. ZIPPY BABY
chased the leaders from an inside position to the turn, continued to save ground through the turn, rallied down the stretch and finished with good energy.
MIKE DAD away a step slowly, reserved off the early pace while staying to the clear in the five or six path in the early stages, launched a bid around the turn
while still wide, entered the stretch about eight-wide and kept on running to the wire. BLAZE OF DREAMS unhurried from the break raced in last position
down the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, was in good position at the head of the stretch and finished evenly, unable to summon the needed
response. BORKAN was first away from the gate but veered outward after, recovered quickly and was up close early, began to lose ground from the seven
sixteenths pole, swung nine-wide into the stretch and was running on well but unable to make up any ground. HEAT N REHEAT outrun from the break,
attempted to rally from the five-sixteenths marker but was unable to make an impact despite strong handling through the stretch.
