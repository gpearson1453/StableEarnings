Footnotes
DREAM STREAK with the pace from the start, dueled in the two path into the turn, shook clear from between foes turning for home, well clear past the
furlong marker, kept to task late. AIN'TNOSWEETIE forwardly placed off the inside, challenged three wide and outside the winner turn, proved no match for
that one in the drive, held sway for the second spot. BAD OUTLOOK lacked early foot off the inside, behind some traffic into the turn, three wide into the
stretch, rallied and was getting to the runner up late. CRYSTAL CRESCENT raced back early, closer four wide through the turn, flattened out in the drive.
MRS. NUSHI off a step slow, raced in mid pack just off the inside, lacked a response in the drive to finish up evenly. DIAL DISH four out to five wide turn,
also lacked a closing kick. FLAG TO FLAG dueled up front along the inside, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
LITTLE ROCKER away well, dueled up front throughout while in the two path, long drive, outkicked the other speed in determined fashion late while having
enough to hold off TWINKLING IRISH in the waning strides while between horses. BOOTLEGGING GIRL broke alertly, alternated up front inside the winner,
proved stubborn to the end, lasted for the place. TWINKLING IRISH came out early to bother a couple of outer rivals, raced well back early, swung out six
wide when beginning to move late in the turn, widest stretch, finished up willingly to be rapidly getting to the top two. SWEET HOLINESS bothered when
TWINKLING IRISH came out early, bumped with SWEET BABY KATE, mid pack off rail, five wide into the lane, mild interest. DR. WOODS MIRACLE last
away, continued to trail up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, improved up the rail. ASEEL in the second flight while racing in the two path,
lacked a closing response in the drive. AUNT CARI back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the turn, three wide late in the bend, made little impact
through the stretch. FORTIBUG in the main body outside, four wide through the turn, failed to rally. VALENTINE ANGEL dropped inside for the drive, lacked
bid after saving ground. LORI'S EYES chased the dueling top two for a half and began to fade late in the turn. SWEET BABY KATE bumped early,
remained back. ALLELUIA ANGEL in the second flight while just off the inside, retreated.

prior to the start then was off slow, raced well back for a half, three wide into the stretch, improved position. NORTH SIDE away well, cleared soon after
toward the inside, continued to show the way by daylight through the turn, was challenged a furlong out, faltered. LIVINGONTULSATIME settled in mid pack
and off the inside, four wide into the lane, failed to rally. NATE'S WAY chased early, began a steady retreat before a half. BRAVO BRAVO remained always
back in failing to threaten. EAGLE PASS was through early while four wide late in the turn.

Footnotes
CITY LEGEND behind the pace outside, four wide through the first turn, continued outside, three wide advance, outside bid into the lane, drove steadily
clear the final furlong. LIARS CLUB show3ed the way early into the first turn, relinquished the advantage before a half, rebid second turn between foes, no
match for the winner the final furlong, remained clear for the place. SEASIDE BOY void of early foot, continued back up the backstretch, worked way out to
be four wide when advancing into the stretch, rallied and finished willingly to be getting to the runner up. ONE MORE BABY turn3ed in a one paced effort
while racing in the two path. MARK THE MOOSE pressed the runner up early from the outside, crossed to the inside when that rival came out a bit onto the
backstretch, showed the way into the far turn, vied closest to the rail through that bend then began to weaken. GALACTIC EMPIRE lacked early speed
outside, four wide early first turn, remained outside and was four wide into the far bend, three wide turning for home, came up empty when called on for the
stretch run. SUPER GEEK fell back to trail after the start, floated out five wide turning into the stretch, not a serious threat while improving a bit in upper
stretch. JIM AND JIM was never a threat while racing off the inside. RISKY SITUATION fractious in the gate, broke back, was not a factor. BILLHILL
forwardly placed early, gave way, finished after a half.

Footnotes
EFFORTLESSLYELGANT broke in good order, dueled up front in the run up the backstretch off the inside, clear while still hand turn, maintained a
comfortable advantage through the stretch under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. DAWNY dueled early along the inside with the winner, fell back off
that one into the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, proved game for the place. FLYIN BESSIE in mid pack outside, three wide into the
stretch, mild interest, narrowly missed the place. MARY'S BOON closest to the dueling leaders just off the inside, two path through the turn, weakened the
final furlong to lose a couple of positions. SWEET CONNECTION in the main group while three wide early, dropped inside late in the turn, failed to muster a
rally when called on for the drive. RATIFIED broke back, lacked any early foot outside, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch. MISS ANALYZED
void of speed, raced in the two path into the stretch, failed to menace. PIVOSKY in the second flight along the inside, had nothing for the drive. WAR
SAVER last away, remained always back.

AIRTIME with the early pace inside, allowed the two leaders to go, continued inside, steered out and advanced three wide on dueling rivals late in the final
turn, took over and drew out in dominant performance through the stretch while still under pressure. IDRATHERBEBLESSED settled off the pace, three
wide late in the final turn when advancing, no match for the winner, clearly second best. RIVER BOY settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through
the final turn, finished up best of the rest. HAROLD'S CLOUD in the second flight into the first turn, checked up midway on that bend across a rival's heels,
settled, closer in the second turn, flattened out in the drive to finish up evenly. RICH GOLD last away, raced well back, moved out, four wide second turn,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a factor. ROCKING ROCKET four wide into the first turn when with the pace, dueled the middle half off the
inside, gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane. DIXIE FURY alternated up front closest to the inside, also faltered before the stretch
run. SUITABLE five wide into the first turn, gave way in the far turn, jogged in far back. LORD GRANTHAM sluggish in trailing early, fell further back,
distanced after losing contact with the field. walked in.

Footnotes
JETS A GINNIN off the pace well out in the strip, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting when challenging, long drive, edging away late under firm handling.
STORMING LADY within striking distance along the inside early, lost some position behind traffic late in the turn while continuing inside, got through to
challenge nearing midstretch, could not match strides with the winner in the late going, clear for the place. ITALIAN JUSTICE brush, broke back, moved out,
came five wide for the drive, mild rally while remaining widest through the lane. A REAL JEWEL forwardly placed three wide, challenged three wide in the
turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, could not last. LA MORENA in mid pack while racing off the inside, three wide into the stretch, failed
to respond when asked. RELIANT off a step slow when brushing with ITALIAN JUSTICE, raced in the back with that one, saved ground into the stretch,
picked off a couple of rivals after the issue had been decided. EMERALD PRINCESS failed to menace while four wide through much of the turn. EMPIRE
PASS broke alertly,. sprinted clear, showed the way for three furlongs, stopped when headed in upper stretch.

Footnotes
KUPUNA sprinted clear into the first turn, showed the way off the inside, two path far turn, continued to sport a daylight advantage into the stretch, drifted
while still clear then held the runner up comfortably safe late. PRESIDENTIAL off the pace and the inside, encountered some traffic midway up the
backstretch, closer second turn, shifted out a bit for the drive, steered in under the drifting winner midstretch, could do little with that one, remained clear for
the place. TIZ RYE TIME void of speed, came in the two path for the drive, rallied for the show and was closing the gap on the runner up late. NUMBER
ONE DUDE chased the winner along the inside, had little left for the drive. CALIBRATE in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the second turn,
lacked a closing bid. DISC JOCKEY hopped at the start, raced in mid pack and also failed to respond when called on in the drive. WINTERWOOD broke
back, lacked speed inside, in some traffic far turn while continuing inside, came up empty for the drive when clear between horses. FULL CHARGE four
wide through both turns, was always outrun. MOWINS forwardly placed while three wide for a half, faded.

Footnotes
SUE ELLEN MISHKIN broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch, shrugged off two foes into lane, long drive, determined. SUPER WONDER GIRL
broke back, raced back and inside through the turn, rallied up the rail to finish up willingly, nod for the place. SUMMER SHOES forwardly placed in the run
up the backstretch, closer four wide to press through the turn, lost ground to the winner into the stretch, rebid a furlong out, hung late, nipped for the place.
PISTOL forwardly placed along the rail, two path into the lane, lacked the needed closing response. LOFTHOUSE void of speed, encountered some traffic
late in the turn, improved position when clear for the drive. OFF RAMP lacked speed between rivals, four wide into the lane while also encountering some
traffic, improved slightly as well. SECRET FIX forwardly placed, advanced and challenged between horses in the turn, faltered in the drive. PIPELINE GIRL
mid pack, tired while racing in the two path through the turn. SAND AND SEA four wide and off the pace into the turn, had nothing for the drive. BLACK KAT
TAPS last away, raced four out to five wide turn, remained back. LADY GOLDSTART flashed brief early foot and stopped.
