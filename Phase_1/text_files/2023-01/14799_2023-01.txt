Footnotes
FLAMING EAST broke sharply and set a rated pace just off the inside, moved clear without much asking early turn, responded when set down in upper
stretch, widened under a drive past mid stretch then cruised home the final yards. RAHMER , brushed at the break, rushed up inside under pressure to gain
a stalking spot, remained under coaxing mid turn, eased out three wide and gave game chase to the wire. CRIMSON ROCKET , bumped and in tight at the
break to be away last, recovered and edged up towards the inside, steadied nearing the turn, gained along the rail to loom in mid stretch then flattened out
late. AMICALOLA FALLS , close up between rivals early, eased back off foes leaving the far turn, altered in and came back willingly through the final
furlong. WHAT SAY YOU lost ground four wide stalking the pace and came up empty. MR. MOSLEY , three wide outside the winner, was under a solid ask
mid turn, stayed on to upper stretch then faded. CHAMBO drifted in at the break and brushed with a foe, steadied nearing the half, came three wide for the
drive and lacked a bid. SOUPER EMPEROR was steadied into the turn, chased four wide mid turn and faded. SINGLINO , four wide, failed to menace.
CHAUFFEUR , bumped and in tight at the start, was outrun.

into the lane, dueled outside OURNATIONONPARADE from the quarter pole, wrested command nearing the eighth pole, opened up under a drive then was
kept to task through the final seventy yards. GALERIO settled off the pace while three wide, angled seven wide with momentum into the lane, ranged up
near mid stretch and churned on willingly to be second best. OURNATIONONPARADE , three to four wide outside a rival while tracking a contested pace,
shifted five wide and bid in hand outside the leaders to taken command into the lane, battled inside the winner to mid stretch then gave way through the final
sixteenth. ONE TEN saved ground, was under pressure mid turn, swung eight wide for the drive but only offered a mild late effort. EXCULPATORY ,
climbing a bit leaving the chute, steadied nearing the five and a half furlong marker, saved ground under rating leaving the far turn, eased out and made
some progress outside a foe into the lane then went evenly in the final furlong. WHISKEY AND YOU got engaged in a duel to the inside of MONDAY
MORNING QB early on, stayed on to contest the issue to upper stretch then weakened. AIN'T DA BEER COLD edged to the inside of foes early to reach
contention, was under pressure between rivals mid turn, failed to kick on entering the lane, faltered and was eased late. MONDAY MORNING QB disputed
the pace three wide and outside WHISKEY AND YOU, held a slim advantage past the three eighths, was engaged from his outside entering the lane, failed
to resist and faltered through the final quarter mile.

AWARD WANTED stalked the pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, swept to command
in mid stretch and drew out under urging. BOURBON WILDCAT took the lead inside MALIBUR BEAUTY leaving the backstretch, set the pace in the two
path around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, remained on her left lead and drifted out the final sixteenth of a mile. MALIBU BEAUTY , prominent outside
BOURBON WILDCAT, circled the turn three wide, steadily weakened the final furlong and switched to her left lead near the sixteenth pole. SWEET GRACIE
, caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, moved to the four path in upper stretch then weakened. STARTWITHABANG lacked speed, drifted four
wide entering the stretch, angled to the inner rail in mid stretch and was not a factor. SWEET SURPRISE chased the pace outside horses, floated five deep
turning for home and faltered. FOOL YOURSELF gave way on the turn.

FILLE D'ESPRIT chased the pace, circled the turn four wide, swept to command in upper stretch and drew away under mostly hand urging. SWAYIN TO
AND FRO disputed the pace racing in the two path between horses around the turn and gradually weakened through the stretch. SNICKET , off the duel
racing in the two path on the turn, swung four wide at the head of the stretch, remained on her left lead and passed tired horses. FOUETTE prompted the
pace racing in the three path around the turn and gave way in upper stretch. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the
stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF JERICHO , well placed behind an embattled trio into the turn, angled out, cruised up four wide and bid outside rivals mid turn, secured
command outside COFFEEWITHCHRIS entering the lane, kicked clear under left handed asks nearing mid stretch then steadily pulled away while ridden
out. COFFEEWITHCHRIS , with the pace three deep and under rating, held a short lead past the five sixteenths, ceded the advantage to the winner into the
stretch, stayed on to battle past the three sixteenths, drifted in and gave way grudgingly. B WEST dropped off the leaders when briefly losing action leaving
the three quarter pole, was under pressure mid turn, circled four wide and offered a mild run to nab the show. ON THE MARK rated outside a foe early on,
crept closer three wide past the five sixteenths, lugged in racing on his left lead in mid stretch then came up empty. TIZ NO CLOWN took command inside
rivals early on, set a pressured pace, battled inside a pair of rivals past the three eighths, failed to kick on nearing the lane and faded. WE DONT NEED
ROADS , off the pace, saved ground into the lane, angled out and failed to generate a rally. HELDISH broke a step slow, angled out and moved up between
rivals to challenge, vied to about mid turn then succumbed. MY BLUE EYES flashed speed, drafted back outside rivals, chased to the turn then faltered.
