Footnotes
CLASH A. J. broke out at the start bumping QUACKENBUSH in tandem with SILENT RUNNING, showed the way in hand under pressure from STEERAGE
to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, edged clear under a drive kept to task. STEERAGE broke in at
the start bumping IGOTTAHAVEIT, prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and was rebuffed by the top one while just preserving the place honors on the wire. QUACKENBUSH got bumped between foes at the start and
was pinched back, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
bid. SILENT RUNNING broke in at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened. IGOTTAHAVEIT bumped at the start by STEERAGE, who broke inwards, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping out four
to five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and trailed.

Footnotes
JOEY FRESHWATER away without apparent mishap, settled into the four path proceeding along the backstretch, crept up to the ones to catch, becoming
the primary pursuer as the half was being rattled off, issued a challenge spinning onto the head of the stretch, fought his way past a stubborn rival to take
over by midstretch, steadily kicked clear. SWIFTY DEVIL assumed the top after making solid contact with GOING IN STYLE, carved out the pace from path
two on a loosely-contested lead, felt an uptick iin pressure in the form of the eventual winner as the second fraction was being posted, yielded reluctantly in
the general area of the eighth pole, continued onward with good energy but had to settle for being second best. BOBBY THE TANK brushed with her next
stall neighbor after coming out with its initial step, went on to work out a tuck along the inside route by the end of the backstretch, flashed some momentum
late on the turn, got maneuvered into path during the early stages of the stretch run, was along for the show. GOING IN STYLE off a beat slowly after
bumping with the second place finisher, took up the chase two wide on the turn, swung out into path five heading onto the tip of the lane, lacked a winning
response. COLOR COMMISH saved ground to no avail. LARZ gained a forward position after making some contact with another at the break, was eased
back slightly during the initial stages, disputed the pace three wide for a approximately a half before giving way. FLASHY ALEX four wide onto the turn, was
one path wider leaving it, wound up trailing up almost throughout.

GLORY ROAD off the rail throughout, underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, was steered out towards the path six looking for a clear seam in upper
stretch, becoming the widest of all, gained ground in a steadfast manner, struck the front inside the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. LAFITTE'S FLEET sat
forwardly placed four wide as the field made its way on the turn, commenced the stretch about as wide, finished willingly to procure the place. ROB THE
RICH took the inside route for the opening half, angled five wide into stretch, came home well to secure the show. JEMOGRAPHY lightly urged to get going,
tucked along the rail, went outside until three wide heading onto upper stretch, moved up menacingly during the ensuing furlong before flattening out.
JALEN JOURNEY took up the chase two wide, got let out a notch on the turn, mustered up some gain in the lane without ever posing a threat. PRISONER
sparred for control from the two path to midstretch, got overhauled by stronger rivals and weaekened. REED KAN a pace factor three wide until around

rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged clear under a drive kept to task. KINETIC SKY chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to just get up for the place honors over his stable and barn mate. AMUNDSON coaxed from the
start, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and
was worn down and collared a sixteenth out, ran on to the finish but was headed at the end while clear for the show honors. STAGE LEFT three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CHESTERTOWN chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.
