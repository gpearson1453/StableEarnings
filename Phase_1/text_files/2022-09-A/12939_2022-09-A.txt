Footnotes
SIERRA MELODY tracked the quick early pace, gained ground on the turn, made a four wide bid at the head of the lane, took a narrow advantage leaving
the eighth pole, was kept to task with firm hand urging through the late stages and held in a drive to prevail. MCGEORGE was unhurried early on, was
roused to go six wide into the drive, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in the final strides but was up in time to secure
second. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN took back off of the early speed, gained ground from a two wide path nearing the quarter marker, came in tight and lacked
room nearing the eighth pole, angled out inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in the end, while clear for third. QUIET CHARM was sent to
contest the early pace, dueled with DARKSABER through the turn while setting solid fractions, took a narrow lead leaving the turn but could not hold off the
winner nearing the furlong marker and yielded in the late stages. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET chased the quick early pace, saved ground through the turn,
swung out in upper stretch and could not muster a late rally. DARKSABER was hustled leaving the break and was sent to the front, set the disputed pace to
the turn, dueled on the front end while carving fast fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken nearing mid-stretch and gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
PAPAPIFAS took back just off of the quick early pace, tracked the leaders through the turn while two wide, found a seam nearing the furlong grounds, took
a narrow edge into the late stages and kicked clear in the end. COUNTING CARDS raced close to the early pace, came three wide nearing the quarter
marker, was outkicked by the winner in the drive but stayed on to get up for second. HONEYMOONZ OVER was sent to contest the early lead, dueled on
the front end with FOREIGN PROTOCOL through quick fractions, shook free of that foe nearing the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner in the
drive and was just edged out late for second. BIG DUKE bobbled at the start, hit the gate leaving the break and was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn,
swung widest into upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. FOREIGN PROTOCOL was away in good order and was sent to contest the early
lead, dueled with HONEYMOONZ OVER through the turn while setting quick fractions, could not keep pace leaving the bend and tired in the stretch drive.

MOTHER'S PRAYER broke alertly and established the early lead, set the pace through the turn and drew clear nearing the quarter marker, was kept to task
through the drive and widened the margin in the late stages. SPECIAL MOMENT was off a step slowly, chased the pace through the turn, was able to gain a
bit of ground on the winner in upper stretch but was outkicked in the drive and held for second at the end. O B'S was off a bit slowly and chased the early
pace, improved position four wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not make headway on the top pair late but held for third over an oncoming
rival. GABLE bobbled at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, swung five wide for the drive, found his best stride late and just
missed for third in the final strides. BEAU MISCHIEF chased the pace from midpack, came three wide approaching the quarter marker, lost ground in upper
stretch and did not produce a late rally. PASSION OF JOE'S was away in good order, lacked early speed, trailed through the turn and into the stretch run
and was not a late factor. NAUVOO hit the gate and ducked in a bit leaving the break, recovered to press the early pace, lost position on the turn and tired
readily in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S ADVOCATE broke alertly and went to the early lead, set quick fractions while in hand through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and
was ridden out in the final stages to be much the best. CIVIL SUIT tracked the quick early pace, gained ground three deep nearing the quarter marker, lost
ground to the winner in upper stretch and just held for second over an oncoming rival. MARY MARGARET stumbled at the start and was off slowly, chased
along the inside, angled out midway through the turn to go four wide into upper stretch, finished well in the end and just missed for second while clear of the
rest for third. GET'EM TIGER tracked the quick early pace, lost ground to the winner along the turn and faded in the stretch drive. EXQUISITE LEGACY
lacked early speed, lost position while three then four wide nearing the top of the lane and was not late factor. DADDYS NINA chased the quick pace from
the inside through the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BIG FAME settled off of the early fractions, improved position on the far turn, mounted a four wide rally into the drive, vied for the lead nearing the furlong
marker, overtook PEACEHAVEN into the final furlong and drew clear in the late stages. PEACEHAVEN was hard sent leaving the break, set contested
fractions through the backstretch run, shook free from the pressing rival on the second turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the eighth pole, could not
hold off BIG FAME in the drive and was outfinished, while besting the rest in the end. ROSEBUD RYDE stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, came
four wide into the backstretch run, gained ground four wide on the second turn, came within aim in mid-stretch and was outkicked in the late stages, while
well clear of the rest for third. SHARAC (GB) was forwardly placed early on, came three wide into the backstretch run while stalking the pace, gained ground
nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. SMILING MELANIE saved all of the ground while
rating off of the early pace, was never far back through the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and faltered in the late going. SLUMBERING BEAUTY
was slow into early stride, lagged through the backstretch run, raced just off of the rail into the stretch run and was not a late factor. JEANIE'S SWAN
showed early speed and pressed the pace through the backstretch run, lost position between horses on the second turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
COOL MOUNTAIN LAD took back off of the fast early pace, raced three then four wide along the turn, was roused leaving the bend, made a steady gain
through the final furlong and was up just in time to prevail. IRREFUTABLE broke alertly then took back off of the quick early pace, advanced three wide
nearing the quarter marker, overtook the pacesetter nearing mid-stretch, was all out in the final strides and was just nailed on the line for the win, while
besting the rest. UNRAPTURED broke in at the start and bothered GERLACH'S leaving the break, chased the quick pace two wide on the turn, gained
ground in upper stretch, was outfinished in the final furlong by the top pair but stayed on to get the nod for third. I'M CORFU chased the quick pace to the
turn, gained ground three wide nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally, while just missing for third. GERLACH'S was
crowded by UNRAPTURED at the break and was off a bit slowly, gained ground along the rail on the turn, continued that bid into upper stretch and was
outkicked in the drive. DARNQUICK was sent leaving the start and took command of the early pace, drew to a clear lead into the turn, set quick fractions
into upper stretch, was overtaken by IRREFUTABLE nearing mid-stretch and faded in the final stages. JEFFNJOHN'STHUNDR came in tight leaving the
break and was slow into early stride, was steered outside of rivals to the turn, gained ground three then four wide nearing the quarter marker and finished
evenly in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ARMA D'ORO rated just off of the early pace while saving ground, tipped out to go two wide into the drive, came within aim inside of the furlong marker,
overtook DIAMOND RANGER in deep stretch and edged away late. DIAMOND RANGER was asked to show early speed and was sent to set the pace, set
quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead nearing mid-stretch, was all out nearing the sixteenth-marker and could not hold off the winner late but
stayed on well to hold for second. THUNDER OF ZION bumped with GORDY'S BOY leaving the start, raced in midpack to the turn, improved position four
wide midway through the bend, lost a bit of ground in upper stretch but rallied in the final sixteenth to get up for third. AYRTON SENNA tracked the early
pace, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker to come within aim of the lead, lost ground in upper stretch, was outfinished in the final stages and was
just edged for third in the end. GORDY'S BOY hopped at the start then bumped with THUNDER OF ZION leaving the break, was unhurried through the turn,
improved position in upper stretch and found her best stride in the late stages. SPEED GRAZY lacked early speed, maintained position while three wide
through the turn, improved position in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. ROISTER showed early speed, raced close to the pace to the
turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and weakened in the stretch drive. TEE SHOT hustled from the break, was on the outside of four horses vying
for the early lead, maintained a forward position through the first quarter mile while still wide, dropped back and was unable to keep pace in the late stages.
ANNIE'S CHIEF hit the gate at the start then took up slightly when brushed with AYRTON SENNA a few strides out of the gate, was outrun racing at the
back of the field, was not persevered with through the lane, was eased and walked off under her own power.
