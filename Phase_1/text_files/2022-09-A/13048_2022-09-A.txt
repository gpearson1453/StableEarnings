DAWGMENTALITY well placed and inside, gained a short lead through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task.

not match strides with the winner into the stretch and held the place. WILLIE WANDO unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, came through inside
of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. WHISKEYMAC broke a step slowly from the gate, gained position two and three wide through the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and could not gain. KOTYLOS well placed and outside, steadily lost ground. GOOSE HUNTER broke sharply leading in
the early going, then faded into the turn.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY BREEZE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid through the second turn, edged ahead again, then drew off in the stretch
and was kept to the task. PRECISION PRADO well placed, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and
closed well for the place. MISS CALIFORNIA allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and
edged up for the show. MOLISE improved her position, inside. LIGHTNING ROUND tracked the pace, moved up to stalk that one down the backstretch,
moved up to gain a short lead on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. DIAL ME AGAIN no factor, inside. ENDLESS mid pack
and outside, faded three wide through the second turn.

Footnotes
SPIRITED SOL rated back to track the pace in the early going, raced boxed and steadied through the turn, came through inside the leader when clear, then
drew off and lasted under steady pressure. HIDEKI well placed, looped up two and three wide through the turn, drifted out widest into the stretch, then made
a steady gain and edged up for the place. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. GENERAL WINSTON allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside
into the stretch and closed for a share. K C ROCKET stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground through the turn, came three wide into the stretch
and faded. FUNKY MUSIC rated on the lead, shook clear through the turn, then faded the final furlong. CROWLEY'S WAR was no factor. FAST FELIX was
never involved.

gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in and weakened. FRANZ JOSEF allowed to settle, gained position
