Footnotes
PAT'S PADDOCK PICK fractious in the gate, took control early and set the pace with VINNY THE COIN alongside, maintained a short lead over that rival
around the turn on the inside, shook free at the top of the stretch and held safely. TALL BOY was off a bit slow to begin, climbed early on the backstretch,
tracked two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend, was closing fast from outside but was too late. CROWNING GOLD bumped leaving the
gate, stalked the top pair on the inside into the turn, eased out around the bend and came three wide into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong but
needed to find more in deep stretch. VINNY THE COIN broke well and prompted the pace from outside up the backstretch, kept the pressure on through the
turn, lost touch with PAT'S PADDOCK PICK at the top of the lane and weakened. SMOKEM HOWARD broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, dropped
back early despite urging, angled to the rail on the turn and could not rally in the drive. WRITTEN DANCE coaxed from outside and chased the top pair from
off the rail, went two to three wide around the bend and faded. PRAYFOROURCOUNTRY raced in range early on then started to climb at the half-mile pole,
dropped back into the turn while three wide, entered the lane five wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
KIRSTENBOSCH sped clear from outside and crossed into the two path, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, cleared briefly at the three-eighths
pole, challenged by TROUVILLE around the far turn, maintained a short lead into the final furlong and found more in the final sixteenth to draw clear.
TROUVILLE chased between rivals then got put in tight and checked prior to the first turn, angled out to the four path around that bend, went four deep into
the far turn, launched a bid from outside, fought into and down the lane and faltered in the final sixteenth. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH got brushed and crowded
early, went two to three wide around the first turn, was on the move three to four wide on the far turn, finished willingly from outside and missed second.
KRISTI'S TIGER chased between then checked off the heels of the winner on the first turn, went between rivals and waited for room through the far turn,
angled and kept on for a minor award. OLE SILVER raced up close on the inside then stalked around the clubhouse turn, saved ground to the stretch and
weakened. TAKE A LEAP brushed early then steered to the inside, coaxed along on the far turn and angled four wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.
CAPSTONE GIRL raced up close early then lost her path on the first turn and became rank, went up to apply pressure from outside, lost touch with three
furlong remaining, dropped back on the far turn and tired.

TO SPEIGHT HER set the pace under pressure, held a short lead through the turn, cleared into the stretch and remained unchallenged to the wire.
TREBBIANO stalked the top pair on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved out a bit, could not make any headway on the winner late but proved
second best. LAW ABIDING stalked three deep early on, got moved to the four path on the turn, shifted in and bumped rival at the quarter pole, finished
willingly and held the show. PICOTA (GB) bumped back at the start, angled to the inside, was in a bit tight going inside a rival at the quarter pole, tipped out
and lacked room at the eighth pole, altered out and finished determinedly in deep stretch. HONEYMOON SUITE pressed the winner from outside into and
around the turn, lost touch two wide into the stretch and weakened. SAI CON (FR) coaxed early while dropping back off the pace, trailed three wide into the
turn then steered down to the inside around the bend and passed tired rivals. OUR JOURNEY broke a step slow on the inside, chased from the rail then two
wide into the stretch and flattened out. VIRAT bumped leaving the gate, stalked between rivals, moved out to the three path, got bumped hard at the quarter
pole, went three to four wide into the stretch and weakened. APFEL broke out a bit, was rank chasing off the rail up the backstretch, went two wide into the
turn, altered out around troubled rival at the quarter pole, came five wide into the stretch and weakened. EXCLAMATION sat off the pace, raced three deep
into the turn, driven three wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LI'L GRAZEN bumped leaving the gate, stalked off the rail then between rivals, chased two wide into the turn then tipped outside rivals, swept by the leader
midway around the turn, drew off into the stretch then widened under hand urging. LADY PROTONICO was off a bit slow, went two wide into the turn,
angled out and came five wide into the lane, closed well through the stretch run but could not threaten the winner. A BROKEN BREEZE broke out, sat off
the pace and steered to the inside, angled out and raced three to four wide into the stretch and was along for the show. BLAME IT ON ROSE chased
outside a rival then three deep, moved into the two path late on the backstretch, came three wide into the drive and lacked a rally. SUGAR KISSES was off
slow to begin, traveled near the back early on, went four wide into the turn, six wide into the stretch and improved. SEVEN SISTERS broke out and bumped
rival, showed early speed then chased the leader up the backstretch, was along the inside then tipped two wide leaving the turn and weakened.
RIGHTEOUSLY sped to the front from outside a rival then moved clear and showed the way up the backstretch, led in the two path then moved to the rail,
lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, chased into the drive and faded. CHROME OF OUR OWN was off a bit slow to begin, raced near the back then
trailed on the inside into the turn, saved ground through the bend and was not a factor. SONG OF FIRE stumbled a bit leaving the gate, traveled in mid-pack
off the rail, went three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TOM'S SURPRISE broke out and was quickly corrected, settled in the two path near the back, on the move three deep on the far turn, closed in from
outside and drew alongside the leader in midstretch and drove clear to win going away. NILES CHANNEL away well and went up to establish the front then
moved inside, showed the way up the backstretch, led clear on the rail into the stretch, collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole, relinquished the lead
shortly after and held the place. ALVAARO stalked the pace from outside in the two path, asked leaving the far turn and lacked the needed late kick in the
final furlong. DILLON ROCKS stalked the pace from inside through both turns, came out in the stretch and needed to find more in the final eighth.
RESPECT THE HUSTLE stalked two to three wide on the first turn, traveled in the two path on the second bend, got floated out through the lane and
weakened. TABLE FOR TEN bobbled after the start, stalked on the inside, two wide leaving the backstretch, got blocked on the far turn and angled out to
the three path, got floated out in the lane and failed to rally. BIG BUZZ was off slow to begin, trailed two wide into the first turn, rounded the far turn three
wide then came five wide into the stretch, got floated out in the lane and made no impact.

FRIED ASPARAGUS was off slow to begin, went two wide into the turn, started to move while angling six wide around the bend, reeled in the leader in the
final sixteenth and was up late. DON'T JU FORGET broke in a bit at the start, lost her path and steadied early, rallied four wide on the turn, took over late on
the bend, kicked clear and led into deep stretch then got run down by the winner. MISS BAYLEE vied three deep up the backstretch, could not keep up with
the leader around the bend, chased three wide into the stretch and held the show. MINING CRYPTO got bumped from outside early then sent to vie for the
lead inside a trio of rivals, cleared briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, was challenged from outside and lost command past the quarter pole, then flattened in
the lane but was able to save a minor award. BACKSTREET AFFAIR got bumped on both sides and steadied early, stalked along the rail to the stretch and
flattened in the furlong grounds. TAMARANDO COAST stalked off the rail then bumped and steadied early, lacked room briefly at the five-sixteenths pole,
went three to four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SHEZ OUR ARCH sat off the pace up the backstretch, moved out on the turn and came six wide
into the stretch and improved position. BIG SEVEN was off slow to begin, trailed off the rail, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor.
RELUCTANT broke a bit slow and inward and quickly corrected, sat off the pace early on, angled in on the turn, back out in upper stretch and failed to
menace. VALENTINE GHOST vied four deep up the backstretch, lost ground around the turn and came five wide into the stretch and tired. BLAZING

pole, dueled with SAMURAI CHARM down the stretch and dug in late for the victory. SAMURAI CHARM sped clear and moved into the two path, showed
the way up the backstretch, met the challenge from TEDDY'S BARINO, battled down the lane holding a slim advantage to the sixteenth pole and got edged
late. VELVET SLIPPERS bumped in the beginning, settled in the two path, raced three wide into the far turn, chased two wide into the lane, moved inward
and gained the show. EVER SMART stalked on the inside, moved off the rail on the far turn, came out in upper stretch and weakened. LISETTE broke a
step slow and brushed with outside rival, trailed early three wide into the first turn, remained off the rail to the stretch and failed to menace. BYE BYE
BERTIE was along the three path stalking the pace early, went two wide into the far turn, moved out around the bend and came four wide into the stretch
and weakened. LA CASTIGLIONE chased in the two path, between foes on the backstretch, dropped back into the far turn, angled to the inside and faded.

N WRANGLERS away quickly and fought for command early before clearing and moved inside, met the challenge from GIRL RANGER at the three-eighths
pole, held a short lead through the far turn then disposed of that rival into the stretch, put to right-handed urging and was overtaken midstretch and stayed
on to secure the place. STREET SHADOW broke out and bumped rival, chased off the rail near the back then moved inward, angled four wide on the far
turn, moved out further in the lane and gained the show. GIRL RANGER showed early speed near the inside then moved to a stalking position, bid outside
the leader at the three-eighths pole, fought through the turn then lost touch into the stretch and flattened fourth. BEACHGRASS stumbled leaving the gate,
settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and improved position. BLOSSOMING bumped leaving the gate, raced up close three deep leaving the
chute then moved to the inside, stalked through the early stages, raced a bit off the rail into the drive and lacked the needed response. ROCK THE
BOURBON broke in the air to be off slow, traveled in the two path off the pace, inched closer on the backstretch, raced in tight between past the
five-sixteenths pole, found traffic in upper stretch and could not rally after. ICE QUEEN chased four deep into the stretch the first time then moved to the two
path to stalk the pace, entered the far turn between runners, tipped out in upper stretch and weakened. WITCH MOON was rank between rivals early then
stalked in the two path, moved out and traveled four deep into the far turn, remained four wide into the stretch, found traffic nearing the sixteenth pole,
moved out and could not threaten. MOVINGLIKEAWINNER shuffled back at the start, steered to the inside while trailing, saved ground to the stretch and
never got involved. RUN FOR MY HONEY was rank racing outside rivals early, pulled the rider forward up the backstretch, went three deep into the far turn,
dropped back around that bend and weakened.

Footnotes
CHISMOSA got bumped and forced out at the start, settled off the pace, three wide into the turn, tipped outside the leader at the three-eighths pole, bid
outside the top pair and took over at the quarter pole, kicked clear leaving the bend, opened up in upper stretch, got a bit weary late but held safely under
urging. UNCONTROLLABLE was off slow to begin, trailed wo wide into the turn, steered out while on the moved through the turn, came five wide into the
stretch, bumped with rival at the top of the stretch, finished determinedly through the final furlong but could not reach the winner. FUN MONEY bumped
early, chased outside a rival and got floated out wide on the backstretch, went six wide into the turn, angled in a few paths and came four wide into the
stretch, bumped with UNCONTROLLABLE at the top of the lane and churned on to hold the show. SMILING LADY pressed the pace inside the leader and
two wide into the turn, fought to the quarter pole then could not keep up with the winner late on the turn and got edged for the show. YO YO MAMA got
crowded a bit at the start then was forced to check in the early going, saved ground through the turn and lacked further response. BIG HOPES chased from
off the pace, entered the lane three wide and failed to rally. ELECTRIC LETTUCE veered out and bumped CHISMOSA, set the pace well off the rail outside
a rival, led four wide into the turn then moved into the three path, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened. E Z PHARIS bumped early, drifted out
chasing the top pair up the backstretch, got shuffled between at the three-eighths pole, moved down to the two path and faded.

Footnotes
HANDY DANDY away quickly in the beginning then took a stalking position in the two path or between rivals, driven two wide into the lane, tipped out in the
lane, rallied three deep and drove past to win clear in the end. BALLY'S CHARM hustled to the front from inside, set the pace to the far turn, took pressure
from outside and held a short lead through the turn, dueled down the lane and clung to a short lead into deep stretch and yielded grudgingly in the end.
ANMER HALL showed early speed then was rated outside the leader early on, pressed through the far turn, dueled down the lane and got outkicked by the
top pair. CLUTCH HITTER chased wide leaving the chute then moved inward and stalked outside a pair of rivals, continued three deep around the far turn
and lacked a late bid. SEVEN WONDERS got bumped early and became a bit rank, dropped back on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and improved
position. SMUGGLER'S RUN raced outside a rival at the back in the two path, moved out to three path, tipped out into the stretch and improved position.
LUCKY BOSS angled to the inside and stalked the pace, remained along the fence into the stretch, tipped out and weakened. ALMANERA (IRE) was off
slow to begin, pulled on the inside first time through the stretch, around the first turn and into the backstretch, had to steady early on the far turn, remained
inside to the stretch, moved out in the lane and weakened. IRISH PROPHET got bumped around on both sides early, had to check between rivals first time
through the stretch, lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in the lane and failed to menace. CROSBY BEACH was off a bit slow, got bumped a
few times early then became rank, traveled three deep around the first turn off the pace, took the second turn two to three wide and weakened.
