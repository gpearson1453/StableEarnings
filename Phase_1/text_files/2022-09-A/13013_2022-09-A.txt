LIVVY LOU was hustled along soon after the start while racing between rivals, dug in inside the eighth pole and held gamely under strong pressure.
COUSIN VICKIE was coaxed along early, experienced traffic near the quarter pole, lost ground, angled to the outside through the upper stretch and rallied
gamely late. LITTLE Z vied for the early lead while racing two wide, raced near the rail in the drive and kept on willingly to the wire. PREPAID SPECIAL
broke to the inside, sent along early from the inside, was shuffled back near the three eighths pole and had no final bid in the drive. GOLD CHAIN was
coaxed along from the outside of rivals early on, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and had not enough. MO DIXIE DIVA was forced in at the break,
raced off the early pace, was five wide through the upper stretch and failed to respond.

ANYOTHERQUESTIONS tracked the early leader down the backstretch, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and prevailed late under all out
pressure. PRINCE PERFECTA stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide in the drive and finished gamely to just miss. CHIEFWEAVE showed
good early speed to set the early pace and weakened a bid the final eighth of a mile. RONALDS GATSBY stalked the pace from the inside, continued an
inside bid in the stretch and raced evenly late. OLDER AND WISER was off slowly, raced off the early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole
and had no late rally. SASSI ASPEN raced off the early pace, was three deep near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. WAR TROLLEY settled off the early
pace, raced towards the inside and never threatened. CHARLIE'S STAR refused to break, stewards reviewed start and declared Charlie's Star a starter as
he was given a fair start.
