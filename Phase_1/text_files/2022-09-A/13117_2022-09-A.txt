CALLINGINTHENIGHT pressed two wide, bid from the four path into the lane, led passing the eighth pole, and held on. ONEFORVIVI broke out, rated in
the four path, swung out to bid from the seven path into the stretch, and ran on but hung late to place. LILRASCALMAN led from inside, cut the corner into
the lane, lost the lead in upper stretch, but held on for show. JOEBOY stalked from the two path, bid from three wide around the far turn, and kept on but got
tired late. HOPE FOR CHANGE pinched an inner foe, raced in midfield from the two path, was driven from the five path into the lane, and gained late. NOW
YOU RULES raced in midpack, was ridden from the three path into the lane, but flattened. PLEASANT VISION chased in the two path but was one paced
into the stretch. WE NEED A FIVE was pinched at the start but unhurried from the two path and never a factor. CH BERN pinched an outer foe, trailed from
inside and was never a threat. SHADY GRADY tracked inside but faded into the stretch. HENNING broke a step slow, was wellback in the two path and no
menace.

Footnotes
PICKING ROSES laid off of the pace in the four path while between horses around the first turn, got floated five wide while picking up stride turning for
home, rallied outside of foes while in pursuit of the clear leader in midstretch, reeled in that foe entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. MONARCH
MAN settled off of the pace in the two path, swung four wide turning for home while inside of PICKING ROSES, sustained a grinding rally between horses
through upper stretch, but failed to match rallying strides with the aforementioned foe in the final furlong, kept on, and reached place soon after. COWBOY
RIDGE set a lightly pressured pace, met NOW NOW MAN's challenge turning for home, swiftly repelled that foe and shook clear entering the lane, but
began to tire entering the final furlong, and was overhauled a sixteenth from home while wandering about. PARALISSFRMANALYSS tugged forward to an
inside tracking position entering the first turn, moved forward two wide and between horses nearing the far turn, cut the corner in pursuit of a clearing
COWBOY RIDGE entering the lane, but only managed to chase along the rail thereafter. PEPPER JACK tracked two to three wide, grinded from between
horses through upper stretch as an outer pair of bidders rallied alongside, but was outkicked by those foes before steadying behind COWBOY RIDGE when
that foe took away his path entering the final sixteenth where. PAPAWS BOY laid off of the pace in the three path while between horses, and made little
impact. BEAUREGARD brushed rivals on either side while breaking last, remained in the six path while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. HOLY
EMPEROR got hung out in the five path while off of the pace, and faded while being floated to the seven path entering the lane. NOW NOW MAN moved
forward to achieve a four to three wide tracking position around the far turn, sustained his gradual advance down the backstretch to be the leader's closest
pursuer, took aim on that foe turning for home, but was turned away entering the lane, and weakened between horses. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY stalked
outside of the pace setter around the first turn, tucked behind that foe down the backstretch, but faded turning for home. TIZ MCNAMARA trailed after being
floated wide into the first turn, tucked from the seven path to the two path around that bend, and never got involved.

Footnotes
MR. WIMBLEDON BAY led from inside, opened up at the top of the lane, and drew clear. PIKACHU chased in the three path, swung out to the six path into
the lane, and kept on. CASTLEBERRY pressed two wide, was driven from the four path into the lane, but finished evenly. CAPTAINS COVE stalked from
inside, saved ground into the stretch, but flattened. ROYAL DE BE tracked from the three path but weakened into the lane. KISSMEISTER bobbled after the
start, was wellback in the four path and was no menace. ROYAL D D rated from the two path but was never a threat. SOBRIETY raced in midpack from the
two path but was empty into the stretch. MOONSHINE SURFER was slow early and trailed throughout.
