TRIBORD forced the pace outside, took over after half a mile, repelled a strong challenge then pulled away through the final furlong. BABY GUNDIN settled
well back, advanced swiftly inside, angled out, bid but proved empty late. WENDY'S FINE WINE stalked the pacesetters outside, lacked a rally and flattened
out. CORBALLY earned a narrow advantage inside then was finished by the far turn. HOLLYWOOD GINA dropped far behind and was never in contention.
OUI MADAME lagged far behind throughout losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
BOURBON BON BAY dueled along the rail, shook loose in midstretch and held on gamely in a determined score. JADES GELLY eased back early,
advanced inside on the turn and closed well too late. DISCO DEJA VU stalked the pace three wide then continued willingly while no threat. SENSE A
MILLION trailed for half a mile, moved wide in the stretch and finished nicely. FLASHING DIAMOND battled the winner outside to the stretch and came up
empty. TIMELY TRADITION raced within striking range early and began fading on the turn.
