THE RIGHT PATH tracked in the two path, was coaxed around the turn to bid between rivals into the lane, and rallied between in the final furlong to get up
late. KING'S HOUSE broke out and bumped DOODLE HOPPER, pressed from the four path, made a bid from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for
place. BERHANU led in the two path, was ridden from the three path into the lane, and kept on to hold show. DOODLE HOPPER was bumped by KING'S
HOUSE, stalked in the five path, was cued from three wide around the turn, but finished evenly. THE EXCEPTION chased in the five path but never
threatened. WHIRLIN CURLIN had a slow start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JARDANI controlled the tempo from the opening bell, raced on the front along the inside entering far turn, surveyed the competition leaving the quarter pole,
kept to task through the stretch, cleared off late. UNION FLEET raced between runners around the turn, took up stalking position between runners into far
turn, queued up nearing the quarter pole, split foes top of the stretch, and dug in through the wire. UNDER THE RADAR raced well off the early pace and in
the five path, stayed off pace and wide into far turn, under a steady drive racing middle of the lane, gained ground late, no threat to winner. MISSION KEY
saved ground around the first turn, shuffled back along the inside leaving the first turn, saved all the ground around the far turn, finished off even through the
wire. ITS OVER stalked the leader around the first turn, stayed just off the leaders flank into far turn, came under a vigorous ride around far turn, flattened
through the startech. COWBOY MALICE slow into stride, never a threat.

Footnotes
ROSELEE very nice clear stalking position around the turn, raced outside the leader nearing the quarter pole, called on for best run leaving the furlong
marker, under a long drive cleared off rival at the wire. ADRIANA ES BONITA leader from the start, raced along the inside under a very snug hold, held
sway nearing the quarter pole, came under outside pressure, was very stubborn through the wire. NOTHINGMAKESENSE off the early pace, raced three
wide into turn, shifted inside top of the stretch, running on left lead, held onto the show money, even strides under the wire. ARIANA VALENTINA tracked
the top pair into the turn, when called on nearing the quarter pole drifted out slightly, urged on through the lane, flattened out late. TAPPI GO LUCKY slow
into stride, lost ground around turn, never a threat.

Footnotes
IYWAAN always between runners, raced off the pace between rivals till nearing the quarter pole, shifted inside nearing the furlong marker, surged to the
front late under a confident ride. SCAR found a very nice three wide stalking position around the first turn, held the three path outside the top pair entering
the far turn, running on a loose rein, put the squeeze play on after leaving the quarter pole, held on gamely through the stretch. TWITTY CITY completely
out of the early picture, was not seen until a mad wide rush around the far turn, raced wide through the lane, gaining ground late. SEVIER found himself on
a nice solo lead after leaving the first turn, rated kindly down the backside, came under heavy outside pressure nearing the quarter pole, could not stay with
the leaders, drifted out late, even strides under the wire. SHOOT THEMESSENGER raced well off the early pace, sent on a four wide rush around the far
turn, could not sustain bid through the lane. MR THRIFTY nice stalking position around the first turn, raced off the leader in the three path into far turn,
called on for run nearing the quarter pole, outrun stretch. AWESOME LAUNCH saved ground around the first turn, always along the inside, roused second
turn, empty stretch. UNION LEADER slow away from the gate, never a threat. LAST PROMISE stalking the leader early on, stayed just off the leader
entering far turn, called on outrun.
