GOOD HEART vied for the early lead on the outside, then dueled for the lead two wide on the turn, then made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear by the
quarter pole, then drew out in the drive while being ridden out. FIRE BARON was off a step slow, then settled towards the inside, then was between horses
by the five sixteenths, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, but flattened out, second best. ROUTE RUNNER was rated along early and saved ground
on the turn, tipped out two wide leaving the turn and made a mild bid two wide by the quarter pole, but needed more late, held show award. MAZING MARK
was off a step slow, reserved early, swung out five wide and had a late rally, missed show award. REGIMENTAL was outrun early on the inside on the turn,
angled out in the lane and offered a belated rally. BAYOU CHROME was rated along early, then was coaxed along and advanced on the turn towards the
inside, then was between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. CRAFTY KING lacked a rally. LEVEL UP chased the pace and was three to four wide on
the turn and tired. DUST STORM rushed up the inside to vie for the lead early, then dueled inside the winner on the turn and tired. KING SHAMAN failed to
menace. GRAPHENE CASSOCK chased the pace four wide and stopped.

ground on the turn, advanced leaving the turn on the inside, then was blocked leaving the three sixteenths and then found room on the inside by the furlong

to settle early, was between rivals by the quarter pole and lacked a rally. BALI KUTA chased the pace four wide and weakened. SHE'S ALL CLASS was

well. MISS SHIPMAN was settled back early, swung wide leaving the turn and closed well. LOVE TANK set a pressured pace early on the inside, then

pop left handed leaving the sixteenth marker and held on to prove best. PRINCESS GRACE stalked the winner and rated kindly on the turn two wide, made
a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, then was gaining late but could not get to the winner, second best. MARKET RUMOR was allowed to settle early,
saved ground on the turn, eased out and came five wide by the quarter pole, rallied well to get the show award late. HENRIETTA TOPHAM tracked the
pace three wide, then was four wide by the quarter pole and had no late kick, missed show award. SUNNY ONE was rated early and was between rivals on
the turn, was in contention by the furlong marker but needed more late. HENDY WOODS tracked the pace and saved ground on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CAMPANELLE (IRE) was rated along and was three to four wide on the turn, made a five wide bid leaving the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole,
then dueled by the furlong marker with BAY STORM, had a long drive with that rival and prevailed, driving. BAY STORM was well placed on the inside,
made a three wide bid leaving the turn and dueled with the winner the final furlong but was outfinished to just miss. SHE CAN'T SING was reserved early on
the inside, eased out on the turn and was six wide by the quarter pole, rallied well on the outside. BROOKE MARIE was allowed to settle early, advanced
three to four wide on the turn, made a five wide bid leaving the quarter pole but finished evenly late. JOUSTER was outrun early, angled out in the stretch
and had a late rally. STAR DEVINE (IRE) chased the early pace, made a three wide bid leaving the turn but faded late. IN GOOD SPIRITS chased the pace
four wide and no rally. CREATIVE CREDIT set the pace on the inside and weakened the final quarter of a mile. CANDACE O lacked a rally. VIOLENZA was
settled on the inside and dropped back. ELLE Z prompted the pace three wide and weakened. TOBYS HEART was bumped at the start, not a factor.

Footnotes
ONE TIMER was away alertly to be soon clear to set the pace while clear, then drew off in the stretch while being kept to right handed crop urging. RUN
CURTIS RUN tracked the pace and was on the inside on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn and finished willingly but was no match for the
winner while clearly second best. BIG INVASION was bumped soundly at the start, then was settled three wide on the turn, shifted out four wide leaving the
quarter pole and then was along late for the show award. ASYMMETRIC (IRE) was allowed to settle early, was on the inside to two wide on the turn, made
a mild bid two to three wide by the quarter pole, but flattened out late, missed show. HEAVEN STREET chased the early pace and saved ground on the
turn, cut the corner leaving the turn and made a mild bid but flattened out. STITCHED chased the pace and was three wide on the turn, swung out five wide
leaving the turn and had no rally. CALL ME MIDNIGHT was settled on the inside on the turn and lacked a rally. TEJANO TWIST was not a threat. ALL IN
SYNC was bumped at the start, reserved and saved ground on the turn, angled out in the stretch and then was in traffic and was hand ridden to the wire,
tough trip. SUMTER tracked the pace two to three wide and weakened. CHANCEUX failed to menace. COINAGE was not a factor.
