Footnotes
THEOCRAT (IRE) launched himself over fence one, struggled some over fence two, jumped well thereafter under reserve, swooped to the lead in the three
path around the final turn, fought inside of the runner-up in the stretch and gamely prevailed. FREDDY FLINTSHIRE jumped well while rated off the pace,
bumped lightly with a rival after landing over fence six, made a bid between foes into the final turn but was beaten to the punch by the winner, moved from
the two to three path around that bend, vied outside of the winner in the stretch and couldn't get by while well clear for the place. SCORPION'S REVENGE
(IRE) raced under steadying restraint while very rank after fence one, struggled over fence two, lagged at the rear, produced a three wide run around the
final turn, held a good striking position while moving inward in upper stretch but lacked the needed response and flattened out but was clear for the show.
DECISIVE TRIUMPH showed the way while jumping well, lost the advantage around the final turn and tired. FAST VISION (FR) struggled over fences one
and two, raced well back on the outside and failed to respond. LYDFORD (GB) was rated on the inside while jumping well, bumped lightly with a foe after
landing over fence six, was roused for his best around the final turn and came up empty. PERFECT TAPATINO (FR) jumped inward over fence one, tracked
the pace on the outside, dropped back after fence seven and faltered.

Footnotes
RAGTIME BLUES bobbled at the break under hustling and dueled inside of BRONX BOMBER down the backstretch, eased off that rival with
seven-sixteenths to go backing away to be just off the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path near the quarter pole and floated four wide into upper
stretch, came again under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong to seize command a sixteenth from home, then inched away in the late
stages to prevail. BRONX BOMBER coaxed from the start, dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his inside early on before being
conceded sole command near the seven-sixteenths, took to the rail three furlongs from home and remained patiently handled through the turn before
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, came under steadily growing threat to the outside and was roused just outside the eighth pole, dug in under
threat getting collared a sixteenth from home and was along safe for the place honors. IN SKY WE TRUST coaxed from the gate, chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. LONG TERM THINKING
coaxed from the start, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper
stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. LOST IN ROME steadied briefly at the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths,
angled seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CASALSA coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing with five-sixteenths
to go, angled five wide for home and tired. MUSICAL AMERICA raced four to five wide in pursuit under coaxing from three furlongs out and trailed.

Footnotes
NUMERO SEIS broke fast and went straight to the front, showed the way while well off the inside, dictated terms in the two path around the turn, responded
well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, extended the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then
was given one pop of a left-handed crop, was placed under a hand-ride into the final sixteenth and proved best under good handling. RUN FOR COVER
stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, lugged in some in pursuit of the winner in upper stretch, chased outside to
the wire and was second best. SIRIUS LIGHT broke in at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground while drafting just behind the leader on the turn, was
roused outside the quarter-pole, cut the corner against the hedge into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but clearly
earned the show. INFLUENTIALOUS lost her footing behind some at the start, moved up then tracked the pace, was asked in the three path on the turn,
chased into upper stretch and came up empty. EXTESSA broke a half-step slow, settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went two to three
wide on the turn, dropped back while climbing some behind horses inside the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch, drifted out near the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. MRS. CASH MAN broke a half-step slow then came inward, was reserved towards the rear, saved ground
while let out on the turn, was roused for more near the quarter-pole and failed to respond. SLY SLOANE broke a half-step slow, was taken back with extra
left-rein pressure while crowded along the hedge early then moved out, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten.

BYE BYE MELVIN forwardly placed tucking along the inside early on under reserve, got conceded the front under the wire the initial time and showed the
way rated in the two path through the first turn and down the backstretch opening up slightly to a clear margin, had the field take closer order three furlongs
from home and had STREET READY latch on outside five-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task to prevail. STREET READY coaxed from the gate, led early on just off the inside before easing back to
concede the front to BYE BYE MELVIN, settled tracking that rival in closest aim just off the inside, began an advanced near the three-eighths pole and
latched on outside with five-sixteenths to run placed to coaxing, spun three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off near the eighth pole and ran on to
preserve the place honors on the wire. GLYNN COUNTY saved ground near the rear of the compact field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took
the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to procure the show honors. FLOP SHOT (IRE) stumbled at the start, tracked just off the inside
from mid pack coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, angled three wide for home and stayed on one paced to the finish. VALUE

at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. IT'S A GAMBLE tracked along the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked.

Footnotes
W W FITZY established forward position from the start, stayed out in the four path early on the first turn then dropped to the three path, prompted the pace
on the outside, took the lead leaving the backstretch, shook clear in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, responded well when set
down in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and maintained a safe advantage under a strong hand-ride to the wire. BEES AND HONEY went three then four
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked in the four path early on the far turn, chased outside through
that bend, dropped to the three path into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best. SWEET WILLEMINA was hustled to the front,
showed the way on the inside, lost the lead leaving the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn, moved out near the furlong marker and weakened but
was clear for the show. FAMILY TIME stumbled badly at the start then bumped soundly with a foe, settled inside of a rival in the two path in the second
flight, was roused while remaining in the two path early on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. LIKE A PRO went around the first
turn in the three path, settled on the outside, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, came into the stretch under a drive and was no factor. LUCKY
PERIDOT bumped soundly with a rival at the start, settled at the rear on the inside, was urged along while continuing to save ground on the far turn and
failed to respond.

Footnotes
INFLATION NATION (IRE) chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into
upper stretch rallying to take command at the three-sixteenths, inched away briefly before coming under threat to the inside, then dug in gamely to the finish
to repel the challenge to the wire. MO SATURDAYS broke a half a beat slow, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, angled in to the inside near the eighth pole and rallied up the hedge latching on the aforementioned foe nearing the
sixteenth marker, fought on gamely to the end but was ultimately rebuffed to the finish. CLUBHOUSE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased just
off the inside from near the rear of the field coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to
secure the show honors. GUCCI BOY broke in brushing the near side stall at the start then shied out from CLUBHOUSE breaking outwards and bumped
with LISTENTOTHEMUSIC, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to
the wire. LISTENTOTHEMUSIC broke a half a beat slow, then got bumped by GUCCI BOY who shied outwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BOLT ABOVE broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, tucked inwards
and then altered out in reaction to MO SATURDAYS just after the break bumping ANTARES into SUSTENANCE, chased three then two wide under a ride
from the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide at the head of the stretch, dug in under a drive, the rider getting his crop caught briefly in the reins when
switching from right to left a furlong out, then weakened to the finish. BALSA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked
inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch under growing threat, got collared with
three-sixteenths to go and tired. ANTARES lunged at the start, then got bumped just after the start by BOLT ABOVE and in turn bumped SUSTENANCE,
raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home
and tired. SUSTENANCE got bumped after the start by ANTARES due to pressure from BOLT ABOVE, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn under motivation with five-sixteenths remaining, tipped four to five wide for home and tired in the stretch. TEXAS
PRIDE devoid of speed early on, grew detached at the tail of the field three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through
the turn, went three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

wide into the stretch and improved to get the last spot in the superfecta. ROSEMARY POTATOES was rated towards the front on the inside, came under

Footnotes
BE YOUR BEST (IRE) coaxed from the gate, raced three to four wide through the first turn before making her way to the inside settling just off the pace,
tracked along the rail from the pocket, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole before pausing tipped to the two path in behind the leader, came
under coaxing once more spinning just off the inside for home, took to the rail straightened away roused, rallied up the inside to take command a furlong
from home, then edged clear to the finish. WHICHWAZE became a bit fractious in the gate in concert with PACHUCA before the start when inspired by
LADY JASMINE who grew rambunctious just prior, was the sole member of the trio backed out and reloaded, came away with the field and was taken in
hand and eased off unhurried to save ground at the tail of the field, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the four path a furlong from home into the clear and kicked on belatedly to get up for the place honors in
the final jumps to the wire. RECOGNIZE established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn before
taking to the rail into the backstretch, showed the way patiently handled coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole as the pressure in behind intensified,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, kept on to the finish battling with
IDEA GENERATION on her right flank and just preserved the show honors on the line. IDEA GENERATION (IRE) tracked the front just off the inside from
mid pack, tipped three wide near the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out before the eventual
winner gave everyone the slip inside that station, then kept on fighting on to the finish latched on the aforementioned foe to the outside but was ultimately
bested for the show honors. PACHUCA grew a bit fractious in the gate in tandem with WHICHWAZE just after LADY JASMINE grew a bit impatient, settled
two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. DAMASO coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn before settling just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, steadily
advanced latching on that rival when put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. LADY JASMINE
grew fractious in the gate leaping up and striking her head before briefly taking a seat in the stall, the rider ejecting before climbing back onboard, broke on
top and settled to track the front just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled four wide into upper
stretch and offered no kick. INDIAN SPIDEROO chased along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, cut the corner into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BE THE BOSS broke a bit awkwardly then bumped with a foe, went to the front then shook clear, extended the advantage in the two path around the turn,
was asked near the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker and proved
much the best while placed under a hand-ride late. MIDASWELLRUN chased the pace down the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path around the
turn, spun three wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. GOT THE GOLD chased the pace down the backstretch,
went three wide around the turn and weakened while able to hold the show. ONCE A GIANT moved in off the pace near the three-quarter pole, settled
towards the back, went four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. LUCKY BRODY was hustled from the start then coaxed along on
the outside, dropped from the five path to the four path on the turn and came up empty. B C GLORY DAYS broke out and bumped lightly with a foe, moved
in around the three-quarter pole, was urged along off the pace, raced in hand leaving the backstretch, was roused in the two path outside the three-eighths,
dropped to the rail later on that bend and capitulated. LORD BROWNIE bobbled ever so slightly at the start then bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the
outside, dropped back four then three wide around the turn and retreated. SCOTTO bumped lightly with a foe at the start then dropped back, angled in
inside the three-quarter pole then moved out around the nine-sixteenths, went five then six wide around the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and was
no factor. STUD PUPPY broke a bit slow, was hard ridden towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch and failed
to threaten.
