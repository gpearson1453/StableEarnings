Footnotes
GREEK GEEK fanned four wide into the opening turn, was allowed to settle off the pace, took closer order outside nearing the three eighths pole, dueled
inside of SMART PLAY off the final turn, was under pressure through the stretch and held safely. SMART PLAY raced at the back of the pack early, started
a bid nearing the five sixteenth marker, matched strides outside of GREEK GEEK but was unable to get by in the stretch and weakened in the final
sixteenth. THESHACK reserved off the early pacesetters, drifted in approaching the stretch and passed tiring rival in the final yards. SMARTY RIVER
PANTS vied outside leaving, was outsprinted to the turn, attended the pace outside of REGAL MAX, was unable to keep the pace with field and faded.
REGAL MAX contested the early pace, dueled inside of SMARTY RIVER PANTS, stopped soon after and was eased.

EVER TRUE led the field leaving the chute then was joined by VISION QUEST in the backstretch, moved clear in the far turn, came under handling into the
stretch and kicked away. BARE BACK JACK picked up the chase in the far turn, drove five to six wide into the lane, rallied through the stretch and held
place. JUMEIRAH COAST saved ground well back, chased wide into the lane, came under heavy handling and improve position deep stretch. NEVVARE
tracked outside in the four path, hustled on the final turn, and finished evenly. BAR NO Q saved ground inside, and lacked a bid. FROBISHER BAY trailed
the field, and closed the gap late. VISION QUEST vied outside early, sat just off the pace racing three wide, and gave way with two furlongs remaining. MY

Footnotes
BIG HUG sat just off the flank of BOOTIFUL ROSE, moved up alongside to challenge the lead nearing the three sixteenth pole, and edged clear deep
stretch under urging. BOOTIFUL ROSE crossed over quickly leaving the gate then rated a slim lead inside, responded to challenge from BIG HUG, and
gave way grudgingly late. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN was under a snug hold inside early, dropped into the final turn, chased in vain through the stretch and
finished well for third. ECHO CREEK sat outside in striking distance, and was unable to improve position in the drive. SINGING BELL bumped leaving, was
never far back inside, angled out to the four path off the final turn, and failed to menace. GOLDIE SOCKS broke in bumping SINGING BELL, sat mid pack
and tired. FAMILY IS GOLD offered little.

SMART CAT sent for speed and was quickest to the turn, remained unchallenged into the stretch, opened up when given cue to an easy victory. CARAVAN
PRINCE dismounted rider loading, stalked from the rail, was no match for the winner and finished second best. BIG JIM dropped back leaving the
backstretch, hustled leaving the final turn, drifted in under right handed urging, and closed well late. KAPTAIN KOWBOY chased five wide leaving the
backstretch, bid outside and flattened in stretch. AGENT C reserved off the pace, rallied early stretch and yielded inside. PARK WEST failed to threaten.
SUNDROP chased outside, and was outrun. ALBERTA no factor.

Footnotes
STEVIE WONDER GIRL rated off the pace while three wide, commenced a bid nearing the three eighths marker, drove up alongside ONEOFTHEMGIRLS
into the lane, dueled clear and held well under steady handling. LILBITSPICY unhurried early, advanced outside in the far turn, angled in at the three
sixteenth pole then shifted out to the three path soon after, and closed gamely, missing out. ONEOFTHEMGIRLS broke alertly then opted to settle in a
stalking position just off THE RIVER GREY, inherited the lead nearing the five sixteenth pole, was joined by STEVIE WONDER GIRL entering the lane, and
lacked the closing response needed. WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE brushed leaving, rated well off the pace, gained closer order under urging, and bid belatedly.
SHAKINOFFTHERUST tracked four to five wide, and faded gradually. SASSY CINDERELLA saved ground to no avail. THE RIVER GREY showed the way,
was unable to keep pace with the field and gave way. LULABELLE outrun throughout.

MUDINATOR pressed the early pace, matched strides inside of LIL ZAPPER, rallied inside approaching the stretch, and edged away. LIL ZAPPER
contended the early pace, dueled outside of MUDINATOR, was set down into the stretch and was out kicked. CARRERA CABALLO chased outside leaving
the backstretch, moved up menacingly then flattened in the stretch and held for show. OUR SUNSHINE trailed the field, and closed with good energy
outside. MOHAMAD chased inside, and had no kicked when asked. LILLY'S OF LONDON chased wide, and lacked a serious bid. BIG BAD INTAGLIO
showed little. KISS ME HELLO chased five wide in the backstretch, and faded.

WILDCAT WILLY settled inside early, waited patiently in the far turn, roused at the quarter pole when rail opened up, and kicked away under a strong hand
ride. ABOVE AND BEYOND stalked four wide through the backstretch, hustled wide into the lane, rallied three wide but was no match for the winner late
stretch. BOSS MAN CAN set a early leisured pace from off the rail, was joined by AMUSING WAY leaving the backstretch, was under attack into the lane
and finished evenly. FLASHFORDANI gave chase into the lane, was all out through stretch but was unable to improve contending position from the rail.
LAST OF WAR unhurried early, and launched a late bid. H K MELODY tracked four wide leaving the opening turn, took closer order nearing the quarter
pole, angled out to the five path, and evened out. TRICKY SPEEDSTER was gapped early and passed tiring foes. AMUSING WAY sat just off the pace
from the four path, was unable to keep the pace with the field, and yielded. AMEER sat mid pack early, and tired.

Footnotes
SOLO RING vied outside for the early lead, held a slim advantage over COMMON KNOWLEDGE in the far turn, kept under under handling outside and
edged clear late. COMMON KNOWLEDGE vied inside but out sprinted to the turn, rallied determinedly inside into the stretch then gave way grudgingly
inside and just held for place. TUCKER TIME chased four to five wide, rallied outside into the stretch, and finished gamely, just missing. MARIA'S SONG
stalked inside and rallied determinedly late. ZICATELA swung out into the lane, and closed well. BACKSTREET BOBBY stalked the pacesetters, angled in
to the rail, and faded gradually inside. VICTORY AT LAST attended the pace while four wide, and tired early. BANG ON offered little. DANCING WILLIE
failed to threaten.
