Footnotes
BROWN DELIVERS vied inside under early rating, took command nearing the backstretch, handled outside pressure then went clear after a half mile, was
under asking past the five sixteenths, came two wide into the lane and widened under a drive. EPIC RISE broke a tad slow then advanced between runners
into the first turn to gain a stalking spot three wide, moved menacingly leaving the far turn to take aim on the winner, gave hard chase into the lane, faded
through the final furlong, saved the place and was reported by the stewards to have bled from both nostrils. AUSPICIOUS LAD , in mid pack and about
three wide, was under a hustling ride leaving the far turn, made a mild four wide run in upper stretch but failed to seriously sustain. ICE BAR lagged back
then angled out for the backstretch run, settled about three to four wide, came five wide for the drive and belated action outside rivals. TRANSFER THE
FUNDS was steadied when in close soon after the break, raced three wide into the lane and failed to menace. NEVERFOLD vied outside the winner around
the first turn and into the backstretch, dropped in chasing around the final turn, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way. BYRON'S GOLD lagged back,
came six wide for the drive and failed to menace. GALWAY LAD , well placed stalking towards the inside, failed to kick on after a half mile and retreated.

factor along the inner rail, gave way late. BLOWN SAVE broke slowly, was outrun and travelled the far turn along the inner rail. URBAN BANDIT , three
wide both turns, chased the pace to mid way on the far turn and weakened. SOUTHERN LAD , rank approaching the first turn, was four wide on both turns

Footnotes
VIRGINIA FULLA was rated back off the early pace and settled inside, commenced a run leaving the five sixteenths, swung out four wide past the three
sixteenths, responded to firmer asking, rolled past the leader nearing the sixteenth pole and drew out under a steady hand ride. CAIRO BOOGIE vied inside
foes into the first turn then eased back to stalk, edged up past the half mile marker, took aim into the lane, shifted out with a furlong remaining and kept on
willingly to gain the place in the final yards. I'M NOT SLOW took over three wide between runners soon into the first turn then cleared, set the pace, came
two wide for the drive, kept on under pressure past mid stretch then weakened late. UNCOMMON VALOR broke a step slow, moved up three deep nearing
the half mile marker, chased and came up empty. TYLER TIME , four deep into the first turn, prompted the pace outside the leader, ranged up after six
furlongs, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and weakened. DASHING CIRCLES vied two wide between runners into the first turn, eased back off the
leaders then stalked between runners past the half, lacked a kick past the three furlong pole and faded. ROCKIN RON , five wide soon into the backstretch,
failed to menace.

Footnotes
LADY SERENITY accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and was under brisk urging in mid stretch. PHAROAHS BABY GYAL , a
forward factor in the two path on the turn, chased the winner in a willing effort. BOSSYNESS saved ground around the turn and failed to rally in an even
effort. REVEILLE SONG , along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and was not a factor. STRUT , no factor, raced inside
horses in the stretch. WAVERLEY was outrun. MARILYNS GONE rushed up early after a slow start, chased the pace while three wide on the turn then
weakened. CHALICE bore in leaving the starting gate then trailed.

Footnotes
MALIBU MOONSHINE , off slow when bumped and forced outward a bit at the break, regrouped and settled off the contested pace, angled out past the
three eighths then gathered steam advancing five wide into the lane, drifted in nearing mid stretch while sustaining her run, was corrected with some left
handed asks, surged away and was steadily hand ridden through the final sixteenth. SHE'S ALL MONEY bore out at the break, corrected and edged up to
stalk the leaders four wide, ranged up four deep past the three eighths, dueled outside a rival from the quarter pole to mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and
dug in to save the place. GRACE AND CHARM rated in range of a contested pace, came under asking three wide chasing the duelers into the lane, shifted
out some but lacked a serious finish. BLOWTHRUYELOWLITES came out at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and raced three deep with the
pace, took a slim lead past the three eighths, dropped in and rated the lead, dug in when challenged nearing the quarter pole, battled inside SHE'S ALL
MONEY and the winner past mid stretch then faded. LIQUIDATOR disputed the pace two wide between foes, raced on near even terms three furlongs out,
failed to kick on heading to the lane and gave way. FIVECOMMATWO , bumped at the break, saved ground leaving the far turn but failed to rally. DIAMOND
SUE broke slowly and was outrun. FREE ADMISSION was gunned up inside rivals to take the early lead, set the pace towards the rail, was pressured by
foes into the turn, ceded the lead near the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
ROCK ROSE saved ground around the turn chasing the pace, advanced in the two path to take command approaching the eighth pole then drove clear.
FORTES raced in the two path on the turn, was taken to the four path in mid stretch and rallied between rivals. QUEEN CASHMERE , a forward factor in the
two path on the turn, moved three wide to reached a striking position in mid stretch then flattened out. CLOSERTOTHEHEART , always wide on the turn,
was six deep turning for home, floated farther out in mid stretch and closed. HOT LOOKIN ROYAL lacked speed, raced well off the and passed tired rivals.
MAMBA QUEEN saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. ICY REPLY , four wide on the turn, failed to rally and bumped SPEAK YOUR MIND when
drifting out in mid stretch. HOT SPICE set the pace along the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. SWEET SENSATION , outrun, was very wide
entering the stretch. SPEAK YOUR MIND , five wide on the turn, was bumped in mid stretch. CHICAGO RIVER raced along the inner rail on the turn while

under a drive past mid stretch, secured command soon past the sixteenth marker then held firm while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. TAKE
CHARGE TOO , bumped and forced out some at the break, regrouped and pulled his way forward to the inside of INVECTIVE to take command, kicked
clear and set a rated pace two wide, kept on under pressure past mid stretch, dug in when confronted and continued gamely between runners. BRILLIANT
ICE drifted out at the break, edged up while saving ground into the turn, took closer order under asking past the five sixteenths, eased out into the lane then
back in, chased and kept on with good energy. NOTIMELIKEPRESENT , bumped from both sides at the break, dropped back around the turn, swung six
wide and continued on with effort. TWICE GOLD drifted out at the break and was off slow, edged up four wide nearing the turn, chased and faded.
NORTHERN TICK TOCK , jostled at the break, saved ground making a mild run into the lane, stayed inside and flattened out. ADDY'S LADDY T N T drifted
in at the break and bumped with a rival, was taken in hand, dropped back around the turn, was eased through the drive and walked off.

Footnotes
BACKNTHEWOODS , urged to the front, set the pace off the rail while handling some early pressure to his inside, spurted away leaving the far turn, turned
away a threat from AL LOVES JOSIE in mid stretch, kicked back away, drifted out some and held firm while kept to task. AL LOVES JOSIE drifted in and
bumped with a rival at the break, straightened and edged up to the inside of the winner and prompted the early pace, steadied nearing the turn, regrouped
and moved up past the five sixteenths, took closer order to loom in mid stretch, failed to match strides but kept on gamely to the wire. GOLDENIZE broke a
bit slow then was pinched back, settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch, worked between foes inside the sixteenth pole and
kept on with interest. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , inside throughout, kept on with effort. HEMP , three to four wide, lacked a bid. HEIR PORT had speed to
chase off the inside, shifted four wide for the drive, drifted in past mid stretch and faded. ROYAL SPY dropped off the early pace, came three wide into the
lane and had belated action behind rivals. SAN ANTONE , bumped at the break, gave some early chase two wide, dropped back around the turn and failed
to make any headway. PEACE OUT , four to six wide, was not a threat. BLUE COLLAR BOOM , three to four wide, failed to kick on under pressure past the
three eighths, dropped back soon into the lane and was eased through the final furlong.
