Footnotes
BROADWAY BOOGIE raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two
path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and pulled clear late. LUMINIST raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half
mile, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn, could not go with the winner late and chased that rival home while drifting in mildly.
EMPRESS AT WAR led the field on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second bend and weakened in
the final sixteenth of a mile. DETERMINED GOLD saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far turn, switched to the outside in upper stretch and improved position mildly from there. DETERMINED EMPIRE brushed lightly with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses,
navigated the far turn from the three path and finished evenly. CAINUDOTHETWIST saved ground in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile,
continued to save ground around the far turn and was empty in the lane. WILDCAT raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn still in the two path and made no bid. OLD SCHOOL (GB) tracked the leader from the two path around the
first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the second bend and faded in the lane. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER trailed the field from the two
path around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and was never a factor. LIVELY REMARK brushed with the
horse to her inside at the break, raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while
saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the lane.

Footnotes
SENDERO hit the gate leaving it, was hurried up to duel on the outside up the backstretch, raced four wide around the turn, took command entering the
stretch and held that margin to the wire while drifting out late. BEE MOUNTAIN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of
a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and chased the winner home in the lane. GETTIN'DOWNONIT raced well off the pace on the inside in the early
going, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground quickly on the outside late. MOON SIGN dueled between horses up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. NOTION pressed the pace between horses
up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the three path and flattened out in the final furlong. UNBRIDLED SASS chased the leader on
the inside in the opening stages, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and was empty from there. GABRIEL'S WING tracked the leaders
between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and faded in the lane. GRANDPA'S KID trailed the field on the outside through
the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the four path around the turn and made no bid. THANK YA PETE led the field on the inside up the backstretch,
dueled while saving ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MR MAC QUHAE rated in the four path, was cued from four wide into the stretch, and rallied. STAR SHOPPING rated inside, angled out to the five path
around the far turn and into the lane, and ran on. EMPIRE BUILDER was in midpack in the two path, swung out to the eight path into the lane, kept on for
show. FREDISATEN was unhurried from two path, moved up to bid in the five path around the turn, and stayed on. SEIZING THE DREAM tracked in the
two path, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, but finished evenly. AZURE SKY was wellback in the two path, swung out to the eight path into the
lane, but was one paced. CHINA BEACH chased in the three path, was ridden from five path into the lane, but flattened. NOMADIC FIGHTER stalked in the
two path, saved ground into the stretch, but weakened. NOBLE CROSS pressed in the two path but gave way entering the lane. AND THE OSCAR GOES
was wellback inside and never a threat. ONE LUCKY DAY led from inside but yielded at the top of the lane. STRATFORD trailed thoughout.
