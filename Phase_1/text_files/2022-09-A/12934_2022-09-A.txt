PRINCESS CHESSIE chased in the two path, bid from inside into the stretch, and held gamely. COAL MINE rated in the four path, swung out to the eight
path into the lane, and rallied down the center for place. MAJESTY'S FREEDOM trailed from inside, was driven from the two path into the lane, and ran on
from the inside to show. WILD ARMY BRAT prompted the pace in the four path, made a bid at the top of the lane but faded. MUSICMANSANDY stalked in
the five path, floated out to the six path into the stretch, but flattened. CONDESCENDING led from the three path but yielded going into the stretch.

ABOUT TODAY (ARG) prompted the pace in the three path, was cued from the four path into the stretch, and rallied to get up late. ZYRAMID led frpm the
two path, was roused and opened up into the lane, drifted in passing the eighth pole, and was caught late to place. NUCLEAR OPTION chased in the three
path, shifted in to the two path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. TIGER BLOOD stalked from inside, was coaxed from the two path into the lane, and
stayed on. TOWN OF GOLD was wellback while saving ground, was cued from inside into the stretch, but finished evenly. TRIKITRAKI rated three wide,
swung out to the seven path into the lane, but was one paced. EPIC LUCK tracked from the five path but faded in the stretch. BAND ON TOUR was
unhurried between rivals but never a factor.

Footnotes
ENGLISH LAD dueled for the lead from the three path, opened up into the stretch, and held gamely. CONSIDER ME pressed the pace from inside, shifted
out to the five path into the lane, and just held on to place. ALIGNMENT rated inside, was roused from the two path into the stretch, and ran on to show.
MAKE THE WAY CLEAR tracked in the three path, floated out to the four path into the lane but finished evenly. FAST RIDE stalked from the three path,
was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. BOYD'S BAND acted upin the gate, trailed from inside, was driven in the three path into
the lane, but flattened. MIGHTY FROSTED was wellback in the four path, swung out to the eight path for the stretch, but was empty. PALLIETER acted up
in the gate, was hustled between foes but was done early.
