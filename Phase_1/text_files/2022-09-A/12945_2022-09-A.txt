LIONS NOT SHEEP was allowed to settled then rallied and saved ground on the far turn, slipped through and drew away in mid stretch and was much the
best. AIN'T THAT A KICK pressed the pace while two wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn, moved out four wide and was shuffled back then came
again in late stretch to be up for the place. ELDON'S SAMURAI stalked the pace while three wide into the far turn, made a bid and was gaining ground but
faltered in late stretch. MOROLICIOUS was allowed to settled in the early going, rallied on the far turn and was inside for the stretch drive but was no
menace in the end. LORD SHAFTESBURY set a well handled pace while inside, drew off on the far turn then dug in but faltered in late stretch. WEST
COAST CHROME stalked the pace while four wide on the backstretch, made a bid on the far turn then gave way. AYE AYE COMMANDER was unruly in
loading then was allowed to settled and was no factor.
