Footnotes
CARNABY STREET stalked the top pair in the early stages, split rivals in the stretch run while racing two to three wide and drew off late under steady
handling. MISS PEABODY bumped the inner part of the gate before being taken in hand soon after the start, was void of early speed to lay at the back of
the pack early on, moved up while racing wide through the stretch, surged deep stretch and got up for the place position in a solid effort. DESERT
TEMPEST chased the top trio early on, raced four wide near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. MASTER SOM showed good early speed to set the
early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DOT MARIE settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and had not enough.
BOUDICA was rated in the early stages, raced five wide near the quarter pole and raced evenly late. DREAM ROLE raced off the early pace, was near the
inside in the streetch run and lacked a rally. FABULOSITY tracked the early leader in the early stages and gave way in the drive while racing three to four
wide. EAST SHORE dropped near the back of the pack early, raced from the outside in the stretch run and had no response. I'M SO COZZE settled to the
middle off the pack early, raced four wide near the five sixteenths pole and never was a factor. FLOWERDEW lost ground through the stretch run and failed
to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
HAWK OF WAR raced off the early pace, moved up six to seven wide through the upper stretch and finished well to just get up in his final strides under
strong handling. ARTIE'S RUMOR was rated to race in hand in the early going, raced four wide near the quarter pole, led late and just missed in a game
effort. FREEDOM MATTERS stalked the pace from the outside, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. PALACE
COUP showed good early speed from the inside to set the pace, dug in eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. LEBLON settled to the middle of the pack
early on, raced two to three wide between rivals in the stretch run and raced evenly late. BE HERE pressed Palace Coup from the outside down the
backstretch and weakened a bit in the final stages. ARGENTELLO (IRE) settled off the early pace, raced four wide in the stretch run and had no late rally.
HAIG POINT was unhurried early to race with the second flight, raced toward the inside through the lane and had no late response. ERON DO
JAGUARETE (BRZ) raced off the pace, was two to three wide in the drive and lacked a bid. ATTORNEY TIM dropped back early and failed to respond.
JIMMY DAN was slow early on and never threatened. BARRISTER TOM was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, checked near the three eighths pole
while racing from the inside and tired readily the final quarter of a mile.

Footnotes
THUNDERING CREED settled to the middle of the pack early, raced six to seven wide through the upper stretch finished strongly to prove best under
strong encouragement. LEMOS CUNHA was void of early speed to race at the back of pack, early on, moved up widest through the upper lane rallied
gamely in the final stages. RED GHOST tracked the early leader in the early stages, raced five wide through the upper stretch, shifted in and finished
gamely to the wire. RISKY REWARD stalked the pace, raced three wide while racing between rivals in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire.
SARANYA raced off the early pace, was six to seven deep into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. MINER'S QUEEN stalked the pace from the
inside, continued an inside bid through the stretch run, challenged for the lead near the eighth pole and was outfinished in the final stages. SOCIAL
CHATTER settled off the early pace along the inside, steadied behind foes approaching the three furlong pole, came into the lane two to three wide, shifted
to the rail in upper stretch, and stayed on in the final furlong and had not enough. AMALFI PRINCESS raced off the early pace, was four wide in the stretch
run and lacked a bid. PYRAMID PRINCESS was rated along in the early stages, checked sharply just past the eighth pole, angled out and never
threatened. PHANTOM VISION was rated off the top trio and tired in the drive while racing four wide. MUSIC CITY STAR sprinted clear early and was
empty late.

WICKED GENIUS settled off the early pace, moved up from the outside through the upper stretch and rallied gamely to just get up under strong handling.
RONSTADT was rated along early, raced five wide near the five sixteenths pole, led inside the eighth pole and just missed in a game effort. NATIONAL
SECURITY was forwardly placed to lay up close in the early going, raced near the two path in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. THE PENINSULA
stalked the pace, was asked nearing the inside quarter pole, raced three to four wide through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. BONUS
APPRECIATION was unhurried early on, raced two to three wide in the lane and had not enough in the drive. UNLEASH THE POWER dropped back with
the second flight, raced four wide near the quarter pole and raced evenly late. JUST CALL RAY was void of early speed, raced three wide through the
stretch run and had no late rally. CAN'T HUSH THIS showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. PATH TO
SUCCESS stalked the pace along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
MAX K. O. stalked the top trio early on from the inside, bumped an outer RUNNIN' RAY approaching the five sixteenths pole while tipping outside of the
pace setter, bid for the lead in the four path at the quarter pole, and held gamely late to prove best under strong pressure. RUNNIN' RAY was rated along
while racing up close from the outside, took a bump from an inner MAX K. O nearing the lane while failing to match bidding strides, raced four wide through
the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. ACCREDIT settled off the early pace, raced three wide near the five sixteenths pole, angled five to six
wide through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. THERAPIST dropped back early on, raced near the inside at the three eighths pole, angled widest
through the stretch run and moved up. LAMPLIGHTER JACK was forwardly place to lay up close early on, was in contention nearing the eighth pole and
faltered late. ENDORSED stalked the pace from the outside and weakened through the stretch run. SPA CITY settled off the early pace, raced two to three
wide in the stretch run and lacked a rally. CUPID'S CLAWS was unhurried early on, raced near the inside in the stretch run and lacked a bid. SPRAWL
dropped back early, raced near the inside at the five sixteenths pole through the stretch and had no response. SONNEMAN was slow early and never
threatened. LONG RANGE TODDY dropped back off the pace, raced far back and failed to respond. THE JOCKEY OF RUNNIN' RAY CLAIMED
OBJECTION AGAINST MAX K. O. FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE AS HIS RIVAL CAME OUT SLIGHTLY, AND THE STEWARDS
RULED NO CHANGE.

STORM KISS pressed the early pace from the outside of rivals, dug in while racing near the rail inside the eighth pole and prevailed under all out pressure
in a determined run. SHANNON pressed the pace while racing between rivals early on, raced three to four wide in the stretch and finished gamely to the
wire to just miss. DUPLICITOUS chased the early pace, raced two wide in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. FAST AS FLIGHT stalked the pace from
the outside, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. AALIYAH EZRI settled off the early pace, raced near the inside in the stretch

Footnotes
LAW PROFESSOR stalked the top trio down the backstretch, raced two wide around the far turn, dug in near the rail at the eighth pole and prevailed late
under all out pressure. SPANISH KINGDOM was coaxed along from the outside down the backstretch, made a three to two wide bid in the drive and
finished gamely to the wire. SHADOW SPHINX settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced seven wide into the upper stretch
and closed well to finish willingly to the wire. FLORIFORM settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced four to five wide into the stretch run and kept on
to the wire. IN LOVE (BRZ) was unhurried early, moved up four wide around the far turn, raced six deep into the upper stretch and raced evenly late.
RAMSEY SOLUTION stalked the pace along the inside, continued an inside run through the lane and had no final winning bid. SOUPER DORMY was rated
to race middle of the pack, raced two to three wide in the drive and lacked a rally. SKYRO stalked the pace and weakened in the drive. NEW YEAR
SURPRISE was off a step slow, void of early speed, raced four wide at the quarter pole and never threatened. MEGACITY showed good early foot to cross
over and set the early pace and gave way the final quarter of a mile. PEACE ACHIEVED was pulled up and had to be vanned off.

Footnotes
AXTHELM tracked the leader from the inside down the backstretch, angled to the outside of Growth Capital and finished determinedly to get up under
strong handling. GROWTH CAPITAL showed good early foot to the early pace, dug in inside the eighth while racing near the rail and just missed in a game
effort. TOLKIEN stalked the pace, raced three wide near the five sixteenths pole, raced four deep near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. BLUE
DEVIL stalked the early going from the outside, raced four to five wide through the stretch run and moved up to improve position. MIRACLE ON ICE was off
slowly, raced six wide into the upper stretch and made a mild late gain. ANDY CANT settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside in the lane and had
no late rally. MINT coaxed along nearing the three eighths pole while racing three wide and gave way in the drive. AMBASSADOR MIKE raced off the early
pace, was near the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. LEVITY raced off the early pace, was six deep near the quarter pole and never threatened.
ARCH EGO settled to mid pack early on, raced four to five wide in the drive and lacked a bid. LOLAS BEAU failed to sustain a bid. HEIR TO GREATNESS
dropped back early, raced from the outside and never was a factor.
