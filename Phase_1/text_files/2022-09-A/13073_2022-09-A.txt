CANVAS ART gave chase and raced off the rail on the turn, dug in leaving the turn and took the nod between horses in the final strides. THELADYISTRUE
chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, left the turn outside, lugged in through the upper stretch and dueled to a brief slim
lead in deep stretch but was nipped in the final strides. COUSIN WINNIE dueled to the lead between horses nearing the three eighths pole and set a
pressured pace, drew clear past the eighth pole but was caught in the final yards. JUBA'S HOUSE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the
three path, steadied off the heels of Theladyistrue mid-stretch but came again and finished well. WINDSOR'S PLAY showed the way early then gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the turn but flattened the final sixteenth. ELLIES LIL CASTLE was not a factor and rounded the
turn in the five and six paths. FEAR THE DIVA contested even terms leaving the three eighths pole and raced close at the rail on the turn, but weakened

Footnotes
TRINGALE tapered in and stalked two deep, bid nearing the three eighths pole, reached the front two deep approaching the top of the lane, dueled clear in
the upper stretch and held well under steady handling. AARON'S TAP settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, left the turn about the four path, took over second mid-stretch and finished well. BETTER BOOGIE moved to
the rail and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met toward the head of the lane and flattened inside the eighth pole.
BOATSWAIN rated off the pace inside on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little
further. JAMMIN STILL came away awkwardly, rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. SUNMAN showed little response. RESIDENT saved early ground, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. PERFETTO rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.
