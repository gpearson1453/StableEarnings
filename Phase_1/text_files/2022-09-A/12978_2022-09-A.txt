LOTTA PRADA pressed the pace from the three path then took over before the seven furlong pole and drew clear under light urging. LUNA ROSE vied for
the lead from the inside moved out to three wide before the end of the turn to make a late bid and proved second best. OUTLAW QUEEN was hustled to the
lead from between horses then moved in to save ground around the turn and was empty in the drive. CHASING DIVINITY was unhurried down the
backstretch was four wide in upper stretch but never launched a solid bid. PLAYAS GEMELAS was never a threat.

Footnotes
CLAIMJUMPER was last away then steadily advanced to the turn from the two path then moved in on the turn to slip through in upper stretch and drew off.
UNCLE TAP was hustled to vie for the lead from the three path but was no match for the winner. ALL RISE UP was reluctant to load then had brief early
speed and fought gamely to the wire. TAPPIN' THE BLING pressed the pace from between horses and flattened out in the drive. ARCH'S WILD had a wide
trip. LONESTAR CHROME was fractious in the gate, then tracked the leaders from the inside down the backstretch then dropped back at the five sixteenths
pole.

Footnotes
GOVENESS SHEILA vied for the lead from the two path then took command at the seven furlong pole and drew off. ABUELA CORI was placed off the pace
in the three path made a three wide bid going into upper stretch then floated out to four or five wide in to the stretch and proved to be second best. WILD
SAINT was forwardly placed in the four path made a mild bid in mid turn, was four to five wide in upper stretch and flattened out. MYSTIC WIND raced near
the back off the rail then made a two wide bid on the turn and finished evenly. AIR WALKER was last away, mild advance on the turn then moved out to six
wide in upper stretch to improve position. PUT A BLING ON IT was fractious in the gate then sprinted to the lead from the inside and gave way in upper
stretch. KISS OF CRAN tracked the leaders from the inside to no avail. HANNAH'S STORM raced widest of all.

from the inside early then tracked the leader around the turn and dug in late to hold on to the place. FIRST ALTERNATE tracked the leaders from the inside
to the turn then made a rail bid on the turn and just missed the place. BIND ME UP was not a factor. JUST LEAVE was outrun.

CELEE'S LAST TE was rouse to the lead going into the first turn then set all the pace while increasing the margin, as the rider pleased. BLUE MOUNTAIN
BELL raced in the middle of the pack from the three path to the final turn then made a three wide bid on the turn but was no match for the winner and proved
second best. A J'S RIDE tracked the leaders around the first turn and down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn but failed to sustain that bid
and chased the leaders home. SHE'S SMART ENOUGH was placed off the pace in the two path down the backstretch and weakened in the middle of the
final turn. BEHOLD THAT WORD was unhurried through the final turn but was never a threat. TYLERS ANGEL WINGS was allowed to settle near the back
and was outrun.
