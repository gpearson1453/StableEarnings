MELITZA was settled back early, shifted out and started her steady advance leaving the half mile marker, continued that advance on the turn and came five
wide into the lane, closed well to get up in time under a mild drive. HEARTBURN set the pace on the inside and was well handled, drew clear leaving the
turn and was caught late, second best. MUSAMAHA was rated early, made a three wide bid when roused on the turn but flattened out in the drive, bested
rest. CUENCA was settled back early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. MONSTER RISING was fractious in the gate, settled on the inside,
shifted out and was three wide on the turn and had no rally. TIP TOP TAPPER chased the pace four wide and tired. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL tracked the
pace two wide and stopped.

KITTEN'S SOLUTION stalked the pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn and then got up late after a long drive to prove best. NAUTICAL
NATURE dueled for the early lead three wide and made a two wide bod on the turn to draw clear, then dug in by the sixteenth pole but was caught late.
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was settled early and three wide on the turn, angled in and closed well up the rail. KING ECLIPTICAL dueled for the lead on the
inside and weakened. ZANNO chased the pace and was four wide on the turn and then was empty. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER was settled back early, came
widest into the lane and had no rally. MILITARY DRILL was off slowly and raced four wide on the turn, not a threat. WORLD OF FOOLS was settled on the
inside and dropped back.

Footnotes
SWAN POINT was allowed to settle along the inside, was asked nearing the five sixteenth and shifted out and made a five wide bid, then came in leaving
the turn bumping with EIGHT DANZAS, then was corrected and drew clear to prove best under a drive. EIGHT DANZAS was rated along three wide, made
a quick decisive move at the five sixteenths and drew clear, then was put to a left hand crop leaving the turn and was bumped and knocked sideways by the
three sixteenths, then got back into stride and battled willingly to the wire, second best. MY DIXIE LASS was well placed along the inside, then was boxed
by the five sixteenths to the quarter pole, swung out three wide leaving the turn for racing room, then shifted back to the inside when by the tiring
frontrunners and finished well on the inside, tough trip. GINGERS WISH was settled three wide, then was four wide by the quarter pole and weakened.
IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN pressed the pace three wide and tired. LADY CINCO DE MAYO set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. THE
STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THERE WAS A JOCKEYS OBJECTION INTO THE RUNNING OF THIS RACE, AFTER THE STEWARDS
REVIEWED THE REPLAYS THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS.

ALPHA SIXTY SIX pressed the early pace between horses and three wide, then dueled for the lead outside of MY WALLY on the turn, then made a bid and
drew off in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. MY WALLY set a pressured paced early while two wide, then remained in the two path and dueled
inside the winner on the turn and proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. FREEDOM'S START prompted the early pace four wide,
then chased the pace four wide on the turn and weakened, bested rest. MR DUBAI pressed the early pace on the inside, then fell back on the turn and
came two wide into the lane, came in by the three sixteenths shutting off MY MAN GEORGIO and weakened. MY MAN GEORGIO was reserved early, then
began to unwind on the turn while saving ground, but was shut off leaving the three sixteenth and had to alter course, no rally. THE STEWARDS POSTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THIS RACE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THEY DISQUALFIED MR DUBAI FROM FOURTH AND
PLACED HIM FIFTH.

BOURBON MUSIC stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to take over, then shook clear leaving the turn, then was
given two pops right handed with the crop leaving the furlong marker and responded well, then one left handed by the sixteenth marker and was well clear
to prove best. MARVALOUS MIKE tracked the early pace four wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, but could not go with the winner while clearly
second best. TRIBAL NOTION was bumped at the start, settled early and was four wide on the turn, came six wide into the drive and was along for the
show award. DOLLARIZATION chased the pace and was three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked the needed bid.
JUMPMASTER chased the pace in between rivals early after a not so sharp break, then was two to three wide on the turn and weakened. NICE WEATHER
set the pace on the inside and weakened. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

ROSES FROM HEAVEN stalked the early pace three wide, then was coaxed along at the five sixteenths to keep the pacesetter in range, then made a bid
leaving the turn and was roused right handed by the furlong marker and responded at once, then was given one left handed to correct, then switched back
to give one more right handed reminder while drawing away to prove best, sharp. HILL VALLEY was allowed to settle early on the inside, eased out on the
turn and advanced five wide by the quarter pole, then finished willingly to be up for the place award. LADY MUNNINGS set the early pace while clear on the
inside, then drew out on the turn, but weakened the final furlong, bested rest. FAIRY DUST was settled back early and advanced on the turn on the inside
but lacked the needed rally on the inside. RAN CHAR tracked the early pace on the inside, then shifted out and came four wide into the lane but came up
empty. HAY BUCK was settled four wide and stopped.
