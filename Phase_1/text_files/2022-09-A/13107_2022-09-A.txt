Footnotes
I'M LUCKY showed the best early speed and got to the rail at the outset was challenged every step of the way drifted out some through the stretch but had
enough left to hold on for the win. BURGAMEISTER engaged for the lead from the outset while in the two path was carried out a bit wide through the stretch
and was inching closer to the winner in the final yards. HYPER DRIVE stalked the pace while along the inside had a perfect rail trip when the leaders drifted
out entering the stretch but lacked a closing rally and had to settle for third. BEHOLD DE FLAME was away in the back of the pack along the inside and
never mounted a serious bid while along the rail throughout. NO SHOW WAGERING DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE HALF MILE TIME WAS

FASHIONABLY QUICK was not the quickest from the gates but was hustled from the rail to take the lead and save the inside position was challenged every
step of the way and edged clear in the late stages. TAP THE HEART was away in good order but could not get to the rail engaged for the lead in the two
path came a bit wide entering the stretch and then tired in the final yards but was able to hold second. B'ESAME ME MUCHO was allowed to settle well off
the pace along the inside angled out for the drive and was finishing with interest. QUEEN OF THE ICE chased the pace along the inside but could not make
up any ground through the stretch. MY INSTIGATOR was away best and then allowed to settle in the two path while chasing the pacesetters but had
nothing left for the drive. THERE WAS NO SHOW WAGERING

D L'S GIRL chased the pace in the two path angled out for the stretch run and steadily cut into the leaders margin and took the lead inside the final sixteenth
for the victory. HATCHET GURL was able to show the best early speed and get to the rail up the backside opened a good lead turning for home but gave
way in the final yards while clearly second best. ZIPPORAH was well off the pace in the early stages while racing in the two path came wider turning for
home and finished well. AINTTHATRIGHTUHHUH was well off the pace along the inside came through along the rail and made a mild bid for fourth. GOLD
PASS raced four wide the entire race and lacked the needed rally. TOURIST LIKE ME was up close in the early stages along the rail but dropped back
going into the turn and was not a factor after that. SENTIMENTAL CROSS showed good early speed to challenge for the lead in the two path was prominent
until the turn and then faded quickly. PROMPTLY DONE was away in good order and midpack in the early stages and then dropped back quickly between
rivals entering the turn. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE FRACTIONS WERE HAND TIMED

BANJO BILL was away in good order and battled for the lead on the inisde from the outset. RANDOM AFFAIR was away quickly but could not get to the rail
into the first turn battled for the lead in the two path but could not match strides with the winner in the stretch. THE GREATEST EAGLE was well back along
the inside in the early stages began a rally on the final turn and was forced five wide as the field turned for home rallied ion the outside for third while never a
threat to the top pair. LOOKING FOR BULL raced along the inside while mid pack angled out for the drive but could not make up the need ground.
THETRASHMANSCOMING was well off the early pace then made a big move three wide up the backstretch but could not sustain that rally through the
stretch and dropped back. ASTUTE WARRIOR raced mid pack in the two path but did not have a rally and dropped back. BOLD IMAGE was up close along
the inside after the first quarter and remained towards the front of the pack until entering the second turn and then dropped back quickly.

WHEELER DEALER was away with the field and was able to save the rail took a clear lead into the turn and steadily increased the margin and then was
much the best through the lane while not asked for his best. LUCYS MAJOR MIRCLE was four wide going up the backstretch and then three wide on the
turn but was able to get second. BARTSTER was away well and battled for the lead in the two path but was no match for the winner through the stretch and
was outfinished for second. YOU'RE MY ROCK raced three wide the entire race and never mounted a rally. EYES ON MOONSHINE was away very slow
spotting the field about five lengths and never mounted a rally. CHIEF RULES was up close to the pace but could not handle the turn was eased and
finished the race in a gallop.

entering the stretch and held gamely until the final yards. JIMBO'S BIZ was well off the pace came three wide on the turn and then six wide at the top of the
lane while third best. SILVER MAKER raced in the two path on the turn and then fanned four wide for the stretch run but could not make up any ground.

Footnotes
BRING THE POSSE showed good speed but was hung three wide on the turn vied for command at the eighth pole and edged clear in the final yards.
GRAND EXPECTATIONS made a big move on the inside through the turn to get into contention angled out for the drive but could not match strides with the
winner late. SHASTAWIN was away a step slow but was hustled to the lead and saved the rail took the lead into the stretch but gave way through the
stretch. YA THINK was well back in the early stages was hustled to mid pack then saved ground while shuffled back a bit and came back some through the
stretch run. MS BUMBLEBEE came six wide entering the stretch and dropped back a bit then made a mild bid on the far outside for as minor share. TUDIE
LU had the perfect inside trip to try to get into contention but never mounted a serious rally. IMA HOT TOTTIE showed good early speed but was off the rail
and then gave way on the turn. FLYING LADY was well in the back while racing on the outside and had little to offer in the stretch run. MIDNIGHT GHOST
was always well back and never a serious threat.
