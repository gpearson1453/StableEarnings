Footnotes
BIZZY GIRL raced back early on, ranged up three wide nearing the lane, was in the five path entering the lane, swept past the leaders once in the lane and
drew off in hand. QUEEN TAPITURE was checked along the backstretch from the inside at the five eighths pole, regrouped and angled out and raced in the
five path into the lane and was no match for the winner in the stretch but held place in the final stages. MEAN ELENITA raced back early on, was in the four
path into the lane and did not have enough for place in the final stages. SURE ENOUGH vied early on from between horses, led near the quarter pole, was
in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. MACI'S GEMSTONE was in the three path into the lane and improved position in the
stretch drive. SISTER CODE vied for the lead early three wide, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. IN A PEACH was bumped
early on and soon folded up. UNLEASH THE SPIRIT was never involved. BOSTON TO BOZEMAN had early speed then retreated.
