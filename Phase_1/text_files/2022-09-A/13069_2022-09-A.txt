Footnotes
HEY SEQUOIA saved ground while being never far back, angled out three-wide for room nearing the the quarter pole and finished strongly to be up in the
final sixteenth. UPO was prominent from the start while racing three-wide, moved up to engage the leaders at the three-eighths pole, dueled with Six
Blessing into deep stretch, but was unable to resist the winner late. SIX BLESSINGS saved ground setting the pace under pressure from Goldie's Hills,
responded when asked to continue dueling for the lead to the sixteenth pole and held on well for the show. EROTIC steadied repeatedly early around the
first turn to the half mile pole racing in tight between horses, swung to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly when clear. GOLDIE'S
HILLS disputed the pace while racing two-wide for six-furlongs and tired.

MARKSMAN ON TARGET saved ground setting the pace in hand, gradually opened clear and was ridden out to increase his advantage. ROCKED saved
ground stalking the pace, angled out for the drive, could not threaten the winner but continued on well for the place. SENOR FABULOSO was unhurried
early, moved forward along the inside on the turn, but lacked a rally. CHARLIE THE GENT was forwardly placed for six furlongs while racing two-wide and
tired. ATLATL steadied on both turns from along the inside while trying to get out, swung out to be six-wide entering the stretch and was not a factor. LUCK
IS MY NAME was prominently placed for six furlongs while racing three-wide and gave way.

LUTES LIL GIFT vied with Yes Your Graze from along the outside, shook that one off nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. YES YOUR GRAZE
disputed the pace from along the inside into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner during the drive but held on fairly well for the place.
PATRICIA L saved ground while being allowed to settled in stride, steadied looking for the room nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out to come
four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. PIRATES CROSS saved ground while being forwardly placed, slipped through during the drive and went
evenly late. ZAZEN was well placed while racing two-wide on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. ALWAYS FOR MONEY bobbled
at the start, then raced three-wide and failed to threaten. AWESOME DAZE dropped back early while saving ground, angled out for the drive and failed to
menace.

TOO TALL TO CALL went to the front at once, saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. SYZSLAK was allowed to settle in stride,
steadied nearing the three-eighths pole while looking for room, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. COWBOY CAUSEWAY
saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. GOOD OLD FAITHFUL was unhurried early, moved out to be
six-wide the final quarter mile and was gaining slightly late. PHILIPIE FAST prompted the pace while racing two-wide and tired. STANWOOD WARRIOR
raced four-wide on the turn and failed to threaten. IMISSBAYMEADOWS hopped in the air, then stumbled at the start and unseated his rider, then was
walked off following the race.

FANTASTIC DAY was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch, caught the leaders at the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. STAND TO dueled
with Coastal Jazz for the lead from along the inside, responded when headed leaving the eighth pole and held on gamely for the place. COASTAL JAZZ
vied for the lead to the eighth pole from along the inside and weakened slightly late. MIRROR IMAGE saved ground while being forwardly placed but lacked
a rally when asked. HEREDIA BOXER bobbled at the start, then moved up three-wide to reach contention nearing the turn, was fou-wide entering the
stretch and tired.
