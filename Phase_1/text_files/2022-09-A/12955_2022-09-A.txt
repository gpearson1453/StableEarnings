OUT OF TOWNER was hard held in the two path, tipped out to bid from the four path into the lane, and drew clear. LUCKY FOR SHORE led from inside,
was driven from the four path into the stretch, and held place. THREE O ONE steadied at the start, trailed along the inside, saved ground into the lane, and
rallied for show. GRAND PLAYER tracked from inside but flattened going into the lane. TAPPED OFF was keen to press two wide but gave way going into
the stretch. KEFI chased in the four path but was no menace. BORRELLY was wellback in the three path and not a factor. SAM LORDS was unhurried from
the five path and done early.

pole, but held gamely. CRABS N BEER chased in the five path, was roused from three wide around the far turn, and ran on down the center for place. THE
SKIPSTER led from the two path, was driven inside going into the lane, lugged in and was corrected but drifted back out and bumped with the eventual

PADRE was hard held from the four path, was cued from two wide into the lane, but was one paced. BAD TO THE BONES was taken back in the two path
but never threatened. DAMIR stalked from inside but was empty into the stretch. ROD TWO ROD bumped an outer foe, was unhurried in the five path and
never menaced. BE YOURSELF bumped with an inner foe and trailed throughout. A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION WAS MADE BY THE RIDER OF, THE

Footnotes
CHEROKEE PARTY turned off the lights on this party soon after the start, took control around the turn, clear sailing under a hand ride. BEAUTY N BRAINS
tracked the leader soon after the start, held nice two wide position around the turn, could not stay with runaway winner, finished willingly for the place
money. SUZY Q THE QUEEN stalked the top pair into the turn, sent three wide when called on, shifted out five wide top of the lane, came home under even
strides. SUNDAY SWAGGER raced off the pace towards the inside, pressed on for best stuff around the turn, had no late kick. BALBOA'S SMILE slow into
stride, came under a drive around the turn, came up empty late.
