SUEZ stalked the leader inside up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid at the quarter pole, took over the lead from LUCKS BIG BOY upper stretch then
took on the challenge from APOLLO BAY, vied along the inside, came under a left handed drive, drifted out and bumped into APOLLO BAY in the final
furlong. APOLLO BAY settled through early stages then hustled up three wide entering the lane, challenged SUEZ for the lead, vied outside of rival in the
final furlong and had progress impeded when SUEZ drifted out repeatedly through the lane. LUCKS BIG BOY sped to the lead at the start and widened to a
clear advantage around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch and around the far turn, got collared by APOLLO BAY in upper stretch and just
lasted for show. NUGGET OF GRACE tracked the leader three deep up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide into the lane and just missed show.
DREAMER'S DELIGHT raced in the last flight, saved ground around the far turn, shifted three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. WAR REPORTER
tracked the pace racing between foes up the backstretch then came u empty around the far turn. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY SUEZ WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR IINTERFERENCE WITH APOLLO BAY IN THE STRETCH

CLASSIC BET advanced to a slim lead soon after the start, vied inside of JOE BILL around the turn, battled on holding a slight edge past the furlong marker
then dug in gamely, edged ahead and held firm. JOE BILL applied pace pressure to CLASSIC BET up the backstretch and dueled for the lead two wide
around the turn, battled on into the lane and failed to match strides in deep stretch. LUCKY DUDE was ridden along two wide in pursuit of the top pair
around the turn, came two wide into the lane, found more in late reserve and finished willingly. DRAG MALIBU raced in contention in the opening quarter
then flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. PRINCE OF EARL raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
PRINCESS NAYYY NAY sped to the lead at the start and showed the way up the backstretch and around the turn, repelled the bid from SABRIA in upper
stretch then widened advantage and finished clear. GATA RUNZ was slow into stride out of the gate and remained reserved in the back, picked up the
tempo two wide late on the turn, steadily edged up closer then finished willingly to capture place. SABRIA tracked the leader into the turn then launched a
two wide bid heading into the lane, raced in striking distance but could not get by, weakened off the leader and got nipped for place. MISCHIEF MAMA
chased between rivals up the backstretch, coaxed three wide around the turn then ran on evenly through the lane. DIXIE PENNY raced three deep in the
opening quarter then failed to progress around the turn and faded in the lane. THAT LUVIN FEELING chased along the rail around the turn then retreated
through the lane.

KAYLA hooked up with SIMMERING on the first turn and dueled through the backstretch, battled on around the far turn, shook free at the head of the lane,
turned back the bid from BUG A BOO a furlong out and finished clear. BUG A BOO settled off the pace in early stages then picked up the tempo near the
half mile marker, advanced into contention around the far turn, launched a bid for KAYLA heading into the lane, raced in threatening range but could not
reach the eventual winner and had to settle for second best. SIMMERING hooked up with KAYLA around the first turn and dueled for the early lead, battled
on around the far turn, failed to match strides at the head of the lane, weakened but finished well clear over the rest. PAPA'S SECRET was reserved racing
well off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the lane and failed to impact the top trio. PICTURE LADY raced in contention through the backstretch
then weakened around the far turn and continued to fade through the lane. JIBE came up empty around the final turn, dropped far back and jogged in.

Footnotes
C R INSTA GATOR was forwardly placed soon after the start and raced just off the early leader, hustled along three wide into the lane and dueled for the
lead mid-stretch, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away. PALACE GUARD tracked the top pair into the turn, was ridden along four wide into
the lane, vied for the lead in the final furlong, fought on determinedly but got denied in deep stretch. BIG LUKE raced off the early pace, chased three wide
around the turn, edged closer then shifted inside and finished willingly. DIXIEMAGIC sped to the lead at the start, led the way under some pressure, hustled
along two wide into the lane, battled for the lead in the final furlong then yielded in final stages. ACCELERITAS chased midpack along the inside, saved
ground around the turn then flattened in the final furlong. LAVENDER LIL raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then shifted three wide for the
drive and lacked a needed rally. DREADPIRATEROBERTS raced off the early pace, urged two wide around the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SCRUTINIZER sped to the lead at the start and held clear around the turn, was ridden along two to three wide into the lane, responded willingly when called
upon and finished much the best. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE stumbled badly at the start and lost four to five lengths on the field, continued reserved in the back,
saved ground then tipped two wide for the drive and got up for place. GINGER RULES raced four wide off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and
captured show. SHUT UP MAN chased in range between rivals in early stages then dropped to the inside midway around the turn, sustained inside bid into
the lane then flattened late. LANCELOT N ELAINE raced in contention along the inside up the backstretch, switched two wide around the turn then
weakened in the final furlong. ITSALLABOUTYOU raced three wide off the early pace and lacked a needed rally. KWAI CHANG raced three deep in
contention heading into the turn, sustained bid into the upper stretch then retreated.
