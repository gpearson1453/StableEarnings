in mid stretch but was able to be up for show. OGRE'S LION KING broke out at the start then trailed into the first turn, advanced down the backstretch

Footnotes
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was roused to the lead from the inside down the backstretch then was headed at the five sixteenths pole fought with outside rival
to the eighth pole and dug in to prove best. DEBONNAIRE DUDE sprinted away from the gate to be forwardly placed off the leader in the two path through
the first turn and down the backstretch moved to engage the leader at the five sixteenths pole and fought gamely to the eighth pole but couldn't match
strides late and was second best. CABO'S RUMOR raced in the middle of the pace in the two path and improved position late. BINDING was unhurried and
never a threat. OUTLAW X. was hustled along around the first turn to be placed off the pace in the three path down the backstretch but was no match for
the top two and tired in the drive. MIDNIGHT REVOLT saved ground to no avail.

CLASSIC INTENTION was hustled to the lead from the inside to set all the pace and drew off in the stretch. WHISKEY OVER ICE raced near the back from
between horses then steadily advanced down the backstretch, made a three wide bid in upper stretch to get up for the place. MO TAP was rushed to
contention around the first turn then was placed off the pace in the two path through the final turn and tired in the stretch drive and missed the place.
WHITAKER tracked the leaders from the inside throughout but never made a serious bid. EYE DEE KAY raced near the back early then steadily advanced
down the backstretch from the three path move out to four wide in upper stretch but failed to menace. CPRIORITY was unhurried to the final turn then made
a mild bid going five wide in upper stretch but was not a factor. ALLIGATOR CRAWL saved ground around the first turn from the middle of the pack then
dropped back going down the backstretch and was not a threat. PESO IN MY POCKET stalked the pace to the backstretch and retreated.
