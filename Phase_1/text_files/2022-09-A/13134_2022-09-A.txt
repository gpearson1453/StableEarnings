ARTISTIC ALIBI bumped at the break would save ground through the turn into upper stretch surging clear late from the rail. PANGEA in close at the break
would lag through the turn responding in the three path mid stretch to finish strong while in a bit close. ALITA raced evenly through the turn racing five then
four wide down the lane needing more at the end. JESSICA BLAH BLAH chased the pace through the turn weakening between horses inside the eighth
pole. SHARED MISCHIEF veered out bumping rival at the break rushing to clear hustling through the turn holding margin in upper stretch stopping abruptly
outside the sixteenth pole. TORIANNE was always outrun.

turn extending three deep from the eighth pole ceding grudgingly to inside pressure. REGAL HOLIDAY pressed early then chased on the turn vying near
mid track down the lane needing a bit more late. ON TILT sent hard pressed through the turn moving between horses in upper stretch weakening late.
GATORATER raced evenly moving six wide through the lane. FLY SWEET SKY faded on the turn.
