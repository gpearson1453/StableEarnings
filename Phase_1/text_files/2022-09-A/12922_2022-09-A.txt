SILVER MOON ROAD lead the way from the two path into the turn and held sway down the lane to prove best in the end. MUSIC TO MY EARS chased the
pace from the inside, then settled back on the turn to rally mid stretch but it was not enough. KREWE CHIEF was unhurried early, was urging gamely on the
turn and closed well from the four path in the stretch and was up for show. RED HOT DEVIL chased the pace while two wide, bid in the upper stretch then
flattened out in the end. SUGGESTED settled along the inside, then bid mildly in the stretch and was no threat. WINGING WAYS chased the pace while
three wide, was steadily fading on the turn and had no final bid. JILLS PASSION pressed the pace from the three path, was in a hard drive on the turn, was
used up and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRAFALGAR SHORE saved ground, rallied at the quarter pole, got through on the rail inside of the leader and was clear under steady urging. MISS LUV
SHACK pressed the pace inside, settled into the turn, bid at the quarter pole, dueled late but was outfinished. IMAGE RUN stalked the pace in the four path,
bid at the eighth pole but couldn't close late. TALKTOMEJUSTICE was clear early, vied between foes, then yielded late. VALSHEBA had a mild late bid
inside. BUOY raced evenly in the four path. LOONA LUV raced in the five path but was not a factor. SUMMER HOME stalked the pace in the five path
before fading in the stretch.
