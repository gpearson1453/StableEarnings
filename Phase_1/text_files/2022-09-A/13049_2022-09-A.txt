JOAN'S SONG showed good early speed and set the pace, was well handled then was in a hard drive to hold sway in late stretch. WARRIOR GRAY was
inside early then rallied three wide on the turn, stayed three wide in the stretch drive and was gaining ground to be second best. CAT GOT LUCKY chased
the early pace then raced two wide on the turn, made a bid but came up empty in late stretch. POLLY SPENT IT was rank on the backstretch then settled,
made a bid three wide on the turn but flattened out in late stretch. HONOR GRADUATE rallied four wide into the turn to upper stretch but was no menace in
late stretch. SANDPLUM CREEK broke awkwardly at the start then settled, made a five wide middle move on the turn and flattened out in the stretch.
DEN'S ROSE had his head turned as the gate opened then broke a step slow and was used up and stopped.

Footnotes
BECKY'S TATTOO was chasing the early pace then taken back off the pace, saved ground on the turn then rallied along the inside in the stretch and
powered to the front in late stretch to be best in the end. FACESTER rallied three wide on the turn making a strong bid, gained the lead in mid stretch and
dig in gamely but hung in late stretch. DOC'S DENITA was unhurried early then rallied four wide in the stretch but was no menace in late stretch. LEMONS
IS GONE rallied on the turn while two wide on the turn, made a bid then flattened out in the drive. BODIE'SLITTLEGIRL stalked the pace while inside, made
a bid but was no menace. CHERISH THE DAY was two wide on the backstretch, was steadied off heels then was no threat. LITTLE SURE SHOT had good
early speed to set the pace, was used up then steadied when in tight at the quarter pole and stopped.
