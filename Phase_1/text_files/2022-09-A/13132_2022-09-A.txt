Footnotes
VENICE BEACH prompted the pace in the two path, took the lead from inside going into the turn, and drew clear in the stretch. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE
stalked in the three path, bid from the four path in the lane, but was repelled to place. PURE TAP rated in the three path, was driven along while floating out
to the seven path into the stretch, and improved from the outside of rivals to show. INDY REBEL tracked in the three path, was ridden from the four path into
the lane, but finished evenly. MYDADSBETRTHANYURS chased in the four path but was one paced entering the lane. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE raced in
midpack from the three path, was hustled from the four path into the lane, but flattened. EVEN MONEY was unhurried from the two path, swung out to the
eight path into the lane, but was empty. SPINEL led from the three path early but gave way entering the lane. GO RODNEY was wellback inside and never
a menace. MIGHTY CONTENDER was behind early and never a threat.

Footnotes
KIMBERLEY DREAM led from the two path, was roused from the three path into the far turn, and dug in gamely. CHOCTAW BINGO tracked in the three
path, bid from the four path into the lane, but hung. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM prompted the pace in the two path, was hustled from inside into the lane but was
empty. KYNANCE (IRE) bumped at the start and trailed throughout.
