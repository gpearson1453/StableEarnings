Footnotes
ZIPPITY DAY was allowed to settle near the back, rallied entering the far turn travelling four wide circling runners, drifting in a bit battling for the lead in mid
stretch between horses and began to inch away nearing the wire. SILENT CREEK advanced outside runners down the backstretch, was shuffled back
nearing the three eighths marker, regrouped four wide to rally at the quarter pole and was gaining steadily through the stretch. BRIENNE OF TARTH took
command from the start, was pressed mildly down the backstretch, opened up on rivals entering the far turn, was challenged by the winner at the top of the
lane, battled on gamely inside until the very late stages and gave way losing second at the wire. SHAZEEN settled near the rear in the beginning, began to
put in a run with three furlongs to go just outside of runners advancing through the turn, angled out to the six path for the drive and had showed interest in
the stretch to get up for a minor share. IVICTORY broke awkwardly at the start to trail the field , settled inside near rear down the backside, could not get
involved through the far turn and passed tiring runners with an eighth to go. ROOKIE COURT pressed the leader in mid backstretch, was ridden between
foes through the far turn, offered little response and retreated at the furlong marker. SUSPICIOUS MINDS tracked the front pack inside at the half, offered a
mild run advancing on the fence through the turn, started to give way turning for home and weakened in mid stretch. NORTHERN PASSAGE stalked mid
pack between runners in the early stages, began to give way entering the far turn, stopped with a quarter left to run and was not persevered with through the
lane.

Footnotes
SUPER HEADLINE settled mid-pack racing inside a foe, came past the quarter pole two wide, found room at the top of the stretch in that same path, took
over outside the furlong marker, was soon clear and held sway under moderate late urging. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) settled outside the winner racing in the
three path into the turn, swung five wide turning for home, held off a rival for the place while no match for the winner. LIONESQUE was urged at the break
but lacking early speed, went two to three wide through much of the turn, fanned six wide into upper stretch and began to pick it up, gained steadily but
could not get past for second. NEPOMUCENO attended the early pace inside then switched outside the leader, bid three wide at the quarter pole taking the
lead, drifted a bit in the stretch while weakening. SMART SOCIETY switched outside foes racing wide up the backstretch going three deep into the turn,
swung seven wide for the stretch and ran on with mild late interest. PAPA DOBLES stalked close up off and outside the leaders three to four wide, lacked
the needed late kick. STRAIGHT EHS was outpaced early racing far back into the turn, made no bid. MIA'S MAJESTY was coaxed forward to set the pace
moving to the rail up the backstretch, gave way at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S ROMANCE tracked the pacesetters on the rail early on, advanced through the turn saving ground, shot up the fence to engage for the lead in
upper stretch and shook clear of runners at the furlong marker to draw away at the end. GAMBLE'S SILVER tracked just outside mid pack through the turn,
was settled behind the dueling leaders turning for home, took the inside path following the winner in mid stretch and finished up well to be a clear second. A
MAIZE ZING DOTIE chased the early pace, contested for the lead in the four path at the top of the lane, could not find enough for the drive to challenge the
winner but fought on nevertheless to get up to win the battle for show. JILL broke sharp to be in front, rated kindly leading through the turn, was headed by
rivals on either side with three sixteenths to run, gave way to the winner at the furlong marker and faded late losing the nod for third at the wire. MY GIRL
SKY settled near the back in the beginning, put in a mild run racing four wide three furlongs out, angled to the five path with a quarter to go and stalled in
mid stretch. BLONDEONAMISSION was void of speed in the backstretch and trailed, could not get into contention through the turn and offered little for the
drive. ALPHA MIA tracked in third travelling four wide through the turn, was in contention turning for home between rivals in the five path , roused to go on in
upper stretch and backed away through the field down the lane.

TOURIST'S DREAM stalked from outside three to four wide, took closer order into the far turn going four wide on that bend, steadily gained on the leader
and edged past inside the final sixteenth. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN was bumped at the break, raced off the pace two to three wide early, angled five wide
at the top of the stretch, kept on to get the place. CHANCEL moved clear to set the pace racing just off or on the rail, was clear into mid-stretch, yielded
grudgingly late. JMR PURE SENSATION brushed with a rival at the start, raced three to four wide early while off the leaders, moved out from four to six
wide on the far turn, kept on in the drive but just missed show. JUST START ME UP chased three wide, dropped back heading into the far turn, came out
seven wide in upper stretch and kept on showing renewed late interest. HAYROLL exchanged bumps and bobbled at the start, angled in and moved up
saving ground inside, was close-up still saving ground on the far turn, came out three wide turning for home and in striking distance but weakened in the
stretch. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN switched out heading up the backstretch tracking in behind the pacesetter, made a mild bid two to three wide late on the
far turn but faltered and faded. BAYTOWN ELVIS raced five wide off the pace, shifted in about midway on the far turn, tired.

Footnotes
GIANT ONE lead straight from the start, was unchallenged through the backside, opened up on his rivals through the far turn and was kept to the task to win
comfortably at the finish. LARAQUE stalked mid pack between horses at the half, rallied with five sixteenths to go outside of foes, angled out to the four path
in upper stretch and closed down the lane to be best of the rest. BELENTIME tracked the winner down the backstretch, was asked to keep up to the leader
three furlongs out, could not threaten turning for home and faded at the furlong marker losing place nearing the wire. STEALTH MISSION settled near the
back in the early stages, was roused on the turn with not much to offer, continued to be ridden in the stretch and showed some interest late to get for a
minor share at the finish. I AM RESILIENT tracked mid pack outside rivals with a half to go, roused entering the turn to offer only a mild run, began to
weaken turning for home and faltered in deep stretch. PHANTOM JEWEL was fractious and briefly loose prior to the start, stumbled at the break to trail and
could not get involved afterwards and was not persevered with through the lane. SOLIS broke out at the start, recovered to track the leader inside down the
backstretch, took an awkward step at the half, pulled up and was vanned off.

ROARING FORTIES set the pace in the clear, raced near the rail through the turn, was clear into mid-stretch and held sway under steady handling. LUCKY
SCORE moved in a path up the backstretch, raced toward the rear two wide and between runners into the turn, began to shift out past the five-sixteenths
and was five wide at the head of the stretch, kicked on with interest to gain steadily but too late. LUCKY CURLIN settled mid-pack outside a rival two to
three wide on the turn, came into upper stretch four deep and ran on. RED RIVER REBEL switched off the inside early to avoid a rival in front, moved back
to the rail heading into the turn, came out three wide in upper stretch, put to strong urging and gained between runners too late. RIPTIDE ROCK settled
outside toward the rear three wide into the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and ran on. TURNED ASIDE saved ground inside but needed more.
WHITE FLAG raced at the back inside, fanned seven wide into the stretch and finished up with mild late interest. TAP IT TO WIN pursued the pacesetter
two to three wide, came up empty in the stretch.

SOCIETY JOE led into the first turn, angled inwards to the rail entering the backside, was headed through the far turn on the outside, opened up on rivals in
mid stretch and held safe at the wire. P H FACTOR broke in at the start, was steadied on the rail entering the backstretch, waited behind the leader into the
far turn, angled out at the quarter pole and was gaining steadily on the winner the last eighth. HALLIE'S HERO stalked the early frontrunners mid pack on
the rail, waited behind runners entering the far turn, angled out for the drive into the five path in upper stretch and closed well getting up for third outside.
BEN LOMOND stalked in the second flight on the rail, advanced on the fence three furlongs remaining, finished up well inside through the stretch run losing
out for the battle for show. SELF INFLICTED took back going into the first turn, settled into stride at the half mile, began a rally into the far turn, split foes
turning for home and showed some late interest. GORGEOUS KITTEN tracked just behind the early leaders at the half, contested for the lead with three
eighths to go, battled outside with the winner through the turn and faltered at the furlong marker. GIANT CRITIC reared at the start, trailed the field through
the backstretch and passed tired runners in the late stages of the race. FIRST SPRING stalked mid pack going three wide into the first turn, was between
rivals at the half mile marker just off the leaders, ridden to go on entering the far turn and had little to offer retreating at the quarter pole. WINGS OF
VICTORY settled near the rear racing four wide into the first turn, continued to be outside in closer range down the backstretch, began to weaken three
eighths to go and stopped through the far turn. #5 GIANT CRITIC WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS

ARRIVISTE settled at the back in behind runners two to three wide, came out five to six wide in upper stretch, was lugging in a bit in mid- to late-stretch but
drove past late. INFAMOUS COVERT tracked inside in behind the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out leaving that bend, bid three wide near the
sixteenth pole but was outfinished. MIDWAY MISCHIEF rated in behind and between runners into the turn, went two to three wide on that bend, came out
four to five deep for the stretch run, was game but outkicked. REPEAT THE HEAT bobbled slightly at the start but quickly took charge to set the pace inside
a rival on or just off the rail and in hand, was challenged in the stretch, yielded grudgingly. POINT TO THE STARS was a bit hard to control early racing
outside three to four wide, swung six deep into the stretch and failed to rally. JUSTIN'S WAY pressed two to three wide, made a mild bid at the quarter pole,
weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROAD MAP chased the early pace just off the fence, battled inside through the turn contesting for the front, began to inch away in upper stretch from her
challengers and had enough left to hold her rivals at the wire. LILLZ HOPE rallied running four wide contending for the lead at the five sixteenths pole,
battled with the winner two furlongs left but could not find another gear to threaten with an eighth to go and finished up taking the place award.
DONNARUMMA trailed the field on the fence in the second flight with three eighths remaining, advanced midway on the turn angling out to the five path at
the top of the stretch and closed well in the lane to get up for the show. FRAGOLA broke inwards at the start, was steadied and trailed in the beginning,
roused four wide through the turn, was fanned out to seven wide turning for home and show some determination to keep going to get a small piece at the
finish. BAYSVILLE took command soon after the start, was collared outside by a trio of challengers with a quarter to run and faded on the fence in upper
stretch. EYES ON A TRAIN hopped at the start to be near the back in the beginning, was ridden between foes in the second flight through the turn, angled
to the six path for the drive and stalled between runners at the eighth pole. SHESALOOSECANNON tracked just off the speed down the backside, travelled
three wide between rivals into the turn, could not quicken with the co leaders mid point through the turn and weakened in upper stretch while drifting inwards
nearing the furlong marker. NUMBER ONE HIT settled inside behind the pacesetters early, waited on the rail watching the contesting leaders battle on the
turn, was roused at the top of the stretch, angled out off tiring runners in mid stretch and offered little finish.
