Footnotes
YOU'RE MY GIRL pressed the pace on the outside, moved forward in the three path early on the turn, took the advantage under her own power at the
three-eighths, cruised clear outside the quarter-pole, was shaken up lightly into upper stretch, extended the advantage with the rider motionless in the
saddle into the final furlong and widened to win handily. MY SWEET SUMMER was sent hard from the start, chased inside under strong urging, saved
ground while dropping back on the turn, squeezed through inside of a foe into the final furlong and got up for the place. LAVON was beaten for early speed,
steadied slightly and briefly outside the five-eighths, fell well behind under urging, went three to four wide around the turn, drifted out under a left-handed
crop in upper stretch, continued to drift out inside the furlong marker, took a straighter course approaching the sixteenth-pole and improved to miss the place
but was up for the show. NICE 'N SPICY chased the pace on the outside, gained to make a four wide bid on the turn, dropped back outside the
quarter-pole, leaned in some under extra right-rein guidance in the stretch, was steered out outside the sixteenth-pole which put DARKNSTORMY more off
heels and weakened but just held the last spot in the superfecta from the aforementioned opponent. DARKNSTORMY broke in at the start, was well placed
just off the pace down the backstretch, dropped back between foes in the two path around the turn, angled out in upper stretch, was guided out while in tight
off the heels of NICE 'N SPICY outside the sixteenth-pole and just missed the superfecta. MIM was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace down the
backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, fell further back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch,
swapped to the proper lead coming to the furlong marker and tired. BOY IS SHE A LADY bobbled slightly just after the start, settled under some urging,
climbed while in hand behind horses near the half-mile pole, dropped back in the two path early on the turn then shifted four wide, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and failed to respond. MA MI JO DREAMS was carried in at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn,
dropped back outside the quarter-pole and faded. MAGGIE T broke awkwardly and was last to commence, was urged along on the outside, went three wide
on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
HIT THE WOAH just off the inside in pursuit briefly, tucked inside near the seven-sixteenths and rode the hedge through the turn coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, edged clear under a drive to prevail. MISCHIEVOUS
DREAM chased two to three wide until tucked inside near the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into
upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. MAIL ORDER struck the right side stall at the start when breaking
outwards and got steadied briefly conceding two lengths to the front before ranging up inside of rivals to take command with five furlongs to go, showed the
way in hand along the inside patiently handled, spun just off the inside for home, got roused nearing the eighth pole under growing threat and was headed
for the front at that station, then weakened to the finish. ELLANATION broke out at the start albeit forwardly placed, then got grabbed hold of and was
wrangled back to be the trailer while four then three wide, tucked to the two path nearing the far turn, came under light coaxing just past the five-sixteenths,
went six wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. MON PETIT CHOU chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and offered no kick.

Footnotes
GOOD MEDICINE was hustled to the front, showed the way while well rated on the inside, responded well when asked with a quarter-mile to run, came
under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, had the
rider put his crop away into the final sixteenth and proved much the best under a hand-ride to the wire. OUTPERFORM was rated on the outside while two
to three wide, came under urging coming to the three-eighths, made a bid on the final turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and proved no match for
the winner while just able to get the place. MOST WANTED MAN brushed the outside of the gate then was hustled from the start, was taken in hand early
then reserved on the inside, moved out midway down the backstretch, was roused three wide on the final turn then driven four wide into the stretch and
narrowly missed the place while clear for the show. TIZ A GIANT was rated in the second flight while saving ground, came under urging leaving the
backstretch, chased inside around the final turn and weakened. GREG'S HONOR bumped with a rival after the start, was reserved at the rear in the two to
three path, came under coaxing late on the backstretch, was urged around the final turn and failed to respond. FUNDING GAP (IRE) bumped with a rival
after the start, moved up early on the outside, went three to four wide around the opening bend, prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, came up
empty under urging on the final turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
MOSIENKO three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that rival coming under coaxing near the quarter pole when taking over narrow command,
swung four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. IMPAZIBLE DONNA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the
inside coming under threat midway on the turn, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. BUSTIN BAY broke out at the start bumping DIVA
BANKER, chased three wide down the backstretch and into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped out four then five wide carrying
out DIVA BANKER to the six path with three furlongs to go, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish, best of the rest. KHALI MAGIC
coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. NO CHALK
coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide for home, tired. DIVA BANKER got bumped at the start
by BUSTIN BAY, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, then got floated out five then six wide at the three-eighths by that same rival
while under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. THINKING IT OVER just off the inside in pursuit from mid
pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside at the head of the stretch and tired. WAILIN JOSIE chased along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths and made no impact.

Footnotes
HAIL TO went four wide around the first turn, settled on the outside without cover, was carried out near the seven-sixteenths, raced six wide while let out on
the far turn, was put to a right-handed crop inside the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to get up late. TRANSIENT (GB)
brushed with an opponent just after the start, saved ground under restraint around the first turn, was reserved off the pace, started the far turn in the two
path, dropped to the hedge around the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best in upper stretch, rallied against the hedge into the final furlong, closed well to
make a bid into the final sixteenth, battled with the winner to the wire and missed while able to secure the place. BLUE TIMES moved in while going to the
front, showed the way in the two path, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led determinedly into the
final sixteenth but was overtaken while able to get the show. CLASSIC COLORS bumped soundly with a rival after the start then was squeezed back, was
reserved near the back in the two path, shifted three wide while moving closer at the five-sixteenths, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and
improved position. LISHEEN moved in early, navigated the first turn in the two path, settled near the middle of the field, moved out near the
seven-sixteenths, was urged between foes in the four path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. CONTROL
FUNCTION was hard held while tugging at bit along the hedge through the first turn then rated on the inside, saved ground around the far turn, was asked
near the quarter-pole, chased behind foes past the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. SANTA GIULIA (FR) went three wide on the first turn,
was rated on the outside in the second flight, raced three then wide on the far turn, was roused into upper stretch and failed to rally. EXCEPT TEMPTATION
was off a bit slow and last to commence then urged early, saved ground at the rear, shifted three wide while roused around the five-sixteenths, came seven
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EYLARA (IRE) was taken back along the hedge under stout restraint, checked nearing the first turn, saved
ground under reserve, checked sharply when TRANSIENT dropped in front at the five-sixteenths, angled out while roused some in upper stretch and lacked
the needed response. ENSEMBLE (IRE) was taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in the three path, was reserved off the pace, went five wide
while asked on the far turn and failed to respond. BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) bumped soundly with a foe after the start, tracked the pace on the outside in

Footnotes
TOPIC CHANGER bumped lightly with a foe at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer while two then three wide on the
far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside under a hand-ride, made a bid nearing the furlong marker, swapped back to his inside
lead after getting one pop of the crop at that juncture, gained the advantage shortly thereafter and moved clear late under good handling to prevail.
FIELDSTONE rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in the middle of the field, advanced closer in the three path on the far turn, rallied four wide into
the stretch then took the advantage around the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while just
able to hold the place. DREAM OF A DAY went three wide around the opening bend, settled on the far outside without cover, moved in near the
seven-sixteenths, raced three wide around the far turn, shifted five wide into upper stretch then tipped a bit further out, gained under a drive into the final
furlong and finished willingly for the show. GINNSU WARRIOR was hustled from the gate, showed speed between horses then was taken back under stout
restraint nearing the first turn, saved ground while rated off the pace, cut the corner into the stretch, steadied near the three-sixteenths, pursued the top two
under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. HE'S GOT IT was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside while pressed by two
foes, was asked while inside one rival on the far turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. SUPER WICKED CHARM bumped lightly with a foe
at the start while taken up some, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled on the inside of a rival but without cover, went four wide while asked
on
the
far
turn,
came
six
wide
while
in
reasonable
striking
range
into
the
stretch
but
lacked
the
needed
response
and
flattened
out.
SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE showed early speed, prompted the pace between foes in the two path, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, chased around
the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. BLESS BLESS moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear,
moved closer with seven-sixteenths to run, saved ground around most of the far turn then moved to the two path, checked behind horses into upper stretch,
moved out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. MOMENTOUS broke out then was hustled, prompted the pace on the outside in the three path,
vied in the two path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. VIVE BIEN was hustled from the gate, went three wide under restraint
on the first turn, settled outside in fourth position down the backstretch, came up empty in the two path on the final turn and faltered then was distanced in
the final furlong.

the quarter-pole, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to make a bid outside of two foes approaching the furlong marker, gained the lead just inside
that marker, shook clear into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging. STERLING SILVER bumped with rivals on both sides early then was
squeezed back, moved in then settled at the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came three wide into the
stretch under a drive, moved out under a left-handed crop coming to the eighth-pole then switched to a right-handed crop, rallied outside in the final furlong
and finished fast but was too late while clear for the place. UNION LAKE was a bit reluctant to load, broke in and bumped with an opponent, pressed the
pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the four path around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, battled
between horses passing the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened while clear for the show. HOT PEPPERS was hustled from
the start, set the pace under pressure from a duo to her outside, vied in the two path while still inside those foes on the turn, battled on even terms under a
drive in upper stretch, battled until inside the furlong marker then also weakened. HALF IS ENOUGH was bumped at the start, bumped lightly with a foe
early, chased the pace down the backstretch then three wide on the turn, moved to four wide outside the quarter-pole, was driven six wide into the stretch,
pursued the leaders outside into the final furlong and tired. ANGITUDE was reluctant to load, bumped with a rival early, raced towards the rear, went five
wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. MISCHIEVOUS DIANE broke in and bumped
with a rival, pressed the pace while loosely between foes, vied in the three path while between horses on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and

Footnotes
CURLIN'S WISDOM just off the inside tracked in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied to
take command a sixteenth out, dug in gamely to prevail in a blanket finish at the end. CONQUIST showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared at the sixteenth marker, fought on to preserve
the place honors over a pair on the wire. EXCURSIONNISTE chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home, rallied to threaten for it all late but missed at the end while up for the show honors. DREAMPOINT just off the
inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home, closed well outside under tepid handling and
was outfinished. BERNARDINO chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out and bumped
MEDIA SENSATION a furlong out, dug in offering up a mild bid but was outfinished in the late stages. MEDIA SENSATION two to three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive getting bumped by the aforementioned foe tipping out at the eighth
pole, then weakened in the late going. VALENTINO'S HERE chased along the inside near the rear early on, went three to four wide through the far turn
lightly coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact, then bucked the rider after the finish and took a tour
of the far turn once more before being apprehended by outrider and walked off. PARTY NEWS left the gate near the rear of the field sluggish early and
displaying poor action growing detached at the tail of the field just off the inside, saved ground through to upper stretch when tipped three wide and was no
factor. NYSHARES veered in at the start sharply tossing the rider from the saddle, was apprehended by outrider in the vicinity of five and a half furlongs
from home and was subsequently vanned off.
