Footnotes
MISS GLORIOUS set a clear early pace, raced off the rail, opened up and held for the win. TYLER'S DREAM tracked the early pace, advanced seven wide
through the turn, was no match late and finished second best. OUR SOUTHERN GIRL was unhurried early, angled towards the inside offered a mild late
rally and was along for third. RELIANT stalked the early pace from between rivals and was empty late. DATQUICKCAT was void of any speed from the
inside and offered no late rally. ELLIE CAN PLAY chased the early pace, raced five wide and weakened. TIZ DONNA BELLA was taken back, was eased
and vanned off.
