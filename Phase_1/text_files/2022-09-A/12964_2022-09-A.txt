WHAT AN HONOR vied for the early lead on the inside, then let COTTON CANDY ANNIE go set the pace, shifted out to prompt that rival, made a three
wide bid leaving the turn and quickly to command, then was clear by the furlong marker and remained clear to prove best, driving. STRAND OF GOLD was
allowed to settle early, was two wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch, finished well on the outside to be clearly second best. BEL ROSSO tracked the
early pace and made a four wide bid leaving the turn but flattened out late, held show award. COTTON CANDY ANNIE vied for the early lead on the
outside, then went on to set the pace on the inside on the turn, faded in the drive, missed show award. WEEHAWKEN tracked the pace two wide and
between rivals, inched closer to take aim inside of the leading pair nearing the quarter pole, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, and only managed to chase.
VALIANT PRAISE was well placed along the inside on the turn, then was two wide in the drive, attempted to split foes at the quarter pole, but failed to
sustain a bid after being put to tight quarters at the hook soon after. IT WASN'T ME was off slowly, then advanced four wide on the turn and came five wide
into the lane and had no late rally. BOTANICAL was bumped at the start, lacked a rally. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF was taken back early, came wide into the
lane and was not a threat. YANIRA chased the field four wide and tired. SHEZA SHINING STAR was settled early four wide, then was two wide on the turn
and tired. LADY EVA pressed the early pace between rivals, then folded on the turn.

eased out midway on the turn, came six wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to just miss. SHIPMAN delayed the start while reluctant to approach
the starting gate, was rank and hard to handle early, got out entering the far turn, then was corrected and got to the inside, then angled out in the stretch

Footnotes
GASLIGHT DANCER set the pace while unchallenged, then drew out nearing the furlong marker, then was given a couple right handed pops with the crop
and drew off then finished with speed to spare to prove much the best. MIRANDA RIGHTS chased the pace and made a bid on the inside, no match for the
winner while getting the nod for the place award. WORTHINGTON stalked the pace three wide and was outfinished for the place award, bested rest.
BERRETTINI was reserved early, then was four wide by the five sixteenths, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. HUNTER'S DRIVE tracked the
early pace and was two wide on the turn, shifted four wide leaving the turn and was empty. PAPPY WOLFE was off slowly, then offered a belated rally. B
MINOR was reserved early and lacked a rally. INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER had no rally. SIX MISSIONS was allowed to settle early, then was four wide on the
turn and weakened. SWISS GUARD chased the early pace, between rivals on the turn and tired. AS ONE DOES failed to menace. UNCLE HEADLEY was
not a factor.

Footnotes
ABOUKIR BAY was settled back early, was two wide by the five sixteenths, angled out leaving the turn, then checked off heels and angled out to the far
outside by the furlong marker, then closed with a rush to get up late, driving. CINDYLOUWHO set the pace on the inside and drew clear leaving the turn and
by the furlong marker, but was caught late to just fail, second best. STRIKINGLY was reserved early, wide run on the turn, came wide into the lane, then
offered a late rally. MACADAMIA (FR) tracked the pace and was two wide by the five sixteenths, then lacked the needed stretch bid. ANKYRAH chased the
pace and made a four wide bid on the turn and then was bumped by the furlong marker and had no late kick. GHOST BAYOU tracked the pace and saved
ground on the turn and tipped out leaving the turn and faded. RAMADHAAN (IRE) was allowed to settle early, then was two to three wide on the turn and
had no rally in traffic in the lane. BODIEFUL stalked the pace three to four wide and weakened in the lane. MARINA'S GOLD lacked a rally. AMERICAN
PYRAMID was allowed to settle and saved ground on the turn and had no late response. PARENTS PRIDE prompted the pace two wide and then was
empty in the stretch. PARIS PARAMOUR failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHOP CHOP stalked the early pace three wide, then rated kindly and drafted behind the dueling leaders on the turn, then shifted out by the five sixteenths
and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, then had a long drive with TOWHEAD, and won the bob under a vigors hand ride the final sixteenth to prove
best. TOWHEAD set the early pace while two wide, then dueled for the lead outside of C C CRUISE CONTROL, then shook off that rival but was quickly
challenged by CHOP CHOP, dug in gamely and had a long drive with that rival and just missed losing the head bob. C C CRUISE CONTROL tracked the
early pace, then went up to duel for the lead on the inside on the turn, weakened leaving the turn, then came again for the show award, no match to the top
two. KNOCKYOURSOCKSOFF was settled back early, made a five wide run on the turn but weakened in the drive, bested rest. MUSTANG LADY was
allowed to settle early, raced three wide on the turn and had no rally. CHIQUITA MOSCA was reserved early and lacked a rally. JANIS JOPLIN was settled
early on the inside and had no response. CALLIE'S GRIT chased the early pace and folded.
