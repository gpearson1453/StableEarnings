Footnotes
WORLD UNITE was impeded at the start and was taken up, then moved up gamely, splitting rivals, was allowed to settle along the inside throughout the
turn, then menaced in the upper stretch, gained the lead at the eighth pole and held on well to prevail. LILY'S HOME vied for the lead from the three path,
was in a hard drive throughout the turn to rally in the stretch and was game for second place. ADDICTED TO LOVE chased the pace while three wide, was
in a steady drive then rallied while five wide on the turn and closed well for the show prize. THATSHOWSHEROLLS veered in at the start, then vied for the
lead on the inside into the turn, was used up and gave way in late stretch. CHARACTER COUNTS chased the pace while two wide, then drifted in towards
the rail, was allowed to settle throughout the turn to make a mild bid in late stretch and was no threat. THESTRAL settled in the two path, then lugged in
leaving the half pole, cut off foe, then bid mildly on the turn into the stretch and was no threat. GLO GIRL GLO vied for the lead while two wide into the turn,
was hard used and weakened in late stretch. CEE MINUS chased the pace from the inside, steadied at the half pole to avoid impeding foe, then was cut off
by another foe leaving the half, checked and lost any chance. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to the early part of the race. After reviewing
the replay, THESTRAL was disqualified from sixth and placed last, for causing interference with CEE MINUS shortly after the half pole.

Footnotes
LAST HURRAH set the pace from the two path into the first turn, was in a long drive then drew off in the stretch and held on well under a mild hand drive to
prevail. JACK'S SUMMER stalked the pace while three wide, was in a a steady drive to rally in the upper stretch but could not catch the leader and bested
the rest. EMERSON'S DREAM tracked the pace from the inside throughout the turn then bid from the two path in the stretch and was game for show. GIO'S
BABY GIRL settled while two wide then bid in the upper stretch but came up evenly in the stretch. ZIPSY ROSE LEE was unhurried early then swung five
wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. BAND OF ROSES was rank entering the first turn, was in a steady drive chasing the
pace from the inside, came out three wide on the far turn then tired in the stretch. GOLDEN HEIST tracked the pace while three wide then flattened out on
the turn and had no final bid in the stretch.

PLAIN OR PEANUT lead the way into the first turn, was challenged for the lead in late back stretch, then shook clear in the upper stretch and was kept to
task to the end. FRUITCAKE chased the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive, then bid along the rail in the upper stretch and just missed in the end
and was second best. NEW ART was allowed to settle along the inside, was moving up on the far turn to rally in the stretch and was best for the show prize.
LUCKY'S SECRET chased the pace while four wide on the back stretch, bid on the far turn into the home stretch then flattened out in the end. VAMONOS
was well placed while two wide, then moved up on the backstretch to duel for the lead into the far turn, was used up and tired in the home stretch.
AMERICAN DOLLARS settled along the rail and failed to rally. SCENIC JUSTICE settled in the two path and never fired in the home stretch. CHARMING
VICTORY chased the pace three to four wide on the backstretch then dropped back shortly after the half pole and was no menace.

Footnotes
LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE set the pace while two wide, was in a long drive on the back stretch, cleared the far turn and held sway down the lane to prevail
in the end. ON A TOUR stalked the pace from the three path, was in a mild drive throughout the turn to rally at the quarter pole but it wasn't enough to catch
the leader in the end. AZURITA was allowed to settle along the rail, while saving ground on the back stretch into the far turn then made a mild bid in late
stretch but it was too little too late. CARRY ON was unhurried early then settled in the two path on the back stretch, bid while four wide on the second turn
into the home stretch and was no threat. BEENTHEREDONETHAT tracked the pace while two wide on the back stretch, menaced from the four path on the
far turn then flattened out in the lane. TRAUMARAMA chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then rallied in the early stretch and stopped.
