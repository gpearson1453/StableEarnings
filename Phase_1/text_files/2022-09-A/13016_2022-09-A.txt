Footnotes
MISSISSIPPI trailed far back early, split rivals rallying on the turn then closed strongly to get up in time. HIGH VELOCITY pursued the loose pacesetter
outside and continued gamely to the finish. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL quickly sprinted clear, maintained the lead to the final sixteenth then tired late. JARLIAN
outrun early, moved inside through the stretch narrowing the gap. TWO PRINCES lacked speed, chased inside and finished willingly. INDIRECTLY angled
inside early, made a brief bid on the turn then faded. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD raced within range early then was finished after half a mile. DRONE SWARM
chased outside then stopped abruptly.

MARGIN OF AIR prompted the pace inside, vied through the final half mile in a game showing. SKY TEMPLE lacked speed and was never in contention.
CARIBBEAN GOLD set a pressured pace in the two path then stopped on the final turn. IMAGINE THIS trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
CLASSY MISS controlled the pace then widened the advantage throughout, was urged to final furlong then geared down late. MY FIRST LOVE chased
wide throughout, was no match for the winner but lasted for the place. ICE LOVE raced far behind early then rallied inside with late energy. TOURING
MARYANNE saved ground early, drifted wide on the final turn and continued well. CREME CARAMEL broke very poorly, moved within striking range then
faded. ONE WILD WOMAN raced very wide off the leaders and was finished after half a mile. ROSE LEGACY lacked speed and was never in contention.
SEA PINES saved ground, bid closer before half a mile and stopped. CICI UNIFIED chased off the pace and was never a factor. BOHEMIA BABE prompted
the winner briefly then stopped abruptly.

D BLACK MAMBA stalked the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch and edged away while kept to a drive. MINE NOT MINE lacked speed, raced
inside throughout and closed well for the place. DANGNABBIT broke sluggishly, moved quickly to the front then weakened in the stretch. SHANGHAI
CANDY lacked speed outside then closed gap without menacing. GRAZELY settled inside, moved out in the stretch, loomed a threat and tired.
SUNSANDDRINKINHAND saved ground then was finished after half a mile. AYE dropped back early and raced far back throughout. CAPE HEDGE was
urged close up outside for half mile and stopped.

Footnotes
EVEY'S CANDY saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch, wore down the pacesetters and was up in the final strides. ALL EYES ON YOU prompted the
pace outside, bid into the stretch vied and was nailed at the wire. LORD UHTRED broke alertly and sped to the front, lost the advantage passing the eighth
pole but continued gamely. CHECKITUP crowded at the start, dropped far back then advanced wide with good energy. VEESON flashed speed between
rivals and faltered. RYAN'S FLEET was eased back in the opening quarter, bid wide then weakened in the stretch. TAKEMETOTHEMOON lagged far
behind and was never a factor. HOT LOVE prompted the pace briefly outside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
FORE HARP took over early, widened on the turn and dominated through the stretch under mild urging. HIDE THE RANSOM saved ground throughout then
closed well to earn the place. WHERE YOU WAS dropped back outside, continued wide and finished well in the stretch. UNCLE ROAMIE broke alertly and
finished gamely while weakening slightly. WEST FORK prompted the winner throughout and faltered in the stretch. O'BRIEN steadied near the three eighths
pole and lacked any further response. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL eased back in the opening furlong and was never a factor. CUNEO dropped back at the
start and trailed throughout.

THE BIG BLUFF went after the loose pacesetter on the turn, took over nearing midstretch and edged away driving. GUSHING OIL dropped far behind,
advanced wide and closed with good energy too late. HEALY'S HOPE lagged far behind then rallied in the two path too late. DEFIBRILLATOR lacked
speed then narrowed the gap outside while no threat. MOUNTAIN TREE moved off the leader inside for half a mile and gave way. LONGTAIL chased three
wide then proved empty in the stretch. KNOCKOUT KICK quickly sprinted clear, widened on the turn then stopped in the stretch. SAILOR AGAIN lacked
speed, angled inside and was always outrun.

Footnotes
IN EQUALITY forced the pace outside, challenged the leader in the stretch, was carried out but edged ahead in a long drive. SOCIAL GROUP hustled to the
front inside, drifted out through the stretch and held on gamely. THE ANGRY MAN saved ground, loomed threat into the stretch but flattened out. TACTICAL
PLAN dropped back outside then passed rivals while no threat. KINGS HIGHWAY settled very wide off the pace and lacked a rally. AMERICAN FLEET
chased three wide between rivals and faltered. MY MAN ELVIS moved in the two path between foes and retreated. ECLIPSED MOON lagged far behind
inside and was no factor. CAPE MAY STYLE was rated off the pace and gave way. NIANGUA dropped back early and was always outrun.
