Footnotes
BOLD ARCH rushed up from along the rail to assume command entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn, and held SLEW'S BAK safely at bay late to prove best. SLEW'S BAK settled off the early pace while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly
from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive before tipping two wide late to get up for the place. SET
TO SHINE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide while continuing to chase the
pacesetter through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. BIG UNION away alertly and stalked the leader into
the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, angled three wide to commence his bid entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the
drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. PARKER POINT stumbled at the start to get away awkwardly, trailed the field into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive. MACHINE away well, but dropped
well back of the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, was always well back and never menaced.

INFINITE PATIENCE away well and challenged for the lead from the inside of DAPHNE entering the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail,
dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch while continuing with a two wide trip, ran away from her nearest competitors with little effort midway
through the final turn, and won handily while being geared down late to prove much the best. SOLARITY stalked the leaders through the stretch the first
time while saving ground at the rail, maintained her position into the backstretch, commenced her bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished
determinedly in the lane to prove second best. WE B THREE broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out
from the rail, held her position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to prove
best of the rest. DAPHNE away alertly and dueled for the lead three wide from the outside of INFINITE PATIENCE entering the stretch the first time, chased
that rival two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final
furlong. KICK UP THE DUST was away awkwardly, and trailed the field throughout. The one mile split for this race was currently unavailable

Footnotes
BABY GRAND away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from just off the rail through the stretch the
first time and in the run down the backside, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, and battled determinedly one out from the rail to hold off the
late challenges to prevail. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the first turn, moved into a stalking trip
one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to get
up for the place. LAUGH WITH ME away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, pulled himself into a
tracking trip from along the rail entering the backside, was forced to steady midway down the backstretch when put in tight quarters at the rail, rallied from
along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while lacking room at time. APPELLANT unhurried early while trailing the
field into the stretch the first time while racing out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while
finishing four wide in the drive. SANAWAR settled off the early pace while being forced three wide into the stretch the first time, carried on with a three wide
trip in the run down the backside, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. MCMURPHY
broke sharply and tracked the leader two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue from the outside of BABY GRAND in
the run down the backside, continued on two wide into the final turn, but faded in the late stages. MASTER EWEN settled well off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail the field in the run down the backstretch, and was never a factor. Following
the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry and was as both a riders and trainers claim of foul. The rider and trainer of LAUGH WITH ME lodged a
claim of foul against the rider of BABY GRAND for alleged interference midway down the backstretch. After review there was no change to the original order
of finish.

Footnotes
ROAD CLOSURE bumped with BACK SHACK in the opening strides before rushing to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, and was all out to fend off TIME TICKER late while drifting out under left handed urging. TIME TICKER
away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly
from the outside of ROAD CLOSURE in deep stretch, but was impeded late while laying in. MILITARY CROSS settled well off the early pace while racing
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed full of run four wide in the drive to get
up for a share. ROARING DESTINY away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering
the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive in a game effort. WICKED NIGHT broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backside while
being carried four wide , continued with a four wide trip into the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. ASKMENOQUESTIONS tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, continued to chase the leader two wide through the final turn, but weakened in the drive. BACK
SHACK was bumped at the start, and settled well off the early pace while racing four wide into the backstretch, continued five wide into the final turn, and
was never a factor. UNION MAN settled off the early pace while saving ground at the inside entering the backstretch, rallied from along the rail entering the
final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. PURSUE raced greenly through the lane the first time while trailing the field into the first turn,
began to lose touch with the field in the run down the backstretch, and was eased over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a
jockey's claim of foul. The rider of TIME TICKER lodged a claim of foul against the rider of ROAD CLOSURE for alleged interference in mid stretch. After
review the claim of foul was upheld, and ROAD CLOSURE was disqualified from first and placed second.

Footnotes
PORTER GENT broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run
down the backside, maintained his lead through the final turn, and held AT ATTENTION safely at bay late to prove best. AT ATTENTION stalked the early
pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, and battled gamely two out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. UNCHARACTERISTIC settled off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to
just miss the place. SYNERGY away well and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held his position in the run
down the backside and into the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages. FORT LANGLEY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. BE QUICK away alertly and stalked the leaders
through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held a striking position while saving ground in the run to the final turn, rallied along the
inside through the turn, but had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
KLOEPATRA away alertly, but was quickly taken in hand and allowed to settle well off the contested early pace while racing three wide entering the first
turn, maintained her position entering the backstretch, began to gain ground on the leaders midway to the final turn, continued sharply three wide through
the turn, quickly took control entering the lane, and drew clear as much the best. AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS broke sharply and stalked the leaders from
along the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed with late interest three wide in deep stretch to get up
for the place in the closing strides. VIVA LA VINO tracked the leaders one out from the rail entering the first turn, continued from a tracking trip through the
second turn and in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the late stages to get up for a share.
MARYS TAPPIN SHOES was squeezed between rivals and pinched back at the start, and trailed the field into the first turn, bided her time at the back of the
pack through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished full of run from
along the inside in the drive before shifting two wide to finish between rivals late. U DID IT pressed the pace from the outside of BELCARRAPARK entering
the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane,
and was outfinished in deep stretch. BURROW DOWN settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, held a
striking position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the stretch drive. BELCARRA
PARK raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace through the second turn and in the run down the backside, continued
to battle for the lead through the final turn while saving ground at the rail, was overtaken entering the lane, and outfinished in the late stages. MISS THE
HYPE settled well off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but
failed to make a serious impact. SHAMRA away well and stalked the pacesetters through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail,
struggled to hold her position in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
REGAL RIOT tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide from the outside of AROLLERCOASTERRIDE in the
run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and got the better of that rival in the closing strides following a stretch long battle.
AROLLERCOASTERRIDE raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of REGAL RIOT through the
second turn and in the run down the backstretch, continued to set a pressured pace through the final turn, and just failed to last while proving clearly second
best. BOITANO away well, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, launched his bid five
wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to get up for a share. STORMY BLUE away alertly and was allowed to settle off the
contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the lane the first time, steadied slightly when in tight quarters leaving the second turn, rallied
three wide through the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive. JUST JIMMY stalked the leaders through the lane the first time while
saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. ITSMYDAY settled well off the early pace while
racing four wide entering the stretch the first time, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished three out
from the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. SOARINGFORTHESUN broke sharply, but settled into a stalking trip one out from the rail
entering the stretch the first time, steadied when in tight quarters from between rivals entering the backstretch, advanced two wide midway down the
backside to gain a tracking trip approaching the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. BETTER TONE unhurried early while trailing the field
into the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make his
presence felt late. COUNTRIFIED settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the stretch the first time, began to advance into a striking position
soon after entering the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, continued three wide into the final turn and quickly came away with the lead, and held the
closers safely at bay late under confident handling. ERLICH settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first

wide in deep stretch to get up for the place late. VON DOM tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail,
commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. WE'RE IN COMMAND unhurried early
