Footnotes
COLORFUL NATIVE sped to the lead at the start and angled to the inside, set a pressured pace over TACTICAL REBEL up the backstretch and around the
far turn, saved ground and widened advantage in the upper stretch then held late under a driving finish. PISTOL PACKIN MAN was allowed to settle out of
the gate and continued unhurried in the back, picked up the tempo two wide late on the far turn, steadily edged jup closer in the final furlong and was getting
to the winner late. TACTICAL REBEL prompted the pace up the backstretch and continued up close around the far turn, hustled along three wide into the
lane, stayed on response and edged up closer to the wire. ONE LAST CHANT stalked the top pair through early stages, hustled along three wide around
the turn then faded in the lane. BIZZY RUN rated off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
CYCLONE SORORITY sped to the lead at the start and set the pace under some pressure, widened advantage and held clear around the turn, was ridden
along three wide into the lane, responded willingly and drew off under steady encouragement. GLAMOROUS LIFE prompted the pace along the inside up
the backstretch then chased two wide around the turn, sustained a three wide bid for CYCLONE SORORITY through the lane and finished second best.
FIVE ROSES LUNA raced up close in opening stages then edged back to track the early leaders, picked up the tempo late on the turn, sustained a three
wide through the lane and cleared a share. PAPA'S SECRET lacked speed and raced in the back, came three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
TA raced in early contention, chased three wide around the turn then drifted out wider entering the lane and retreated.

GOTTA HAVE FAITH sped to the lead at the start and set the pace into the turn, repelled bid from REDNECKER at the quarter pole, pulled away in the
upper stretch and kept to task while ridden out. BIT A BAD NEWS raced near midpack in early stages and chased two wide around the turn, moved up three
wide to engage the second flight at the quarter pole, was no match for the clear winner but dug in to take place. REDNECKER was forwardly placed into the
turn, raced two wide in striking distance at the quarter pole, could not reach the eventual winner but stayed on and just missed place. FREEIA TAP raced in
early contention, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and flattened in the final furlong. FIREBAUGH raced in range in the opening
quarter, saved ground around the turn then gave way. DELIGHT SURPRISE raced off the early pace, coaxed three wide around the turn and failed to
respond. G. I. JAYNE raced off the early speed, chased two wide around the turn and never threatened. ADIOS OKOBOJI got bumped back at the start and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KNOCKS BIG THIRST was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, moved up two wide to engage VISON OF ELIAS for the lead at the quarter pole,
took command turning for home, widened to a clear advantage then just lasted under a driving finish. GINGER RULES settled off the early pace, came
under a ride three wide in the upper stretch, responded gamely, rallied to the wire and got denied by a nose. TAP THE BRAKES was unhurried and raced in
the back, saved ground around the turn, launched a rail bid heading into the lane, steadily inched up closer and just missed. RUBIGINOUS tracked the top
pair three to four wide around the turn, swung wide into the lane then shifted in a couple paths under pressure and edged closer to the wire. VISION OF
ELIAS set the pace into the turn, vied with the winner at the quarter pole then got collared turning for home and faded. MONSIEUR BROWN failed to move
into contention.

Footnotes
BLACK KAT TAPS steadied around the first turn then took over the lead entering the backstretch, set the uncontested pace and held clear around the far
turn, coaxed three wide into the lane, had more left in the tank and held clear under a driving finish. STONECOLD STUNNER was reserved and raced in the
back, picked up the pace late on the far turn, responded gamely under pressure in the upper stretch, rallied and closed the gap on the winner. GATA RUNZ
stalked the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and prevailed for a share. PEGGY RULES tracked the
early pace, chased two wide around the far turn then ran on evenly through the lane. SASSY AIN'T I was rated off the early pace, saved ground entering the
lane and lacked a needed rally. SWEET LAURA raced off the early pace, chased three to four wide around the far turn and failed to threaten. EBONY
PEARL vied for the lead around the first turn, raced behind the pacesetter in the opening quarter then came up empty, steadily retreated and jogged in.

Footnotes
COBYMEISTER dueled for the lead in opening stages and battled on with MINISTRY OF ART around the turn, shook free entering the lane, widened to
clear advantage and held late under a driving finish. APOLLO BAY raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide late on the turn, swung five wide
into the lane, rallied while moving inward and finished clearly second best. MINISTRY OF ART raced near midpack and saved ground around the turn,
roused along the rail at the head of the lane, edged closer then evened out and held show. TEQUILA was unhurried, was ridden along two wide around the
turn, tipped four wide for the drive and narrowly missed show. LURCH dueled for the lead up the backstretch and battled on around the turn, could not move
on with the eventual winner at the head of the lane and faded in the final furlong. MY BOAZ tracked the top pair leaving the backstretch, chased forwardly
two to three wide around the turn then gave way. WELLER ROGUE lacked early speed. shifted inside in the upper stretch and failed to respond under a
drive. KIDO'S SLING SHOT showed brief response in early stages then retreated.
