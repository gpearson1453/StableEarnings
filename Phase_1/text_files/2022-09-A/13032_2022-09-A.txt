Footnotes
TRACK QUEEN was rated along from the inside, moved up through the far turn, split rivals near the eighth pole and finished strongly to be well clear late
under steady handling. PENNIE'S MAGIC stalked the pace from the inside, continued an inside bid around the far turn through the stretch run kept on to
narrowly hold the place position. BAD GAL RIRI settled off the early going, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. I'D BE
RICH showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened a bit through the drive. B B GUN BULLSEYE was rated off the early going, raced two
wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. SHE'S TAKIN OVER stalked the pace, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no late
response. MISS BARETA tracked the leader from the outside down the backstretch and tired readily.

Footnotes
WHO DAT GREY showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure. FIBRILLATOR raced off the early
pace, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. SHEZA HUNK stalked the pace, raced three wide while racing between rivals
and finished willingly late. ROYAL BONUS was bumped at the break, hard sent from the inside to vie for the early lead and kept on through the drive.
MARILYN'S MAGIC was bumped soundly at the break, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted five wide and had not enough. EASY IS GOOD
dropped back early, raced from the outside in the stretch run and lacked a rally. LADY LUTE settled off the early pace, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and never was a factor. PEPPER POINT was hustled along while racing between rivals early on and faded.

Footnotes
VETERAN'S HOLIDAY was unhurried early on made a good advance through the far turn, raced three wide near the quarter pole and finished well to edge
clear late under strong handling. THUNDER ROAD settled off the early pace, checked sharply near the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch run and
rallied gamely to the wire. LOU'S ARROW showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. BIG ROJO tracked
the early leader from the outside and weakened a bit in the drive. FOTHERINGAY settled off the early going, raced from the outside in the lane and raced
evenly late. WINGS FOR ENO stalked the pace, raced five to six wide in the stretch and had not enough. GOLIATH RIDGE stalked the pace from the inside
and lacked a final winning bid. INFINITE MORO raced off the early pace, was six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. BACKGATE RED was
coaxed along early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ANITA'S VISION stalked the pace from the outside, came in nearing the eighth pole, took the path of Emmas Ruler away and finished well under strong
handling. Jockey of Emmas Ruler filed objection along with a stewards inquiry and deemed Anita's Vision to be disqualified and placed third for interference
in the stretch run. HIGH VALUE TARGET showed good early foot from the inside, continued an inside run through the stretch and finished willingly to the
wire. EMMAS RULER showed good speed while racing between rivals early down the backstretch, raced three wide into the upper stretch, checked nearing
the eighth pole, altered out and kept on to the wire. KITTENOFTHE COURT raced in tight quarters, checked off heels from the inside, raced in hand down
the backstretch into the far turn, shifted out through the stretch run and had not enough. LADY BE GONE stalked the pace from the outside while racing five
wide down the backstretch, raced four wide through the far turn and lacked a bid.

ZYDECO MUSIC stalked the pace, was asked through the far turn, raced from the outside in the lane and finished well to prove best under strong handling.
NONEYA pressed rival from the outside down the backstretch, dug in near the eighth pole but couldn't match strides late with the winner to finish second
best. SIENNA BREEZE chased the pace from the inside early on, shifted off the rail through the far turn, raced four to three wide in the stretch run and kept
on to the wire. PROUD VICTORIA vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened the final furlong. ROMANTIC BEAST was slow early on, raced five
wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. A. K. A. GRAMS dropped back early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. LA
TRESS GRAY was slow early, raced from the outside in the stretch run and lacked a bid. NAVAGATIONALBEACON stumbled at the break, coaxed along
and lost ground to race far back.
