Footnotes
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN engaged for the early lead pressing three wide of rivals, battled outside throughout the turn, began to inch away at the quarter
pole, opened up nearing the furlong marker and kept to the task late to win comfortably in the end. ONE BAY HEMINGWAY contested for the lead on the
rail with two other challengers in the beginning, continued to battle inside through the turn for the lead, started to weaken in upper stretch and tired the last
eighth but had enough cushion to hold on for the place award. ONE MORE BREW settled mid pack down the backstretch with rivals on either side, began to
rally just outside runners turning for home and closed belatedly through the stretch to just missing getting up for second. STUBBORN STREAK lacked early
speed and trailed into the turn, was asked for run two furlongs out angling to the four path for the drive and showed some late energy to pass tiring rivals in
mid stretch. IT'S TRUE rated inside mid pack going into the turn, was roused while saving ground with a quarter to go and offered little running to the wire.
GUNGI stalked outside of runners in the second flight down the backside, could not keep up to the pack through the turn and was not a factor for the stretch
run. SMART COVERAGE broke sharp to be involved in the middle of a three horse pace duel early on, began to weaken between rivals midway on the turn
and faltered at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
HADDASSAH'S DEVIL settled in behind along the inside off the leaders, gradually shifted out beginning midway on the turn, came into upper stretch seven
wide, struck the lead about a furlong out, drifted out a touch while driving clear. MY BOY CHRISTIAN was held up in behind rivals early racing off the inside,
swung eight wide turning for home while being asked for more, kept on to get up for place over SUPREMEACTION, who raced off the early leaders outside,
advanced four then six wide on the turn, kept on in the lane but was outfinished for second. FOUR BOUNCE moved forward between rivals after the
opening three-sixteenths to contest the pace, vied two to three wide on the turn, kept on in the lane but needed more. INCENDIO tracked from inside, came
out in mid-stretch three deep, rallied between foes but was too little too late. BULLET SPEED led through the opening three-sixteenths then was content to
stalk just off the leading pair, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch taking a narrow and brief lead but was outkicked.
MORE THAN HAPPY was coaxed forward to contest the early pace, vied inside on or just off the rail, was outkicked. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT was
outpaced racing off the inside and never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
BROADWAY LADY rated patiently behind the frontrunners on the rail at the half, waited inside of horses through the far turn, angled off runners with three
sixteenths remaining, began to pick the pace at the furlong marker outside of foes and inched away in deep stretch. MS VANCOUGAR led the field going
into the first turn, was challenged up front outside entering the backstretch, lost the lead briefly four furlongs out, regained the top spot turning for home and
dug in on the rail at the furlong marker giving away grudgingly in deep stretch. PEACE SEEKER was allowed to settle trailing the compact field down the
backside, took closer range at the three eighths pole, lost ground to the pack racing three wide on the far turn and re-rallied outside with an eighth to the
wire to get up just at the finish for show. ROSEBUD'S HOPE tracked inside into the first turn, angled just outside entering the backstretch to engage for the
lead, briefly lead with a half to run, started to weaken between runners at the top of the stretch and tired late losing third money nearing the wire.
NOVEMBER FOG stalked near the rear in the early stages of the race travelling in the two path throughout, was ridden with a quarter remaining to go after
the leaders, could not quicken with the field in upper stretch and was not involved at the finish.

Footnotes
CONCEALED CARRY tracked in behind the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, came to the top of the stretch four wide, took aim, once in front
near the sixteenth pole quickly powered clear. SANDY BAY bumped with a rival at the start then settled off the pace, saved ground inside on the turn, came
out a bit in upper stretch then further in later stretch, once in the clear finished strongly. MAAKWA set the pace in the clear racing just off the rail, was
outkicked. TAKE A CHANCE stalked the pace from outside three wide through the turn, ran on evenly. RON'S GIZMO broke a step slowly then steadily
advanced inside under mild coaxing, had no extra for the drive. EPILOGUE bumped with inner and outer rivals then steadied at the start, trailed early racing
off the inside, finished up with mild interest to improve position. LESLIE CHOW raced mid-pack outside going four wide on the turn and coming into upper
stretch five deep, drifted out a couple paths and failed to rally. SOUPER LEGACY bumped with a rival at the start, raced off the pace three to four wide into
the turn and was encouraged a bit at that juncture, came into upper stretch wider still and failed to threaten. DOWNY BOY was ridden along early but
lacking a response, went four wide to five wide on the turn and a bit wider into upper stretch, was never a threat.

Footnotes
SOUPER COHIBA was in a good position inside at the half tracking the top two, took closer range through the far turn, angled off the dueling pair in upper
stretch and finished strongest of all with a furlong remaining to get up at the line. FINALIST broke well to be in front into the first turn, continued to dictate the
pace along the backside, was confronted on the outside two furlongs to the finish, battled stubbornly on the fence to rebid getting his nose in front with a
sixteenth left and could not find some more very late to hold off the closing winner at the wire. SO SUAVE (IRE) tracked the frontrunner from the onset,
engaged the pacesetter outside at the quarter pole, briefly took command in upper stretch and gave way between runners in the late stages of the race
settling for a clear third in the end. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS was allowed to settle trailing the field in the early stages, started to rally three furlongs from
home, angled out to the five path for the drive and showed good energy outside to get up for a minor role. HYPERFOCUS settled on the rail in the middle of
the field through the backstretch, advanced mildly inside on the far turn, waited momentarily on the fence with a quarter to run and finished up evenly
through the lane. ARGENTIUM stalked between horses in the middle of the pack at the half, was ridden with three eighths to go and could not get into
contention while behind horses through the stretch. BURNING MAN rated near the back of the pack in the early running, was asked for run while travelling
three off the fence midpoint on the turn, had little to offer in upper stretch and was not involved at the finish. RELIABILITY stalked mid pack outside of
runners down the backside, offered a brief rally three wide through the far turn to contend at the top of the stretch and came up empty for the drive at the
furlong marker.

Footnotes
WITCH HAZEL attended the pace from outside three to four wide, lost ground on the leaders leaving the bend while floating five wide into upper stretch,
came again late under strong urging to just get up over DOLCE SOPRESA, who pressed from between rivals two to three wide, dueled in upper stretch,
took command a furlong out, led late but was outfinished. ATTABE broke outwardly just a bit, pursued in behind mid-pack, was encouraged along about the
nine-sixteenths while losing ground on the leaders, went three wide on the turn, navigated traffic in the stretch and gained too late. CRUMLIN BEAST shifted
in gradually heading up the backstretch to be about four wide into the turn, edged a bit closer while moving out six wide turning for home, ran on. TIME FOR
AN ANGEL set the pace facing outside pressured, was off the rail turning for home and dueled briefly before weakening. WAR'S END KISS raced off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, kept on evenly up the rail in the stretch. SPLURGE tracked from inside, came out four wide turning for home within striking
distance but flattened out. RAVELLO BEAUTY lacked early speed while switching outside foes, moved four to six wide on the turn, lugged in a bit in upper
stretch and ran on. MISSION OF JOY was in just a bit tight at the start, raced off the inside toward the rear and was never a threat. PANIC SWITCH shifted
in and was not a factor. GODDESS PELE chased from outside five wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
MEYER hounded the early pace from the start, hooked up with the frontrunner with a half left to go, took command two furlongs from home, was collared at
the furlong marker and lost the lead with a sixteenth remaining only to rebid courageously in the shadow of the wire to get up for the win. LIL BIT GANGSTA
tracked the pacesetters into the final turn, moved up the fence to take closer range turning for home the final time, took control outside in the final sixteenth
and was outgamed by the winner at the shadow of the wire. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION tracked the top pair in the early parts of the race, was between runners
three furlongs remaining, lost ground to the top two through the final turn and finished up well while not a threat to the first two finishers but running on to be
a clear third. LION KINGDOM took command after the break, set all the fractions for the first mile, was challenged with a half remaining on the outside by
the winner, battled for the lead on the rail until upper stretch and faded on the fence in the last eighth to hold for a minor award. CANADIAN PHAROAH
broke well to be close after the start, was allowed to relax in the middle stages of the race settling mid pack with a half to run, began to advance inside
through the final turn and finished up with good interest down the stretch. MNEMBA ISLAND was allowed to settle close to the back in the beginning and
offered a little run through the lane passing tired rivals in mid stretch. OCTOBER FROST took a stalking position travelling three wide midfield in the early
stages, advanced outside of runners down the backside to contend into the far turn, began to weaken at the three furlong marker and could not make an
impact in the stretch run. REDOUTE'S LIGHT took position near the rear after the start and could not gain on rivals throughout the race. JUAN PABLO
settled at the back of the field from the start and could not get involved at any point in the race.

SISTER SEAGULL was forced in and bumped a rival just after the break then steadied slightly heading into the first bend, saved ground before coming out
a bit turning into the run up the backstretch settling last but one, moved back to the rail heading into the far turn, gradually moved out then shifted four wide
by the three-eighths, bid five wide in upper stretch with a narrow lead, dueled then edged away under steady handling. SWOOP TO FINISH switched
outside the pacesetter early to stalk two to three wide, bid leaving the far turn, was soon overtaken by the aforementioned, kept on with that one till mid- to
late-stretch and was outfinished. DEVIL'S BIT came in a bit after the break, tracked the leading pair inside saving ground, tipped out leaving the far turn and
ran on. WHIMSICAL DANCE was bumped and steadied slightly at the start then steadied slightly again soon after when in tight, settled at the rear racing off
the inside, began to advance outside on the far turn moving out from four to six wide on that bend, ran on mildly. STREGA was bumped at the break but
moved clear to set the pace racing on or just off the rail, was engaged late on the far turn, drifted out a bit leaving that bend, and weakened. KEEP IT NEAT
bumped a rival at the start, was caught three wide early, moved up a bit heading up the backstretch, was close while three to four wide on the far turn but
failed to rally.

Footnotes
SPECIAL FORCES tracked the early leader from the onset, took command midpoint on the far turn, opened up on the field in upper stretch and had enough
in reserve late to hold at the wire. DOLDER GRAND broke inwards at the start, settled near the back travelling down the backside, waited on the turn for
running room, pushed his way out to the six path for the run to the wire and could not make up enough ground late to catch the winner. CONGLOMERATE
rated inside behind the frontrunners early on, roused on the rail with three eighths to go, angled off a tiring runner in upper stretch and offered a good finish
to be alone in third at the line. FULL EXTREME tracked mid pack on the outside down the backstretch, was ridden hard to keep position through the far turn,
turning for home was floated out to be in the seven path for the drive and closed mildly through the lane to be on the fringes. SIR SAHIB advanced between
runners at the half, was in contention entering the far turn racing just outside of foes, stalled in upper stretch between horses and was not a factor at the
finish. GUESTIMATION assumed command from the start, was collared outside by the winner midpoint on the far turn, began to weaken in upper stretch
and retreated on the fence through the lane. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was allowed to get his feet under himself early while trailing the field after the break,
took closer order to the pack entering the far turn and could not find another gear for the stretch drive to be involved at the finish.

Footnotes
SILENT RISK settled and tucked in behind the leaders mid-pack racing three wide into the turn, came out five wide leaving that bend, took aim in the
stretch, struck the lead a sixteenth out and drove past under steady handling. BEAU GUEST stalked outside mid-pack, went three to four wide on the turn,
kept on in late stretch to get the place. RAISE A PROFIT broke outwardly just a bit, tracked from inside, came out three wide in upper stretch, missed
second while finishing well. CHUNKY MONKEY settled at the rear, went four to five wide on the turn coming six deep into upper stretch, kicked on mildly.
YOU MAKE ME HAPPY stalked from outside going two to three wide on the turn and taking the lead about the quarter, was clear in upper stretch but lacked
the needed late kick. RED FLARE moved forward inside to set the pace, was overtaken two furlongs out, weakened thereafter. SILENT FAREWELL
switched outside a foe going two to three wide while up close early and into the turn, came up empty. BORN HAPPY broke a step slowly and was in a bit
tight, saved ground on the turn but was not a factor.
