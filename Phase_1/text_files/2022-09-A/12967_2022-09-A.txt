HANDSOME PLAYBOY was fractious in the gate, tracked close up on the inside, chased on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside,
closed willingly, kicked clear under urging and was in hand the final yards. ANTONOV trailed the field, moved up two wide on the far turn, came four wide
into the lane and made a late run outside. BEAR'S CORRECT pressed the pace racing close up two wide, bid between rivals on the far turn, dueled with
SHEA ON THE LAM passing the quarter pole, dug in through the lane and earned the show spot. SUMMER BEE raced off the pace inside, dropped back
some on the far turn, then rallied mildly in the two path. NETWORKING raced five wide entering the first turn, settled two wide off the pace, went four wide
past the quarter pole and failed to threaten. SHEA ON THE LAM set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in and weakened in the final furlong.
TROPHY ROOM raced four wide into the first turn, stalked two wide, bid three wide on the far turn and faded.

SENATE CHAMBER was well placed on the inside tracking the leaders, angled out midway on the far turn, bid four wide, took charge turning for home,
drew clear under urging and was kept to the task. AFFABLE MONARCH raced two wide off the pace, advanced outside on the far turn, came five wide into
the lane, rallied outside and finished well. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY vied between rivals in a three way tussle for the early lead, dueled on the backside and far
turn, dug in through the lane and earned the show spot. OUR LUCKY MAN raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the
lane and flattened out. DADDY KNOWS vied inside for the lead, dueled on the backside and far turn, then tired. AEQUOR vied three wide for the lead,
dueled into the far turn and tired in the stretch. RISK VS REWARD raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, moved up on the far turn, then
lacked a rally. ASHAAB raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

the stretch run, commenced her bid in the final sixteenth and was going best late to prevail. LOVE UNLIMITED vied inside for the lead, briefly shook free on
the far turn, dueled, shook free again in upper stretch, then dug in gamely inside to the finish. TIME GOES FAST was bumped at the start, raced three wide
off the pace, bid four wide on the far turn, dueled past midstretch and was outkicked. FAR HEART veered out and bumped a rival at the start, pulled in the
early stages, steadied entering the first turn, raced off the pace inside, came out sharply at the quarter pole impeding MYRA FLEENER, then bested the
others. LEGEND'S SONG raced three wide early, then tracked inside, chased on the far turn and faded. MYRA FLEENER was bumped and checked at the
start, trailed the field, then was impeded at the quarter pole and forced to check sharply. ACE GIRL vied two wide for the lead, chased on the far turn and
faded. GRACE IN MOTION raced off the pace and failed to respond when asked. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection, FAR HEART was
disqualified and placed sixth for interference at the quarter pole.
