Footnotes
VACATION DANCE was off a step slow, moved up on the outside under urging, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths,
took the lead into the stretch then was set down, drifted out under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed crop inside the
sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. DISARMED came inward early, was coaxed along off the pace, moved closer in the two path around the turn,
waited patiently while BOBBY THE TANK came out in front of him late on that bend, swung out and bumped soundly with EXCALIBRATE at the top of the
stretch then steadied behind horses, dropped in for room shortly thereafter, chased greenly into the final sixteenth, gained on the winner late and just
missed while able to secure the place. BOBBY THE TANK broke out and bumped with a rival then was corrected before being hustled, settled under some
urging, moved closer while inside on the turn, shifted off the rail late on that bend, came out into upper stretch, pursued the leader while outside into the final
furlong, moved out more in pursuit late and finished willingly while gaining late for the show. CURLY LARRY AND MO was hustled from the gate, disputed
the pace on the inside of a foe while well clear of the rest of the field, saw the margin on the rest of the field diminish while inside around the turn, came
under increased urging outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch, fought on well under a drive to near the sixteenth-pole but
was outfinished while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. TATER AND TOT was urged along towards the rear, traveled around the turn in the two
path and improved position. CHASIN' YOU bumped soundly with a rival at the start and was off a step slow, was urged along on the outside, moved closer
while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. EXALTED ONE broke out then bumped soundly
with a rival and was off a step slow, raced near the rear under urging, traveled in the four path around the turn and was no factor. EXCALIBRATE was sent
hard from the start, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, was bumped hard while dropping back at the quarter-pole and
tired. HOT ROD LINCOLN was bumped at the start and a bit slow into stride, saved ground at the rear and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GREELEY AND BEN coaxed from the gate, showed the way three wide under pressure from HAPPY FARM to the outside, came under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, angled four to five wide into upper stretch floating out his prompter, came out two paths near the eighth pole to look his main danger in the eye
and dug in bumping with HAPPY FARM forty yards from the finish, then gamely fended off that rival to prevail by a neck. HAPPY FARM bobbled at the
break under coaxing and pressed the aforementioned foe from the outside four paths off the rail down the backstretch and through the turn coming under
coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch when GREELY AND BEN tipped out to his inside, floated to the seven path
straightened away getting separation of two paths, had that rival come out to be eyeball to eyeball through the final furlong, dug in gamely getting bumped
with forty yards to the finish and was ultimately bested at the end. BIG ENGINE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up mild late foot to secure the show honors. HERO TIGER chased four to five wide under
a ride from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MONTAUK DADDY bobbled at the break under
hustling, chased six then five wide down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide into the turn before making his way to the two path near the
three-eighths having been under coaxing for a sixteenth of a mile, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FOREVER DREAMING was rated nicely on the inside, drafted along the rail around the far turn, tipped three wide into the stretch then was roused
straightened for the drive, rallied under good handling to take the lead inside the furlong marker then strode clear to prove much the best. ATHWAAQ broke
out and brushed the gate but came out first, crossed over while going to the front in hand, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way with an
uncontested advantage, vied inside on the far turn, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead into upper stretch, fought on well into the final
sixteenth but proved no match for the winner late while gamely holding the place. ADELAIDE MISS was taken under a tight hold early, raced in the three
path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, took the
lead into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, was collared by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and also proved no match for that foe
then just missed the place. CHARGE ACCOUNT broke out at the start, went three wide around the opening bend, was rated on the outside, traveled three
wide around the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the crop, chased outside into the final furlong, swapped back to her
inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened then missed the trifecta. STATE CROWN was taken back under a strong hold early, raced inside to the
two path around the first turn, was unhurried at the back, went three then four wide while roused on the far turn and failed to rally. BLUE ATLAS went two to
three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the far turn and failed to respond. LINNY KATE pulled hard on
the bit under snug restraint while inside to the two path through the first turn, was rated off the pace while continuing into the bit, came under urging in the
two path on the final turn and failed to respond.

COUSTEAU coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command a sixteenth from home, dug in and just held on at the wire. CRITICAL THREAT coaxed from the gate, chased
just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, in behind the leader, tipped out near the eighth
pole once COUSTEAU cleared despite having a usable seam inside of AMPERSAND and rallied to engage COUSTEAU in the final strides and just missed
by the bob of the nose on the line. AMPERSAND showed the way in hand three then two wide shaking away through the turn, got let out spinning just off
the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to safely preserve the place honors at the end. JADE'S
DREAM chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure
the last major share. BREAKING STONES leapt at the start inadvertently following the assistant starter's superfluous leg motioning and was off slow,
chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no headway. CHARGER just off the inside in
closest aim of the leader, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, then tipped out
to the three path at the three-sixteenths despite an open inside lane in front and weakened in the late stages. MAJESTIC TIGER chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, made no impact. FORESTWOOD LANE coaxed from the start, chased five paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered
no kick. FOREVER WICKED hustled from the start, chased along the inside until tipped to the four path half a mile from home, came under coaxing three
wide at the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout. PER HISA RULING, COUSTEAU WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND MADE UNPLACED

Footnotes
ME 'N SAP was urged along in third position while well behind the leading duo, moved closer in the two then three path around the turn, gained four wide
into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths then took a short lead, battled with two foes while separated between them in the final furlong and
prevailed under strong handling. COURAGEOOUS OH LA brushed with a foe just after the start, dueled on the outside under urging, went around the turn in
the two path, led into upper stretch then lost the advantage narrowly to the winner, fought on gamely in the final furlong but missed while able to get the
place. SHERIFF BIANCO was urged along on the outside, moved closer while three then four wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, made an
outside bid at the three-sixteenths, battled with the top two in the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the show. ATHENRY was reserved on
the outside, came under urging in the three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out some while chasing near the eighth-pole, held
a good striking position in the final furlong but lacked the needed kick and finished evenly. HUDSON OVERPASS settled towards the rear, was crowded
along the rail when STORM SHOOTER dropped in front at the nine-sixteenths then steadied, passed the half-mile pole under urging, saved ground on the
turn, swung six wide into the stretch, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. GIRAMONTE settled on the inside of a foe, was roused
between horses in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch under the crop and lacked the needed response. GOLQUIST was hustled from
the start then brushed with a foe, dueled on the inside of the runner-up, brushed the rail inside the seven-sixteenths, vied along the rail while still inside that
opponent on the turn, dropped back under urging into the stretch and tired. STORM SHOOTER broke out then was corrected by the rider, was ridden along
off the pace, dropped to the rail at the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally.

TAKE CHARGE BRIANA stumbled at the start flopping and collapsing downwards losing all footing before recovering to vault herself upright getting away
last and conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field down the backstretch and into
the turn before tipping briefly four wide just past the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing tucked three wide at the three-eighths, angled eight to nine wide
into upper stretch, closed well outside to the finish into prominence inside the final sixteenth showing good courage and was up in the final jumps to the
finish to score. VAHVA bobbled at the break, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced
to take over with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide for home, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone late threat and was nailed
in the final strides to the wire. MY BETSY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. PURE PAULINE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside briefly early on before tipping four paths
off the inside midway down the backstretch, commenced a four wide bid through the turn from the seven-sixteenths into contention, continued four wide for
home, then kept on one paced to the finish to preserve the last major share. ST. BENEDICTS PREP coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under
a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. STUNNINGLY prompted the pace along the inside under coaxing
from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch in retreat and weakened in the drive. RENEGADE REBEL four then three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MISINTENTION showed the way in hand just off the inside,
tucked inside into the turn and came under pressure, got headed for the front at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

advantage under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth and maintained a safe advantage while put to lighter encouragement late. FREYDIS THE RED
(FR) was taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in the two path under restraint, was reserved off the pace, saved ground while roused on the far
turn, gained while cutting the corner into the stretch, steadied while blocked behind horses inside the three-sixteenths, found room into the final furlong and

Footnotes
PALM COTTAGE broke through the gate prior to the start, the assistant starter doing an excellent job to keep a handle on this charge so she could be
reloaded, established the front at the break and showed the way in hand three then two wide before tucking inside through the turn, shook away near the
quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, maintained her clearance to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late
threat and held on to prevail. BOSTON POST ROAD chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong but was ultimately rebuffed at the finish while well clear of the rest and along second best.
MOVIE MOXY hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened while along clear for the show honors. HALO CITY away last without incident, came under taps to the left side and chased detached from the
main body of the field in the two path from the rear, tucked inside through the turn and was coaxed along three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. MYSTIC EYES hustled from the start, prompted the eventual winner briefly before chasing along the inside under coaxing from
the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and tired.

off the pace, moved from the rail to the four path around the far turn, came out some while chasing in upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead near

front, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead to the runner-up at the quarter-pole and gave way. SUNDAESWITHSANDY went around the first turn in the
two path, moved out entering the backstretch, was reserved without cover down, went four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. TOP ENVOY went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back three wide on the far turn and had nothing left. BEACH PASS

MUCHO MAMA MIA five wide near the five-sixteenths when placed to coaxing, continued five wide for home, rallied under a drive coming inwards near the
sixteenth marker and nudging CAPE COD CAUSEWAY into LA VICTORIA who was coming out under the direction of left handed urging and was up with
seventy yards to go and inched away to the finish. to prevail. LA VICTORIA coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed just off the inside, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command straightened away, dug in under a drive
under growing threat to the outside, flashed the crop in the right hand while being directed out slightly under left handed urging a sixteenth out to engage
SUCCULENT eye to eye, got bumped behind by CAPE COD CAUSEWAY loosely between hind ends getting collared seventy yards from home, then was
bounced around by that rival late while along for the place honors. CAPE COD CAUSEWAY stumbled at the start recovering into CAN'T FOOL ME, tracked
the front from mid pack along the inside early on and then from the two path, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper
stretch, tipped out nearing the eighth pole bumping and nudging JOCOSITY near that station forcing that rival to pause and then take brief hold when taking
over his lane, rallied into a seam between foes as it closed down when SUCCULENT came inwards and LA VICTORIA came out to look one another in the
eye, got bumped into the hindquarters of LA VICTORIA before being jostled between the top pair's hindquarters paused late and missed for the place
honors. LEM ME DRINK established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared straightened away and ran on fighting on inside to the finish to preserve the last major
share. CAN'T FOOL ME got bumped at the start by CAPE COD CAUSEWAY, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked to the finish. JOCOSITY just off the pace tracking along the inside, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, was under a drive when nudged and forced to steady as CAPE COD CAUSEWAY came out directly
in front lacking clearance and taking over the lane, then weakened in the late stages unable to get going once more. MUCHO MAMA MIA saved ground
near the rear of the field, entered the far turn and had SUCCULENT range up outside, floated that rival out three to four paths to the five path near the
five-sixteenths before tucking briefly three wide, angled seven wide for home and offered no kick. LET UR LIGHT SHINE just off the pace two to three wide
in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry following a claim of foul by

LEAVE NO TRACE stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even
terms for the lead, inched away into the final furlong, drifted out some nearing the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. WONDER WHEEL settled
just off the pace on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, chased while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, was pulled in by the rider to get
a lead change at the furlong marker, was carried out while in pursuit of the winner approaching the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the
place. KALING was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came through along the rail to make a bid inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch
on even terms for the lead, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. AMERICAN ROCKETTE bolted towards the
outside fence just after the start, ducked so far out the outrider had to move to avoid getting in the way, spotted the front many lengths, was guided back in
at the rear before the three-quarter pole, settled at the back, was roused three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and finished with good
energy for the last spot in the superfecta. SABRA TUFF was hustled from the start then urged along well off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung
five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. JUST CINDY was away very awkwardly, settled off the pace, was urged five wide on the turn
then driven six wide into the stretch and came up empty. APPLE PICKER settled well back in the field, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn,
swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AUNT SHIRLEY settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn
and failed to respond. NAUGHTY GAL displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was put to the
crop at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and faded. MISS GEORGIE showed some early speed, dropped back inside the three-quarter
pole, saved ground under urging around the turn, came out into the stretch and faltered.
