Footnotes
FROMAJACKTOAKING was hustled to the early lead and cleared the field into the first turn, was well rated through the backstretch run while setting
moderate fractions, extended the lead along the far turn, was clear to mid-stretch and held in a drive in the final stages to prevail. TRIBUTE TO AFLEET the
rider lost his iron leaving the break then drifted out a path heading to the first turn and impeded SLIGHT APPROVAL, recovered and stalked the early pace,
lost position nearing the half-mile marker, re-rallied in upper stretch, closed in the final stages to put mild late pressure on the winner and held safely for
second in the end. AMADMADWORLD came a bit in tight on the run into the first turn and was bumped by SLIGHT APPROVAL, stalked the pace to the
second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outfinished late, while clear of the rest for third. SLIGHT APPROVAL was away in good order, took up when
impeded by TRIBUTE TO AFLEET coming to the first turn and lost position, chased from the rear to the second turn, came five wide into upper stretch and
lacked a late response. CANDYBOX stalked the early pace three wide on the first turn, maintained position into the second turn, could not keep pace in
upper stretch and faded in the final stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING INTO THE FIRST TURN, AND IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
RHODIUM RUNNER was brushed by EL CHARRO CHAMP leaving the gate but broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well handled while setting
solid fractions through the turn, drew clear into mid-stretch, came under extreme pressure in the final strides and held gamely over the quickly oncoming
runner-up. MCGEORGE took back off of the early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, was roused five wide in upper stretch, closed with a rush in
the final furlong and just missed for the win on the wire, while getting up in time to secure the place. HE BE MOJO RISIN tracked the early pace, gained
ground two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased the pacesetter into upper stretch, rallied in the late stages but was outfinished in the final sixteenth and
held for third. EL CHARRO CHAMP bobbled at the start and brushed RHODIUM RUNNER leaving the break, chased the solid early pace three wide
through the turn, lost position in upper stretch, was able to make a late gain but was outkicked in the final stages.

SMOKIN' HOT broke alertly and was hustled to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted to the second turn, drew clear into mid-stretch, was
headed by SUBURBAN PRINCE inside of the sixteenth-marker, was kept to steady late urging and gamely prevailed in the end. SUBURBAN PRINCE
stalked the moderate fractions, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the second turn, was roused two wide nearing the quarter
marker, lost a bit of ground to the pacesetter in upper stretch but closed well late, headed SMOKIN' HOT in deep stretch, could not get by that game winner
in the end and held safely for the place. CALI CONQUEST rated off of the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, gained ground three wide
nearing the top of the lane, rallied in deep stretch but was outfinished in the final sixteenth and was well clear of the rest for third. SEA DOG was away in
good order and showed early speed along the first turn, lost position along the backstretch, was asked for run two wide on the far turn, lacked a late
response and was a bit green in the final stages. HADLEES HONOR was a bit keen in the early stages and came in tight along the first turn, took back off of
the pace through the backstretch run, came three wide into the second turn and tired in the stretch drive.

LADY BLACKBIRD was asked to show early speed and established the early lead into the first turn, was well rated through the backstretch run while setting
moderate fractions, drew clear in upper stretch and was kept to task in the final stages. QUITCHERSNIVELIN settled off of the moderate pace while saving
ground, rallied along the inside approaching the furlong grounds, was outkicked in the final sixteenth but stayed on to secure the place. FLIPLIT tracked the
moderate pace from a three wide path to the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages, while holding safely
at the end for third. CAL ROUGH settled off of the early pace while not far back, was a bit rank and hard to place along the first turn and into the backstretch
run, gained ground nearing the half-mile marker, could not match strides leaving the second turn and lacked a late rally. APRIL AFFAIR was unhurried early
on, came four wide into the first turn, trailed to the second turn, came three wide into upper stretch and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
BACALAR was away in good order, vied for the early lead then took command into the turn, showed good speed while extending the lead into upper stretch,
found more in deep stretch and kicked clear in the end. CLEAR WIN tracked the solid pace from the inside, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, was
outkicked by the winner in the final stages but stayed on to get the nod for second at the end. LION'S LAIR vied for the early lead then pressed the quick
fractions through the turn, chased BACALAR into upper stretch, was outfinished in the late stages and was just edged for second, while clear of the rest for
third. KERRYGOLD LADY broke through the gate prior to the start, was crowded by WETHERLY leaving the break and was off a step slowly, chased from
the rear to the turn, gained ground along the inside nearing the top of the lane, improved position in mid-stretch but lacked the needed late response.
WETHERLY broke in at the start, crowded KERRYGOLD LADY and was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn, lost ground three wide nearing the quarter
marker and gave way in the stretch run. NENE ROMANO chased the pace from the second flight early on, lost ground four wide nearing the top of the
stretch and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
LAKAYA settled off of the early fractions, improved position nearing the far turn, came within range approaching the top of the lane, angled out in upper
stretch, was put to firm urging in mid-stretch and surged clear in the final sixteenth. FRONT OF LINE (GB) showed early speed and tracked the solid pace to
the second turn, took command nearing the furlong grounds, was overtaken by LAKAYA in deep stretch and held safely in the end for the place. CONNIE'S
PROMISE broke alertly and showed good early speed to dictate terms to the first turn, set solid fractions while on a clear lead through the backstretch run,
came under pressure nearing the top of the lane, could not hold off FRONT OF LINE in upper stretch, gave way in the final stages and held late for third.
SUE ETTAS GHOST settled off of the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run, saved ground through the second turn, rallied in upper stretch but
could not sustain that run in the final stages. CYCLONE SLEW was unprepared at the start then broke in a tangle leaving the gate and spotted the field
early on, trailed to the second turn, was not a factor in the stretch run but showed good late interest. LEIGH ANN saved ground while settling off of the early
pace, came two wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into upper stretch and lacked a late response. BANDON BRIDGE was off a step slowly but
recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the second turn, lost ground in upper
stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SACRED RIDER was hustled leaving the break and took command of the lead into the early stages, was well handled through the backstretch run while
setting solid fractions, was confronted by BOTTLE OF SMOKE nearing the top of the lane, kicked away from that rival in the drive and drew clear late.
BOTTLE OF SMOKE stalked the solid early pace from a three wide position, made a two wide bid on the far turn to confront SACRED RIDER, was turned
away in that effort and lost ground in the drive, was outfinished in the final stages but was second best in the end. HAPI HAPI came three wide along the
first turn while unhurried, was roused three wide on the second turn, came five wide into upper stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, ran evenly
through the lane and just got up for third in the final strides. CLAIM OF PASSION stalked the early pace, lost ground while still in contention nearing the
second turn, ran evenly to the top of the stretch, gave way in the drive and was just edged for third in the final strides. POUR ON THE COLE tracked the
early pace from the inside, lost position into the second turn, trailed into the stretch run and did not produce a late rally. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY settled off of
the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, gained ground nearing the half-mile marker, continued that bid to make a three wide move nearing
the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the stretch and flattened out late.

MUCHO MACHISMO hustled from the gate, took command around the first turn, set comfortable fractions to the far turn, responded when asked to quicken
on the far turn, continued a strong run to the wire under a firm hand urging and gamely held in the final stages. TABLE FOR TWO was allowed to settle,
improved position along the backstretch run, continued that advance on the far turn, came in tight and lacked room nearing the top of the lane, tipped out in
upper stretch, closed well in the drive, came within aim in deep stretch but could not reel in the game winner and held for second in the end. EXPLAIN THIS
AUDIT was forced to check when PLAISIR took his path a few strides out of the gate, clipped heels, stumbled, then found himself far behind the field when
he regained his stride, make some forward progress down the backstretch, swung out for the stretch drive, came six wide into upper stretch, finished well
and challenged for second while getting up in time to secure third. PERCOLATE (IRE) saved ground into the first turn while racing in mid-pack, improved
position on the backstretch run to stalk the pace to the far turn, ran evenly to the top of the lane, made a mild gain to mid-stretch and was outfinished in the
final stages, while just being edged for third in the final strides. PLAISIR broke in after the start and bothered EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT, came three wide along
the first turn and into the backstretch run, was unable to keep up when the pace quickened into the turn, passed tiring foes late and was not able to threaten
in the final stages. UPSTART YANKEE showed early speed and stalked the pace on the first turn, came four wide into the backstretch run, lost position
nearing the half-mile marker, was asked for a response while three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired in the final
furlong. UNUSUAL MEASURE showed early speed and stalked the pace two to three wide into the backstretch run, raced close to the solid pace to the
quarter marker, came five wide into upper stretch, lost ground nearing the eighth pole and faltered in the late going.
