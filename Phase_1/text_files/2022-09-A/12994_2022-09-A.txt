WAR RON advanced near the inside and took over the lead soon after the start, held clear then took on the challenge of LORD OF THE PALACE entering
the turn, shook free entering the lane, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under a driving finish. LORD OF THE PALACE was forwardly placed in
opening stages then engaged WAR RON for the lead leaving the backstretch, dueled around the turn then failed to kick on with the winner entering the lane,
stayed on with response and cleared second best. LARCH tracked the top pair into the turn, was ridden along three wide into the lane and prevailed for a
share. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE raced off the pace in early stages, saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. SNAP'N TAP got bumped then
steadied at the start, remained reserved in the back and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
UPTOWN QUEEN matched strides for the lead around the first turn then dueled inside of HOPPING FOR A RING up the backstretch, continued just off the
leader on the inside a furlong out, found another kick in reserve, reengaged HOPPING FOR A RING and exchanged head bobs in deep stretch then poked
a head in front and prevailed under a driving finish. HOPING FOR A RING vied for the lead with UPTOWN QUEEN around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued to battle for command into the upper stretch, held a slight edge a furlong out, fought back determinedly and got denied late.
CHASING SHADOWS stalked the pair of embattled leaders up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the final turn, sustained bid into the lane
and bested the rest. A GIRL LIKE ME was unhurried in the back, swung five wide into the lane and never threatened. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE reared in the air
at the start and lost four to five lengths on the field, continued off the pace and failed to move into contention.

COLD SNACK THIRTY tracked the top pair into the turn, launched a three wide bid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer and forged clear in
deep stretch. FIRECRACKER STAND hustled up out of the gate and took over the lead, held clear around the turn, came under a drive two wide in upper
stretch, fought back into the final furlong and got reeled in late. PARLAY PETE raced three to four wide off the leaders around the turn, came under right
handed urging in the upper stretch, responded and finished strongly. O'L RED prompted the pace in opening stages then remained forwardly placed around
the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, sustained bid past the furlong marker then gave way. THREE TIME CHARMER raced in the last flight, saved
ground around the turn and lacked a rally. FLY FIRST CLASS raced off the early pace, chased two wide around the turn and failed to threaten.

LETS TAKE IT IZZY tracked the top two leaders into the turn then moved up three wide with a quarter mile remaining, cleared command at the head of the
lane and kept to task under a driving finish. JAVISTHA raced off the top trio in early stages, hustled along three wide into the lane, responded under a drive
and cleared second best. BAYLEYWICK was forwardly placed in opening stages then dueled for the lead with IMA TROUBLE MAKER around the turn, got
overtaken by the eventual winner at the head of the lane and just lasted for show. SLUSHY chased on the inside and saved ground around the turn, cut the
corner entering the lane, shifted three wide and just missed show. ZENCHUA SKY raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide
in upper stretch and lacked a rally. IMA TROUBLE MAKER dueled for the lead up the backstretch and around the turn then faded. PALACE MAGIC raced
off the early pace, chased three to four wide around the turn and never threatened.

through the lane and secured a share. BUZZER raced near midpack through the backstretch, chased three to four wide around the far turn, raced two wide
a furlong out and finished evenly. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY raced off the early pace, was ridden along two to three wide around the final turn, came four
