Footnotes
GLAVA stalked the pacesetters while in the five path, moved up closer then fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, gained the lead into the stretch and
won going away. NORTHERN DREAMIN rated off the pace in the four path and rallied late for place. RAILWAY raced wide through the backstretch, roused
nearing the quarter pole, rallied into the stretch and got up late for show. HARD TO COME HOME prompted the pace from outside, took over the lead at the
three eighths marker, was no match for the winner into the stretch and was rundown late. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE saved ground inside, and lacked a
serious bid. INTENT TO STRIKE saved ground while setting the early pace, was overtaken and tired.

AWESOME GIGI sat just off the pace in the four path, checked in the far turn from between rivals, drove four wide into the lane, was headed into the stretch
and held on. BEAUTIFUL BABE trailed early, circled into the lane, and closed steadily, missing out. LITTLE ROSALYN dropped back leaving the
backstretch, swung out into the lane, was out kicked through the stretch and improved late. SAVYSKYE pressed five wide, rallied between foes approaching
the stretch and weakened late. LIL OL FLATTER last away then hurried inside, checked in traffic in the far turn, shifted out approaching the stretch, and
came up empty for the drive. GET BAKK set the pace from off the rail, was overtaken at the quarter pole and gave way inside.

SANSOME showed the way under a strong hold, responded to looming threat from INDEPENDENCE NEIGH and held under a late drive. HANDSOME
HENRY unhurried early, took closer order then shifted outside approaching the stretch, and closed determinedly, missing out. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH
chased the pace while four to five wide, was unable to reach the eventual winner and flattened out. FINALIZE trailed early, gained closer order with a furlong
and a half remaining, and showed a mild interest late. EXPO stalked wide through the backstretch, hustled off the final turn and gave way. DEXTERS CODE
offered little.

UNBRIDLED'S SKYE vied inside for the early lead, dueled into the lane inside of STORMCHASER, edged away from the fore mentioned and held under a
late drive. MAJESTIC CAFE saved ground in the three path, was set down into the stretch then kept under steady handling and missed after a determined
try. PROOF IT rallied late inside and got up for show. STORMCHASER set a pressured pace outside, dueled in the final turn, was unable to move on with
rival and weakened. SILVER SPUN unhurried early and bid belatedly. BOLSANO trailed the field and failed to threaten. GRADY'S SONG sat in range early
and faded.

Footnotes
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR broke outward leaving, chased the pace outside, moved up alongside CHRIS'S COMMAND to challenge the lead, edged away
at the head of the stretch, and held. ESTIFRAAD bumped hard then was squeezed out leaving the gate, raced wide through the backstretch, closed
gradually in the stretch and dug in late, missing out. CHRIS'S COMMAND broke in sharply bumping into inside foes, showed the way in the backstretch,
lacked the rally needed late then was edged out late. KISS AWAY bumped hard repeatedly, sat at the back of the pack, bid inside into stretch and finished
evenly. BEAUGATTI bumped hard leaving, fanned three wide leaving, and tired early. SKYWARD BOUND reared leaving, chased hard and was unable to
make up ground and tired. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving SKYWARD BOUND. After review
SKYWARD BOUND was deemed to have had a fair start. CHRIS'S COMMAND was disqualified from third and placed fifth for interference to BEAUGATTI,
KISS AWAY and ESTIFRAAD.

Footnotes
AWESOME SATURDAY went three wide into the opening turn, was taken back off the early pace, moved up alongside IRISH TRICK nearing the quarte
pole, drove five wide, dug in for the lead mid stretch, and edged clear in the later yards. IRISH TRICK led the way through the backstretch, drifted out in the
final turn while under pressure from AWESOME SATURDAY, kept on inside determinedly and weakened in the final yards. MR. KALYPSO experienced
traffic early, tracked inside then was hustled in the far turn, gained inside and held on for show. WHERE'S THE GOLD saved ground inside and rallied late.
LANNY MAC went five wide into the opening turn, tracked outside, and rallied late under encouragement. BOOKIE raced near the back of the pack, lodged
a bid mid stretch and gave way deep stretch. SIR BRONX was under a snug hold early, and lacked a response when asked.

Footnotes
OUR DANDY'S BOY raced with the pace from between foes, shifted out to the four path leaving the backstretch, angled in off the final turn finding the front,
was kept under steady handling through the stretch, and held sway. WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT reserved off the early pacesetters, circled into the lane, drifted
in early stretch, closed gradually and missed. ACE OF DIAMONDS trailed the field, angled out gaining closer order into the stretch, and was along with time
late for third. NO SUPAH FOR YOU stalked inside, waited in traffic nearing the quarter pole, and was out kicked. DEVILS COMMAND hurried outside then
pressed the pace from the four path, dueled outside of PREDESTINED in the final turn, and came up empty for the drive. PREDESTINED set a pressured
pace while three wide, dueled inside of DEVILS COMMAND and wilted.

Footnotes
HERE COMES BARNEY contended the early pace inside, dueled inside of SPORTSCARR, rival took a slim lead but refused to go down without a fight,
battled back gamely and held firm. SPORTSCARR prompted the pace outside of HERE COMES BARNEY, raced noses apart off the final turn, gained a
narrow lead into the stretch, gave up the front then dug in gamely in the final yards and was out finished. SPOT ON DUDE stalked the dueling pacesetters
early, loomed boldly at the head of the stretch then evened out and held on. FULL VELOCITY fanned five wide into the far turn, chased the pace outside,
bid steadily outside under urging and missed. WYE CROSS trailed early and showed interest late. RAVINA LANE offered little. ROLL THE STONE chased
five wide early, and faded inside into the lane. ANKARA outrun throughout.
