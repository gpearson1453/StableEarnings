Footnotes
GRAND SKYLARK chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, moved up from the three path coming around the turn, challenged in upper stretch
and dueled to the wire to get the head bob for the win. INDEFATIGABLE raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn,
began a bid approaching the eighth pole and gained ground to the wire to just miss. UPBEAT MELODY dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued
to battle while saving ground around the turn and raced gamely in the lane, narrowly missing. E J'S REVENGE dueled on the outside through the opening
quarter of a mile, continued to battle around the turn and was outkicked in the lane late. DIVE DEEP chased the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and weakened in late stretch. BEST CHANCE YET raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the two
path, and improved position in the final furlong while never threatening. TEMPTING MOMENT trailed well behind the field throughout, saved ground and
was never a factor.

in the final furlong. KISS N BIZ led the field through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, could not go with the winner in the lane and
chased that rival to the wire. C J 'S CAT FIVE tracked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly.
QUEEN OF CLASS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground in late

the stretch. BLUE BONNIE chased the leaders on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and flattened out in the lane. MADE

the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. PAUL'S TRICKY TALE raced at the back of the pack on the inside
early, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch. BELIZE GYAL raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, came

TRANSLATE chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and
edged clear late. DANNYHILL dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn and chased the winner to the wire. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE)
chased the leaders on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. CLASSY OF COURSE raced off the pace in the
opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. EXPECT OURS dueled on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened late. BEACH HOUSE reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field from that point on, saved ground
and was not a factor.

LENTEN ROSE chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and gained ground
quickly in the final furlong to get clear late. SAFE TRAVELS sprinted to a clear early lead racing in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn while still holding a significant advantage and was caught in the final strides. BEASTIE GIRL raced in the three path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began a bid from the five path coming around the second bend and gained
ground on the outside to the wire. FAIRY CAKES (GB) saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn and gained ground between horses late. FOXTROT SEVILLE saved ground at the back of the pack around the
first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and gained ground on the rail late. BYEGONE DAYS raced at the back of the
pack on the outside early, came around the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. HIGHWAY QUEEN raced in the twp path in the middle of the pack
through the opening half mile, improved position while saving ground around the second bend and weakened in late stretch. WASSER saved ground around
the first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid. TORRE BRANCA raced at the
back of the pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. FEMINISTA
raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path
and faded from there. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came
around the second turn in the two path and flattened out in the lane. HEART LIGHT tracked the leader on the inside while saving ground early, began to
drop back coming around the far turn and tired further in the stretch. AUTOSTRADA trailed the field the entire way around the oval and was never a factor.

AWAKENED tracked the loose leader, led passing the eighth pole, and held gamely. ROBERT'S LUXURY rated from inside, and ran on down the stretch to
place. SEISMIC WAVE rated from the outside, ranged up rounding the far turn, and kept on. REAL FACTOR set an open lead, but faded in the final furlong.
ZARKALLANI (FR) trailed early but passed tired horses in the stretch. ROYALE raced in midpack but was always one paced. BEOWULF (IRE) raced in
midfield but flattened into the lane. WELSHMAN prompted the pace early but faded rounding the far turn. EPONINE was wellback and never a threat.
HONOR UP stalked the loose leader but was no menace.
