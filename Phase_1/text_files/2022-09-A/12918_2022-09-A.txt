Footnotes
NO ICE CREAM bumped with outside rival shortly after the start, sped to the front on the inside then moved to the two path while pulling under a hold, set
the pace between rivals on the backstretch, cleared nearing the far turn, responded to urging on the far turn and held in the late stages under a drive. DARK
MARCUS brushed the inner part of the gate, went four then three wide around the far turn at the back, lacked room from the three-eighths to five-sixteenths
pole, angled out widest leaving the bend, put in late run and proved a game second. CRYPTO MUNNY bumped with inner rival then had his path taken
nearing the first turn, stalked in the two path, pushed upon between rivals on the second bend, angled out and gained the show. MEMES off alertly from
outside, pulled three-four wide on the first turn, attended the pace four deep up the backstretch, chased outside rivals entering the far turn, put in a mild bid
from outside at the quarter pole but flattened to fourth in the furlong grounds. RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE stumbled leaving the gate, steadied off heels on the
first turn, traveled between runners in the middle stages, rounded the far turn three then four deep and weakened. PRACTICAL IMPACT was off slow to
begin, chased three then four wide early, raced four deep at the three-eighths pole and stayed off the rail to the stretch and lacked further response.
MONGOLIAN BOX bumped repeatedly with rivals on both sides then got shuffled between prior to the first turn, went up to press the issue from inside, lost
touch with the leader past the half-mile pole, saved ground to the stretch and faded. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY showed early speed from between rivals then
pressed from outside while pulling under a hold, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the furlong grounds and walked off.

JIBBER JABBER (IRE) traveled along the inside and raced in the middle of the pack early on, tipped two wide on the far turn, drew alongside the top pair at
the top of the lane, quickly kicked clear and held safely in the late stages. BIG MAMA SUE was unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, steered out
and came three wide into the stretch, angled out further and closed well to gain the place. OCTANE (BRZ) bumped leaving the gate, traveled two wide from
off the pace early on, exited the far turn three wide, finished willingly late and got edged for second. SPLIT THEN DOUBLE (GB) got bumped both sides
leaving the gate, raced outside a rival near the back early on, tipped three wide on the far turn then came back to the two path, moved out in the lane and

stretch, swung out but could not summon the needed rally. DRAMATIZER unhurried in the early stages and moved inside, pushed upon around the far turn
while going around a weakening rival, had to pause behind a pair of rivals with a furlong left to run, then gained a clear path but could not regain the needed
momentum. GALLOVIE (GB) broke in and bumped rival, vied three deep into the first turn, chased the speed outside a rival up the backstretch, bid from
outside with three furlong left to run, dueled past the quarter pole, took a brief lead at the top of the lane but was soon overtaken by the winner and
weakened. WITH THIS VOW vied for the lead into the first turn then took control around the bend, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled with
GALLOVIE (GB) into the stretch, then gave way. FLYING TO THE LINE sent between rivals early, started to lose ground past the half-mile pole, dropped

Footnotes
LAUGHING LEGACY away quickly then bobbled soon after the start, pressed the pace between foes then vied for command three wide on the turn, took
over with three-sixteenths remaining, cleared in upper stretch and held off RAKU FIRING in the late stages. RAKU FIRING broke alertly, drifted out early,
raced up close four deep to the turn, lost a bit of ground and chased five wide around the bend, finished gamely while drifting out in the lane and could not
get by the winner. MASTERMIND pressed three deep early on, vied four wide around the bend and into the stretch and failed to find the needed late kick in
the final sixteenth. MONGOLIAN NINJA stalked the quartet on the inside, steered out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. AN ARMY OF LIGHT set the pace
under pressure from outer rivals, vied two wide through the turn maintaining a short lead, lost command at the top of the stretch and gave way.
MONGOLIAN MOON coaxed from the gate then lost his path briefly early, steered to the inside trailing the field, saved ground to the stretch and had little
left for the drive.

Footnotes
COOL YOUR JETS unhurried in the beginning, traveled two wide then went between runners, entered the lane three deep, tipped out in the drive, rallied
and drove by RVINDICATED late. RVINDICATED broke a step slow, steered to the two path near the back, went two then three wide around the clubhouse
turn, chased five deep past the quarter pole, rallied and reached the front nearing the sixteenth pole but got overhauled by the winner in the end. NEVER
SEEN BEFORE (IRE) pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn and took over at the quarter pole, put away inner rival leaving the turn, lost
command in upper stretch but stayed on well for third inside the top pair. WEEGEE settled on the inside, tugged a bit and had to steady off heels past the
five-eighths pole, slipped through inside a rival while in a bit tight on the far turn, lacked room and checked at the three-sixteenths pole, remained inside and
kept on to earn a minor award. HOODLUM was off slow to begin, angled down to the inside, reserved in hand early on, moved off the rail and went two wide
on the far turn, found traffic from the quarter pole to the three-sixteenths pole, steered outside and kept on through the lane. PETRUCHIO stalked three then
two wide, raced between foes on the clubhouse turn, came three wide into the stretch, bumped with rival at the top of the lane, got crowded between foes at
the eighth pole and weakened. SO I'M TOLD away quickly from inside, took a bad step first time in the stretch then pulled nearing the clubhouse turn,
stalked along the rail then two wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. CONSTANT CONFLICT sped to the front and was rated on the inside,
set the pace under pressure to the far turn, dueled around the bend and lost command at the quarter pole, then faded in the lane. CARNIVORE chased five
leaving the chute then moved in a few paths and traveled three deep, moved up alongside the leaders leaving the backstretch, started to weaken four wide
on the far turn and also faded.

Footnotes
HOT BOX broke out and bumped rival, went up to take control from inside, led clear through the turn, roused in upper stretch, urged right-handed through
the final furlong and held off the late run from the runner-up. COMMANDER (FR) settled off the pace, angled down to the inside, tipped two wide exiting the
turn, found traffic briefly in upper stretch, found a seem between rivals, rallied and drew alongside the winner late but ran out of time. SIGILOSO was off a
bit slow from outside, unhurried in the early stages, raced in the two path into the turn, swung out into the stretch and gained the show. ZOFFARELLI (IRE)
raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, traveled two then three wide on the turn, altered out in upper stretch and got edged for the show. GYPSY KING took a
bumped from HOT BOX leaving the gate, chased up close in the two path through the turn, moved out a bit in the stretch and lacked a bid. WHOOPING
JAY stalked the pacesetter while outside a rival, was along the three path through the turn and flattened out in deep stretch. APPRECIATED broke a step
slow, raced near the back three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. GOOD WITH PEOPLE traced
out of range early on, saved ground through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ARREST got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack well off the rail early, took the turn five then four wide, closed from outside and
collared the leader at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. COLD CITY bumped leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit early on, bid two wide outside the
leader into the stretch, took a narrow lead at the eight pole, clung to a short lead at the sixteenth pole and yielded to the winner. HAVAKASH READY sped
to the front and showed the way up the backstretch, led clear through the turn then received a challenge entering the stretch, fought back inside COLD CITY
then relinquished the lead at the eighth pole and weakened in the final sixteenth. WHISKEY VISION dropped back early, went two wide into the turn,
traveled a bit off the rail into the lane, steered out and kept on to round out the superfecta. STILL ON THE BOOKS stalked on the inside then drifted out
some up the backstretch, entered the turn two wide, angled four wide leaving the bend, moved out in the lane but lacked further response. CROSS
EXAMINE was off slow to begin, coaxed on the inside trailing early, saved ground around the bend, drifted out a bit midstretch and failed to threaten.
MEMORANDUM came in and brushed rival in the beginning, stalked the pace outside a runner early, took the turn three wide and weakened. SIERRA
PASS got bumped between rivals and crowded early, coaxed from off the rail near the back, rounded the turn three then two wide and failed to respond
when called upon. CARSON'S LEGACY broke in and brushed rival, traveled between foes wide up the backstretch, went six wide into the turn, moved into
the four path then came five wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SASQUATCH RIDE raced widest up the backstretch off the pace, went seven wide
into the turn, remained wide into the drive and made no impact. PRECEDENT bumped in the beginning, settled out of range, chased between rivals into the
turn, four then three wide around the bend and weakened.
