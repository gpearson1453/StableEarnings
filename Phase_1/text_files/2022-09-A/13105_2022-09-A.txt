Footnotes
GREEN FLEET tracked the pressing frontrunners with a half to run, sat patiently on the turn waiting to assume command, took control three wide to lead
two furlongs out, quickly opened up on the field in upper stretch and held well winning comfortably at the wire. STOP THE HUMBUG rated inside near the
rear in the early stages, advanced nicely up the rail through the far turn, waited to angle out with five sixteenths to run and finished up well to be a solid
second but could not wear down the winner through the lane. MUROMEC trailed the field at the half, closed the gap on the frontrunners racing inside into
the far turn, waited behind horses inside entering the stretch and darted up the fence for the drive to be a clear third. TRINITY GOLD broke slow at the start
to trail in the beginning, started to gain on runners through the backstretch, took closer range three wide on the far turn and ran evenly to the wire passing
tiring horses. ULTIMATE STORM broke sharp to lead into the backstretch, was headed by an outside rival nine sixteenths from home, dueled inside until
the quarter pole and weakened in upper stretch fading the last eighth. COPINSAY chased the leader into the first turn, engaged for the front outside a rival
midway down the backside, contested for lead mid point on the far turn to get his head in front, was challenged while between runners at the quarter pole,
faltered and backed away through the field down the lane.

Footnotes
INDIAN MUSIC moved clear to set the pace near inside, drifted out in mid-stretch when engaged by an outside foe, was headed by that one but dug in to
duel and regain a narrow lead late and prevail. SACRED DANCER rated off the pace outside, went four wide on the turn, struck a narrow lead in
mid-stretch, dueled to the wire but was outfinished. SWEET BOMBOLINI got away well, dropped back from between rivals into and on the turn going three
then four wide on that bend, came again from between rivals in mid-stretch to secure show honors. LADY IN RED broke a step slowly, raced outside four
then five wide on the turn, needed more. AQUA LUNA was forced in at the break, moved forward in behind rivals off the inside, took to the rail for the turn
saving ground, kept on evenly in the stretch. SUSPICIOUS was a bit fractious in the gate, broke inwardly then chased in the two path into the turn,
weakened in the stretch. ROYAL CHROME chased the winner from outside three wide on the turn, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE MAX was allowed to settle into stride trailing the field through the opening half, began to find his feet turning for home rallying five wide in upper
stretch and was full of run in the final eighth of a mile to get up in a well timed finish at the wire. MR NARCISSISTIC stalked behind the trio of pacesetters
with three furlongs remaining, angled out to the four path for the drive to take command in mid stretch but could not hold off the fast closing winner outside
nearing the wire. CONFIDENT N ELITE pressed while outside of horses after the start, was taken back mildly off the contesting trio of frontrunners going
into the turn, rallied four wide around the turn to briefly take command turning for home and could not find another gear when headed in deep stretch settling
for third money. STYLISH GENT raced between rivals engaging for the lead entering the turn, battled inside around the turn for command, was in contention
inside runners in mid stretch and faded at the furlong marker to garner a minor share. LION OF THE SEA pressed for the early lead with seven sixteenths to
go, lost some ground to the field racing inside through the turn and finished up evenly on the fence running to the wire. ARQUEBUS contested for the early
lead three wide down the backstretch, dueled just outside for the front throughout the turn, then weakened between rivals with a quarter left to run and faded
running in the stretch to the wire.

Footnotes
BEAT THE SYSTEM set the pace in hand and in the clear, extended the margin in upper stretch when asked, lasted to the wire to hold off gaining rivals.
MARAIS settled at the rear racing off the inside, angled six wide at the top of the stretch, was gaining fast but too late. SPIDER BELLE raced off the pace
between rivals to the turn, angled five wide at the top of the stretch, gained steadily but not enough. DESTINIQUE stalked from outside going four wide on
the turn, brushed with a rival in mid-stretch and kept on. EPHRATA (GB) chased the winner from just outside two to three wide, brushed with a foe and
steadied just slightly past the furlong marker, kept on. HELLO FRIENDS tracked inside, evened out in the stretch. TWISTER ALERT raced off the pace
inside rivals, came out in mid-stretch and ran on. STARLIGHT RIDGE was outside foes toward the back, went four wide on the turn, swung eight wide into
the stretch and failed to rally. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD chased from between rivals three wide, came up empty. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF EPHRATA (GB) AGAINST DESTINIQUE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
A TOUCH OF RED broke well to contend for the early lead, took back mid backstretch angling off the inside to have an outside tracking position while
keeping the leader in her sights through the turn, roused with a quarter to go to quickly assume command with three sixteenths remaining and drew off at
the furlong marker to win convincingly in the end. SOCIETY'S KAT rated inside on the turn just behind the top pacesetters at the quarter pole, rallied turning
for home between rivals and finished up a good second winning the duel in deep stretch. FASHIONABLY FAB tracked the frontrunners in the second flight
just outside midway on the turn, could not gain on the long gone leader to the wire but battled willingly through to the finish just losing the place award late.
CARA CARA tracked in fifth running through the turn, was urged at the top of the stretch and showed some late interest at the furlong marker to finish up on
the fringes. DANISH DYNAMITE was outrun early, lost contact with the field entering the turn and figured things out in the stretch run to show good energy
running past rivals to the finish. DELILAH'S REVENGE broke sharp to gain command from the outside early, lead throughout the turn, was headed at the
top of the lane by the winner, gave way inside with a furlong left and faltered in deep stretch. I'M PHANTOM settled near the rear in the early stages of the
race, put in a mild run just outside of foes midway through the turn and was empty for the drive. ASHLEE'S RING was ridden inside to keep up three
furlongs out and could not make a presence running through the lane. SUNSHINE GIRL stalked mid pack on the fence through the backside, offered little
response when asked on the turn and weakened through the stretch.

SILENT CAUSEWAY settled inside, came out four wide in upper stretch commencing a rally, exchanged minor brushing with an outside rival while dueling,
prevailed. SARATOGA VISION tracked from inside, angled four wide leaving the far turn, was forced out a path by an inside foe, dueled with that one
exchanging minor brushing, was outfinished. MILLIE GIRL stalked three to four wide, came into upper stretch six deep and hit her best stride late to get up
for show honors over IL MALOCCHIO, who stalked the pace two to three wide, was in contention till mid-stretch but could not kick on with the top pair and
lost third late. READY LADY shifted in settling off the pace and saving ground toward the back early, went two to three wide on the far turn, angled seven
deep turning for home and improved position. JOIN THE DANCE was urged forward from the break to set the pace inside and in the clear, weakened in the
stretch. MRS. BARBARA raced outside two to three wide at the rear, was never near enough to threaten. DREIDEL switched outside a foe from two to three
wide on the first turn, continued to pursue in behind, dropped back and faded. SEASONS raced outside three to four wide mid-pack early, went five wide on
the second turn then was forced out eight deep turning for home, failed to make a bid.

Footnotes
LUCKMAN was squeezed at the break to trail, saved ground at the back of the field through the turn, crept up the fence at the quarter pole, lost his path and
angled out with a furlong left and split rivals late punching through at the wire. CHURCHTOWN hounded the early pace through the half, engaged the leader
outside mid point on the turn, took command two furlongs to go, opened up briefly with an eighth to the finish and was caught late at the wire. DAY
TRIPPER was in tight quarters early nearing the five eighths pole, settled well behind runners through the turn, found running room four off the fence turning
for home and ran on willingly between foes with an eighth to go to win the three horse show photo. LAC MACAZA settled near the rear in the beginning,
began to advance between runners with three furlongs remaining, angled out behind a wall of runners nearing the eighth pole and closed belatedly in the
seven path settling for a minor role. MANNIX (IRE) rated mid pack on the rail after the break, advanced into the turn to have a good rail position saving
ground at the half, waited through the turn for running room behind horses, found a seam in the two path to contend three sixteenths to go and stalled late in
deep stretch to losing the photo for the minors. RIOT HOUSE tracked just behind the early frontrunners running three wide through the turn, loomed up at
the top of the stretch between rivals and could not find enough in the final furlong to be involved at the finish. SERIFOS was between rivals stalking mid
pack through the turn, angled out for the drive in the seven path turning for home and could not get involved in the late stages of the race. HICKSY tracked
the pace just behind the lead group through the backstretch, racing four wide through the turn could not gain on the field and had little offer for the stretch
run. FIRST EMPIRE showed good early speed to lead in the early stages, was collared by outside runners with three eighths remaining, began to weaken
on the fence midway through the stretch and backed away in the final furlong. ZATIP was headstrong fighting the rider running mid pack down the backside,
while surrounded by rivals running into the turn continued to be eager and had nothing left for the run to the finish.

Footnotes
KEEN FLATTER exchanged a light brush at the start, stalked two to three wide, bid in upper stretch, dueled briefly inside CELENTANO while drifting out
then edged away late under steady handling. CELENTANO stalked three wide through the turn, bid in mid-stretch putting a very short head in front briefly
but was turned back. MAGIC TOMAHAWK settled off the pace outside rivals going four wide on the turn, gained late. UNCAPTURED MOMENT raced off
the pace between runners, moved to the rail about midway on the turn, came out in upper stretch and kept on. FOREST BUZZ exchanged a light brush at
the start, set the pace inside, weakened in the stretch. GREEN AMAZON was outpaced early, saved ground on the turn. TODAY was fractious behind the
gate, chased inside, came off the rail early on the turn, was three wide at the quarter pole, turned up empty in the stretch. PREETZAH'S STAR was off
slowly and never a factor.

Footnotes
AL HEYBAY pressed the early pace, took back off the contested speed rivals inside into the turn, waited to pounce with a quarter remaining, angled just
outside for the run to the line and closed determinedly between horses with a sixteenth left to hold at the wire. PRICELESS WILL rated mid pack on the rail
on the backstretch, began to rally splitting foes two furlongs to go, angled to the four path turning for home and was gaining steadily outside of horses late
just missing at the finish. HANDCARVED led between horses entering the turn, dueled with an outside pace challenger three furlongs from home, put away
that speed rival at the top of the lane, was collared by the winner in deep stretch and faded late losing second money at the wire. KID FORESTER settled
near the rear just outside for the first half, angled outside of rivals turning for home in the seven path and showed some energy in the final eighth to get a
minor share. FUNICULI trailed the field soon after the break, saved ground throughout the turn, angled in to the fence for the stretch run and picked up tiring
runners down the lane. GANCHO sat just off the trio of frontrunners in the early stages, was roused travelling three wide midway on the turn and had little to
offer for the stretch run. BEYOND BORDERS pressed the pace down the backside, dueled just outside for the lead through the turn, gave way between
runners at the top of the stretch and stopped with a furlong to go.

Footnotes
COOL KISS settled off the pace racing near the inside, came out in upper stretch, drove past outside the sixteenth pole and cleared.
WICKEDBLACKBULLET raced off the pace inside foes on or just off the rail into the turn, angled out past the three-eighths bumping a rival, came into upper
stretch five wide, ran on to get up for second. KAUKOKAIPUU stalked from outside, entered the turn four wide but moved nearer inside while edging closer
willingly, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, was clear into upper stretch but outkicked. BIG RANSOM was outpaced early, went three wide on the turn,
shifted out six to seven deep for the stretch drive and improved position. FIGHTING IRISH raced off the pace and forced five wide on the turn, kicked on
mildly. DO THE GRIDDY chased from inside, shifted four wide into the stretch and ran on. SUNYANI chased two to three wide between runners then
weakened. IMPERIAL STAR set the pace inside, steadily weakened. MYTHICAL STORM pursued the pace from between runners three wide, was bumped
and steadied past the three-eighths. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MYTHICAL STORM AGAINST
WICKEDBLACKBULLET ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED LAST BEHIND THE
FORMER.
