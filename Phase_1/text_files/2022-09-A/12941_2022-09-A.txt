REGHITTO saved ground off the pace, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, progressed steadily in the three path of the far turn then dug in
through the lane to get up the final strides. HEROIC DEED exchanged contact with My Miracle Man leaving the gate then stalked off the rail, took the lead
past the half mile pole, drew clear at the seven sixteenths and came under pressure toward the five sixteenths, dug in under steady stretch handling but was
caught in the final strides. NEW SOUTH had a brief early lead inside then stalked while saving ground from the three quarter pole, started a bid leaving the
three eighths, ran at the rail on the far turn and came along for third the final strides. BOUBOLINO broke out and made contact with My Miracle Man then
settled in the three path of the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened inside the
eighth pole. LITTLE BUD broke inward, rounded the first turn in the four path then saved ground. MY MIRACLE MAN exchanged contact with Heroic Deed
leaving the gate then set the early pace inside, was caught leaving the half mile pole, gave chase from that point but faded toward the five sixteenths.

VALID REASON became a bit edgy in the gate, took quick control and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and was
kept alert in the lane. ORBIT MARS chased the early pace outside, raced close in the three path of the turn then cleared K K CAN later yards. The latter
gave early chase toward mid track, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened leaving the eighth pole. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE gave chase, came
through the turn about the four path and showed little more. WINDY GLO SAL gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened in the lane.
SUPER WILDCAT flipped in the gate, angled to the outside soon after the start then loped around while saving some ground on the turn.

IMPRESSIONISM gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and dueled through the stretch for second. LIVANA gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the three and four paths then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. JUBA'S PARADE chased the pace inside, angled out nearing
the eighth pole and passed rivals outside. SING A LULLABYE was hustled to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace,
gave up the lead at the rail midway on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. LET'S DO THIS gave chase, raced two deep on the turn and weakened
into the lane. GOLDEN SALLY saved ground. VIESTE was not a factor.

UNIMPEACHED stalked off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths pole, dug in for the nod mid-stretch
and widened through later yards. ROCK FILE settled off the pace two deep, started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced close
through the turn and got up for second the final strides. IN THE GOSPEL tapered to the inside to rate the early pace, came under pressure approaching the
three eighths pole, contested even terms leaving the five sixteenths but gave up the lead mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. HENRY
STANDINGBEAR came away a bit awkwardly then saved ground, gave chase from the three eighths pole, though, weakened at the rail on the far turn.
