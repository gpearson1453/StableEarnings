driving hand. SAMMIES SAMURAI lead the way from the inside, cleared the turn and continued to bid then yielded in late stretch. C C REVENGE tracked
the pace from the inside, then bid entering the turn but came up evenly in the stretch. POSITIONDUMONI settled along the inside, then bid mildly on the
turn and was no threat. TIAN'AI ROAD veered in at the start, then was unhurried early, bid while two wide on the turn and was no menace. VIGILANTIA
raced in the middle of the field in the three path, then bid four to five wide on the turn but never fire in the stretch. The final time was hand timed due to timer

Footnotes
ROYAL ICING pressed the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then bid late and was up in time. AEROBALLISTIC pressed the pace
outside of the leader, was clear in the stretch and was then caught. HOBNOBIN GENERAL stalked the pace inside, angled three wide on the far turn and
had a mild late bid. AMICABLE was brushed at the start, took back, trailed, angled six wide at the quarter pole and then rallied in traffic. GO NUTS stalked
the pace in the four path, then had no late bid.. RIVER ANT led inside for a half mile and gave way. MEMORY IN MOTION was not a factor. GRAND IN
BAY was squeezed back at the start. NATES HEARTTHROB was not a factor.
