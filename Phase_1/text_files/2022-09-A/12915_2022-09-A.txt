DEFIED quick pace to the front, well rated throughout, held sway under good handling. BERN N ASH close up the half, took up chase, stayed game, best of
rest. SARGEANT BARGER chased early, could not keep up and settled for show spot. PERFECT PAINTING angled in to the rail quickly, advanced to the
far turn, evenly. MULBERRY STREET rail trip throughout, shuffled back far turn, leveled off stretch. OFFICIAL BUSINESS failed to menace. EYES OF
GLORY through after half, dropped back with no response. DAWN WEST never factored. FIGHTING HEART close to the half, faded back far turn and
stretch. Turf times are unavailable due to a cut cable on the grass course. Race was hand timed.
