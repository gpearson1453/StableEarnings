Footnotes
CARIBBEAN NIGHT tracked the pace from the pace from the inside into the far turn, rallied three wide in the early stretch, gained command in the final
furlong and held sway till the end. MINGLEWOOD (GB) lead the way into the first turn, then vied for the lead from the inside into the upper stretch, was in a
hard drive and held on for second place . RE ANTE tracked the pace while two wide into the home stretch, rallied and was closing willingly, just missing the
place prize. CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY vied for the lead between rivals on the back stretch, then emerged from the fray entering the far turn, continued to
rally gamely in the stretch then gave way in the end. KANGAROO TALK was unhurried early then made a mild bid in the home stretch from the two path but
it was too little too late. LEMON ROSES vied for the lead while three wide on the back stretch into the far turn then weakened in the late stretch. ONLY
TIME stumbled at the start then tracked the pace three to four wide, came out five wide on the second turn then flattened out in the lane. SWIFT TEMPLE
was rank on the first turn, then settled along the inside on the back stretch, bid four to five wide on the far turn and was no menace. VERKLEMPT raced
from the inside into the turn and needed more. PERTINACIOUS TIZ settled while two wide on the back stretch, dropped back then trailed behind the field
and was no factor.

CASTELMOLA vied for the lead while four wide, then angled in towards the rail around the three furlongs pole to take command, cleared the turn and was
kept to task down the lane to prevail in the end. NYVAN vied for the lead while two wide, steadied at the three furlongs marker, then menaced in the early
stretch but it wasn't enough to catch the leader. CATCHA LATER MO vied for the lead from the inside, checked at the three furlongs pole then continued to
bid along the rail and closed well for the show prize. PIGEON CAY chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive then bid along the inside down the
stretch but it wasn't enough. LILLY LANE chased the pace from the inside throughout the turn, was in a hard drive down the lane but closed too little too
late. CHICA CHULA was unhurried early then made a mild bid in the stretch from the two path and was no threat. ARAYA vied for the lead while five wide
into the turn, was used up and weakened in the end. TOTAL SMOKESHOW chased the pace while three wide then bid five wide on the turn but never fired
in the stretch. GOGO GEISHA vied for the lead while three wide then steadily faded and had no final bid in the stretch. TIZ ERIN was off slowly at the start
then trailed behind the field and was no factor. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of NYVAN claimed foul against the rider of
CASTELMOLA for interference around the three furlongs pole. After reviewing the replay, no change was made.
