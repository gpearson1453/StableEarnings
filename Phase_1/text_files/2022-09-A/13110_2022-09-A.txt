come four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. CLASSIC LEAH hopped slightly in the air at the start, then moved up along the outside to prompt the

RAAJIN RIBBON was never back back, moved through along the inside on the turn, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, drew clear and maintained
a safe advantage. SAXON SAGA was unhurried early, moved up strongly along the inside on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, then drifted about
during the drive and was clearly second best. LITTLE HENRY was prominent early while racing four-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and finished
willingly. MUSIC RUSH prompted the pace while racing three-wide to the stretch and weakened. POCKET KNIFE steadied early when Hammer's Knight
came out, then dropped well back and failed to threaten. HAMMER'S KNIGHT came out slightly after the start, then set the pressure pace into the turn while
racing off the rail and tired.

LIE AND DENY was bumped at the start by Tap the Back, then moved up to stalk the leaders, angled out to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught
Big Galute leaving the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. TAP THE BANK broke in to bump with the winner at the start, then was unhurried early, move up
strongly along the inside on the turn and finished fast. BIG GALUTE vied with Predication for the lead from along the inside, took the lead nearing the
quarter pole, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and then late after losing the lead and held on for the show. PREDICATION dueled with Big Galute for
the lead from along the outside to the stretch and weakened. FANTASTIC DREAM was allowed to settle in strides while racing two-wide, came three-wide
into the stretch, steadied slightly in tight late and finished willingly. ASSURANCE dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch, steadied nearing the
wire in traffic and failed to threaten. ATTORNEY LOUIS broke out, then raced five-wide and was not a factor. KNOTTYWATERS showed brief speed while

Footnotes
TIG saved ground setting the pace, opened a clear lead on the turn and maintained a safe advantage. NAPOLETANO was unhurried early, moved up along
the inside on the turn, angled out for the drive and finished strongly. EARS TO US hopped in the air at the start, then rushed up two-wide to prompt the early
pace, drifted out on the turn and finished willingly when straightened. DANNY ZUKO dropped back early, then saved ground and gained his best strides too
late. EXECUTIVE ACTION was prominent early while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. CRYSTAL BANDIT was
forwardly placed while racing four-wide and weakened.

Footnotes
ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished with a rush to be up in the
final strides. LIFE'S EMOTIONS was bumped at the start when Chinook Quick came out, then was allowed to settle in stride while racing two-wide, moved
up to take a slight lead leaving the sixteenths pole but was unable to resist the winner late. APPOINTED STAR saved ground setting the pace to the
sixteenths pole and held on gamely when headed. VIOLENT MOVE was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked.
WAHASHA was bumped and pinched back at the start when Chinook Quick came out, dropped back and came three-wide into the stretch and was not a
factor. SADIE'S SNOWSTORM raced four-wide on the turn, angled in for the drive and failed to threaten. A WHOLE LOTTA HULA was pinched back at the
start to get away behind her field, raced three-wide on the turn and was unable to recover the lost ground. CHINOOK QUICK broke out sharply at the start
causing interference, then moved up to prompt the early pace, bore out badly on the turn and was taken in hand.
