Footnotes
ROUGH ENOUGH was in range inside, bid three wide between foes nearing the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. DUBSTEP raced
well back four wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, bid outside of the winner nearing the eighth pole but was
turned back and just held on the place. PRESENCIA lacked speed while racing two wide, made progress four wide around the far turn and rallied outside to
just miss second. SYLLABUS stalked the pace three wide, bid four wide around the far turn, briefly led near the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the
lane. STARE IF YOU MUST saved ground and failed to menace. RIVERCREST ROAD chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally. INTERESTING GEM
dueled three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn and tired in the lane. KAREN'S REVENGE played no factor while racing two wide.
ALBA MIA dueled inside and retreated through the lane.

REBELDE settled off the pace outside, circled five wide around the turn, took over leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. MEADE stalked the
pace four wide, took a narrow lead near the five-sixteenths pole, resisted inside of the winner to midstretch and settled for second best late. DOUBLE
TOUGH TIGER tracked the pace from the rail, had plenty of room inside of foes in the lane and lacked the needed rally. TONE FEELIN vied three wide and
tired in the drive. HIERRO set a pressured pace in the two path and faltered in the lane. TRIPLE JEOPARDY played no factor while racing two wide.
STAGE READY trailed inside.

MISTER BEAMS pressed the pace three wide, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. BOY O' BOY tracked the pace two wide, angled
four wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. MY EAGLE SOARS set the pace in the two path, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch
and held well enough to save the show. TUMIGA broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back outside, angled to the rail nearing the eighth pole and rallied
belatedly. SALUTE THE TROOPS went evenly while racing two wide. KINDNESS IS FREE stalked the pace four wide and faded in the lane. CHARLIE
LIGHTNING hit the starting gate, raced two wide and never threatened. CABAR SUL was outrun while racing four wide. NOBLE AND KIND played no factor
while racing three wide.

HARD TO HANDLE settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer late on the turn, took over nearing the eighth pole and drew off under a
drive. FIFTY ONE FIFTY raced off the pace three wide, could not gain on the winner in the lane but stayed on to best the rest. DON'T ANSWER lacked
speed, raced four wide and was along for the show. BEAST MARKET set the pace along the rail, gave way near the eighth pole, collapsed after race was
unable to be revived. SHAQ DIESEL failed to menace while racing three wide. NATIONAL UNITY pressed the pace down the backstretch, chased inside
around the turn and came up empty in the lane. MISTER ABARRIO had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
LYNX was in range while racing two wide down the backstretch, angled four wide near the half-mile pole, advanced four wide under some urging around the
turn, closed outside, was up nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off under a drive. GUARDIAN ANGEL bumped with GIRL BYE at the start, tracked the
pace from the rail, cut the corner into the lane, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner from there.
CAJUN TEASE set the pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch and held well enough between rivals to save the show. TIME PASSAGE
prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. SHILOH failed to menace while racing three and four wide. HIGH FASHION LADY played no
factor while racing four wide. MY CAJUN LADY chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. GIRL BYE bumped with GUARDIAN ANGEL at the
start, raced two wide and never threatened.

SPACE RUNNER pressed the pace two wide, took over in upper stretch and held gamely. FARM BOY raced off the pace five wide, made progress still five
deep rounding the far turn, closed outside and just missed. IMPRESSIVE SPEED saved ground in midpack, tipped two wide near the quarter pole and
rallied between foes. STAT was washy pre-race, broke through the starting gate, set the pace along the rail and weakened through the stretch. MERLIN
never threatened while racing two wide. ASTROTURF tracked the pace four wide and faded in the lane. SLIM SLOW SLIDER failed to menace while racing
four and five wide. GREAT UNCLE stalked the pace three wide and retreated through the lane. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF FARM BOY
AGAINST SPACE RUNNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

AWESOME STRONG stalked the pace three wide, assumed command near the three-eighths pole, quickly cleared, drifted out in the stretch and held clear
under a drive. TURBO settled off the early pace outside, advanced six wide around the turn, had the rider lose the whip leaving the eighth pole and was
clearly second best. APOCALYPSO was bumped at the start, raced five wide around the turn and ran on to gain the show. COMMANDANT raced off the
pace five wide and passed tiring rivals. CAJUN HOPE stumbled at the start, saved ground in range and lacked a closing bid. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU

Footnotes
TIZ ROMANTIC raced off the pace four wide, angled in in upper stretch, bid inside of the pacesetter leaving the eighth pole and was up late. EARTH set the
pace in the two path, responded to challenges on both sides leaving the eighth pole and fought on to the wire. NEW YORK'S FINEST prompted the pace in
the three path, bid in midstretch, vied outside of a pair through the final stages and hung. STAR WEAVER raced off the pace three wide and rallied for a
minor award. SASSY BUT SMART was bumped early, raced off the pace two wide, angled out in the stretch and rallied belatedly. AMOR LEJANO (ARG)
played no factor while racing two wide. MALRAUX chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) was very rank at the
start, raced five wide and never threatened. PALADIO bumped with SASSY BUT SMART early, saved ground in midpack and retreated through the lane.
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.
