over command from GOLD MAKER and kept clear. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide around the turn, angled inside
in upper stretch and finished clearly second best. GOLD MAKER applied pace pressure to GAME TO PLAY in opening stages then took over the lead
approaching the three eighths pole, continued on top around the turn, got collared by the winner at the head of the lane and steadily weakened. GAME TO
PLAY sped to the lead at the start, got collared by GOLD MAKER three furlongs from home and steadily faded.

Footnotes
FIREY EMBLEM took over the lead moving through the backstretch and widened advantage around the turn, was ridden along two wide into the lane,
responded willingly, drew off under a drive then finished in hand. HOT CAVIAR tracked the top trio in early stages, chased inside around the turn, sustained
a rail bid through the lane and gained second best. FAST SOPHIA was forwardly placed three wide in early stages then weakened off the clear leader
entering the stretch, ran on three to four wide through the lane and secured a share. PREF RIGHT raced off the early pace, chased two to three wide
around the turn, swung four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. KITTY CATTY lacked speed and raced in the back, coaxed four to five wide into
the lane and failed to respond. WHAT NOW MY LOVE briefly held the lead then got overtaken by the eventual winner, chased in range around the turn then
steadily retreated.

DARLENE STRONG rated off the early pace and saved ground around the turn, shifted out four wide heading into the lane, roused forward to challenge
GLORY ROLL at the furlong marker, seized command under a drive and finished clear. GLORY ROLL tracked the leader around the turn, given cue two
wide at the head of the lane, took over the lead then got overtaken mid-stretch. PRINCESSOFCHITOWN was forwardly placed on the inside around the
turn, tipped two wide for the drive and cleared a share. ORNERY ANGEL raced near mid-pack heading into the turn, hustled along four wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. LOTS OF GOLD sped to the lead at the start and held clear around the turn, got collared in upper stretch and faded. UNHERDOF lacked
speed and saved ground to no avail. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

CENTERFOLD dueled for the early lead with VICTORY BOLT then shook free heading into the lane, took on the challenge from RAISIN RAISIN in the final
furlong, dug in gamely, turned back bid and held firm. RAISIN RAISIN tracked the pace into the turn, launched a three wide bid at the head of the lane,
roused forward into striking distance but could not get by the game winner. AMERICAN SUE hustled along in steady pursuit, cut the corner entering the
lane, sustained an inside bid and secured a share. ADD IT ALL UP edged up closer four wide late on the turn then ran on evenly through the lane.
VICTORY BOLT dueled with the eventual winner in opening stages and continued around the turn then retreated through the lane. RISKY WHISKY raced
