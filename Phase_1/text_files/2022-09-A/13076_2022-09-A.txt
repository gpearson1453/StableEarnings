Footnotes
HEADS OR TAILS rated kindly behind rivals and off the inside, angled out and was put to asking mid turn, circled five wide advancing into the lane,
sustained under pressure, forged to command outside BOWIE TWO STEP with about a sixteenth remaining and drew clear. BOWIE TWO STEP broke
outward, corrected and edged up three wide to prompt the pace, responded while four wide into the lane and engaged the leader, briefly spurted clear under
a drive in mid stretch, dug in when collared by the winner soon after and gave way grudgingly. PANNA MINE drafted back soon after the break and saved
ground, lost his action near the half and bobbled, regrouped and was angled out around the turn, came six wide for the drive and rallied mildly. ELEAZAR ,
hustled up inside rivals soon after the break, poked a head in front after a furlong, took pressure then spurted clear past the five sixteenths, came off the rail
into the lane, failed to contain BOWIE TWO STEP past the three sixteenths then faded. SWEET ASTA rated close up while saving ground, got through in
upper stretch but failed to kick on. SCINTILLIO sped to a brief early lead, was headed after a furlong but stayed on to press two to three wide, failed to kick
on in upper stretch and weakened.

LIFELOVENLAUGHTER stalked the pace down the backstretch, was under urging near the three eighths pole, gained a two wide lead in upper stretch and
held sway under brisk urging. SUN BEE , two wide down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, moved up to take aim on the lead in mid stretch and
hung outside the winner. LUCK IN THE DUSK , rail both turns, failed to menace. MY FOREVER FRIEND , no factor, raced outside horses in the stretch and
passed tired ones. POSITIVE MESSAGE (GB) set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in the drive. BODE'S HERITAGE bore out leaving the starting

BETCHA BY GOLLY was sent up between rivals soon after the break, took over inside rivals past the five eighths and set a rated pace, moved clear
heading to the turn, rated kindly around the turn, spurted away after being roused two wide in upper stretch then held firm while kept to task. FASHIONATTA
, taken to rate in a forward spot while saving ground, edged up when given her cue mid turn, shifted out past the furlong grounds and kept on gamely. DAT
DARES GOLD , three deep with the pace nearing the half mile, stayed close under urging heading into the lane, failed to go on with the top pair past mid
stretch but stayed on with effort to the wire. HUSH Y'ALL dropped well off the early pace, came two to three wide for the drive and had belated interest.
VOLNAY had speed between rivals, chased past the five sixteenths, altered out four wide and gave way.

CASH ROCKET was rank and bumped with IMAGINE IT ALL leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail stalking the pace for six furlongs, eased out
to the two path in upper stretch, gained command outside CROSSLAND approaching the eighth pole then drew out. CROSSLAND sprinted to the early
lead, set the pace along the rail, finished gamely and was second best. THE LAST SCIP lacked speed, circled the far turn four wide, floated to the six path
in mid stretch and had a mild rally outside foes. ORO GRIS , always inside horses, failed to rally. SEE OUT , taken to the seven path in mid stretch, lacked a
rally. IMAGINE IT ALL bumped with the winner at the start, was rank on the first turn, chased the pace and gave way in the drive. LOVE MACHINE , well
placed in the three path on the far turn, gave way. MINEOLA MIKE was outrun. MADE TO BE LUCKY , three wide the first turn, faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
THUNDERSHOOK , unhurried early, was taken three wide and edged up nearing the half mile marker, responded to asking soon after and commenced a
run, advanced four wide outside rivals past the five sixteenths, sustained under a drive and moved alongside FORTUNE'S FOOL nearing mid stretch,
dueled while being floated out several paths in the final sixteenth and forged ahead late. FORTUNE'S FOOL prompted the pace outside the leader, wrested
command leaving the three eighths, moved clear soon into the lane, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, grimly held command while dueling near the
sixteenth marker, wandered out multiple paths in the final seventy yards and just failed to hold in a gritty effort. WALK AWAY JOE rated close up while
saving ground, eased out and was put to pressure leaving the far turn, challenged between foes near the five sixteenths, was in a bit tight approaching the
stretch then failed to seriously kick on. GHOSTLIGHTER broke a step slow, raced to the inside of the winner near the half mile marker and faded.
CARIBBEAN (AUS) , urged to the front, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure into the far turn, gave little resistance past the three eighths and
faltered. An objection by the rider of WALK AWAY JOE against the winner for alleged interference near the three eighths pole was not allowed.

POWER BACK stalked the pace, closed between horses and was up at the wire. MY BOY PADDY saved ground around the first turn, eased out on the far
turn, was wide turning for home and offered a late bid. BENNY HAVENS chased the pace, gained a two wide lead in upper stretch, drifted out late and just
missed. KOBE TOUGH , along the inner rail stalking the pace to the stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch then weakened. LEFT BLANK , along the
inner rail stalking the pace, failed to rally. TRASH TALKIN LARRY lacked speed and was not a factor. CONSULTANT bore out entering the first turn and
was no factor. JACKSON MAN bore out to the five path entering the first turn and was outrun. SUE LOVES BARBADOS , outrun, was wide around the far
turn. ALIFEROUS , steadied in tight quarters entering the backstretch, was no factor. SPANISH CZAR set the pace along the inner rail and faltered through
the stretch. NICKY BEAR broke in the air and trailed. Seven furlong time unavailable.

Footnotes
WELLING drifted out a bit soon after the break, was quickly corrected and pulled his way toward the front, disputed the pace to the inside of ALPHA
QUEUE, moved away while remaining under confident handling around the far turn, responded when put to a drive entering the lane, steadily widened and
was kept to task. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , off the pace while three to four wide, came under pressure leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the lane,
drifted in a bit giving chase in mid stretch then continued on willingly to save the place. DREAM BIG DREAMS tracked inside, dropped back under a ride
leaving the three eighths, swung out for the drive and found some more through the final furlong. BADGER TOOTH , in tight soon after the start, rated off
the pace, edged up between runners in upper stretch then flattened out. VINNY , off slow when hopping outward at the break, recovered and moved up
outside rivals, tracked a contested pace three wide past the five eighths, was under pressure pursuing into the lane and gave way. ALPHA QUEUE , three
wide into the first turn, vied outside the winner, dropped in when failing to keep pace leaving the far turn, steadied in upper stretch and gave way.
