angled out to split rivals approaching the quarter pole, offered his bid entering the stretch, could not reach the winner but continued on gamely to just earn
the pace. ITS KRAKEN TIME vied for the lead with Mister Midas from along the outside, came three-wide into the stretch and held on well during the drive in
a good effort. SIX SHOTS OF T hopped in the air at the start, then saved ground and gained his best stride too late. TIME WEAVE SHARED was
prominently place early while racing three wide and tired during the drive. EXIT STAGE LEFT bobbled at the start, then dropped back and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF ROAD was reserved off the early pace, moved into contention while three-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, took the lead entering the stretch,
opened clear and then was fully extended to hold off Larsen Bay narrowly. LARSEN BAY was unhurried early, swung out to come four-wide into the stretch
and finished fast to just miss. STREET DEMAND stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up to take a slight lead nearing the three-eighths pole, then battled
with Mischief Road to the stretch and weakened slightly late. EASY DOES IT was allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the inside on the turn to be
forwardly placed, angled out three-wide nearing the stretch and was gaining slightly late. CONTINUE ON VICTOR disputed the pace set by Blame the Devil
for five furlongs and weakened. BLAME THE DEVIL stumbled at the start, then saved ground setting the pressured pace for five furlongs and gave way
readily when headed. OCTAVIUS PRIME bobbled at the start, then dropped back and failed to seriously threaten.

WEAR THE CROWN went to the front at once, quickly opened a clear leader, set the pace racing in hand and maintained a safe advantage. HARBOR
OUTLAW chased the winner from the outset, could not reach that one but finished well for the place. WARRIORS HERO dropped back early, moved up
two-wide to split rivals nearing the quarter pole and was gaining slightly late. RINGS OF SATURN was unhurried early, came four-wide the final quarter mile
but lacked a rally. MILEYS BLUECAT raced three-wide and failed to seriously threaten. PERFECT ONE saved ground while being reserved off the pace but
had no response when asked.

Footnotes
MISS SUPER SAINT prompted the pace of Unlimiteddataplan, moved up along the outside to join that one nearing the three-eighths pole, dueled with him
from that point and proved best under strong strong handling. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged nearing
the three-eighths pole, disputed the issue to deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. LAKER JET saved ground while being allowed to
settle in stride, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and was slowly gaining late. LOOKOUT TAYLOR was three wide early while being unhurried,
angled to the inside nearing the three-eighths pole, slipped through to offer a mild bid and then flattened out. NOUMEA dropped back early, came two-wide
into the stretch and gained her best stride too late. BEST OF SHOW was in tight early racing between horses, then raced two-wide and failed to threaten.
WILLING TO BURN was prominent for a half mile while racing three-wide and gave way.

JUSPASSINTHRU set the early pace from between horses, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter pole, drifted out during the drive and maintained a safe
advantage. NEW EVERY MORNING prompted the pace from along the inside, dropped back slightly nearing the quarter pole, then responded to be gaining
on the winner late. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN was reserved off the early pace, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out four-wide entering the
stretch and finished strongly. AFTER THE CANDY forced the early pace while racing three-wide and weakened. DEMOCRAT was allowed to settle in
stretch, came four-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and finished willingly. FORTY SMOOCHES was unhurried early, moved up five-wide
nearing the quarter pole but lacked a response. DECIMATE dropped back early and failed to menace.

the drive and finished well in a good effort. OPAL CREEK saved ground early, swung out to be three-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. GOLD
COAST GIRL saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and improved her position. PRINCESS PAYTON was reserved off the

Footnotes
DONTFORGETHESUGAR saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through nearing the quarter pole, took command entering the stretch and quickly drew
clear. NADITA was off a step slow, then saved ground, improved his position on the turn and finished strongly. LUVAHAPPYENDING was shuffled back
early to be well behind her field, moved up three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. FIRST TIME PLAYER saved
ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out nearing the quarter pole and then again late and weakened. SHE SAID MY WAY broke in the was allowed to
settled in stride, angled to the inside for the drive and was gaining slightly late. MIA CASA gave way after showing brief speed while racing two-wide. MUCH
ABOUT ONE dropped back early and was not a factor.
