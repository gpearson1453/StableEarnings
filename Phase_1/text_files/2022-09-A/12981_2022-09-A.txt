Footnotes
BRAHMS IS WHO tracked off the leaders from just out of striking distance racing into the turn, shifted out four wide entering upper stretch and produced a
steady late response to wear down his rivals under firm encouragement. MOONSHINE MOXY was urged to contend inside foes from the break, was
collected, then shifted three deep early stalking just off the first flight racing into the bend, moved to challenge in that path racing into upper stretch, led
between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner. REINA DEL SUR settled last along the inside racing to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and
made some belated progress. CHA, pulling against rating in early stages, moved to terms with the pacesetter pressing the issue nearing the bend, dueled
between foes into upper stretch and weakened late. BRIAR THICKET, off slowly, tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend but offered
no rally. AUNT RUTHIE, urged between foes from the break, angled to the inside disputing the pace inside foes into the turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
TURN THE SWITCH was urged to terms prompting a rival's pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue through the turn, took over entering upper stretch
and edged forward under firm encouragement. RIVIERA CHAMP, urged to the lead inside a rival in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin into the turn. resisted the winner's challenge nearing upper stretch but proved only second best. RUBY'S RED DEVIL tracked off the second flight on
the backstretch while angling inwards a bit, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild bid to gain a share. MISAWA stalked
just off the leaders inside foes racing to the turn, tipped out three deep nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no final kick. SKY
CONFIDENTIAL tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and quickly emptied out. BREXTON
proved no factor. MAGIC CARPET tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
ELSIE'S KID broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, forged clear nearing upper stretch and extended the advantage under
pressure. SAILSINTHESUNSET was rated off the second flight outside rivals in early stages, was prompted to advance while being fanned six wide into
upper stretch, was bumped SECOND GRACE entering the lane but continued with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors in time. COUGER
tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch to advance between rivals but was
outkicked for the place honors. SECOND GRACE stumbled at the start, was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the bend, swung out five
wide entering the lane bumping SAILSINTHESUNSET but lacked the needed final kick. CIRCULODEGANADORAS angled to the inside tracking off the first
flight racing to the turn but gave way nearing upper stretch. FLYING BUSINESS broke readily, was urged disputing the pace inside the eventual winner
racing to the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. HEY HEY tracked the leaders three wide in second flight through the backstretch, was prompted to
lodge a brief bid in that path nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
IRISH DAWN, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage inside foes to the far turn, was prompted to
go clear nearing upper stretch, drifted out entering upper stretch but continued with a steady response to hold ARIES REIGNS to the end under pressure.
The latter angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, tipped out entering the lane, then shifted to the inside in the closing
stages while being just outkicked by the winner. SWAMPDRAINER was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground under patient handling
into upper stretch, switched out in the closing stages and was outkicked by the top pair. KEEN RESPONSE settled between foes in the opening stages,
switched out four wide racing into the far turn, then continued in that path to late stages while making an effort to improve position. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY,
reserved near the inside to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. ROWDY RED GLARE switched outside foes
racing to the backstretch, made a brief, three wide bid racing into the far turn and emptied out racing into the lane. BOSTON WALLY, forwardly placed
tracking just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. FLASHFIRE,
reluctant to load in the gate, angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes in the opening half, was pulled up racing into the stretch, then was
vanned off the course following the race.

HAPPY DANCER broke readily, was urged between foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, edged clear racing into upper stretch and
was kept to firm right handed encouragement. STOMPING MOON, forwardly placed three wide in early stages, continued in pursuit of the winner in that
path to midstretch but proved only second best. SUPER SHAR, urged between foes, then along the inside entering the turn prompting the pacesetter, gave
way in the drive. TOP HAT ARISTOCRAT hopped at the start, was caught four wide racing into the turn but had no closing bid. HE'S CONNECTED settled
off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly while proving no threat. SCORE MCCOY dropped out early. HOT NIGHT AIR flashed
brief pace along the inside but emptied out racing into the turn. FLOOR IT broke slowly and trailed throughout.

PUBLIC SAFETY, off slowly while caught in close quarters at the start, switched out nearing the turn commencing his advance, was fanned four wide
nearing upper stretch, but continued with a sustained response to wrest a clear advantage under firm handling. JOHNNY UP, urged to dispute the pace
while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command through the bend, edged forward in upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner.
OUT RUN'M, slow to gather stride, switched outside foes early, was caught five wide racing into the turn, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and
continued with interest to gain position while tipping off the inside late to prevail for a share. COLOR ME LEGENDARY tracked off the first flight outside a
rival racing to the turn, shifted out three wide advancing in tandem with the eventual winner nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed closing bid.
WESTA WAVERLY was urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset, dueled for command into the lane and gave way late. J J'S WILDCAT
tracked just off the leaders along the inside in the opening stages but retreated early.

INTENSE COMPANY (IRE) angled to the inside stalking the pacesetter into the backstretch, saved ground into the second bend, shifted out three wide
racing into upper stretch to bid for command between foes and edged clear under firm handling. MORGS WORLD, caught four wide racing into the first turn
racing as part of the second flight, tracked just off the leaders three wide to the second bend, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and prevailed for
second on the wire. SUMMER BELLE broke sharply, was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage for a half, dueled for command into
the far turn and just missed saving the place honors. JEWEL AZUL was rated between foes off the second flight, angled inside racing into the far turn, was
urged to advance entering the lane, altered course three, then four wide racing through the stretch and came through between foes to gain some position.
DESERT GLOW, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, pressed the pace into the far turn, dueled past midstretch but gave
way late. TWELVE STARS, reserved last along the inside to the backstretch, was urged to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and made an
effort to gain some position. ROLLIN BLACKOUT settled into stride off the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out to the six path racing into upper
stretch while being roused to advance but made no impact. WAR MUSIC settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, then continued three deep between
foes into the lane but never gained contention. ALQWANI broke slowly, switched outside foes on the first turn, was urged to make brief progress four wide
after a half but emptied out early. SUMMER MATE tracked off the second flight three wide between foes to the backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
DELFT BLUE, reserved off the second flight along the inside in the opening mile, commenced a steady advance on the third turn, tipped outside the
pacesetter in upper stretch and took over under firm encouragement to go clear. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS moved clear of his rivals racing to the first turn,
angled inside dictating the pace to the third turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge racing into upper stretch but proved no match late. MYSTIFIER
switched out three wide tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the third bend and faded in the drive while lasting for a share.
COASTAL WATERS worked his way to the inside tracking the pacesetter in second flight in the opening mile but came up empty racing through the third
turn. TOUR THE WORLD settled last to the far turn and never gained contention. STAR MISSION tracked the pacesetter along the inside in the opening
half, tipped out racing through the second bend to continued between foes, then gave way between foes leaving the third bend.
