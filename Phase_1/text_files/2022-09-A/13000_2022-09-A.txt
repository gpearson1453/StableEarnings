Footnotes
KELLEY'S MANDATE raced in the middle of the pack from the two path made a bid in mid turn moved between horses at the eighth pole to be up in final
strides. ANGIE'S REVRAC sprinted away from the gate to vie for the lead from the inside and fought gamely but couldn't match strides with the winner late
in the drive. RIVER CHARMER raced near the back through the turn then went four wide in upper stretch to make a late run for the show. SEGOVIANA
tracked the leaders from the two path made a three wide bid going into the turn to take the lead at the three furlong pole was caught in mid stretch and tired.
SMART ACT raced in the middle of the pack from the four path made a bid in upper stretch but failed to sustain that bid. KINSLEYS SWEET PEA settled
near the back in the three path made a four wide bid on the turn and improved position in the stretch run. TAKARA QUEEN was in tight early made a mild
bid from the two path on the turn and faltered. DIXIE TRIXIE broke in the air leaving the gate then was roused to off the pace on the inside and gave way in
mid turn. CRIMSON T. failed to menace. TRICKY LEX was not a threat. EYES OF AGE was hustled along to vie for the lead then retreated.
