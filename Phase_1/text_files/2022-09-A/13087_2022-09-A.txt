Footnotes
SANTOS TO WILSON broke in and brushed rival then went up to take control set the pace outside a rival up the backstretch, vied between foes around the
bend and into the stretch, held a short lead over the runner-up through the lane and inched clear in the final sixteenth in a game win. MULTI PLATINUM
broke well, attended the pace outside the top pair, fought for the lead three deep on the turn and into the stretch, fought into the final sixteenth then lost
touch with the winner and held the place. MORAWETH broke out, chased widest up the backstretch, went five deep into the turn, remained wide to the
stretch, finished willingly from outside and held the show. BALADI was off a bit slow to begin, chased three deep then moved into the two path on the turn,
angled to the inside at the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly along the fence but got edged for the show. MISSED CALL pressed the pace up the
backstretch then vied along the rail through the turn, stayed on to the eighth pole then flattened in deep stretch. D D S EXPRESS broke out a bit but was
quickly corrected, stalked four deep early on, chased wide to the stretch, altered out in upper stretch and kept on trying while unable to advance. KIMMER
chased on the inside entering the turn, eased out to the three path around the bend, steered out in upper stretch and never threatened. STATE OF THE
UNION brushed leaving the gate, was a bit erratic racing between rivals, went two wide into the turn, came out and went five wide into the stretch and failed
to menace.

Footnotes
TIZHOTNDUSTY stalked behind the leader on the inside, exited the turn two wide, drew alongside then frontrunner in upper stretch, quickly took command
and cleared, then drew away under right-handed urging. ESTABLISHED stalked the speed outside rivals, bid four deep entering the stretch, could not match
the winner late but was clearly second best. MANITOWISH broke a step slow, shifted in soon after the start, chased a bit off the rail through the turn and
rallied to gain the show. SQUARE DEAL closest in pursuit from outside to the turn, put in a mild bid between runners and three wide nearing the stretch but
flattened in the lane. HALF RIGHT sped clear and crossed over to the inside, pushed on with a quarter mile left to run, gave up the lead in upper stretch and
weakened. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE climbed early chasing off the pace, went two wide into the turn, steered out to the four path around the bend and failed to
menace. BLACK STORM taken back early, rounded the turn four then three wide and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
ENCROACHMENT pressed the pace from outside, dueled on the turn and took over at the quarter pole, cleared into the stretch, drifted out in the lane and
held on. YENG AGAIN bumped with rival early, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch off the rail, gained ground on the turn, moved out in the lane and put
in late run outside the winner but was ran out of time. LINCOLN CITY raced three deep near the back, came four wide into the drive, steered out in the drive
and closed well for the show. GREGORY'S PRIDE dropped back early and angled in to the inside, shifted two wide around rival early on the turn, closed
fast down the stretch and earned a minor award. AMBIVALENT stalked between foes early then moved inside on the turn, lacked room at the
three-sixteenths pole behind the leaders, gained a clear path and finished willingly through the final furlong. TIME TO PARTY chased three deep early, two
wide into the stretch, raced within striking distance through the final furlong but finished evenly late. ELEVADO raced between rivals near the back, came
two wide into the stretch and needed to find more late. COMMANDER KHAI tracked the pace on the inside, steadied at the five-sixteenths pole, set down
for the drive and got put in a bit tight inside a weakening rival in midstretch and could not rally. KING OF SPEED sat off the pace in the early going, exited
the turn three wide then moved out and also failed to rally. STAR RACER bumped with rival early, traveled off the pace and steered inside, saved ground to
the lane and could not rally. CLAYTON DELANEY traveled at the back outside rivals, went three wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.
STRAIGHT NO CHASER set the pace under pressure from outside rival early on, dueled around the turn and lost command at the quarter pole, lost touch
with the winner into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MAYNARD tracked four wide early, went up to challenge for deep on the backstretch, took control into the far turn, shifted out then back in past the
five-sixteenths pole, carried a short lead into the stretch in the two path, cleared rivals in upper stretch and held in the final strides. CARELESS KITTEN
stalked in the two path, looked to launch a bid on the far turn but was forced to check by the winner and bumped inner rival past the five-sixteenths pole,
vied along the rail into the stretch, lost touch with MAYNARD then switched to the outside at the eighth pole, re-bid between late and finished gamely to the
wire. DUAL THREAT traveled in the two path outside a rival then between foes near the back, moved closer while steered out three deep on the
backstretch, made a swift move four deep on the far turn to take control past the five-sixteenths pole, lost command into the stretch, then came back three
deep late but was not enough. FLYING FRED got shuffled between rivals early, tugged at the five-eighths pole, angled four wide on the far turn and bested
the rest. TAKE THE TWO TEN chased five wide around the clubhouse turn, trailed into the backstretch, passed tired rivals on the far turn while four the
three wide and improved position in the lane. DAD BOD dueled for command from outside then vied between on the backstretch, could not keep pace and
chased in the two path around the far turn and weakened. SPROSTON chased three wide then challenged three deep early on the backstretch, failed to
keep up into the far turn, checked at the five-sixteenths pole and tired. MACHO SAM sped to the front and dueled inside a rival, vied for command up the
backstretch and to the far turn, got bumped past the five-sixteenth pole and faded. RUSTY B CAUSE settled three wide or three deep, stalked off the rail to
the far turn, came four wide into the drive but had little left. BIG STUFF climbed early and steered to the inside, moved off the rail and chased between,
dropped back into the second turn, exited that bend three wide and tired. THE RIDER OF MACHO SAM LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST CARELESS
KITTEN AND THE RIDER OF CARELSS KITTEN LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST MAYNARD PERTAINING THE SAME INCIDENTS PAST THE
FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE INCIDENTS DID
NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) broke a step slow, settled in the two path then between rivals, tipped three wide exiting the turn, rallied four deep and proved best in
the end. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK stalked outside a rival then in the two path, bid three in upper stretch, was no match for the winner late but edged
HOCKEY DAD for the place. HOCKEY DAD stalked in the two path then moved inside, tipped out and bid between foe in upper stretch, led into the furlong
grounds then yielded to the winner at the sixteenth pole and lost the place. COALINGA ROAD bumped leaving the gate, settled on the inside, went two wide
into the lane, lacked room past the eighth pole, altered out with a sixteenth remaining and finished determinedly for a minor award. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR
broke a step slow and dropped back, went four then three deep on the clubhouse turn, traveled four deep around the second bend and kept trying to the
wire. HOMETOWN HERO broke a step slow, angled to the two path off the pace, steered out on the far turn and came five wide into the stretch and
summoned a mild rally. LI MU BAI (IRE) bumped at the start, tracked the pace on the inside out of range, saved ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane
but found traffic and checked between past the eighth pole and could not regain momentum. LIBERAL (IRE) traveled three deep into the first turn then
moved to the back, swung widest into the stretch and could not rally. TROPICAL TERROR tracked four then three wide on the first turn, raced mid-pack on
the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch, tipped out further in the lane and failed to menace. DOMINANT SOUL shifted in at the start, set all the pace
to the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. SUBSIDIZE traveled near the back on the inside, trailed into the stretch and had little left.
RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) was off slow to begin, chased three deep around both turns and faded.

Footnotes
SPEED BOAT BEACH set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, cleared with three-furlong remaining, showed the way two wide into the stretch,
remained clear into the final furlong under hand urging, given a few taps of right handed encouragement in the final sixteenth and stayed strong to the wire
to set a new track record. HEJAZI forward place four deep up the backstretch then three deep into the turn, was closest in pursuit from outside entering the
stretch, finished gamely down the lane but had to settle for second best. FORT BRAGG chased four deep into the turn, remained wide into the stretch, could
not threaten the top pair in the lane but finished a clear third. ROLL ON BIG JOE away well then pressed the pace earl from outside, could not keep up with
three furlongs left to run, chased off the rail into the lane and weakened. FLEET FEET was up close three deep early, chased the top trio into the turn,
traveled three deep then tipped out into the stretch and weakened. FIRST PEACE chased outside a rival then between foes into the turn, was driven two
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. JAM SESSION coaxed from the gate, chased on the inside to the stretch and also lacked a rally. MOBE TOWN was
off slow to start, raced near the back early on, traveled four then three wide around the turn and was not a factor. NAPOLEONIC CODE chased off the pace,
began to climb past the half-mile pole, was along the two path on the turn and weakened. GUN BULLET dropped back and trailed early, saved ground
through the turn and made no impact.

seven-sixteenths pole, crossed over to the inside, roused in upper stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth and got nailed on the line. ICE DANCING tracked

Footnotes
AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) settled outside a rival in the two path then got put in tight between foes early, was on the move three deep into the far turn,
quickly took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear and angled to the inside, urged right and left hand in the drive and held off GOING GLOBAL
(IRE) in the final sixteenth. GOING GLOBAL (IRE) stalked between then outside a rival, got blocked and steadied at the three-eighths pole, tipped out to the
three path, took aim two wide into the stretch, challenged from outside in deep stretch but could not get by. GOING TO VEGAS stalked the pace on the
inside, got blocked on the far turn, remained along the rail to the stretch, gained a clear path and finished willingly to earn the show honors. BELLAMORE
unhurried on the inside and got put tight nearing the clubhouse turn, angled out on the far turn and traveled four deep into the stretch, kept to task through
the lane and gained a minor award. BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) closest in the two path through the early stages, drew alongside PARK AVENUE into the far
turn, lost ground and chased three wide into the stretch and never responded to urging. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM tracked three deep early then outside a rival
at the back in the middle stages, moved out and traveled five deep into the stretch and failed to rally. PARK AVENUE sped to the front in the two path then
moved inside, lost command early on the far turn, chased to the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MOOSE MITCHELL pressed the pace from between rivals, headed rival on the turn and took over at the quarter pole, disposed of STORMY PATTERN
exiting the turn and would not let STREET ART by in the final sixteenth. STREET ART stalked on the inside then eased out to the three path around the
turn, challenged the winner from outside with a sixteenth to go and lacked the needed late kick to get by. MICKY FROM WEXFORD was off slow to begin,
trailed on the inside into the turn, swung six wide into the lane and put in good late run for third. AS AMATTER OF FACT tossed his head to come away a bit
slow at the start, chased four wide into the lane and could not rally. STORMY PATTERN hit the gate in the beginning then went up to set the pace from
inside under pressure up the backstretch, fought with MOOSE MITCHELL on the turn, relinquished command at the quarter pole, lost touch exiting the bend
and weakened. MR. T'S THIRSTY settled off the pace, entered the turn three wide, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and could not rally.
PIONEERING PAPA broke a step slow on the outside, chased four deep in the early going, rounded the bend five wide and lacked the needed response.
COBRA JET showed early speed three deep, lost touch with the leaders with three furlongs remaining, got put in a bit tight near the quarter pole, chased
three wide around the bend and faded. TIZLIGHTNING raced in range off the inside, got blocked from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths pole,
angled to the rail and weakened.

rallied to the front with a sixteenth remaining and held over the late charge from the runner-up. MAEVE OF CONNAUGHT (IRE) was off slow to begin, was
unhurried on the inside early on, steadied early on the far turn, raced three wide into the lane, swung out in upper stretch and flew late but ran out of time.
LEISUREWEAR (IRE) rated two wide early, went up to press between rivals then outside the leader, vied for command on the far turn, held a short lead at
the quarter pole, resisted to deep stretch then relinquished the lead to the winner and lost the place. VIVANDO tracked four wide early off the pace, crept
closer up the backstretch, took an awkward step at the five-sixteenths pole, remained four wide into the stretch, bid four deep at the eighth pole and got
outkicked by the top trio. TIERGARTEN forwardly placed three deep into the first turn, pressed from outside early on the backstretch then chased the leader
to the far turn, went up to challenge again three deep around the second bend, fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. VELVET was rank in the early
going then rated on the inside, waited for room through the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and needed to find more late. ADELIE (IRE) tracked three
wide early, four deep at the three-eighths pole, came five wide into the drive and kept on through the lane while unable to threaten. AUTOMAX (IRE) pulled
or steadied briefly early then was reserved in the two path, chased between on the far turn, entered the lane three wide and failed to rally. JUBILEE LAKE
