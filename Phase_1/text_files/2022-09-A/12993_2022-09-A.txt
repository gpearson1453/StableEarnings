set the pace through the far turn digging in from the three and four paths down the lane ceding grudgingly to inside pressure late. AMICUS BRIEF stalked
the pace chasing on the far turn weakening in upper stretch. HIGH ROLLING DUDE unhurried early rallied on the outside bidding four deep to the quarter
pole before flattening out at mid track in upper stretch. MUTASHABEH hustled early would fold up on the far turn.
