PROPHETESS just off leaders to the half, took turn, cleared stretch held. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE unhurried early, good run past quarter pole, finished well.
LA LA ANGEL far back to the stretch, split horses in the lane for show spot. APPEALING SENORITA no speed, inside run past quarter pole, angled out no
gain. DISCREET ENERGY pressed leader to the turn, could not keep up, faded. LOVE YOU GOODBYE brief speed inside, stopped. GINGERMYSISTER
through early, dropped back steadily.
