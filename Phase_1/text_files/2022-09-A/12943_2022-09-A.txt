late to prove best under a drive. MR. SHADES OF GRAY broke in the air at the start, settled back on the inside, was keen to go on the backstretch, checked
nearing the three eighths marker, then advanced two to three wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane, shifted out four wide for aim, tried to lug in by
the furlong marker, then corrected with left handed crop urging and closed well to just miss. READY REWARD was well rated along the inside, made a
inside bid leaving the turn and was outkicked. MONGOLIAN HERO was reserved early on the outside, then was five wide on the turn and advancing, came
seven wide into the lane and had a late rally. FAVORITE IMAGE set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. CALL ON CLARA was
settled back early two to three wide, then was on the inside by the quarter pole, had no rally. FOLE'S NOTION was allowed to settle early and saved ground

NEW HIRE was four wide into the first turn, well rated behind the vying trio on the backstretch, made a three wide move on the turn and then crossed over
to the inside leaving the turn and drew off by the furlong marker, then was given a couple right handed pops and then one left handed with the crop before
being eased up the final eighty yards to prove much the best. SOUR MASH vied for the lead outside of the trio, then dueled for the lead on the turn and fell
off the pace by the quarter pole, then ran on to be clearly second best while no match for the winner. SHERO vied for the lead between rivals and then
dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane and lasted late for the show award. FOLLY tracked the pace along the inside and
weakened, missed the show award. PARTY AT PAGE'S vied for the early lead on the inside, then tracked the pace between rivals by the half mile marker
and stopped.

MASON MANIA was rated along two wide, advanced two to three wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and made a bid leaving the turn and drew
off in the furlong grounds to prove much the best, driving. ECONOMIC POWER set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn and then was
headed by the winner nearing the furlong marker and was no match for that rival, second best. ZILLION prompted the pace three wide and was ridden along
on the turn and weakened, held show award. UNCLE YUDI was well placed on the inside and weakened, missed show award. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER
tracked the pace four wide, then went up to prompt the pace and then was ridden along by the half mile marker and tired.

Footnotes
GREY QUEST was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, drew out leaving the turn and then drew off in the lane while being ridden out. SCARY LARRY
chased the early pace, made a bid three wide on the turn but flattened out, no match for the winner while being second best. SCYNTZ was allowed to settle
early, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole, and had no rally while getting the nod for the show award. IRON CLASH passed the tiring rivals and just
missed the show award. LEGENDARY BID broke outwardly at the start, then went up to stalk the pace three wide, then was two wide by the quarter pole
and was empty. COMMUNICATION FAIL was dwelt at the start, not a factor. NIGHTENFORD KAZ was hustled along the inside and folded.
