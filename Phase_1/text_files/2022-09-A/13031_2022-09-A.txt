Footnotes
RAP STAR dueled from the inside into the turn, shook clear from FIRST KITTEN, then kept on to duel with WINDOW SHAKER in the stretch drive, dug in
grudgingly and was in the final strides to prevail. WINDOW SHAKER chased the pace from the inside, then rallied in the upper stretch to duel RAP STAR in
the final furlong but gave way in the end. FIRST KITTEN dueled for the lead from the two path into the turn, then gave way in the stretch but held on gamely
for the show prize. RIO LADY was unhurried early then bid while two wide on the turn, angled out to the three path in the stretch to rally but it was too little
too late. LILBITOFSWEETNESS chased the pace from the two path at one pace and needed more in the stretch. BOOTS N' JEANS track the pace from the
inside and never fired in the stretch. NEOQUEEN chased the pace while three wide then came out five wide on the turn to bid but flattened out in the
stretch. FOX CREEK LADY raced while four wide, then faded early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
EIVISSA was well rated along the inside on the back stretch, was moving up on the second turn, gained command, then drew off in the upper stretch and
was ridden out to the end proving much the best. WICKED ECSTASY lead the way from the inside into the first turn, was in a long drive, then was headed
by an inner rival at the five sixteenths pole and was able to hold onto the place position through out the stretch drive, besting the rest. MEJTHAAM was
unhurried early, was gaining ground while three wide on the backstretch to bid on the far turn and was closing well and was up for the show prize.
FORGOTTEN REALM chased the pace from the three path on the back stretch then bid mildly on the second turn and continued to race even throughout
the home stretch. FAST SUMMER stalked the pace while two wide then bid on the far turn, was used up and weakened in late stretch. CINQ SOUERS was
unhurried early then bid three wide on the second turn into the stretch and was no threat. OOMPH GIRL was bumped at the start then settled along the
inside and failed to menace. CHASE THE LIGHT was bumped at the start then settled in the two path and failed to rally.

Footnotes
SHESACLEVERJUSTICE stalked the pace between foes, split rivals at the quarter pole, dueled late and lasted at the wire. LANTANA JUSTICE was
unrushed early, bid in the three path at the half-mile mark, then dueled late and was outfinished. RED ROSEBUSH was unrushed early, circled six wide at
the three-eighths pole, closed but couldn't catch the top two. IMA N H LADY CAT dueled inside before giving way in the stretch. SEQUEEKER stalked the
pace in the four path before giving way on the far turn. TWISTED GARTER was fractious in the gate, raced in the three path, then gave way on the far turn.
COOL BABY saved ground, angled four wide at the three-eighths pole, then gave way in the stretch.
