Footnotes
BEING CREATIVE angled in into the first turn, was rated three wide, commenced her bid on the second bend, was carried out some into the lane, engaged
CAIRO SUMMER again inside the last furlong and edged ahead inside the final sixteenth. CAIRO SUMMER rushed up from inside after the break, floated
out slightly into the first bend, set a pressured pace between rivals, was overtaken from inside on the backstretch, edged ahead two wide on the second
turn, floated out some entering the stretch, battled through the last eighth but did not have enough left in the waning yards. BULU was checked solidly
behind BEING CREATIVE into the first turn, altered in, advanced along the rail to vie for the lead on the backstretch then gradually wore down for the drive.
VIVA VIOLENCE forced out slightly into the first turn, steadily retreated running widest on the backstretch, her rider lost her whip on the second turn, was
allowed to coast in the stretch, distanced herself from the others and was walked off after the race.

B G ATTACK rated from outside, took over when allowed into the bend, moved clear, was put to urging midstretch and kept to task until near the wire. J J'S
SOLUTION prompted the pace just off the inside, angled out some into the turn, took over second into the lane, was no match for B G ATTACK but was
unchallenged for the place. DARREN'S LEGACY was away slowly, chased from inside and passed inside tired ones the final furlong. ROCKET MAN
ATTACK was also away slowly, raced in contention early between rivals, faded widest on the bend and did not have a much left for the drive. HIDE AND
RUN AWAY displayed early speed between rivals, gained the rail into the turn, did not stay with B G ATTACK, continued to yield leaving the bend, angled
outside J J'S SOLUTION at the top of the lane and steadily faded from between horses.

Footnotes
MOUDARI quickly sprinted clear of the others, saved ground in hand on the turn, was asked upper stretch and kept BACKSTAGE BAMBI at bay under
steady handling. BACKSTAGE BAMBI raced closest MOUDARI running widest, closed the gap just off the inside through the bend, lacked the needed late
kick deep stretch but proved easily second best. WEDDING BOURBON chased from inside, came into contention along the rail on the turn, fanned out
behind BACKSTAGE BAMBI entering the lane, altered in for a clear path upper stretch but leveled off the last eighth. LITTLE ACCOUNT broke on top, was
soon well back while just off the inside, stayed off the rail through the bend, came widest into the stretch and had little to offer.

Footnotes
SUPERTRIX vied for the early lead between rivals, was two wide on the bend, carried out to path four into the stretch, did not stay with HIDDEN FIGURE,
rallied in the late going and edged ahead nearing the wire. HIDDEN FIGURE shared the lead just off the inside, gained the rail on the turn, was roused
leaving the bend, floated out to path three entering the lane, moved clear, began to wear down inside the last furlong and lugged in under right-handed
pressure in the waning yards. MIKE'S LADY was steadied when she lost her path near the five furlong marker, angled out, lost considerable ground widest
through the turn and rallied belatedly deep stretch to gain third. PRINCESS MANDII pressed the early pace from outside, was three wide on the bend,
floated out to path six for the stretch run and also found best stride too late. DIAMOND GUCCI a step slow at the break, helped prompt the early pace from
inside, did not keep up on the turn and lacked a serious stretch bid.

CAMPAIGN SPY vied for the early lead, moved clear on the backstretch, showed the way in hand just off or along the rail, lengthen command under a drive
in the lane and held sway under steady handling. ANTRIM'S GIANT settled early, picked up his pace along the rail leaving the second turn, altered out three
wide for a clear path upper stretch, battled for second inside SHOBIZ STAR and edged ahead for the place as he closed the gap on the leader in the waning
yards. SHOBIZ STAR made a slight hop and was throwing his head at the break, pressed the early pace from outside, was two wide on the second bend,
floated out to path four into the stretch, fought to keep second as he was closing in on the leader inside the last eighth but did not have enough nearing the
wire. LASTFORTINOFAMILY crowded briefly at the break, vied for the lead on the first turn, did not keep up just off the rail on the backstretch, lost ground
widest through the second bend and only made up minor ground the final furlong. AMERICAN SUCCESS failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

CRAPS SHOOTER broke on top, set a pressured pace just off the inside, roused with two furlongs to go, was under urging through the stretch, began to
wear down between rivals in the late going but gamely held on. VIOLENZA D'ORO broke outward, bumping ICECAP, pressed the pace from between
horses, found himself boxed in behind CRAPS SHOOTER on the bend, altered out for a clear path near the furlong marker, closed well, was too late but
caught ART HEIST for second. ART HEIST hesitated at the break, moved up from inside to help prompt the pace, took over second along the rail on the
turn, had every chance in the stretch, lacked the needed late kick but was clearly best of the others. SOME DUDE well back early, picked up his pace just
off the rail on the turn, lost ground fanning widest into the lane, drifted out some midstretch, held a straight path the last furlong and showed late interest.
ICECAP bumped at the start, pressed the pace from outside, was three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and gradually yielded.

Footnotes
BLAZEN ROAD was hustled along early to vie for the lead outside SNOOZER, did not keep up on the bend, was all out in the stretch, got the advantage
with a sixteenth left and moved clear in the waning yards. SNOOZER broke inward, jostled briefly with MAGNA LEE, angled in some after the first sixteenth
of a mile, shared the lead off the rail, moved clear and stayed just off the inside on the bend, was put to a drive midstretch and gradually wore down inside
the last furlong. BABA'S BOY chased from between rivals, was two wide on the turn, fanned out behind BLAZEN ROAD entering the lane, lacked a clear
path behind the latter as he rallied deep stretch, forced his way outside BLAZEN ROAD with seventy yards to go, closed the gap, was too late but caught
MAC PANDOWDY for third. MAC PANDOWDY also jostled with MAGNA LEE briefly at the start, was steadied in traffic and altered in after the first sixteenth
of a mile, advanced along the rail on the bend, rallied to take over third and threaten inside the final eighth but leveled off in the late going. SIRCORRI broke
on top, was soon chasing the top pair from outside, was three then four wide taking the turn, lacked the extra needed the final eighth, altered out to stay
clear of BABA'S BOY with seventy yards left and only made up minor ground nearing the wire. MON AMI FUZZIE broke inward, soon trailed and only
passed outside tired ones upper stretch. AFTER MY BROTHER was away slowly, chased from inside, angled out through the turn and had no late bid.
MAGNA LEE jostled between horses at the start, was checked behind SNOOZER after the first sixteenth of a mile, altered in and gave way two wide before
finishing three furlongs.
