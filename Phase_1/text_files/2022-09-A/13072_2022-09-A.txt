Footnotes
ROCKIN ROLLER was off slow, chased the pace from the inside, shifted four wide near the quarter pole, had a clear lead near the eighth pole, came out a
bit late and held gamely under strong handling. CAJUN OCCASION chased the pace while being coaxed along early while racing three wide, moved up six
wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. THE KHOZAN ONE pressed Golden from the outside while racing two deep, dropped
back a bit through the far turn and kept on willingly to the wire. SMOOTH MOTION was off slowly, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no final
winning bid. GERARD was allowed to settle early, raced near the inside down the backstretch, was two to three wide in the drive and lacked a rally.
GOLDEN TALENT showed good early speed from the inside and gave way. ALDO'S DREAM was unhurried early and failed to respond. SUERTE was slow
early and trailed.

Footnotes
DROPKICK QUEEN showed good early speed to set the early pace, repelled the bids of Too Much Vino, Poetic Union near the quarter pole, raced three
deep in the stretch run and drove clear late. TOO MUCH VINO was hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole while racing four wide, challenged for the
lead through the far turn but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finished second best. POETIC UNION stalked the pace while racing three wide,
moved up to challenge between rivals near the quarter pole, raced near the rail in the drive and flattened out. ROLL GYPSY ROLL was coaxed along early,
raced five through the far turn and had no final winning bid. GENUINE MISS was hustled along from the inside early to lay just off the early leader, drifted in
the stretch to race wide and stopped the final quarter of a mile. BREAKING BULLET showed good early foot while racing three to two wide down the
backstretch and tired readily. I LIKE VINO raced far back, lost ground and was eased up on in the stretch run.

SMILING TEUFLES chased the early leader while racing three wide down the backstretch through the far turn, raced near the six path at the three
sixteenths pole and finished strongly to edge clear under steady pressure. YES I'M A BEAST showed good early speed, raced just off the inside down the
backstretch, raced off the rail in the drive and couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. PUDDING coaxed along early from the
outside, raced three to four wide through the far turn and kept on to the wire. SPEARGUN raced off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn,
raced two wide near the quarter pole, shifted out to race six wide inside the three sixteenths pole and moved up to improve position. UNCORK THE
BOTTLE dropped back early, ridden along while racing three wide through the far turn, angled widest through the lane and had no late rally. SMALL
REASON was off very slow, raced at the back of the pack early, saved ground and lacked a bid. SCHOCHOH was hustled along from the inside and lost
ground and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
LE BOIANA vied inside for the early lead, dug in stretch while continuing an inside run and held in a determined run under strong pressure. ASTONISHING
ANABEL pressed the pace while racing two wide between rivals, raced to the outside of Le Boiana in the drive and finished gamely to the wire. AWESOME
PIC chased the pace from the inside early on, continued an inside run at the quarter pole, angled five wide nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly to
the wire. VAL'S GAL was bumped at the break, moved up four wide through the far turn and flattened out in the drive. IMPERIOUSLY dropped back early
on, angled wide to race from the outside in the stretch run and never threatened. GET A GRIP MARILYN coaxed the from the outside while racing three
wide and tired readily.

Footnotes
MOMZA stalked the top trio early on, made an advance near the quarter pole while racing three wide and finished strongly in the drive while racing off the
inside to be well clear under steady handling. BIRDNOTE settled off the early going, moved up through the far turn, raced five wide near the quarter pole
and rallied for the place position late. SILENT CHAOS was unhurried early to race near the back early on, moved up five wide through the far turn and had
not enough for the top pair late. PIPITO tracked the early leader down the backstretch from the inside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. SONIC
KITTEN was rated along in the early stages while racing three wide, raced four deep into the upper stretch and weakened through the drive. HROTHGAR
rated along from the inside, experienced traffic just past the quarter pole, brushed with Last Second Louie and weakened thereafter. MY MAN FLINT settled
off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn, shifted out in the stretch and failed to respond. LAST SECOND LOUIE sent along to set the
early pace from the outside and was done early.
