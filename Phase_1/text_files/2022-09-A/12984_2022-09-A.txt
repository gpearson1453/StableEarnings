Footnotes
NATIONHEART saved ground setting the pace in hand, opened clear entering the stretch and drew off to win as the rider pleased. CAPTAIN DASHI was
allowed to settle in stride while racing two-wide and finished strongly. BENNYANDTHECHICKS hopped in the air slightly at the start then saved ground
while being reserved off the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. DIAMOND WILLOW prompted the pace set by Nationheart to
the stretch and weakened. LASTBESTHOPE was off a step slow, moved up four-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously
threaten. IOWA KID was forwardly placed for a half mile while racing three-wide and then gave way.

BE TOUGH saved ground stalking the pace, found room along the inside nearing the quarter pole, took the lead approaching the eighth pole and gradually
drew clear. BAKERSFIELD BABE prompted the pace from along the outside of Queensboro, was three-wide entering the stretch and continued on gamely
for the place. QUEENSBORO was bumped at the start by Shiny Toy, then moved up to set the pace from along the inside, drifted out slightly nearing the
quarter pole and weakened slightly late. TOE DANCER steadied in the opening furlong from between horses, dropped back, came three-wide into the
stretch and failed to seriously threaten. SHINY TOY broke in to bump Queensboro at the start, was four-wide entering the stretch and failed to factor.

ICE TOWER saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. WEGOTBEERONICE chased the winner from the start, came two-wide into
the stretch, could not reach the winner but continued on well for the place. SUPERMAX was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up along the inside on
the turn, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. KNOCKOUT GUY was hurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and
was gaining slightly late. MY MAN BIGGIE dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LIMA ZULU broke in and was bumped
by Quality Grandson at the start then steadied, saved ground on the turn, came two-wide into the stretch, steadied nearing the eighth pole running up on
horses heels and finished willingly when clear. QUALITY GRANDSON broke in and bumped with Lima Zulu, then saved ground and failed to menace. MY
LAST BULLET was forwardly placed racing along the inside for three furlongs and gave way.

and weakened. FRANKS FIX IT broke in, then was forwardly place for a half mile from between horses and tired. MOJAVE forced the pace for a half mile

Footnotes
COMPLICATE was never far back while racing along the inside, found room to split rivals nearing the quarter pole, caught Five Start General nearing the
eighth pole, and proved narrowly best in a stiff drive, appeared to go wrong pulling up and was vanned off. FIVE STAR GENERAL was forwardly placed
from the start, took the lead on the backstretch, opened a clear lead entering the stretch then responded when challenged but was quite good enough in a
game effort. SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ hopped in the start, then was unhurried, moved up three-wide on the turn to offer a bid, then drifted in nearing the eighth
pole and hung. TOP EXECUTIVE stalked the pace while racing two-wide, was prominent for six furlongs but lacked a response. EL ALTO HOMBRE saved
ground setting the early pace and weakened during the drive. HOUSE OF LORDS dropped back early and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MANCUSO AT THE MIC forced the pace set by Northern Blend, shook that one off entering the stretch and gradually drew clear. AKASI saved ground while
being allowed to settle in stride, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch and finished fast. MAYHEM AND CHAOS saved ground stalking the pace,
angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole for room and finished in a mild rally. BALIUS was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was
gaining slightly late. NORTHERN BLEND saved ground setting the pressured pace for six furlongs and tired. ROWDY RETURNS was prominently placed
for three furlongs and gave way.
