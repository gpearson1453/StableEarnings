Footnotes
STORM N GOLD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the leaders with a furlong to run, vied with SHELL
GAME and proved best through a stiff drive. SHELL GAME was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with OLIVE COUNTRY while racing
three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the eighth pole, vied with that foe and just missed in a game effort. OLIVE COUNTY broke
sharply to dispute the pace with SHELLGAME while racing from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. WILEO PROCEED was void of early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. JASMINE WHO showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. IM COMING OVER showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
OUR IRIS ROSE was away in good order to stalk the pace of BURNZ DA BOSS while racing three-wide, moved up to take command inside the furlong
marker, opened a clear margin and held off the closing COMPETITIVE IDEA to prevail. COMPETITIVE IDEA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. CLAVICHORD settled off the leaders from the inside,
responded when set down for the drive remained inside and finished with good late energy. SWEET RIVER BAINES lacked early foot, raced three-wide
through the turn and failed to threaten. BURNZ DA BOSS broke sharply then was hustled along to open a clear lead before going a quarter, saved ground
while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. NUMEROLOGIST showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach
contention.
