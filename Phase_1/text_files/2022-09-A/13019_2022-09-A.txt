SOUTHERN SUMMER was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly
drew off. PRESLEY broke sharply to press the pace of GOOD BYE CHARLIE while racing three-wide, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid
nearing the sixteenth pole but could not match strides with that rival late. DECK HUMOR was never far back, raced five-wide through the turn and finished
with good late energy. GOOD BYE CHARLIE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin approaching the
stretch and gave way through the final sixteenth. TIZ MY HOUR lagged throughout, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

GODDARD broke sharply to stalk the pace of the dueling leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to engage after going a half, vied with
RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP through a prolonged drive and safely held that rival at bay to the wire. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP disputed the pace from the
inside, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the half, vied with that rival and gave way grudgingly through a stiff drive. MISS YOU MOM
lagged early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. BRICKBAT was forwardly placed early, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the half and weakened after going five furlongs. DIAMOND RAPPER was away in good order to duel with RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half.
