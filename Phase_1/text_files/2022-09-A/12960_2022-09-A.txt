Footnotes
STRETCH RUN broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while well handled through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and
kicked clear in the late going. COLORMEMONEY stalked the solid early pace, maintained a three wide path through the turn and into upper stretch, was
outkicked in the drive by the winner but stayed on to be second best. SATANTA lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, was unable to impact
the top two in the final furlong but passed tired rivals late to get up for third. SOUND JUDGMENT raced close to the solid early pace, could not match strides
with the leaders in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. WHOA BUDDY tracked the early pace, saved ground through the turn, was asked for run
at the quarter marker and lacked a late response. KNOCKOUT BERT hesitated at the start and was off slowly, recovered to chase the pace to the turn,
advanced four wide on the turn, swung widest into the drive and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MISS BELLA brushed with TAMANTARI leaving the start but was away in good order and showed good early speed, set quick fractions while well handled
through the turn, was kept to task through the drive and held safely in the end to prevail. TAMANTARI brushed with MISS BELLA leaving the start, chased
the pace to the turn, angled out nearing the quarter marker to go four wide into the stretch run, showed good late interest inside of the eighth pole but could
not reel in the winner and was second best. SWEET VENGEANCE was prominent early on and tracked the quick early pace, chased the winner into the
stretch, was outfinished by the top pair in the drive and was clear of the rest for third. BELLEO'S MUSIC chased the quick pace from the second flight, lost
ground while along the rail on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not mount a late rally. GOVERNOR SPECIAL broke alertly then took back off of the
early speed, stalked the quick pace three wide through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. OH SUMMER was away
slowly, was a bit green in the early stages, saved ground through the turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
SAFE COMBINATION was away in good order and was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the reasonable pace through the backstretch run,
advanced on the pacesetter nearing the top of the lane, battled to mid-stretch and proved best in the final stages while kept to firm urging. RUNAWAY
KRISTIN was allowed to settle, improved position two wide on the second turn, continued that advance in upper stretch, found his best stride late and could
not reel in the winner in the end but was up in the final strides for second. DI LAURIAN was hustled to the early lead, set reasonable fractions while
prompted by the winner, was confronted by SAFE COMBINATION nearing the quarter pole, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, was gamely bested in deep
stretch and was just edged for second on the wire. GOVERNOR ARTHUR rated off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run,
made a quick move three wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead to mid-stretch, ran on the left lead in the final furlong and was outfinished in
deep stretch, just missing for the minor awards. TWIRLING DERBY settled off of the pace while saving ground, advanced leaving the second turn but did
not offer the needed late response in the drive. WICKED BLUE was unhurried in the early stages, lost position along the second turn while three wide and
did not mount a late rally. SLEEP OVER stalked the early pace three deep on the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, was asked for
run three wide nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
WALKING BOSS settled off of the early fractions while saving ground, maintained position through the backstretch run, angled out on the far turn, mounted
a four wide bid into the drive, responded to his rider's handling in mid-stretch and held well at the end to prevail. SYNC raced close to the early pace,
steadied in tight quarters nearing the six-furlong marker, ran evenly while stalking the pace to the far turn, rallied in upper stretch, vied for the lead nearing
the eighth pole and was outfinished late by the winner while besting the rest. ENJOY IT STRAIT was squeezed at the start and was off a step slowly,
recovered to race in the second flight along the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, came three wide while chasing the pacesetter nearing
the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the drive, while well clear of the rest for third. STAY LIT was allowed to settle early on, was
steered four wide on the far turn and lacked a late rally. GALLANT OAK was hard sent leaving the start and cleared the field into the first turn, set solid
fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the late
going. MASHHAD FLATS was away in good order, stalked the early pace three deep along the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run,
lost ground on the far turn, stopped in mid-stretch, was eased through the late stages and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
HONORABLE GAL broke alertly and showed good early speed to dictate terms to the turn, set a fast pace while drawing clear approaching the quarter
marker, had the lead cut into in upper stretch and felt mild late pressure from her stablemate but held in a drive at the end to prevail.
IT'SAGRANDILLUSION was a bit slow into early stride and chased the pace to the turn, came in tight a bit along the turn and swung out to go five wide into
upper stretch, closed with a rush through the final furlong and could not reel in her stablemate in the end but was up in time to secure the place. ROSE OF
MOONCOIN was crowded at the start by ULTIMATE DIVA and was off a bit slowly, chased the pace to the turn, advanced outside of rivals nearing the top
of the lane, came within aim nearing mid-stretch and was outkicked late, while holding well for third. CHROME'S BEST COPY was forwardly placed to the
turn, chased the quick pace from the inside to the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final stages. NOSHEWONT
was unhurried in the early going, slipped to the inside along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and finished well while unable to impact the leaders late.
ULTIMATE DIVA broke in and crowded ROSE OF MOONCOIN leaving the start, chased the early pace from the second flight, lost position on the turn, was
able to re-rally in the final furlong but could not produce the needed late response. MATCHLESS showed early speed and tracked the quick pace to the turn,
came three then four wide nearing the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. DRAW NEAR lacked early speed,
saved ground through the turn, swung out for the drive, was five to six wide in upper stretch and offered a mild late rally while not threatening in the late
stages.

Footnotes
ZELAIA settled off of the solid early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced along the inside on the far turn, tipped out at the top of
the lane, made a steady gain on AWESOME AMANDA in the drive, wore that foe down in deep stretch and edged away late. AWESOME AMANDA broke
alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, felt pressure from the winner in mid-stretch, could
not hold off ZELAIA nearing the sixteenth-pole, was overtaken in the late stages and was second best. STATEFOREST saved all of the ground while rating
off of the early pace, made an inside bid in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive but stayed on to get up for third in the final strides. CASINO GAMES
was unhurried in the early stages, was steered outside of rivals on the second turn and came five wide into upper stretch, made a mild late rally and just
missed for third at the end. SAY IT WITH ROSES broke in good order and tracked the solid pace to the second turn, could not keep pace in the drive and
weakened in the final stages. ALESHA settled off of the early pace, came three wide along the first turn, improved position along the backstretch, gained
ground four wide on the second turn, could not sustain that rally in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ASHLEY'S RAINBOW made contact with AMAAZA leaving the start, was allowed to settle mid-pack, moved into contention on the turn, awaited room to the
head of the stretch, got through a narrow opening between horses just past the eighth pole, surged to the lead and doggedly held sway at the wire. LADY IN
A HURRY lacked early speed, launched a strong bid from the middle of the turn, closed fast in the late stages and just missed for the win, while well clear of
the rest for second. DANCE LADY was content to track the dueling leaders from a three wide position, launched a bid passing the quarter pole, got into
contention but lacked a final kick when needed in the final sixteenth. AMAAZA broke in at the start, bumping with ASHLEY'S RAINBOW, straightened, then
sped to the front where she was engaged by WONDERFUL WONDERFUL, dueled through the turn and finally disposed of that rival at the eighth pole but
had nothing left in the late stages. WONDERFULWONDERFUL was away well and dueled with AMAZAA to the eighth pole, then gave way. SUE ETTAS
GHOST broke alertly but was outrun in the early stages, was asked to pick it up down the back stretch but was unable to keep up.

SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn while in hand, extended the lead in upper stretch
and pulled away late as much the best. IMPRESSIVE CURLS chased the quick early pace to the turn, ran evenly through the turn while three wide, was
outkicked in the drive and held safely at the end for the place. RING GENERAL was unhurried early on, gained ground three then two wide nearing the top
of the lane, mounted a mild late rally and stayed on to secure third at the end. MACHO CHROME chased the solid early pace from midpack, lost ground
three then two wide nearing the stretch run, was green and hard to place through the final furlong and did not offer a late rally. INFERNAL TIGER showed
early speed and raced close to the quick early pace, lost ground three wide nearing the quarter marker and weakened in the lane. MANFORALLSEASONS
lacked early speed and was never involved. JAZZ CITY wheeled at the start, lost his rider and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
CODE RIBBON bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn, improved position four wide on the turn, circled six wide in upper stretch,
took command inside of the sixteenth-marker and edged away late. ALWAYS SEEKING was shuffled back leaving the break, allowed to settle near the back
early, stayed towards the inside, was content to trail to the quarter then swung wide for the drive, launched a furious rally but came up short, while getting up
in time to secure the place. EMILY SMILES broke out at the start and crowded ALWAYS SEEKING, chased the pace from an inside path through the turn,
loomed in upper stretch, split foes inside of the furlong marker and was outclosed in the final sixteenth, while holding for third. BLUE WILDCAT tracked the
early fast pace, gained ground along the rail on the turn, came in tight and lacked room nearing the top of the lane, found racing room in upper stretch, came
within aim in mid-stretch and was outkicked late, while missing for third. DULCE EMMA chased the pace from midflight to the turn, gained ground on the
turn, attempted a quick move between horses nearing the quarter pole and roughed THE ARCADIAN WAY in doing so, gained ground in upper stretch and
was outfinished in the late going. MISS UNION broke well, sped to the front, challenged by CALLMEMARTHAJANE throughout, disposed of that rival in the
final furlong but didn't have enough left to fend off the closers. THE ARCADIAN WAY came in tight soon after the break and was shuffled back leaving the
five-furlong marker, gained ground on the turn while three wide, was jostled by DULCE EMMA nearing the quarter pole, lost position five wide in upper
stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. CALLMEMARTHAJANE broke a step slow but moved up quickly to engage with MISS UNION for the early lead,
battled with that one to the eighth pole, tired from those early efforts and fell back.
