SUGAR MOON bumped leaving then sat in striking position outside, moved up alongside THE RIVER GREY nearing the quarter pole, dueled through the
stretch then dug in the final sixteenth and edged clear. THE RIVER GREY took a quick lead and angled inside to rate the pace, was joined by SUGAR
MOON near the quarter pole, dueled determinedly inside through the stretch and weakened deep stretch. JODEAN drove four to five wide leaving the final
turn, rallied into the stretch improve position and finished with good energy. MISYA GIRL broke outward, reserved off the early pacesetters, and lacked the
rally needed in the drive. CUVEE TEE fractious in the gate, and lacked a bid. SAYGE'S SPIRIT failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BON PRIX sat in striking position in the three path, drove four wide off the final turn, was headed into the stretch and drove clear. GRAY ADMIRAL trailed
leaving the backstretch, picked up the chase rounding the final turn, angled outside then closed determinedly and got up in time. CATS TOUCH chased
three wide to the opening turn, drifted out in the final turn, closed gamely through stretch and bested for place. YORKTOWN was quickest to the turn, dueled
through the far turn outside of SAVED BY ZERO, continue on matching strides through the stretch and was edged out late after a multi-horse scramble to
the finish. SAVED BY ZERO bumped leaving then hurried inside to contest the lead, dueled inside of YORKTOWN and was out nodded. MR. ARTISTIC
offered little. CABOT TRAIL bumped from the gate, and chased to no avail.

Footnotes
NORTHERN GOLD settled off the pace inside, made a run at the head of the lane then gained the lead and held on. WICKED WIZZY bumped leaving,
fanned four wide in the opening turn, took closer order in the final turn, rallied inside through stretch and inched up late for place. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL
reserved off the early pacesetter in the three path, moved up alongside BEAUTIFUL CALL near the three eighth marker, inherited the lead at the head of the
lane, and flattened late stretch. LIL MISS MUD broke inward bumping WICKED WIZZY, sat mid pack while four to five wide through the backstretch, and
lacked a bid. APRIL'S IMPERIAL gapped early, and offered a mild late bid. INDIAN GIRL sent for speed outside, opened up to good margins in the
backstretch, and was done early. BEAUTIFUL CALL reserved off the early pace, swept the lead with three and a half furlongs remaining, bolted on the final
turn, was pulled up, did not finish and was walked off.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY LEGEND quickly took command, drew clear in the final turn while remaining unchallenged, opened up through the stretch to an easy victory.
HIGH KELLY SONG drove four wide leaving the final turn, and closed gradually getting up just in time for place. KEEP YOUR COOL sat in striking range
while four wide, chased in vain through the stretch under urging but was no match for the winner and was nipped at the wire. DARK STORM COMING
stalked the pace from the rail, chased through the stretch, and weakened late. PAULIE WALNUTS sat in range while three wide, and went evenly through
the stretch. CHESTER SLEW chased outside early, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, and wilted at the head of the stretch. BRADYDABOSS never
reached contending position. TINY TYCOON trailed the field early racing wide, and was no factor. OUTLAWED IN TEXAS sat in range early and tired.

Footnotes
PERPETUAL BLISS allowed to settle inside early, shifted outside nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead at the head of the stretch and won driving. FAST
LANDING quickest entering the backstretch, angled towards the inside, showed the way into the far turn, was overtaken into the stretch and held. SWIFT
SWALLOW gained closer order in the final turn, and closed well late. LASKA trailed early, found running room along the rail into the lane, and was outkicked
for show. PEARLS AND CURLS settled outside, fanned four wide in the far turn, and bid belatedly. THIS TIME SWEETIE raced in closest pursuit, and faded
gradually. NO MORE RINGS circled the field leaving the final turn, and lodged a mild bid. ZHAVIA chased throughout and tired. SOLANA showed a mild
interest late. SPARK PLUG chased four to five wide in the backstretch, and was outrun.
