Footnotes
MAGIC MAN broke alertly and took command of the early lead, set quick fractions while well handled through the turn, shook free from a pressing rival
nearing mid-stretch and edged away late. BLAZING JAMIE rated off of the early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, rallied in the drive and could
not reel in the winner late but was best of the rest. I CAN'T HEAR YOU showed early speed and contested the quick pace, could not match strides with the
winner in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong, while holding safely for third. PARTY FOUL hopped at the start and was green leaving the gate,
recovered to chase the pace to the turn, came in tight while a bit hard to place along the turn, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and gave way late.
MANY AMBITIONS chased from the rear to the turn, improved position three wide nearing the quarter pole but was not a late factor. VIVA LEON JODIDO
chased the quick early pace, lost position four wide on the turn and was unable to threaten in the lane.

Footnotes
KODIACTION was off a bit slowly when crowded at the start, was unhurried through the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid in upper stretch,
confronted DESERT DUDE in deep stretch and gamely found more in the final strides to prevail. DESERT DUDE settled off of the early pace, was steered
outside of rivals into the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, took command into the drive, was confronted by KODIACTION inside of the
sixteenth-marker, met that bid but was bested in the final strides and held for second. VANTAGE POINT was sandwiched at the start and was off a step
slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed through the first turn, saved ground to the second turn, came in tight and lacked room nearing the top of the lane,
found room nearing mid-stretch but was outfinished by the top pair in the end and was well clear of the rest for third. KOWBOYKABIN broke in at the start
and crowded VANTAGE POINT leaving the break, was sent to the early lead, set contested fractions to the second turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and
gave way in the late going. CAT GAMER came three wide into the first turn while just off of the pace, advanced on the backstretch run to press the pace to
the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

FULL OF LUCK (CHI) slightly stumbled leaving the break and was hustled to the early lead, was well rated through the backstretch run while setting
moderate fractions, held foes at bay through the lane and determinedly prevailed in a game effort. J T'S WATCH settled off of the early pace while never far
back, saved ground to the second turn, angled out in upper stretch, mounted a three wide rally in the final furlong, came within aim in the final strides but
could not get to the determined winner and was up for second at the end. SENSEMAKER showed early speed and tracked FULL OF LUCK in the early
going, advanced on the backstretch run and pressed that leader to the quarter marker, battled with the winner to deep stretch and was outfinished late,
while just being edged for second. DR. HOFFMAN was unhurried early on, maintained a two wide path into the second turn, advanced along the rail in
mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final stages.

Footnotes
PRINCE ABU DHABI raced in mid-pack to the turn, gained ground two wide nearing the quarter marker, was well placed into upper stretch, came within aim
inside of the furlong grounds, quickly overtook ZHIVAGO nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew away late in a good debut. ZHIVAGO was away alertly and
was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions while well handled through the turn, drew clear in mid-stretch, was overtaken in deep stretch but stayed on to
be second best. MATT'S MONSTER lacked early speed, slipped to the inside on the turn, loomed in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and just
held for third. PACIFIC STATES chased the quick pace to the turn, maintained position while two then three wide through the bend, swung five wide into the
stretch run, gained ground in the final furlong and just missed for third in the end. ITS THIEVERY was off slowly and spotted the field leaving the break, was
unhurried in the early stages, improved position in upper stretch and showed late interest in the final sixteenth. RAJI lacked early speed, came five wide
through the turn and offered a mild late rally. SLEW'S JOY chased the pace from the inside, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain
that run in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. TRINIDAD chased the quick early pace three wide, lost ground leaving the turn and tired in the
stretch run. WART was away in good order and took back off of the early speed, lost position on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and gave way in
the final stages.

Footnotes
DESCARTES was shuffled leaving the break and spotted the field early on, chased from the rear to the turn, saved ground through the bend, was roused
three wide at the top of the stretch, closed fast in mid-stretch, overtook LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS in the late stages and drew clear in the end.
LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS broke alertly and showed early speed to get to the front, was pressed to the turn, shook free and drew to a clear lead approaching
the top of the lane, felt pressure from the winner in mid-stretch, was overtaken by DESCARTES in the late stages and held well in the end to be best of the
rest. MEET THE SHERIFF took back off of the fast early pace, gained ground two wide on the turn, continued that advance into upper stretch, could not
match strides with the top pair in the drive and was outkicked, while holding safely for third. MORE BUBBLY settled off of the fast early pace, lost ground
three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally. LOVE MY JIMMY showed early speed and pressed the pace to the
turn, steadied in tight quarters leaving the three-furlong marker and lost position nearing the top of the lane, chased the leaders into the drive and faded in
the final stages.

Footnotes
EARLY RELEASE broke alertly and took command of the early pace, was engaged by PIPER'S CAUSEWAY midway through the turn, set quick fractions to
mid-stretch while battling with that foe, repelled the runner-up in deep stretch and pulled away late. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY took back off of the early pace,
was sent after EARLY RELEASE entering the turn, dueled with that rival to mid-stretch, was turned away in the late stages and stayed on in the end to be
well clear of the rest for second. RUSSELL was off slowly and lagged in the early stages, chased two wide through the turn, was no match for the top pair in
the late going but finished well to be clear for third. MADAME GAZELLE showed early speed, stalked the quick pace from the inside through the turn, lost
ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. OAKDALE ROAD chased the quick early pace, came two wide through the turn, was outkicked in
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. A BIT MUCH bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, stalked the pace from mid-pack, lost ground three
wide on the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and faded in the drive. BIG DIFFERENCE broke in at the start, chased the early pace, lost position
two wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
GARDEES WORLD was a bit slow into early stride and settled off of the quick early pace, saved ground through the turn, maintained a rail trip through
mid-stretch, shifted out nearing the sixteenth-marker, surged in deep stretch and edged away in the final strides. BOLD MISTRESS exchanged bumps with
MIA SOLINA at the start but recovered to be forwardly placed early on, gained ground along the rail on the turn, lacked room and waited nearing the top of
the stretch, was outkicked in the drive but kept on to get up in the final strides for second. JAYCEE showed early speed and stalked the pace three wide into
the turn, advanced to confront LADY BRETT and battled with the pacesetter to mid-stretch, came within aim in the final furlong and was outfinished, while
holding safely in the end for third. LADY BRETT broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn, battled with JAYCEE into
mid-stretch, could not hold off rallying foes late and weakened in the final stages. AUSTRIAN NAVY was a bit slow into early stride, chased the early pace,
came three wide between rivals on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, drifted out in the final sixteenth, carried out ALL and did not offer a late rally. ALL was
shuffled back at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the pace four wide, improved position nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was
carried out in deep stretch and did not produce a late response. MIA SOLINA bumped with BOLD MISTRESS leaving the start, chased the pace to the turn,
lost action nearing the quarter pole, was pulled up in upper stretch and was vanned off.
