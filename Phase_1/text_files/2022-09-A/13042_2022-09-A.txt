FLAT BILL In hand along the rail, eased out in the lane, asked, gained to take the lead and was going away. DUCK POND ROAD Tracked along the rail,
challenged inside, kicked clear in the lane, was collared and finished second best. GRIT AND GLORY Away well, set the pace along the two path, was
collared at the top of the lane, chased and weakened. COX'S LEDGE In hand along the two path, continued on that path around the last turn, lodged a bid
and hung. MARBLE MOON Unhurried four wide, three path on the last turn, angled wide and lacked a rally. SLEEPY JOE Unhurried along the three path,
five wide on the last turn, was not a factor. UNION BANKS Tracked along the three path to the lane and weakened. FULLFAITHANDCREDIT Four wide on
the turns and tired. ARMANDO'S TEAM In hand four wide, continued four wide on the last turn while dropped back and then was eased over the wire. REAL
