WROTE IN STONE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and held under steady pressure.
SEASIDE BOY allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, then made a steady gain and closed well for the
place. GOLDEN SURVIVOR tracked the pace, angled out to come three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain, drifted out late and weakened.
MARK THE MOOSE unhurried, looped three wide through the turn, bumped a rival four wide into the stretch and evened out. JOYFUL CANDY well placed
and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, then was bumped and evened out. HOFBURG PALACE well placed and between, lost some
ground on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
FUEL THE BERN well placed and outside, gained position three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
drove clear late. BUGLE BARRY unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, steadied at the
furlong marker for racing room, then lacked the needed late kick and edged up for the place. BEAR CREEK set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid
into the stretch, then drifted in slightly and weakened late, holding the show. CITY PLAN stalked the pace on the outside, drifted out four wide into the
stretch and evened out. STEVIS MAN tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.
CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT was no factor. GUACO was never involved.

Footnotes
INCITATUS hopped slightly at the start, moved up while angling out through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear
late. C C'S KITTEN vied for the early lead on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, then dueled in the stretch with EAGLES PALACE
came again and edged ahead, then was no match for the winner and held the place. EAGLES PALACE well placed and outside, gained a striking position
three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then dueled with CC'S KITTEN and
weakened. SCIENCE TO WIN set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, angled out late for racing room and held a share.
TITHED tracked the pace pulling, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for racing room and flattened out.
BAHAMIAN PARK improved his position, widest. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL ran evenly for a half and had no rally. HOUSE LIGHTS was no factor.
