Footnotes
PRINCEDREAMCESS broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin into the turn, drifted out racing past the three sixteenth marker
while crossing the path of TAKING CHARGE DESI but maintained a clear advantage under firm encouragement. The latter tracked the pacesetter inside a
rival in second flight shifting a bit off the inside racing to the turn, moved to close the gap looming outside the eventual winner nearing upper stretch, lost her
path momentarily entering the lane and flattened out late. MAZI tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out entering the
stretch and prevailed for a share between foes late. USA USA USA settled last in early stages, raced three wide into the stretch but made no impact. NINE
CROWNS tracked the pacesetter as part of the second flight outside a rival to the turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CANTERBURY GOLD broke outwards brushing MOM'S PASS, was quickly righted to go clear while angling nearer to the inside racing into the first turn, set
the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, turned back a rival's challenge nearing upper stretch and went clear again in the drive under firm encouragement.
SHE'S XTREMELY HOT settled into stride racing to the first turn, switched outside foes entering the backstretch commencing a steady advance, moved to
challenge the eventual winner nearing upper stretch but proved no match in the drive. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second
flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and weakened into the stretch. PIPPA'S PROSPECT tracked the pacesetter between foes in
second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. MAIDEN ROCK proved no factor. MOM'S PASS, brushed at the start, raced three deep
to the first turn tracking off the second flight and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SCATAMARAN broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace on a clear margin into the turn, then held sway to the end a bit off the rail while being kept to
stout encouragement. TOTAL SURPRISE tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and
continued willingly to close the gap inside the winner nearing the wire. PROTONIC AND GIN was rated off the second flight in the opening stages, shifted
four wide racing into the turn and continued with a steady effort while being just outkicked for second. WYNN TRIP ducked out at the start brushing
WARBURN, was righted to track the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing into the turn, then weakened between foes in the drive. IMAGINE
DRAYGON tracked off the second flight five wide on the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the turn and continued evenly into the lane. RED'S MR Z
made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes but gave way early. WARBURN stumbled at the start, while being brushed, dropped well off the leaders and
never gained contention. BLUES TRAFFIC was off slowly and trailed the field to the stretch. BORDERLINEOUTALINE was a brief factor four wide in early
stages and emptied out racing into the turn.

Footnotes
ROZEY CHEEKS was rated stalking the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, swung out to the four path racing into upper stretch rallied smartly to
wrest the advantage in time under strong handling. APART OF MY CHARM was urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset into the backstretch,
shook clear midway through the far turn, tipped out racing through the stretch but couldn't fend off the winner. DISTORTED VIEW was rated off the first
flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide on the far turn steadily advancing on the leader in tandem with the eventual winner into
upper stretch but was forced to alter course to the inside when losing his path nearing the sixteenth marker and was just outkicked for second. COME ON
SWEET PEA, reserved while angling to the inside, saved ground gaining position into upper stretch, steadied off a tiring foe, then altered course midstretch
but continued with interest to gain some position. IMMINENT THREAT settled last racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes entering the stretch and
gained some position while making no impression. APPRECIABLE, urged along three deep racing to the first turn to gain terms with the leaders, angled
inside on the backstretch tracking just off the foes into the far turn and gave way into the lane. PLUMA was urged between foes pressing the pace, then
outside a rival for five furlongs and gave way racing through the far turn.

Footnotes
THICK HAZE was rated off the leaders racing into the first turn, angled to the rail to track just behind the pacesetter to the backstretch, saved ground to
upper stretch, tipped out entering the lane and responded to stout pressure to wrest the advantage in time. MR. WHO came through some traffic at the
break, was urged between foes to gain a narrow advantage racing to the first turn, angled to the rail nearing the backstretch setting the pace on a narrow
advantage, maintained that margin through the far turn into the lane under pressure but was collared late. PERFECT WAGER tracked off the first flight
inside rivals in the opening stages, tipped out entering the backstretch to race between foes to the far turn, angled inside entering the stretch and continued
well enough to prevail for a share. PALACE PRINCE, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pace, switched outside the leader to prompt the issue
between foes racing into the far turn and flattened in the drive. VIOLIN MAKER shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, settled in the last flight along the
inside to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into the lane and made an effort to gain some position late. HECOULDGOALLTHEWAY, forwardly
placed three deep from the outset to the backstretch, continued in pursuit in that path to the far turn and gave way. UNBROKEN SONG, caught in close
quarters at the start, settled between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted in nearing the lane but offered no rally. ALLEYCAT settled outside foes in the
last flight racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and proved no threat. THORN HILL CAT, reserved off the first flight outside
a rival in early stages, angled to the inside after a half and emptied out early.

MISS DUTTON was rated off the first flight four wide on the backstretch, shifted inwards on the bend, swung out four wide entering upper stretch, then took
over and went clear under pressure. GRANDIOSE SUMMER settled into stride off the inside, angled outside foes entering upper stretch and proved best of
the others. ROSEHILL ROAD, in touch with the leaders three wide prompting the pace into the turn, inherited the lead momentarily while steadying off U SO
MONEY BABY entering upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. FINAL TABLE settled last to the turn and passed only tiring rivals. ZEE PERFECT
RUN, urged inside foes prompting the pace, gave way nearing the lane. U SO MONEY BABY, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset,
edged clear racing through the turn, then bolted to the outside entering upper stretch and was taken up through the last furlong.

Footnotes
TAPIT SAM broke readily, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace in the opening stages, shook clear racing into the bend and held sway to the end
under firm encouragement. SUMMER SWINGER, in touch prompting the pacesetter in early stages, eased off that foe to track the leader between rivals into
the bend, then continued willingly to late stages to prevail narrowly for the place honors. STILLWATER BROWN, urged four wide pursuing the leaders into
the turn, continued three deep into the lane and just missed for second. SMART OXIE vied briefly three wide between foes in early stages, shifted to the
inside entering the turn but had no final kick. SKATS WILDCAT settled last while switching off the inside racing through the backstretch and never gained
contention. BURN BOSS angled to the inside early and proved no factor.
