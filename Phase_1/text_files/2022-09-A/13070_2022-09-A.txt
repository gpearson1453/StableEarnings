Footnotes
BURNING BUSH bumped at the start, vied for the lead between rivals from the beginning, was crowded into the bend, two wide through the turn, began to
gradually drift out in the lane, jostled with MARQUEE COWBOY a couple times upper stretch, fought between rivals while still slowly getting out and edged
ahead as she crowded the latter near the wire. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC moved up quickly from inside to dispute the pace, battled in the stretch, began to drift
out inside the last furlong and was outfinished in a game effort. MARQUEE COWBOY advanced from outside to vie for the early lead, was three wide
through the turn, jostled by BURNING BUSH several times upper stretch and dueled for the advantage as she was gradually forced out and crowded again
by BURNING BUSH near the wire. LEA'S DREAMER raced in contention just off the inside on the backstretch, did not keep up while along the rail on the
turn and lacked a rally in the lane. WHITE CASHEL was caught in tight quarters as she vied for the lead between horses into the turn, shuffled back with
three furlongs to go, angled out to path four and gradually wore down for the stretch run. BEE A WINNER broke outward, bumping BURNING BUSH,
displayed early speed between rivals but began to yield after a quarter mile. The rider of MARQUEE COWBOY lodged an objection claiming interference
from BURNING BUSH in the stretch. After their review, the stewards disqualified BURNING BUSH and placed her third.

LITTLE MIGHTY MAN rated from inside on the backstretch, moved clear when allowed on the bend, widened command under a drive upper stretch then
continued to pull away from the rest while ridden out the last eighth. DANG IT CASSIE advanced from inside on the turn and moved clear for second deep
stretch. D'ARCHER was hustled to vie for the lead outside LITTLE MIGHTY MAN, did not keep up on the bend, fanned to path three for the drive, drifted out
under left-handed pressure inside the last eighth and gradually yielded. RIPE ATTACK was jostled by WILD WES midway on the backstretch as he
prompted the early pace, vied for second three wide on the turn, began to weaken midstretch and was altered out when D'ARCHER came out inside the
final furlong. HELLOFAGUY was soon well back, angled in on the bend, swung back out for the stretch run and had little to offer. WILD WES gradually
angled in as he helped prompt the pace, jostled with RIPE ATTACK midway on the backstretch, faded from outside on the turn, angled in approaching the
end of a half mile and continued to give way.

JULIAISON forwardly placed between horses on the backstretch, gained a clear path along the rail leaving the bend, moved ahead approaching the final
sixteenth and held off GIRL NAMED PATSY under steady handling. GIRL NAMED PATSY pressed the pace from outside, was three wide on the turn,
fanned out further for the drive, rallied belatedly but caught MIND YOUR OWN for second. MIND YOUR OWN shared the early lead from inside, moved
ahead on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path inside the last furlong but did not have enough left.
ENGLISH was hustled to contest the pace outside MIND YOUR OWN, did not stay with that one on the turn, angled in some when the latter came out upper
stretch and continued to slowly yield.

KIANA'S LOVE gradually progressed from between rivals to engage APOLLO U ANYWHERE after a quarter mile, moved clear on the turn, was put to a
drive in the lane and drew away as much the best. APOLLO U ANYWHERE was hustled to a clear early lead, challenged from outside after two furlongs,
did not stay with KIANA'S LOVE on the bend, was no match for the latter when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for second. G CITY WARRIOR
chased from midpack just off the inside, moved clear for third upper stretch then could only just hold her position late. TWO MORE TIMES chased while
toward the outside, improved position three wide on the bend then lacked a significant stretch bid. ARCHIE'S GIRL void of speed from outside, angled in
entering the turn, moved out widest upper stretch and had little to offer.

Footnotes
BLEEDING BLUE shared the early lead just off the inside, moved clear after two furlongs, gradually drifted out under nearly all hand urging in the lane but
was clearly best of the rest. WAVE THE GOLD prominent from inside, did not keep up on the bend, moved clear for second upper stretch and finished
evenly. THACKER FROMM was hustled along early, two wide on the bend, fanned outside BLEEDING BLUE entering the lane and leveled off. A P
BLAZING GREEN forwardly placed from outside, lost ground widest through the turn, angled in midstretch and had no late bid. WILLIE ATTACK fractious in
the gate, displayed early speed between horses, began to retreat three wide on the bend, shortened his stride into the lane, was allowed to coast while kept
in hand the rest of the way and walked off.

Footnotes
LOCAMOTOR prominent from inside, altered outside for a clear path after two furlongs, vied for the lead four wide on the turn, angled in some leaving the
bend, lugged in some midstretch, moved clear inside the last furlong and held sway under steady handling. PALACE KITTEN vied for the lead between
rivals, was two wide on the bend, gained the rail leaving the turn, did not stay with LOCAMOTOR inside the furlong marker, was checked hard, angled
outside the latter inside the final sixteenth and maintained his hold on second. CREEKMORE disputed the pace from outside, was three wide on the turn,
began to yield from between horses upper stretch, angled out some for a clear path inside the last eighth, finished evenly but was easily best of the rest.
TURBINADO unruly in the gate, leaned inward when the gate opened, left many lengths behind the rest of the field, progressed from inside on the turn and
passed tired ones upper stretch. DAVID'S GEM displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up after a quarter mile, was checked when he lost his path
into the bend, altered out, came widest into the stretch and had little to offer. TAP'S BIG SHOT contested the pace between rivals, gained the rail into the
turn, began to yield before finishing four furlong, fanned out entering the lane and steadily faded. There was a stewards' inquiry into TURBINADO'S start
and the rider of PALACE KITTEN lodged an objection alleging interference from LOCAMOTOR inside the final furlong. After their review the stewards
determined that TURBINADO was prepared to break with the rest of the field but did not and the foul claim was not upheld.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY SCENT broke on top, was rated between rivals, went for the lead after two furlongs, moved clear on the bend, was under steady urging in the
lane, began to wear down in the late going but held on. COWGIRL FRANKIE dwelt at the start, was settled inside, angled out to advance on the turn, lost
considerable ground fanning six wide for the stretch run, made a strong move the last furlong, came up a bit short but caught TENSE for second. TENSE
pressed from outside, also went for the lead after a quarter mile, did not stay with HEAVENLY SCENT on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, steadily
closed the gap on the weakening leader in the waning yards but was too late. SHINE DOWN chased from inside, progressed on the turn, fanned out behind
TENSE entering the lane and rallied belatedly inside the latter deep stretch. MAZLAN chased from outside, angled in to be two wide on the turn, swung out
to path five for the stretch run and failed to have a significant bid. WILDWOOD DREAMER displayed early speed from inside, was overtaken into the bend,
angled outside TENSE upper stretch and continued to yield. FREEDOM ATTACK was away slowly, was never far off the inside and failed to menace.
LONGLIVEROCKNROLL chased from between rivals, faded from along the rail on the turn and did not respond to urging in the stretch. RESTLESS
REALITY also dwelt then left the gate awkwardly, was always outrun and allowed to coast through the lane.
