Footnotes
PAPI'S BABY GIRL was settled early on the inside, made a rail bid on the turn by the quarter pole, swung out three wide leaving the turn and made a bid in
the lane, finished nicely to edge clear under a mild drive. POLISHED GAL was reserved early, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and rallied well on the
outside. LUCKY LIZZIE was allowed to settle early, was on the inside by the quarter pole, angled out nearing the furlong marker and was gaining late.
LUCKY DAY DIVA dueled for the lead outside on the turn, then was between rivals by the furlong marker and faded. SUSIKIN dueled for the lead on the
inside and then had to check by the sixteenth pole when in tight, angled out and weakened. ZIPPY JO was fractious in the gate, chased the pace and was
between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. PARABLE stalked the pace four to three wide and then was empty. The rider on number five claimed foul
against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the race was left as is.

Footnotes
LEAVE 'EM LOADED set the pace on the inside, then was confronted at the half mile marker, then shook off that challenge leaving the five sixteenths, then
turned back another bid by the quarter pole and kicked clear by the furlong marker, then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best under a drive.
MY FRIEND FRANK was allowed to settle early on the inside, then shifted out and was coaxed along two wide on the turn, made a four wide bid nearing the
quarter pole, then finished willingly to the wire but needed more. BEACH TRAFFIC tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter
pole to loom boldly but flattened out in the lane. DEVOTED KITTEN was reserved early two to three wide, then came three wide into the lane and had no
kick. THE TRAIN was well placed on the inside throughout and faded. DIGGERS DIAMOND prompted the pace and went up to duel for the lead three wide
at the half mile marker and weakened in the drive. ALWAYS FORGIVEN chased the pace three to four wide and tired. SPINNING KITTEN was settled back
on the inside and failed to menace.

I SAY I PLAY set a pressured pace on the inside, then was in a long drive with PARLOR the final quarter of a mile and dug in gamely to prove best under a
drive. PARLOR was off a step slow, settled into stride early, made a three wide move on the turn to vie for command, then had a long drive with the winner
but was outfinished. TROUBLE COFFEE was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and was up for the show award. ABDAA was settled
early, came four wide into the drive and lacked the needed rally and just missed the show award. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER pressed the paced three to two
wide and weakened in the lane. PRETENDANT tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. TERRY'S CHARM was settled back on the inside and was
not a threat. SHADOW BOAT was three wide and stopped, bled and vanned off.

MIDNIGHT PARADE pressed the early pace three wide, then vied for the lead between horses on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn and quickly spurted
clear, then was given a couple right handed reminders while drawing off smartly to prove much the best, sharp. CONFIRMED STAR was a bit slow into
stride, then was outrun early, eased out on the turn and came seven wide into the lane, then rallied well on the outside to get the place award. HOT FUDGE
WARRIOR set a pressured pace on the inside, then vied for the lead on the turn and proved to be no match for the winner and lost the place award late.
ORGANIZED CHAOS was fractious in the gate, then hit the gate and broke in at the start, tracked the pace two wide behind the vying leaders on the turn,
tipped out three wide and was empty. SIDESWIPED chased the pace three to four wide on the turn and had no rally. ALL HAIL MO chased the pace three
wide and weakened. IOANNA was bumped at the start, tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. CIRCUITT was fractious in the gate, prompted the
pace four wide and then vied for the lead three wide on the turn and folded in the lane.

PEAKY BLINKERS was three wide into the first turn, settled early behind the fast pace, made a four wide move in hand on the turn, then drew off in the
furlong grounds under a couple left handed pops with the crop to prove much the best. KINSALER was washy pre race, prompted the pace three wide,
made a bid at the five sixteenths and gained a short lead by the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for the winner in the final furlong, clearly second
best. BEDAZZLING was outrun early and was not a factor, bested rest. THINKIN OUT LOUD set a fast pace on the inside and was headed at the five
sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
RUNNIN REDBIRD was away alertly, tracked the early pace between rivals, then was two wide on the turn, closed up the rail in the stretch to get up in time
under a drive. RAIN LILLY pressed the early pace on the inside, then let the pace setter go nearing the quarter pole, swung out leaving the turn and finished
willingly and surged late but was outfinished by the winner while getting the nod for the place award. KA KAW set a pressured pace three wide early, then
drew clear two wide on the turn, then remained clear by the furlong marker but got tired late and was caught in deep stretch to just fail. MS STRONG
HEART chased the pace five wide, then made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out. DUST BUNNY was outrun early and four wide despite being
ridden along, then was three wide on the turn and was not a threat. NUMERATOR tracked the pace on the inside and stopped, eased late, walked off.
