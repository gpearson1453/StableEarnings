Footnotes
DUNEDIN raced off the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn, moved up to split rivals nearing the eighth pole while racing three wide and
finished strongly to prove best under strong handling. ROMAN GIANT was allowed to settle early on, raced from the outside in the stretch run and closed
belatedly to the wire. WICO (IRE) stalked the pace, raced five wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. MO STASH dueled for the early
lead from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. RITHM NIC stalked the dueling pair down the backstretch, raced three deep near the five
sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive. ANGEL OF EMPIRE dropped back off the early pace and failed to respond. OCEAN POINTE broke slowly,
raced near the inside in stretch run and never threatened. KBCYA LATER dueled to the outside of rival and gave way the final quarter of a mile.

Footnotes
STELLAR LADY tracked the top pair down the backstretch, raced five wide near the quarter pole, dug in late and got up under strong handling. BOLTORO
rated in the early stages, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire to just miss. STAY LOST settled off the early going,
moved up from the outside in the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. MENDED WE STAND pressed the early leader from the outside while racing
two wide and weakened a bit in the final stages. METAPHYSICAL ran off a quarter of a mile pre-race, quick to begin to set the pace fro the inside and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. NOBLE BERNADETTE settled off the early going, raced three to four wide in the drive and had not enough. DON'T GO
CHANGING settled to the middle of the pack early, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a rally. TIGER TAP dropped
back early, raced five wide near the quarter pole and lacked a bid. DASHYNS DREAM was slow early on, raced near the inside around the far turn,
experienced traffic nearing the quarter pole and had no late rally. WET PAINT settled off the early pace, raced three deep near the five sixteenths pole and
never threatened. PERFECT ROSE dropped to the back of the pack, was getting out through the stretch, angled back in late after racing very wide in the
drive. LOOKS LOVELY stalked the pace from the inside and tired.

willingly to the wire. REWARD NIGHT tracked the top pair while racing three wide, ridden along nearing the five sixteenths pole, led narrowly near the eighth
pole and was outfinished late. WAKE SURF tracked the early leader racing two deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ROUGHIN THE CITY stalked
the pace, raced three to four wide in the drive and had no final winning bid. PENNER ASH (IRE) stalked the pace, raced five wide near the quarter pole and
lacked a rally. MR. TIP settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. HAPPY BOY ROCKET was
unhurried early, raced four wide through the far turn and never threatened. A LATE ONE was sent along to set the early pace and gave way. DEEP STATE

PERSONAL BEST rated along off the top pair in the early stages, pulling hard nearing the five sixteenths pole, asked near the quarter pole, drew off to be
well clear under steady handling and raced in hand in the final stages. FIVE PRIZES settled to the middle of the pack, moved up five wide near the quarter
pole but was no match for the winner in the drive. QUALITY STAR was unhurried early, moved up three wide through the far turn and improved position
late. MISSONI stalked the pace, raced along the inside through the far turn and weakened a bid the final eighth of a mile. DREAM FLY was slow early on,
made an advance through the far turn, angled widest through the stretch run and made a good late gain. SEIVER was unhurried early, ridden along near the
three eighths pole, raced from the outside in the stretch run and had not enough. SUFFICE stalked the pace, raced two wide passing three eighths pole,
raced three to four wide in the stretch run and raced evenly late. SOLIDARITY showed good early foot from the inside and weakened through the drive.
AZAMANA EMPIRE was quick to begin from the outside, showed good early foot racing two deep from the outside of rival and gave way in the stretch run.
D'ORO FOREVER dropped back early and failed to respond. PARIS KENTUCKY raced in tight quarters in the early going, settled off the pace and never
threatened.
