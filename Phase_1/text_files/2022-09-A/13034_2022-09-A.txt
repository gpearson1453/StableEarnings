drifted out through the lane and could not hold off the winner. CANOOCHEE lacked speed racing very wide and was easily third best. TOWSON angled out
before half a mile and lacked a rally. HOLA PRINCESS dropped well behind and trailed throughout.

A DANGEROUS GUY settled behind wall of dueling leaders, swung wide into the stretch, offered a late surge to get up in time. BAAGY forced the pace
outside, took over at the quarter pole, moved clear but was caught. SPIKEZONE was urged close up three wide to the stretch and continued willingly.
WIZKY'S ON THE BAY battled between rivals to near the quarter pole and tired. BLACK LIGHT hustled close up inside to the stretch and weakened.
PRIVATE SECTOR broke slowest, raced far behind then narrowed the gap. ON OUR WAY BOYZ hustled to slight advantage then proved empty in the
stretch. JEST ABOVE dropped back early and was always outrun.

without
menacing.
ONLYGODCANJUDGEME dropped off the pace outside and lacked a solid rally. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT dropped well behind and was never in
contention. MY GAL VAL was urged close up briefly then gave way. TORPEDO RUN prompted the pace for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
DR ZRADA saved ground throughout, rallied into the stretch then quickly drew away under moderate coaxing. STREET TAIL hustled to the front in the two
path, moved clear briefly on the turn then weakened while holding the place. CONQUISTADOR forced the pace inside, angled outside on the turn and
finished willingly. EXTREME FORCE chased very wide throughout and showed some late energy. WILD UNION dropped back early and was never a factor.
GONE INZANE was urged just off the pace outside, faded on the turn and moved wide in the stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ROMA settled behind the dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch then edged past the pacesetter in a long drive. LITTLEBITAMEDAL vied
along the inside, was collared again in the stretch and held no gamely. WEEKEND IN COURT lagged far behind throughout then closed gap while no threat.
SAMARONTI dropped back early, advanced outside, moved very wide in the stretch. PETULANT DELIGHT alternated for the advantage outside then was
finished by the quarter pole. WAGON BOSS prompted the pace three wide for five furlongs and faltered. OPEN LENGTHS lacked speed and weakened
steadily.
