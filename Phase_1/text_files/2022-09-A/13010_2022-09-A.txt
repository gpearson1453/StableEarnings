Footnotes
HOT JOURNEY was allowed to settle early on, saved ground through the backstretch run, was roused along the far turn, tipped out two wide into upper
stretch, confronted LET THERE BE PEACE nearing the furlong marker, quickly overtook that rival and kicked clear late. LET THERE BE PEACE was sent
to the early lead after an alert beginning, drew to a clear lead on the second turn while setting moderate fractions, was confronted by HOT JOURNEY in
mid-stretch, could not hold off the winner's bid and was overtaken in the late stages while well clear of the rest for second. TEN THOUSAND STEPS
attended to the moderate pace, advanced on the backstretch run, could not match strides on the second turn, faded in the stretch run and just held for third
in the final strides. OBJECTIVLYPERFECT stalked the moderate pace from a ground saving position through the backstretch run, could not keep pace on
the far turn, gave way in the stretch and just missed for third in the end. GROSS PROFIT broke in leaving the break, settled two wide off of the pace, lost
contact in upper stretch and was empty in the late stages.

A DIME FOR ME took back off of the quick early pace and tracked the pacesetter to the turn, overtook TONI TWO POCKET nearing the quarter marker,
extended the lead in mid-stretch and drew away late under a firm hand ride. JAN JAN CAN was off a bit slowly and settled off of the solid early pace, saved
ground through the turn, rallied two wide in upper stretch, was outkicked in the late stages but stayed on and was up for second in the final strides.
MAYCEE JO was forwardly placed early on, raced two wide between runners through the turn, gave way in the drive, was just edged for second in the final
strides and was clear of the rest for third. ST. ANNIE'S INDY rated off of the early pace, gained ground outside of rivals on the turn, could not sustain that
run while four wide into upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. TONI TWO POCKET was away in good order and was sent to the early lead, set
quick fractions while tracked by the winner through the turn, could not hold off A DIME FOR ME leaving the turn, chased that rival into upper stretch and

ground two wide along the second turn, closed three deep in upper stretch, came within aim inside of the furlong marker, overtook UNION DANCE in deep
stretch and inched away late. UNION DANCE stalked the early pace from a two wide path, slipped to the inside on the far turn and took the lead nearing the

(IRE) was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, swung widest into the drive, mounted a six wide rally in the stretch run, found his
best stride late and just missed for second at the end, while well clear of the rest for third. NOLDE was asked to show early speed and was sent to the early
lead, set fast fractions while prompted by MOHAWK KING through the backstretch run, was overtaken by UNION DANCE nearing the quarter marker,
chased the leaders to mid-stretch and faded late. MOHAWK KING (IRE) broke alertly and was forwardly placed, pressed the fast pace through the

TIGER QUEEN broke in good order and took back off of the quick early pace, tracked the pace through the turn, came within aim nearing mid-stretch,
overtook the pacesetter leaving the furlong marker and made a late push to edge away in the end. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN rated off of the fast early pace,
gained ground three wide on the turn, continued that bid into upper stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final sixteenth but kept on to be second
best. TWILIGHT EMPIRE chased the fast early pace from the rear, came two wide to the quarter marker, gained ground in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the
late going but stayed on to secure the show. CRYSTAL PROOF broke alertly and showed good early speed, set fast fractions through the turn, was all out
to hold off the winner in mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. LA AGUILILLA was shuffled back soon after the break and chased the fast pace to
the turn, gained ground along the inside on the bend, could not sustain that run in the final furlong and flattened out in the late stages.

Footnotes
LIL MIRACLE MAN broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was engaged by STONE'S RIVER along the first turn, dictated terms with that rival through
the backstretch run, lost ground to that one heading into the second turn, re-engaged along the far turn, gamely dueled into upper stretch and through the
lane and determinedly prevailed at the end. STONE'S RIVER was away in good order and rated just off of the early pace, advanced to confront LIL
MIRACLE MAN leaving the first turn, took a narrow edge from that foe heading into the far turn, was headed again by that rival nearing the quarter marker,
dueled the length of the stretch and was gamely bested at the end, while well clear of the rest for second. RIMPROTECTOR was unhurried early on, saved
ground through the backstretch run, gained ground two to three wide in upper stretch, was no match for the top pair in the late stages but rallied to get up for
third in the final strides. YOU KIDDING ME was allowed to settle, gained ground three wide on the second turn, was outkicked in the drive and was just
edged for third in the final strides. BARHOPSKY stalked the pace from the inside, lost position on the far turn and lacked a late rally.
MAGICISTHEMOONLITE was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground nearing the quarter marker,
chased the leaders in upper stretch and faded in the final stages. SALTO DE TIGRE settled off of the early pace, saved ground to the second turn and was
not a late factor.

Footnotes
HOW ABOUT A FRESCA settled off of the early pace, came two wide to the quarter marker while near the rear, improved position in mid-stretch, made a
quick move nearing the sixteenth-marker, split rivals in deep stretch and kicked clear in the final stages in a good debut. DANZIGS STAR STORM broke in
at the start and was off a step slowly, was hustled to show early speed, advanced on the turn while along the inside, vied for the lead to mid-stretch, could
not match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth and was outfinished but saved second in the final strides. THE COMRIE RULE was hard to load,
showed early speed and disputed the pace to the turn, raced two wide between rivals through the turn, vied for the lead nearing the top of the lane,
continued to battle for the lead into mid-stretch, was outkicked in the late stages and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. LILY PAD LAKE
chased the moderate early pace from midpack, came two wide to the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, gained ground nearing the eighth
pole but did not offer the needed late response. WESTERN TOWN broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, set contested fractions to the
quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. PRAY FOR SNOW broke alertly and vied for the early lead, steadied
nearing the turn and lost position into the bend, swung four wide nearing the quarter marker, came six wide into upper stretch and faded in the late going.
FEVER showed early speed and tracked the pace to the turn, lost position five wide on the turn, came six to seven wide in upper stretch and tired in the final
stages. SILVER PERSUASION lacked early speed, came three wide along the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
I'MGONNABESOMEBODY broke alertly and took command of the early pace, was prompted through the backstretch run by JIMMY BLUE JEANS while
setting moderate fractions, was headed by that rival on the far turn, took a narrow advantage into mid-stretch, gamely held the runner-up at bay in the final
sixteenth and determinedly prevailed in the end. JIMMY BLUE JEANS was off a half-step slowly leaving the break but recovered to be prominent in the early
stages, attended to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, headed I'MGONNABESOMEBODY nearing the quarter marker, battled with that game
rival to mid-stretch, could not get by in the final stages and was turned away in the end, while besting the rest. ME AND MR. C rated off of the moderate
early pace while in mid-pack, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained that three wide path to the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch,
re-rallied in the final sixteenth and finished well to secure third in the end. HARMON settled off of the early pace, advanced position nearing the second turn,
continued that bid into upper stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and was just edged for third in the final strides. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) was
unhurried in the early going, improved position outside of rivals on the backstretch run, lost position four wide on the far turn, came five wide into upper
stretch and did not mount a late rally. HUGE BIGLY raced close to the early pace, steadied slightly heading into the first turn, stalked the pace to the second
turn, chased the leaders in upper stretch and faded in the late stages. GOVENOR'S PARTY was allowed to settle, came three wide through the first turn,
lost position along the backstretch run, made a mild late rally in the drive but was not a factor. AMERICAN FARMER settled off of the moderate pace while
never far back, raced just off of the rail into the second turn and did not offer late response. OUR SILVER OAK was forwardly placed in the early stages,
came in tight along the first turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch run and into the far turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and gave way in the final
stages.

Footnotes
BETT ON BLAZE was bumped by UNION GIG after the break, quickly took the early lead, rated kindly while setting comfortable fractions, fended off a pair
of challengers coming out of the far turn, easily put them away and cruised to the wire under a steady hand ride as the rider never uncorked the crop.
UNION GIG broke out and bumped BETT ON BLAZE at the break, straightened, then hustled up to track the pacesetter, moved up to press the issue
heading into the turn, made a strong bid for the lead at the top of the stretch, had that bid repelled but continued on well to garner the place. BOSS OF
THEMOSS unable to keep up early, forced to steady just past the five furlong marker when GOOD FOCUS took his path, then steadied slightly once again
near the three furlong pole, continued on with some interest but was never a threat to the top pair. GOOD FOCUS broke best but ceded the lead to BETT
ON BLAZE, held the inside position to the turn, swung to the outside and launched a bid widest of all approaching the quarter pole but flattened out in the
late stages and was just nabbed for third in the final strides.
