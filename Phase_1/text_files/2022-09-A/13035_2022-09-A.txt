Footnotes
ROBBY'S RANSOM rushed up outside into the turn, gained position four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and
drew off late. SHOOT YOUR CUFFS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then lacked the needed
late kick and held the place. COMMODORE BARRY well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
angled out and closed for the show. PURE SPRING allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and edged
up for a share. PAID THE PREACHER rated close up and between, steadied on heels into the turn, loosing ground, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and weakened the final furlong. QPIDSCARIZMATKQTEE never far back, lost some ground three and four wide through the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and weakened. KEYSTONE HANK broke awkwardly from the gate and lost his path, then passed tiring rivals in the lane. LEONARD'S
LEGACY set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then faded the final furlong. MORE RANSOM stalked the pace on the outside and faded
on the two path through the turn.

Footnotes
FARAT well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. CORAL LEGACY rated
inside, moved up to gain the lead into the second turn, shook clear through the turn, then was no match for the winner in the late going and held the place.
LAKE NAKURU mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came five and six wide into the stretch, drifted in and edged up for the show.
PAUPING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, evened out and gained a share. NO TIME TO
YAWN mid pack, gained position on the two path through the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. K. K.
ICHIKAWA unhurried in the early going, looped four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved his position. ALPHA
PREDATOR unhurried in the early going, looped four and five wide through the second turn, came six wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
ATLANTIC RULER hopped at the start, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out.
SNAKERATTLEANDROLL well placed and outside, moved up four wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally. KID CHOCOLATE passed tiring
rivals. FIGHTIN PHIL set the pace off the rail and faded through the second turn. BRYTON'S D J tracked the pace, angled out four wide into the second turn
and faded.
