a good effort. PRINCESS D'ORO off rail trip to the far turn, bid in the stretch but faltered la. TIZ PENNEY off tardy from the gate, far back to stretch, closed
gap late. STORMY NILE rushed to first turn, chased leader to the half, gave way readily. TAMI ANN stayed close throughout with no late kick when needed.

Footnotes
TIZ DEJA BLUE speed to the front inside, well handled, to hold sway at the wire. MONTEREY PENINSULA chased winner from the get go, roused in the
stretch too late. RUFFLED WATERS broke slow, rushed inside to the turn, ran on late, close the gap. ZIPPER ZAPPER chased top pair throughout, three
wide into steretch. YOUNEVERWALKALONE caused trouble at the start, ran on evenly from that point. WATERBOY bothered at the start, raced evenly
after a tenuous start. RUBINSTEIN off rail trip while never a real threat throughout. MISS SOVELIA bothered at the start, never menaced thereafter. KING'S
WARDEN broke terrible from the gate with no chance thereafter, trailed.
