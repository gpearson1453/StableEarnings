Footnotes
GREY SOCIETY hounded the early frontrunner throughout the turn, took control easily with a quarter to go, opened up in mid stretch to win comfortably
while being kept to the task to the wire. INTRO travelled mid pack on the rail in the early going, waited on the fence saving ground through the turn, angled
out in upper stretch to the four path at the furlong marker and finished up best of the rest to be a clear second. ISLAND BELLE settled near the back
travelling in the two path, angled out for clear run five off the rail turning for home and closed belatedly getting up for third. SHEZ A SEALY leapt up at the
start and trailed considerably after the break, was allowed to settle through the turn, caught up to the field in upper stretch and showed some grit finishing
with late interest to get a minor share. FIRE EMOJI took command after the start, was collared by outside rivals turning for home and weakened on the
fence with an eighth to go. FOREST VIXEN stalked the early pace outside racing three wide, loomed outside at the quarter pole, chased the winner until mid
stretch and faltered late.

Footnotes
WENTRU was forwardly-positioned between runners to the first turn then eased back content to track in behind two wide, came out near the quarter pole to
commence a rally, took the length of the stretch under strong urging to get up late. GOSPEL WAY set the pace inside on or just off the rail, was clear till late
stretch and caught. HIT THE POINT tucked in to save ground racing at the back, angled six wide leaving the far turn, ran on to get up for show. HELL BENT
was encouraged forward from the break, tracked along the inside mid-division, came out coming to the three-eighths, brushed with a rival lightly at that
juncture, went three then four wide on the far turn and asked for run at the quarter pole, ran on evenly. SUNRISE DRIVE stalked up close outside three
wide, steadily weakened. I'M DASHING raced toward the rear between rivals two to three wide early, went three wide into the far turn, floated seven wide
into upper stretch, failed to rally. CALL MY BANKER was caught three wide around the first turn outside rivals, was still toward the back four wide on the far
turn receiving a light brush into that bend, tired in the lane.

Footnotes
BANFF was allowed to settle at the back, started to rally splitting runners with a quarter to go, angled outwards in upper stretch six wide and was full of run
with an eighth to go drawing away in the end. LONG POND settled nicely mid pack between horses, quickly closed in on the frontrunner at the quarter pole
to lead in mid stretch, was pressed outside by the winner a furlong out and could not hold off the challenge while racing between foes the last eighth.
CRUDEN BAY stalked mid field racing three wide on the turn, angled to the seven path for the drive and finished up well closing with interest just missing
getting up for second money. PERFECT CRIME tracked just off the early pace, contested between runners for the lead two furlongs out, fought on with an
eighth to run and tired in deep stretch losing third at the wire. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) was away alertly to lead in the early stages, was collared by outside
rivals at the quarter pole, offered no resistance nearing the furlong marker and retreated. MUCHOKOVA rated kindly mid pack on the rail after the start, was
roused with three eighths to go inside, weakened mid stretch behind runners and had no finish.

Footnotes
FORESTER'S FORTUNE was in a bit tight between runners in the vanguard then eased back off the pace at the half content to track in behind racing off the
inside, steadied slightly and had to alter course to avoid a rival past the three-eighths, continued four to five wide on the turn, dug in to bid between rivals
and get up late. WEDGEWOOD settled off the pace outside, was forced four to five wide through the turn, was outside six deep in upper stretch and ran on
gamely for the place. ROCKCREST moved forward outside to force the pace four wide, came in entering the turn causing problems for inside rivals, was
clear late on the bend moving in to about the two path, clear also till late stretch but was outfinished. WARP RIDE prompted the pace from between runners
three wide, was forced in entering the turn, continued to chase and kept on in the stretch. MASON'S GAMBLE vied inside, was bumped into the rail at the
three-eighths, chased but had no extra for the drive. FOUR ACES HIGH settled toward the rear racing just off the fence, came out in late stretch. SILENT
POET vied between runners, was forced in at the three-eighths bumping a rival, stumbling and checking sharply, had nothing for the drive. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDER OF SILENT POET AGAINST BOTH WARP RIDE AND ROCKCREST AND THE
RIDER OF WEDGEWOOD AGAINST FORESTER'S FORTUNE, THE LATTER OBJECTION WAS NOT ALLOWED AND IN THE CASE OF THE FORMER,
ROCKCREST WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED LAST BEHIND SILENT POET FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN.

Footnotes
GLORIANNIA settled just outside stalking mid pack through the turn, rallied seven wide with clear run down the lane, took command with a furlong to go and
found her best stride late inching away at the finish. GAMBLING CAT stalked the early pace travelling three wide on the turn, contested for the lead two
furlongs out in the six path, poked her nose in front mid stretch, dueled with the winner outside of runners until the eighth pole and finished up well to be
second best. MO TOURING broke sharp to lead, was headed in upper stretch by numerous outside challengers, battled on showing some grit inside
through the lane and stubbornly held for third. DANCE RHYTHMS settled near the back in the beginning, trailed behind horses with a quarter to run, angled
out to be in the seven path in mid stretch and showed some late energy to pass tiring rivals nearing the finish. MARAIS saved ground in the early stages,
was asked while behind runners entering the stretch, could not find another gear and ran evenly to the finish. JILLI MARIE broke in and hit the gate at the
start to trail, offered a mild run inside through the turn and levelled out on the fence for the drive to the finish. DANCE WITH DESTINY tracked the early lead
just sitting off the pacesetter running two wide, bid for the lead turning for home between runners racing in the four path, began to weaken a furlong out and
faltered in deep stretch. LADYWEARSTHERING tracked the leader inside through the turn, angled out while ridden to go on in the three path at the top of
the stretch, offered little response, faltered and was not not persevered with late.

CURLIN CANDY tracked just behind the speed two off the fence from the start, angled out four wide with three sixteenths remaining for the stretch run and
finished up well to wear down the leader at the wire to win the photo by a nod. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL stalked three wide through the turn, roused four wide
outside of the frontrunners to bid in upper stretch, put away the inside rival running between horses at the furlong marker and was caught late at the wire
losing the bob. GAYELETTE tracked the leader through the turn, battled for the lead in the three path at the quarter pole, fought on in deep stretch and
finished up gamely on the fence in the late stages to lose in a three horse photo. QUALITY COLLECTION was slow into stride after the start, started show
interest turning for home, began to pick up rivals mid stretch and rallied between runners the last eighth to get a minor share. CATCH MAGIC broke sharp to
lead down the backstretch, was headed by runners outside with a quarter left to run and faltered at the furlong marker. LADY XI was positioned near the
rear in the early going, put in a mild rally with three eighths to go, could not find enough in mid stretch and stalled with an eighth to the finish. MARDENE
tracked the frontrunners on the rail into the far turn, steadied while inside midway through the turn, was shuffled back to near the rear turning for home and
could not get involved for the run to the wire. REES settled in mid pack racing four off the fence down the backside, was roused but lost ground to the field
through the turn and had nothing to offer through the stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEYS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 MARDENE ON #3 CURLIN

Footnotes
BIZYMALINE set the pace from off the inside racing in the two path, fended off a challenger leaving the far turn while drifting out a bit turning for home,
continued to drift just a bit and held under steady handling. SHE MAKES A POINT was forwardly-positioned early then eased back ceding the lead and
content to track inside, was close up coming past the quarter pole, shifted out when room materialized four wide at the top of the stretch, made a steady bid
late but missed. GAL WONDER (GB) brushed with a rival at the start, raced off the leader three wide early, took closer order to press about the half-mile
marker, edged closer to challenge for the lead on the far turn, drifted five wide into the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. VIVID VIXEN broke outwardly,
was in tight between runners into the first turn, settled in to stalk two to three wide, swung seven wide into the stretch, made no late bid. AMAZIN QUEEN
brushed with a rival at the start, was unhurried settling at the rear, advanced three to four wide on the far turn, floated six deep into upper stretch and
flattened out.

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA was allowed to settle after the break trailing the field, advanced up the fence midpoint on the turn, weaved his way through mid stretch and
found a clear path six wide at the eighth pole and got up late for the win. DRAGON'S BREW stalked behind the front flight travelling well, took command
rallying five wide in mid stretch, opened up mildly a furlong out and could not hold off the charge by the winner nearing the wire. TIMESKIP settled near the
back of the pack after the start, rallied between horses turning for home and angled out widest with an eighth to go closing well to be a solid third. CREATE
AGAIN tracked behind the pacesetters on the rail through the turn, was roused in upper stretch running behind foes, found room on the fence a furlong out
and showed interest late to get up for a small piece. SELFMADE rated just off the early speed, dueled for the lead outside of rivals at the top of the stretch
and could not find enough late running evenly to the finish. ANALYZER sat just off the early pace, engaged for the lead between runners turning for home
and levelled out in mid stretch to not factor at the finish. THOR'S ROCKET rated mid pack all alone through the turn, roused going seven wide in upper
stretch and had nothing to offer in late stages of the race. CORDUROY ROAD broke inwards starting, recovered to lead through the turn, was collared while
inside at the quarter pole and backed away through the field at the furlong marker. DESOLATOR was near the back after the start and never was involved
at any point. MAMBOINTHEFOREST settled behind most of the field in the beginning, was asked through the turn and had no response.
