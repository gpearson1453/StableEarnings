Footnotes
AMERICAREDWHITEBLU broke a bit slow, stalked three wide then outside the top pair, challenged those rivals with three furlong remaining, and cleared
nearing the quarter pole, moved in some and led two wide into the stretch, then drew off under strong handling and shown a left handed whip when drifting
in a bit. BRIGHT LEAF chased in the two path then angled out into the backstretch, traveled three deep to the second bend, moved down to the two path
briefly before returning to the three path, gave chase through the final furlong while unable to threaten the winner, jump the tracks in the final sixteenth and
was clearly second best. SOCAL RED was off slow from outside, trailed off the inside, angled five to six wide outside a rival on the far turn and was along
for the show. TISQUANTUM broke a step slow and lost his path, tracked three wide early, inched closer four deep on the backstretch, went four to five wide
into the stretch drifted out then back inward rand lacked a late bid. DURANTE sped to the front then dueled in the two path inside a rival, went head to head
to the second turn, was overtaken at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the winner into the stretch and weakened. MITICO stalked outside a rival, angled in on
the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch and lacked further response. MO THEM DOWN dueled for command three wide outside a rival, battled to the
five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up nearing the quarter pole and weakened. MIGHTY MATT stalked the pace on the inside, coaxed into the far turn,
drifted out around the bend and came up empty.

SMOKEM FOR YOU bobbled leaving the gate, rated on the inside behind the top pair, saved ground to the stretch, tipped outside the frontrunner at the
eight pole and overhauled the runner-up in the late stages. NIGHT PARTY lost footing at the start to come away a bit slow, recovered quickly and went up to
duel inside a rival for command, held a short lead around the bend then cleared leaving the turn, showed the way into the final furlong but got run down by
the winner late. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY chased early then ran up on heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground and traveled a bit off the rail into the
stretch, stayed on the fence through the drive and outkicked GOLDEN AGAIN for the show. GOLDEN AGAIN was off slow to begin, chased behind a rival
then steered out, traveled four deep at the quarter pole, remained wide into the stretch and got edged for third. WINK WISH AND PARK away well in the
beginning, dueled outside NIGHT PARTY for command, kept the pressure on around the turn then lost touch nearing the stretch and weakened. ELEGANT
SWAY came in and collided with at the start, started to climb then lugged out on the backstretch, chased five wide into the drive and failed to menace.
VIOLET CROWN got floated out on the backstretch, traveled three to four wide into the drive, lugged out in the lane and was not a factor. BIG GIFT chased
between rivals, suffered a mild shuffle past the quarter pole and weakened. CAANFOOLERY broke out, tracked outside rivals into the turn, asked three
deep around the bend and weakened. FOREST ACCLAMATION veered out and collided with rival at the start, became rank and came in early, saved
ground into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

BACK RING LUCK stumbled, broke out and bumped rival, got shuffled back shortly after, swung out and went up outside rivals six wide into the first turn,
took over then cleared and moved to the inside, asked right handed leaving the far turn, switch to the left hand in the lane and remained clear while drifting
out some. SOUTHERN KING off alertly to begin, led two wide inside several runners entering the first turn, lost command around the bend, closest in pursuit
up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the stretch, finished willingly through the final furlong but could not make any headway on the winner late.
TARTINI got bumped leaving the gate, showed early speed between rivals then dropped back a bit to chase the speed from off the rail, was driven four wide
into the lane and gained the show. FALSELY ACCUSED up close four deep at the seven-eighths pole then chased the top pair around the clubhouse turn,
traveled off the pace in the middle stages, was under a drive two wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HOLY GHOST lacked early speed and steered
to the inside, advanced two to three wide on the far turn, moved back to the inside in the stretch and kept on to improve position. KITTEN'S SPA chased in
range in the three path early then dropped back off the pace, moved out wide and entered the stretch six wide and failed to make an impact. PERFECT
CUT stumbled a bit at the start but still showed early speed three deep into the first turn, moved back to chase while staying out wide, asked on the far turn
and came five wide into the stretch and weakened. JACK SPROUT chased in the two path early then moved back off the pace, trailed two wide into the
stretch and tired. MOVE OVER (GB) stumbled leaving the gate, saved ground throughout and came up empty.

SHEZA GIRLY GIRL got bumped and crowded between rivals early, trailed to the turn, swung six wide leaving the bend, closed in and quickly reached the
front midstretch and won going away. SHE'S BULLETPROOF shifted in and bothered rival early, chased three deep around the turn then angled out nearing
the stretch, bumped with CAUSE SHE'S A LADY at the top of the stretch, finished well in the furlong grounds but got outclosed by the winner. BIG BEAUTY
forwardly placed up the backstretch, bid between rivals at the quarter pole, took over at the top of the stretch, cleared briefly then yielded to the top pair and
saved the show. CAUSE SHE'S A LADY settled out of range after a good a start, rounded the bend four to five wide, bumped with inner rival at the top of
the stretch, drifted out and checked midstretch and kept churned on only to miss the show honors. LAUREL CANYON showed early speed three deep then
chased the top pair up the backstretch, traveled outside a rival then spun four wide into the lane and could not rally. ACT OF SERENDIPITY was off a bit
slow to start, chased on the inside and gained ground on the turn, then tipped out a bit in the lane and flattened out. BIG TREAT dueled for the lead from
inside, maintained a short lead on the turn then relinquished command into the stretch and gave way. EMMA'S DANCE bumped with outside rival and
checked early, chased between foes around the turn in the two path and weakened. SATURDAY HEIST dueled for command from outside, three deep at
the quarter pole, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and weakened. SMILIN EVIE stumbled in the beginning, raced off the pace wide up the
backstretch, navigated the turn five then six wide, tired and eased in the lane and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOVLING THE
STRETCH RUN AND RULED THAT SHE'S BULLETPROOF AND CAUSE SHE'S A LADY MADE MUTUEL CONTACT AND THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE.

BOLT'S BROAD settled off the pace five wide, lagged up the backstretch, was on the move while remaining wide on the far turn, rallied from outside through
the lane and got up at the wire. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE away quickly in the beginning, led three deep into the first turn then dueled around the bend, lost
command but remained to the outside of the leader, flanked that rival through the far turn and three wide into the stretch, took over at the eighth pole and
put that rival away, led into the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. LA PEER up close inside the leaders into the first turn then took a stalking position,
saved ground to the stretch and finished willingly for the show. ANACARO broke in, pulled on the inside early, moved out a bit and went between rivals,
waited for room on the far turn, got boxed in and bumped in midstretch and kept on late for a minor award. BALENCIAGA BETTY bobbled leaving the gate,
got put in tight on the front-end between rivals early, began to pull and eventually took full control from outside rival, led two wide into the stretch, lost the
lead at the eight pole, drifted out and bumped ANACARO midstretch and weakened. FREE AND HUMBLE leaned back and broke a step slow, chased five
wide into the first turn, traveled four deep up the backstretch, remained four deep into the lane and weakened. SHIRLEY'S BANE broke a step slow then
went up to be four deep into the first turn, chased three deep into the second bend, got shuffled between runners and steadied at the three-sixteenths pole
and faded. PER RULING LATC010 FROM THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD, BOLT'S BROAD WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO

Footnotes
GIVER NOT A TAKER bobbled leaving the gate, tracked three deep on the turn, was closest in pursuit three wide into the stretch, reeled in STRAIGHTEN
UP in midstretch and drove clear. STRAIGHTEN UP sped to the front and set the pace up the backstretch, kicked clear on the turn while two wide then a bit
off the rail into the stretch, could not offer any resistance to the winner in midstretch but stayed on for a clear second. AMIGO G A stumbled leaving the gate
and was a bit green early, chased three then four wide on the turn, drifted inward in the stretch and gained the show. MERIT SONG hit the gate in the
beginning, chased the speed outside a rival, traveled between foes then two wide on the turn and weakened. HACKING IT UP raced up close inside the
leader early, lost ground through the turn and weakened in the drive. MOON ICE broke inward, stalked from inside, dropped back around the bend, entered
the lane two wide and had little left for the drive.

COAST OF ROAN chased in the two path, drew alongside the leader with three furlong remaining, kept the pressure on three wide into the stretch, roused
at the top of the stretch, took over past the eight pole and drew clear. FORT MOULTRIE broke a step slow from outside, traveled four to three wide around
the first turn tracking the speed, stayed out wide into the second bend, came four wide into the stretch and grinded out the final furlong to get up for second.
MAC DADDY TOO cleared and crossed over to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged by COAST OF ROAN at the three-eighths pole,
maintained a short lead through the far turn and led two wide into the stretch, clung to a narrow advantage at the eight pole, relinquished the lead shortly
after and got edged for the place. ONE FAST BRO stalked in the three path through both turns and flattened in the stretch run. NEPTUNE'S STORM
chased the speed from the rail, coaxed on the far turn, asked right-handed while still on the fence at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened in the lane.
OVERDUE settled four then three wide on the first turn, traveled five wide into the far turn, got moved out to the six path then moved back in and came five
wide into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off. MOODY JIM (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, tracked three to four wide on the first turn, two to three
wide on the second, eased in the lane and walked off.
