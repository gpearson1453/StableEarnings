C BY THE SEA set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. NO MORE was in mid pack, a
factor on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. NO EASY ROAD was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and from the five path
at the top of the stretch was up for show. OMEGNA was in range and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more.
CORE settled off the pace and moved up on the turn but from the nine path at the top of the stretch was no threat. MISS D'S PRIDE forced the pace and
dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. SCARBOROUGH BLUFFS was well back, trailed the field on the turn and had
no impact. SECTION TEN was hustled early but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
TERRIFIC LADY tracked the early leader, was hustled along on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. MY LAST
DREAM was away alertly and a factor on the turn but was no match for the winner. WICKEN CENTS was well back, closed the gap on the turn and was up
for show. BURMESE showed speed from the outside and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and gave way. AWESOME WINNA
was in touch but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. OH LORDY was in touch but lost ground on the turn and
dropped back through the stretch.
