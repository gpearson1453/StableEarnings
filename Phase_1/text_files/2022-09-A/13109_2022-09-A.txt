Footnotes
SHEMAKESCENTS broke well then settled off the pace widest early, moved closer nearing the turn, bid outside the top pair around the bend, dueled past
the quarter pole, took over into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, drew away and was kept to task with the right hand. CHARLOTTE HARBOR got
shuffled back early, advanced between up the backstretch, rounded the turn three wide then took aim four wide into the stretch, could not threaten the
winner late and held the place. SWEET HEIDELBERG was off slow in the beginning, went three wide into the turn, was on the move through the bend,
came four to five wide into the stretch and put in a late rally while unable to get up for the place. GOLDEN HALO bumped from outside in the beginning,
stalked behind the leader early, went two to three wide around the bend and lacked a bid in the stretch. PEANUT BUTTER CUP stumbled, shifted in and
bumped rival at the start, stalked the pace outside a rival, bid outside the leader with three furlongs remaining, took over early on the turn, held a short lead
in the two path then lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. LUCY L tracked the pace on the inside, got blocked behind a rival and began
to climb, angled out into the clear and could not rally after. SAPADILLA chased between rivals then off the rail, went two wide into the turn, lacked room and
checked at the quarter pole, got straightened out and churned on through the final furlong. KEEPURSELF ALIVE was off slow to begin, trialed up the
backstretch, was a bit rank and had to altered out from behind a rival late on the turn and failed to menace. SO SOFTLY was keen early while clearing to
take control, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged from outside at the three-eighths pole, became rank on the turn and lost command soon after
and gave way inside. I'M NO BALLERINA chased between rivals early then began to climb up the backstretch and dropped back, raced along the inside
through the turn and was not a factor. LIVING WITH AUTISM was off a bit slow to begin, chased three deep or four wide into the turn, came five wide into
the lane and weakened. FLAPS UP broke a step slow, chased wide up the backstretch, rounded the turn five then six wide while dropping back and tired.

Footnotes
HOLDEN THE LUTE stalked in the two path, raced in a bit tight into the far turn between rivals, tipped out leaving the bend, rallied outside the top pair and
wore down SPIRIT OF MAKENA in the closing moments to get up. SPIRIT OF MAKENA cleared quickly and steered down to the inside, set the pace under
pressure up the backstretch, maintained a short lead through the far turn, resisted into deep stretch and got overtaken in the closing moments. STREET
RUCKUS stalked the pace on the inside, inched closer at the half-mile pole, saved ground to the stretch, urged right-handed along the fence and finished
willingly for the show. PERFECT FLIGHT broke out, was up close three wide then went up to press the pace from outside, kept the pressure on through the
far turn, fought between to the sixteenth pole and flattened late. LORD DRAGON tracked three wide outside a rival on the first turn, went between on the
backstretch then raced three wide in the clear into the far turn, moved out and was fanned five wide late on the bend and could not produce a bid. STAR
ALIGNMENT bumped repeatedly with KINGMEISTER in the beginning, tracked three wide early, three deep into the far turn, four wide leaving the bend and
weakened. KINGMEISTER bumped repeatedly with STAR ALIGNMENT and had to steady early, settled on the inside, angled out on the far turn and
entered the stretch five to six wide and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
MALIBU COAST was off slow and bumped in the beginning, tracked on the inside to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane, drifted out a bit past the
eight pole, rallied and got up late. REINCARNATE vied three deep into the first turn then cleared inside pair around the bend, rated early on the backstretch
which allowed pressure to come from both sides briefly then set the pace with KID AZTECA to the outside, held a short lead through the far turn and into the
stretch, cleared with a sixteenth remaining but got nailed at the wire. HEARTBREAK KID sat off the pace in the early going, went three deep into the far
turn, raced three to four wide into the stretch, moved out further in the drive, got floated out a bit past the eight pole, rallied outside the top pair but lacked
the needed late punch. KID AZTECA chased four wide around the first turn, went up to press the pace on the outside, battled around the far turn and into
the stretch, kept the pressure on to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. RUSSELLS HUSTLE stumbled and bumped in the beginning, went up inside the
speed into the first turn then chased the pacesetter around the bend, drew alongside once again early on the backstretch then moved back to stalk, coaxed
two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. FAST FALL vied between into the first turn then got shuffled back then steadied behind RUSSELLS HUSTLE
around the bend, tracked two wide into the stretch, angled to the inside and lacked a rally. REIGN OVER ME was off slow and bumped leaving the gate,
tucked in early, saved ground off the pace and made no impact. EXCESS ENGLISH broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked two wide and could not
rally. AMERICAN EMPIRE was off slow and never got invovled. DANUBE was off slow to begin, pulled and became rank early and had to alter out, traveled
off the rail near the back, entered the lane a bit off the rail and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DOUBLE FANTASY raced in range three deep, bid four then three wide on the turn, dueled and took over at the eighth pole, drifted out in the furlong
grounds and drawing clear. SO IT WOULD SEEM stalked outside a rival, bid outside the leader at the three-eighths pole, took over past the five-sixteenths
marker, took pressure from DOUBLE FANTASY to the outside, fought with that rival in upper stretch then lost command at the eight pole and stayed on
through the final sixteenth for a clear second. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL got impeded and checked early, chased on the inside to the stretch, tipped out and gained
the show. SMILING THUNDER stalked the speed up the backstretch, bid along the rail on the turn, could not go on with the top pair leaving the bend and
weakened while holding a minor award. WHISKEY BLUE bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pace outside a rival, came four wide into the stretch and
never found the needed response. CHAO MAR lacked early speed, traveled along the inside into the turn, steered out and came six wide into the lane and
improved position. SUNNY LANE was off a bit slow to begin, chased off the rail near the back of the pack, pushed on three to four wide around the bend
and failed to menace. LIL'S BIG SHOT chased between then started to climb and dropped back up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, five wide
into the stretch and weakened. MAINLINE was up close early off the rail, traveled two wide into the turn, got blocked behind SALLY STANFORD then tipped
three wide leaving the bend and weakened. FAST TO FORTUNE bumped leaving the gate, sat off the pace, entered the turn four wide, exited six wide and
came up empty. SALLY STANFORD broke well then shifted in early, went up to take control and showed the way to the turn, challenged from outside at the
three-eighths pole, lost command past the five-sixteenths and folded.

Footnotes
GETTHEMONEY sped to the front, showed the way to the turn, kicked clear around the bend, cut the corner into the drive, roused in upper stretch and
widened under a tap of left handed urging midstretch, then coasted in late. LILY POO settled outside a rival, went two to three wide around the turn,
summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. DOINITTHEHARDWAY veered out leaving the gate, sat off the pace well off the inside, went four then three
wide around the turn and was along for the show. FOURTH STREET was closest in pursuit early on, took the turn three then two wide and flattened to
fourth. BLESSED TOUCH was off slow and lost path, trailed up the backstretch, rounded the bend three then four wide and offered a mild response to
improve. DIVINELY BOLT stalked between then two wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and faded. SPICYBUG broke out a bit at the start,
bumped rival in the early stages, settled off the pace, traveled on the inside then tipped to the two path around the bend and failed to rally.
FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER broke a step slow then got bumped and lost her path early, raced near the back two wide into the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and failed to menace. GILA raced in range outside rivals, asked four wide into the turn, dropped back and moved in some around the bend and tired.
PRINCESS BETTINA stalked the pace on the inside then started to weaken around the bend and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CREATIVE PEAK sat in mid-pack three deep into the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, rallied to the front with a sixteenth to go and drew clear. SQUARE
CAT unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turn, remained inside in the stretch, closed fast in deep stretch and gained second. FORGIVING
SPIRIT chased on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out and finished willingly to gain the show. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS chased between rivals
early, entered the stretch two wide, came out in upper stretch and put in a late run to round out the superfecta. BRIX dropped back early, moved to the
inside, went between rivals at the quarter pole then came two wide into the stretch, found traffic in upper stretch and steered to the outside and kept on
through the final furlong. WHO'S CANDY was off a bit slow to begin, steadied past the half-mile pole, spun four wide into the lane, moved out further in the
drive and kept on to the wire. IN VRONSKY STYLE vied between early for command, dueled from outside late on the bend, carried a short lead into the final
furlong, relinquished control at the sixteenth pole and flattened. LIL RICHARDS BELLO was off slow to begin, trailed to the stretch, tipped out in the lane,
then dove back inside with a sixteenth remaining and improved. ATOMIC DROP chased the top trio early on, saved ground to the stretch and lacked the
needed late kick in deep stretch. CROSSKIRK was off a bit slow to begin, steadied off heels early, chased four deep then four wide into the drive and lacked
a rally. EVENEREVENWORSE was a bit rank early then went up to vie three deep for command into and around the turn, could not keep up late on the
bend and weakened between rivals. HEAD FOR BUSINESS vied for the lead from inside, dueled past the quarter pole, fought to the eighth pole and
weakened.

and vied with rivals into the lane, bumped with CENSORSHIP in upper stretch, battled through the final furlong holding a narrow advantage and gamely
prevailed. CENSORSHIP chased off the rail then bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, vied between leaving the turn, bumped with ANGEL
NADESHIKO in upper stretch, fought head to head down the lane and missed. KURA was off a bit slow, dropped back early, went four to five wide around
the turn, drifted out in the lane and produced a mild rally to best the rest. PRINCESS ADALEIGH stumbled badly in the beginning, moved into range outside
rivals up the backstretch, bid four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, vied three deep into the stretch and weakened. RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ had his path
taken early, tracked two wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide and could not rally. BROCADE settled off the rail, went two wide around the turn and
failed to threaten. KARIN WITH AN I bumped repeatedly in the early stages, saved ground through the turn, tipped out and failed to rally. CLASSY drifted
out and bumped repeatedly early, trailed two wide into the lane, drifted through the lane and was not a factor. INFINITE EMPIRE broke in, was forced to
check early, traveled in mid-pack off the rail or outside a rival, came three wide into the lane and weakened. TOO BOSSY sped to the front from outside
then cleared inner rival, challenged from both sides at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command and steadied near the quarter pole, eased in the lane and

PACKS A WAHLOP pressed the pace from outside, lost touch near the half-mile pole, drew alongside again into the far turn, took over near the quarter
pole, cleared in upper stretch and drew off. DON'TTHINKJUSTDOIT was off slow to begin, traveled on the inside, drifted out and bumped rival with a
sixteenth remaining and rallied for the place. VALIANCER was off slow from the outside, reserved at the back and moved inside, steered out and went three
deep into the far turn, lacked room past the quarter pole, came out in the stretch and gained the show. DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) was off slow to begin,
raced off the rail near the back then moved inside, waited for room leaving the far turn, tipped out and tried to rally between foes but got sandwiched near
the sixteenth pole, kept on late and was edged for the show. AH JEEZ bobbled leaving the gate then went up to take command from inside, led under
pressure early then cleared at the half-mile pole, challenged again by PACKS A WAHLOP into the far turn, lost command with a quarter mile left to run,
fought back to the stretch and flattened to fifth. DE LA LUNA settled inside then started to pull early and went between runners, tugged on the backstretch,
chased two to three wide into the stretch, got bumped hard with a sixteenth to go and could not regain momentum. WOUND UP stalked on the inside, tipped
out in the lane, got forced into outside rival at the sixteenth pole and weakened. MAS RAPIDO (GB) broke a step slow, traveled four then three deep off the
pace, took closer order up the backstretch, went five then four wide around the far turn and lacked a needed bid. SYNTACTIC sat off the pace early on,
raced between then off the rail, got put in tight between foes at the quarter pole and churned on to improve position in the stretch run. STONE POINT
bumped and checked on the first turn, steadied between runners while three deep into the backstretch, remained between foes on the far turn, lacked room
leaving the bend, angled out and could not rally. TAHOMA chased four deep into the first turn then got forced out around the bend, came four wide into the
stretch and lacked further response. PARK CITY broke in and bumped rival, pulled early and shifted out on the first turn, chased off the rail into the far turn,
lost ground around the bend and weakened. TI SENTO (IRE) was off slow to begin, raced between rivals off the pace, three deep on the backstretch, lacked
room past the quarter pole and could not rally once gaining a clear path. PRESIDENT Z bumped leaving the gate, raced three deep into the first turn then
had to steady, eased into the far turn and pulled up on bend and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
DON'TTHINKJUSTDOIT FROM SECOND TO SEVENTH FOR DRIFTING OUT AND CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN WOUND UP, DE LA
LUNA, AND DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE WHICH COST THOSE RIVALS A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
WEEGEE bumped leaving the gate, raced near the back two to three wide on the first turn, traveled three deep with three furlongs remaining, came four
wide into the stretch, headed rival at the eighth pole, took over shortly after and inched away from NATIONAL ROAD in deep stretch. NATIONAL ROAD
chased outside rivals early then angled in, inched closer up the backstretch, waited for room room on the far turn then found an opening, went two wide into
the lane, tipped out and bid between at the eighth pole but got outkicked by the winner. FLINT STROLL popped the gate open and was reloaded, unhurried
three wide then raced outside a rival in the two path, got blocked nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled in then back out around the far turn, steered out
further in the lane and got up for the show. UNCLE JEFF dueled for the lead three wide inside a rival leaving the chute, ceded command near the
seven-eighths pole, bid outside on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, cleared into the stretch, headed at the eighth pole and yielded. CAISSON
settled on the inside then angled out off the rail, raced four deep at the three-eighths pole, came three wide into the drive, lost his path and checked at the
eighth pole and could not regain momentum. BARNFIELD broke in and bumped rival, angled to the two path near the back then moved inside, steadied at
the five-sixteenths pole, raced a bit off the rail into the lane, moved out in the drive and improved position. HALFBARBERBINGIE bobbled leaving the gate,
trailed early, advanced four to five wide on the far turn and failed to threaten in the lane. THE KEY IS UNITY tracked two wide then moved inside, tipped out
and could not rally. CANELO dueled for command from outside racing wide into the stretch for the first time, cleared and angled in, showed the way to the
far turn, challenged from outside and lost command at the quarter pole and faded. KANT BEAT THE ROCK tracked five deep leaving the chute, moved into
the two path and raced between on the first turn, came three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. TUSKEGEE CAT tracked there deep, got
shuffled early on the far turn and tired.
