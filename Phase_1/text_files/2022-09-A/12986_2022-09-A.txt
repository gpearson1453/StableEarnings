Footnotes
PETER D settled off the pace in the two path, circled four wide around the far turn, reached near even terms outside of BADBADBOBBY in upper stretch,
dueled outside of that foe to the wire and narrowly prevailed. BADBADBOBBY saved ground in range around the first turn, bid three wide around the far
turn, turned for home on even terms between foes, dueled inside of the winner to the wire and just missed in a game try. T VILLE vied two wide between
foes around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn, could not keep pace with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on well enough for the sow.
MAJOR FRONTIER disputed the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn and weakened in the lane. BOCA GUY hit the
starting gate, raced three wide and never threatened. VANCOUVER D'ORO set the early pace along the rail and was through early.

Footnotes
CARABINERO was bumped hard on both sides at the start, sped to the front nonetheless, set a clear pace in the 2path, drifted out in midstretch and
widened under right-handed urging. ARMOR PIERCING bumped the winner at the start, lacked speed, raced three wide around the turn, angled widest in
upper stretch and ran on for the place. CONRADO gave chase two wide between foes, angled to the rail in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the
lane and churned on for the show. JOE'S HAD ENOUGH broke out and bumped the winner at the start, chased that foe three wide and tired in the lane.
BAR DOWN EXPRESS had some speed four wide and steadily faded. KAIZEN was outrun inside. CAFFE VIVO played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
DONTMESSWITHTESS set a rated pace in the three path around the first turn, drew clear in the two path rounding the far turn, dug in inside of VANDALIA
when that foe drew abreast nearing the eighth pole and was edging away again late. VANDALIA stalked the pace two wide around the first turn and three
wide around the far turn, reached near even terms outside of the winner nearing the eighth pole but was turned back by that foe in the final sixteenth.
KENTUCKY PRIDE raced in range three and four wide, lacked the needed rally but outfinished a foe for the show. DIVINE EXCHANGE raced off the pace
four wide around the first turn, went two wide around the far turn, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, made some progress in upper stretch but
weakened through the final furlong. PERFECT KIMBERLY S steadied midway around the first turn, raced two and three wide and never threatened. TRULY
steadied late on the first turn and never factor while racing two wide. KISSING FROGS had speed inside of the winner and retreated around the far turn.

BLACK BELT vied three wide down the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn, pressed the pace inside of ENSIGN PARKER around most of the
turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, quickly cleared, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging and widened. ENSIGN PARKER stalked the pace four
wide down the backstretch, took over near the half-mile pole, set the pace two wide around the turn, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch
and lasted for the place. WANDERING WEST raced off the pace three wide, lacked a rally and bested the rest. EXAMINER vied between foes early, chased
two wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. TOSCANITO failed to menace while racing three wide. THE RED MAN had only brief speed
inside.

Footnotes
GATSBY stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch, advanced two wide around the turn, took over turning for home, steadily drifted out under
left-handed urging and edged clear. RED CRESCENT settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, reached near even terms
nearing the quarter pole, drifted a bit entering the turn, had aim outside of the winner and was second best late. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) veered in at the
start, rushed up inside to set the pace along the rail, vied past the eighth pole and weakened late. AMERICAN PRINCE had early speed two wide, dropped
back between foes around the turn then churned on through the lane to pass some tiring foes. COLLABORATE was in range inside and had no response.
BREWMEISTER was forced in at the start and dropped well back, raced two wide around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened.
NO QUE NO settled off the early pace, advanced four wide under urging around the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CAJUN BAYOU raced well back early, circled four wide around the turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. GO HOME HAPPY
saved ground off the pace, tipped out nearing the quarter pole, split foes in upper stretch, angled back to the rail in upper stretch, continued on the left lead
in the lane and gained the place. EXTRACTION WILL tracked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, was bumped turning for
home and lacked a closing bid. BAKER BLOCK raced off the pace outside, bid four wide nearing the quarter pole and came up empty in the lane. SHEA D
CAPTURE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. CORPORATE AFFAIR had early speed inside and retreated around the turn. MINISTER
QUINN set the pace two wide, drifted out and bumped EXRACTION WILL turning for home and had little left for the stretch.
