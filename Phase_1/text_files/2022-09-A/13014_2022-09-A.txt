Footnotes
GET GROOVY stalked close up two or three wide, bid two wide on the far turn, took over and came wide into the stretch, responded when roused, drew
clear under urging, held well and was under confident handling in the final yards. PRINCESS GEORGIA was off a bit slow, raced four wide early, stalked
three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, angled in behind the winner at the top of the lane, rallied in the final sixteenth and was gaining slowly late.
TAKEITTOCOMITTEE was off a bit slow, steadied in tight on the first turn, settled off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, then rallied mildly on the rail.
BEATUBYACHUBINOSE raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. PERSPICACIOUS tracked on the inside, chased on
the far turn and tired. MUZZLE TOUGH set the pace racing in the two path, dueled inside on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
WINFROMWITHIN sent to the lead early on, set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, raced off the inside turning for home,
drifted in crowding NOTHING BETTER at the eighth pole, then dug in gamely and held well under urging. NOTHING BETTER tracked on the inside,
advanced inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, steadied when lacking room nearing the furlong marker, altered course outside, rallied
mildly and then finished evenly late. HOT BLOODED raced three wide early, settled off the pace inside, angled out entering the stretch, closed well outside
and was along for the show spot. GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied
mildly and was outkicked for third. CASH NOW stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and had no rally. MOHS steadied at the start, raced off the pace
inside, saved ground on the far turn, rode the rail in the stretch and lacked a rally. BELGRANO steadied soon after the start, raced three wide into the first
turn, stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and tired. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of
NOTHING BETTER against the winner, the race was declared official.
