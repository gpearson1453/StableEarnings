gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, continued close through the far turn but drifted leaving the turn and flattened stride. PRACTICAL KITTY raced off
the rail the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LICENSE TO CARRY came away rank and never factored.

MARKETABILITY settled off the pace in the three path the opening turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and
four paths, dug in for the lead past the sixteenth pole and edged clear later yards. CENTERFOLD ANGEL tapered to the inside and rated a slim lead, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn but was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. TIZ
MICHELLE'S WAY stalked the earlier pace from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened
inside the eighth pole. DEVILISH BEAUTY saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path. DUSTWHIRL
WONDER raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path. CATHERINES
WARRIOR stalked two deep, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail past the five sixteenths.

ENJOY SUMMER rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, came between horses into the lane and
dug in under determined handling to nose out CAN'T FIGURE under the wire. The latter stalked in the four path the first turn and took the lead three wide
toward the five sixteenths pole, raced clear past the quarter, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but missed the nod under the wire.
SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER settled inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and
finished well to take third later yards. PRINCESS MIA ROSE angled in while racing with the early pace, took the nod two deep leaving the five eighths pole,
was met while between horses approaching the five sixteenths, dropped back and rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened in the lane.
SUPERSNAKE raced with the pace inside then stalked from the five eighths pole, gave chase nearing the three eighths, contested at a close disadvantage
at the rail on the turn then weakened the final sixteenth. BUNNY PRINCESS raced well off the pace in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and
showed little response. CRISPY GAL came away a bit rank and never factored. JADE SKYE rounded the first turn in the four path then faded leaving the
half mile pole.
