raced in the two path throughout and had a slight rally. GOLDEN AVIEATOR set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened
late. LET US MAKE GOLD lacked speed and passed a tired horse with a late, mild move. SILENT SERVICE hugged the inner rail and gave way leaving the
far turn.

Footnotes
MISS FUSSY PANTS prompted the pace outside NEVER FREE, applied more pressure near the three eighths, wrested command leaving the far turn then
was urged clear soon after, dropped in towards the rail, kept on under left handed asking and held firm. NEED A MARKER showed speed then was rated
back off the leaders and tracked inside, came out for room and was three wide leaving the three eighths, took closer order under asking past the three
sixteenth, remained on her left lead and finished gamely to bridge the gap. NEVER DONE , brushed with GALACTIC TIDE at the break, saved ground early
then eased out to move between runners leaving the far turn, dropped back inside, exchanged a bump in upper stretch then churned on. GALACTIC TIDE ,
brushed at the start, chased three wide outside a rival past the half, lost ground four wide while edging up past the three eighths, bumped with NEVER
DONE in upper stretch but lacked a serious finish. NEVER FREE took over between foes in the opening furlong then cleared off heading to the half, secured
the inside then took pressure through the backstretch run, ceded the lead around the far turn, faltered soon after and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MR. MOX prompted the pace outside FREE SQUARE, overtook that one leaving the backstretch, opened a clear lead mid way on the final turn and held
sway under steady handling. JACKIE A , shuffled back entering the first turn, swung wide turning for home and rallied outside horses. HOLY
SYNCHRONICITY , steadied in tight quarters soon after the break, was four wide on both turns, bumped with GERRYS GEM near the furlong marker and
flattened out. GERRYS GEM stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path chasing the pace, and bumped with HOLY SUNCHRONICITY near
the eighth pole. FREE SQUARE , fractious during the post parade, set a pressured pace along the inner rail and faded. WHAT SAY YOU was not a factor.
GREAT CAMANOE raced along the inner rail, failed to be a factor and was eased in the stretch. BROTHER CONWAY , four wide entering the first turn,
chased the pace, gave way leaving the final turn and was eased.

Footnotes
R B'S THE BOSS rated kindly early on and angled four wide soon into the backstretch, moved up readily past the three eighths then bid deep to join the
pace fray, emerged in a battle outside BARZINI leaving the quarter pole, gained a slim advantage under a hustling ride entering the lane, kicked clear under
a drive with a sixteenth to go then was taken in hand in the final yards. DUCKPINS had speed then eased back off the leaders under the wire the first time,
stalked three wide, edged up near the five sixteenths then steadied when trying to work through a seam around the far turn, regrouped to chase, came three
wide for the drive and rallied on his left lead to gamely earn the place. BARZINI was hustled up to contention and gained a short lead outside rivals heading
into the first turn, dueled with NOAH CHANCE and then was surrounded past the three eighths, shifted in toward the rail and battled inside the winner
around the final turn, stayed on to the sixteenth pole then weakened late. FEELING WOOZY , off the pace while four wide, was under a hustling ride from
the far turn, circled four wide into the lane and churned on. NOAH CHANCE dueled inside from the three and a half pole to the far turn, chased the leaders
into the lane and faded. READ THE SPEC chased the dueling leaders while saving ground and faded in the lane. I KNOW , towards the inside, had belated
action. BONDED , ridden along three wide past the three eighths, failed to respond. SIGMUND , inside, dropped far back. An objection by the rider of
DUCKPINS against the winner for alleged interference near the far turn was not allowed.

LOST WEEKEND broke alertly, set the pace along the inner rail and drew off under a hand ride. ISLAND D'LITE circled the turn three wide and rallied.
SILVER PATRON , slightly off the rail on the turn, chased the winner and faded. BO'S BOURBON , well off the rail down the backstretch, drifted in entering
the turn when racing greenly and weakened. DR GREENTHUMB hugged the inner rail on the backstretch and was checked in tight quarters behind BO'S
BOURBON entering the turn. TONY'S NACHO was outrun. An objection by the rider of DR GREENTHUMB against BO'S BOURBON for alleged
interference near the quarter pole was not allowed.

FUHGEDDABOUDIT took over early, secured the inside and set a rated pace, took pressure from MY FLICKER into the far turn, dueled and was headed
near the furlong grounds, stayed on to spar past the sixteenth pole, regained command in deep stretch while under strong handling and prevailed. MY
FLICKER prompted the pace outside the winner, moved alongside leaving the far turn, dueled and gained a short lead approaching the stretch, maintained
the advantage until the final strides but wasn't quite good enough. LOVING CUP stumbled at the break then steadied when in close, regrouped and
advanced four wide to be in range soon into the backstretch, gave wide chase of the leaders into the far turn, dropped in with pursuit to the furlong marker,
shifted back out and finished with good energy. SHINELIKEADIAMOND chased the leaders while saving ground, dropped back some into the far turn, came
off the rail with continued pursuit past the three sixteenths, shifted further out to avoid a drifting rival then came back on with effort. ABBY THE BULL DAWG
, off the pace, raced between runners leaving the far turn, angled in and offered a mild kick. BOSS ANGEL , three wide, ranged up under asking nearing the
far turn, gave hard chase of the duelers past the three sixteenths, weakened soon into the lane and drifted out. ESPERANNNA broke slowly then steadied
when in tight soon after, lost ground and failed to menace. POLISH COOKIE saved ground, chased for nearly a half mile then retreated.

CALLYOURIGHTBACK , keen to go, was steadied along behind the leaders heading to the first turn, angled out for the backstretch run and stalked three
wide, took closer order leaving the far turn, bid three deep with a furlong to go, took over near mid stretch and drew clear under a drive. PLAYING GOLD
disputed the pace outside SKIP THE BULL, moved alongside after a half mile, dueled then gained a slim lead between rivals nearing the lane, fought on to
the inside of the winner past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. SKIP THE BULL sped to the early lead, dropped in and set a pressured pace towards
the rail, dueled from the far turn to about the eighth pole then weakened. KEEP NORTH drifted out at the break and was off slowly, saved ground into the
backstretch but failed to respond. CASA GRANDE , between rivals early, faltered.
