Footnotes
ONE NIGHT MIKE broke in steadying then tapered in and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the far turn, was met leaving the eighth pole but dug in under determined handling to recover the advantage mid-stretch and drew clear
the final yards. ANGELA'S ROMEO saved ground off the pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn, took a
brief lead inside the eighth pole but was caught mid-stretch and relented later yards. RIVER MALBUMOONRVF stalked two deep then gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path but showed little in the lane. ORANGEBURG made contact with REAL RICK leaving the
gate then settled off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then faded in the lane. The latter
was bumped leaving the gate, raced in the two and three paths the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. ROCKET BALLAD saved
ground.

mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. LIQUID LOUIE saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dueled clear of
FRATHOUSE MUSIC inside the sixteenth pole and finished well, while the latter rated the pace inside, was pressured nearing the quarter pole, rounded the

leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. TIZ AUCTION TIME

VIDMER'S COURAGE chased the pace from the inside, rounded the turn at the rail, took the lead past the eighth pole, cleared TANELEER mid-stretch and
widened later yards, while the latter, contested the pace through the backstretch, raced close two deep on the turn, dropped back into the lane but dug in
through the stretch to retain second. DOC ELM chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the lane and finished
evenly. EASTBOUND N DOWN contested the pace through the backstretch, dueled briefly clear at the rail leaving the turn but was caught past the eighth
pole and weakened the final sixteenth. BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path, left the turn outside
and finished evenly. RUN LEA RUN chased through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn but showed little more in the lane. QUICK WIT gave chase
inside, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little in the lane.
