AWESOME WONDER broke alertly, set the tempo early along the rail, gave up the lead to the runner up, came back on quickly to duel for the lead into and
through the turn, drifted out to the five path while egging clear at the top of the stretch, set the balance of the pace and just lasted under strong handling.
WHAT'S SO FUNNY steadied then angled outside to the seven path leaving the chute, rushed to the lead before a quarter, matched stride with the winner
through the turn, dropped back a bit, angled inside that one and came on again late to just miss in a game effort. HALF LEGEND never far back, finished
with good courage along the rail. VOODOOISM failed to menace. PLAYFUL SUMMER with the second flight two wide, advanced in the four path into the
turn then came up empty. POOLSIDE COCKTAILS was outrun. WELL HELLO YOU was through early.

PAINT THE TOWN chased the pace two wide, rallied through the turn outside the leader, was carried out by that one to the five path, angled back into the
three path and drew off. GOOD MUSIC bore in at the start bumping rivals, was never far back and finished determinedly along the rail. FAST CLIP broke
sharply and quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace along the inside, drifted to the four path past the quarter pole, checked behind the winner then
faded. ROUGE TU RICHES was bumped and forced into SWING STATE at the start then passed tiring rivals through the stretch. LUNCHATTHELIZARD
failed to menace. SWING STATE was bumped at the start then failed to respond. HARSH TRUTH was wide early and always outrun. PALACE
TEMPTATION was through early. THE RIDER OF FAST CLIP LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

KINGOFTHEBUCKEYE matched strides for the early lead along the rail, steadied nearing the turn, was well handled while getting out through the turn and
dropping back several lengths, swung out to the eight path entering the stretch, closed rapidly and got up in the final strides. QUIET AMIGO broke in front,
set the tempo under early pressure two wide, drew clear on the turn, drifted to the six path at the top of the stretch, set all the pace and just missed hanging
on. GONE IN A FLASH allowed to settle, advanced in the five path through the turn, entering the stretch in the six path, angled into the four path soon
thereafter and finished with good courage. SUSIE'S KID close from the start, inched closer three wide on the turn then came up empty. STUNT MAN
stalked the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. KONTAR was wide early and trailed.

ALTISSIMO pressed the pace into the stretch, made the lead two wide near the furlong marker then finished full of run to win going away. MO DONT NO
stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally in the three path and finished second best. AYE AYE SIR sped to the lead soon after the start, set a
rapid pace along the rail until mid stretch then tired. GOOD ON YA failed to menace. DARK OAK broke slowly and was no threat. MIGHTY ANGEL was no
factor. CHIEF RANDEL had brief speed.
