SEVEN IS A BREEZE was well back, closed gap on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. ACTION POINT was off the pace
and gained ground on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. LETS SAY THIS was hustled early, a factor on the
turn but leveled off through the stretch. STORMIN' HUMOR was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no
real threat. GUS'S GAMBLE was away alertly and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch faded. SILVER SIGNATURE was
in touch and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response.

Footnotes
POOLSIDE MANNERS settled off the pace, was a factor on the turn and with the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch prevailed. CEEBETT'S
BOW was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. SPEEDY FIRE was in mid pack and had
a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. LINDA LOVES LACE showed no speed and had a mild gain on the
turn but from the nine path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. PACENZA was well back, closed the gap on the turn and passed tired foes through the
stretch. MAHONE BAY was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was no threat. QUIET ASCOT was up close early but lost ground on the turn and
had no impact. CRUMLIN BIRD set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but dropped back through the stretch. THE GREEN PLANET forced
the pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.
