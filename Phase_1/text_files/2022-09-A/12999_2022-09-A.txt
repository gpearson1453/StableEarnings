Footnotes
TREASON took command after the break, was headstrong into the first turn, found his rhythm down the backside to increase his advantage, opened up
even more on the field turning for home and cruised to the wire winning with ease, geared down at the end. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY chased the winner
throughout, could not keep up to the long gone winner through the far turn, was headed inside by another rival with a quarter left to run and battled outside
through the lane to be the best of the rest. CUPID'S DUDE settled at the rear after the start, began to make a run with three eighths to go advancing up the
rail to duel inside for the place honors, challenged his outside rival through the stretch and lost the photo at the wire settling for third. BASKETBALL JONES
stalked mid pack just off the rail in the early stages, was between runners racing into the far turn, fought on inside through the lane winning the photo for the
minors. BET N WIN broke out a bit after the start, settled near the rear into the first turn, was relegated to the rear through the backstretch, offered a mild bid
three wide on the far turn and lost the battle for the small share outside at the wire.

Footnotes
FORESTERS PRINCESS pressed the pace three then two wide into and on the first turn, edged to put a head in front at the nine-sixteenths, vied before
edging clear past the five-sixteenths, was clear into upper stretch and held sway while being kept to the task. JOLENE JOLENE tracked inside the second
group on or just off the rail, moved out three wide coming to the quarter pole, chased the winner home but could make no headway late. VENENOSA settled
at the rear along the inside, was still last leaving the far turn, angled seven wide into the stretch, was along for show but no threat to the top pair. LITTLE
FIRE raced outside three to four wide off the pace early, took closer order heading into the far turn moving in from four to three wide on that bend, moved in
further in upper stretch and improved position inside foes but needed more. GOLD FORESTER set a pressured pace inside, came out a bit in mid-stretch
while weakening. SMARTY ILLUSION settled off the pace in the three path at the rear into and on the first turn, advanced outside five wide up the
backstretch to the far turn, evened out in the lane. COURTINGCOURTNEY was shuffled back at the start then moved forward to gain a stalking position two
to three wide mid-division on the first turn, chased three to four wide on the far turn and weakened. SWEET SHADES switched outside a rival going two to
three wide in behind runners off the pace, failed to rally.

Footnotes
TARANTO TITAN stalked on the rail mid pack in the early stages, angled off the fence into the first turn racing five wide in the clear with a half to run, roused
with five sixteenths to go, quickly responded to lead in mid stretch and opened up with an eighth left to win comfortably. KILLARY settled at the back into the
turn, began picking up foes running between horses at the half, angled off off tiring runners at the quarter pole in the seven path and closed belatedly getting
up for second. TUFF RAGS trailed inside to begin, creeped into contention on the fence throughout the turn, shot up the rail with three sixteenths to go and
finished up well to be an unchallenged third. AWESOME STRIKE broke inwards starting, rated close to the leader running three wide on the turn, was in the
mix between horses turning for home and could not offer a strong finish to the wire. SILENT LUCIDITY took command soon after the break, continued to be
the frontrunner through the turn, was headed by the winner with three sixteenths to run, offered no resistance and tired at the furlong marker. TRIZMO
advanced up the rail on the backstretch and through the turn, was in contention turning for home but could not quicken with rivals on either side and
weakened in mid stretch. MOMENT OF PEACE tracked the pace inside from the start, travelled between foes three wide through the turn, started to weaken
three furlongs out and backed away through the field in upper stretch. SPRING MOUNTAIN settled near the rear running three wide in the beginning, was
roused at the top of the stretch in the seven path for the drive and never became a factor. BODACIOUS BIZ chased the early pace outside of rivals, began
to lose interest running between foes at the half and could not make a presence through the lane.

Footnotes
TEXT ME UP tucked in behind the leaders to track racing in the two path, moved out late on the far turn to commence a bid, struck the lead just past the
eighth pole and was clear a sixteenth out then held safe. STORMY DERBY DAY raced off the pace two to three wide, swung six wide into upper stretch,
rallied to gain the place while no threat to the winner. LIL'S TURN tucked in two wide mid-pack early, swung four wide into upper stretch, altered course in a
bit in upper- to mid-stretch and rallied between rivals to just get up for show honors. COOL SOCIETY saved ground racing off the pace inside, gained late
but needed more. CALL HER JOEY broke a step slowly, settled near the inside at the rear, came out in upper stretch and ran on. MACHISIMA switched
outside a rival three to four wide into the first turn, edged closer to force the issue after the opening half, moved clear turning for home, weakened late.
GLOVANNA stalked just off the pace while floated four to five deep into the first turn, encouraged along on the far turn still racing about four deep, lacked
the needed late kick. FLAT OUT VIXEN saved ground inside, came out in upper stretch, failed to rally. ANITA GRIGIO set the early pace racing just off the
rail, dueled late up the backstretch into the far turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
NIKOLAOU was near the rear turning for home, angled out to the five path splitting runners at the quarter marker, found clear running room mid stretch in
the six path, was full of run a furlong from the wire and accelerated well in deep stretch to win drawing away in the end. LAST DAWN hounded the early
frontrunner on the turn, pressed for the lead three furlongs to go, put away his rival at the eighth pole but could not hold off the late charge of the winner in
deep stretch. HILARIOUS AFFAIR was allowed to settle near the back outside of runners throughout the turn, rallied in upper stretch closing in the eight
path in mid stretch, quickened a furlong out and finished up well for a clear third. MAGNIFICENT MARIO travelled four wide through the turn within range of
the frontrunners, contended between rivals two furlongs out and levelled off a bit with an eighth to run to garner a minor share. REBEL FAITH took a good
stalking position inside mid pack through the turn, was asked to go on at the quarter marker and ran evenly through mid stretch. COLONEL MUSTARD
broke in and hit the gate at the break to trail, angled out for run nine wide in upper stretch and passed tired ones outside in the late stages of the race.
ALLEN DIGGS took command after the break, was headed with three eighths remaining, battled inside for nearly a quarter and stopped at the furlong
marker. JACK rated mid pack on the rail in the early stages, was roused to go on behind runners in upper stretch and faded in the last eighth. HERE BE
DRAGONS tracked just behind the early frontrunners in the three path through the turn, was ridden into the stretch to go on, offered little response and
retreated between rivals in mid stretch. WAR SAFE settled in mid pack outside of rivals, was asked at the top of the stretch in the seven path and stopped
with three sixteenths to run.

Footnotes
LORENA stalked from just off the leader three wide into the turn, came out of that bend four wide, took aim and gained steadily to edge past late. STORMY
SILENCE exchanged light bumps at the break but moved forward to track in behind the leader, saved ground on or just off the rail into the turn, moved out
about midway on that bend, was three wide at the top of the stretch commencing a rally, drifted in a bit but struck the lead a sixteenth from home however
was outfinished. MARIE MACKAY got away alertly, moved in to the two path to set the pace racing off the rail, yielded once headed. SPANISH BALLERINA
exchanged a minor bump at the start, settled mid-pack while wide, moved in two wide just before entering the turn, ran just off the rail advancing on the
leaders, kept on in the stretch. MILLENNIUM FORCE was bumped lightly at the start, settled at the rear racing off the inside four wide into the turn, swung
seven wide into upper stretch and gained too late. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE was ridden along from the break but lacking sufficient early speed, moved closer
four to five wide on the turn, ran on evenly. AMALFI SKY settled at the rear, advanced inside entering the turn when room opened on the rail, came out in
mid-stretch and lacked the needed late kick. HELL N WILD switched off the inside heading up the backstretch racing in behind runners two wide into the
turn, was forced out five wide abruptly at that juncture and was unable to menace. GREEN GABLES raced toward the back four wide heading to the turn,
was forced out six wide abruptly to avoid a foe at that point, came into upper stretch six deep and failed to rally. FOREST DRIFT tracked inside, checked
when in just a bit tight along the rail moving out at that point entering the turn, dropped back and faded. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
FOREST DRIFT AGAINST SPANISH BALLERINA ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SPITE STORE was in a good stalking position on the turn tracking the front threesome on the fence, waited to move on the dueling trio into the stretch,
angled just outside to split foes at the furlong marker and began to draw away at the finish. SOUPER WATSON was allowed to settle on the rail at the back
in the early stages, began to close in on runners travelling five wide with a quarter to go, was full of run through the stretch and ran on well to get up to win
the photo for place. MACLEAN'S POSSE led soon after the start, put away one pace rival with a quarter to go, was challenged outside by another contender
in upper stretch, repelled that charge and finally gave way stubbornly in deep stretch losing place right on the line. SWOT ANALYSIS tracked the
frontrunners around the turn, advanced with three sixteenths to go to bid for the lead in upper stretch, could not find enough late and stalled in deep stretch
setting for a minor share. HAVE A SOUPER DAY trailed early on, was ridden hard with runners on either side through the turn, showed some late interest in
the final furlong to be involved for a minor placing in the end. ESKIMINZIN tracked mid pack outside runners, was five wide entering upper stretch and
offered little finish between horses running to the wire. LAST AMERICAN EXIT settled at the back throughout, could not get involved on the turn and passed
weary runners down the lane. KAWACATOOSE pressed for the early lead just outside, began to weaken between rivals at the top of the stretch and
retreated through the field. IT'S GAME KNIGHT settled near the back in the beginning, offered a mild run on the fence through the turn and could not be a
factor down the lane.

Footnotes
BUSHIDO broke in a bit but very alertly and several lengths on top, then slowed down under light rating tactics to set the pace inside, began to edge away
turning for home, was only asked past the three-sixteenths and responded to draw off in the stretch under just moderate urging thereafter. LIEUTENANT
STAN was urged forward, pressed briefly from between runners then continued to chase the eventual winner two to three wide but was no match. MUSICAL
STRIDE tucked in off the leaders to track inside into the turn, came out four wide turning for home and ran on. TOWN'S WARRIOR advanced some two
then three wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five deep, was never near enough to threaten. PIDIN broke inwardly forcing a rival in then continued to
appear to be getting in early, clipped heels in behind, saved ground on the turn, was unable to threaten. CONFUSING was forced in at the break, bumped
lightly and clipped heels early, switched out at that point trailing well back, came into upper stretch four wide, was not a threat. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA
chased briefly outside three wide, dropped back and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, PIDIN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND
PLACED SIXTH BEHIND CONFUSING FOR INTERFERENCE.

ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) sat outside the early pacesetters running three wide on the turn, pounced outside of the dueling leaders at the top of the stretch,
opened up through to the furlong marker and held well to the wire. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY settled inside behind the pacesetters turning for home, waited in
upper stretch for clear running room, lost his inside path and had to angle outwards in deep stretch and when finally was clear closed well to be a solid
second at the line. ANARCHY chased the frontrunner throughout the turn, took command briefly to lead in upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner a
furlong to go and just held on to the show winning the nod at the finish. LA BELLEZA NEGRA took the lead soon after the break, set the fractions for the first
half, was collared with a quarter to run, battled inside until mid stretch and weakened late to be involved in a three horse photo for the minors at the finish.
GRAND ALLIANCE trailed inside turning for home, rallied up the fence through the lane and while could not threaten the top two finished with interest on the
rail missing out for third place in a three horse photo. VANBRUGH angled out in the six path to be in the mix of things at the quarter pole, could not keep up
in mid stretch with rivals and stalled at the furlong marker. FORESTER'S TURN stalked between foes in the beginning, nearing the quarter was behind
runners looking for a seam, never found a clear path to run through in the lane and had no finish to offer in the final stages of the race. BIG EXECUTIVE
settled near the back in the early stages, was in tight going into the turn between and behind runners, waited inside through the rest of the turn and was
roused in upper stretch only to come up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
DOINGGOODTROUBLE settled just off the leaders to track inside, came out three wide turning for home, struck the lead at the furlong marker, was clear at
the sixteenth while drifting in, hit the rail late but just lasted. HARDWARE GAP stalked from outside three to four wide on both turns, was into the best stride
late and gaining fast but too late. GRAND GIZMO moved clear and shifted in before the first turn to set the pace inside, was challenged in upper stretch and
outkicked. FACTOTUM raced off the pace four to five wide on both turns and kept on late. WHY NOT BOURBON settled inside, advanced while saving
ground, came out a bit for the stretch and ran on. WILLIAM'S CAUSE pursued the pace two to three wide, weakened in the stretch. FREE SHIPPING
settled at the rear racing off the inside but shifting in a bit on the first turn, passed tired foes. SNOOKERED raced off the pace three to four wide early,
swung out six wide late on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. BET was very hard to load, urged at the break but lacking speed, moved in to the two
path racing mid-pack, tired. BARTICA was fractious in the gate, tucked in two to three wide early, dropped back and tired.
