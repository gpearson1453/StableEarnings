Footnotes
TIGER SPICE sped clear early, showed the way two wide through the turn and stayed clear under right-handed urging. SECRET FIX stalked outside rivals
early on, traveled four then three wide around the turn, chased the winner through the stretch and whittle the gap but had to settle for second best. BIG
SHAMROCK stumbled slightly leaving the gate, was unhurried no the inside and moved closer nearing the turn, asked right-handed past the quarter pole,
cut the corner into the stretch, lacked the needed late response but edged DARLING DONNA for the show honors. DARLING DONNA was closest early in
pursuit, rounded the turn three then two wide, flattened in the furlong grounds and got edged for the show. CRIMSON ROSE chased between rivals then got
put in tight and suffered a mild shuffle at the three-eighths pole, came four wide into the drive and weakened. M IS FOR MAGIC climbed a bit early while
chasing off the rail, trailed three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
FUNKHOUSER away quickly to establish the front, led a bit off the rail through the turn while drawing away from the pack, padded the lead in upper stretch
and won easily under mild encouragement. OTTER POP chased between foes into the turn, came two wide into the stretch and kept on determinedly for a
clear second. MODERA was off a bit slow to begin then hustled early chasing the pace, came out past the half-mile pole, entered the lane four wide, drifted
out through the drive and was along for the show. CONTROLLED FIRE chased off the inside and climbed up the backstretch, angled in and saved ground
on the turn and summoned a mild rally for fourth. SMILING PRINCESS broke a step slow, chased the leader three deep into the turn, was closest in pursuit
three wide into the stretch and flattened out. FAST INVESTMENT broke slow and came in at the start, traveled off the rail then angled in on the turn and
failed to threaten. BEBBANBURG forwardly placed inside a pair of rivals along the rail, lost ground around the bend and moved into the two path, then
weakened in the stretch run. NOMI LACKEE broke a step slow on the outside, lacked early speed dropping back, went three then two wide around the turn
and failed to menace. DREAM STATE shifted in a bit at the start and came away slow, raced near the back on the inside and failed to menace. BLUE RIM
ROCKS broke a step slow, traveled in mid-pack early on, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path then came three wide into the stretch
and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CARMELITA'S MAN stalked in the two path early on, raced along the rail into the final turn, tipped out into the stretch, drifted out a bit and took over past the
eighth pole, bumped with WIN THE DAY late and held on. WIN THE DAY settled early while moving inside, tipped out a bit and waited for room on the far
turn and into the stretch, steered out in the lane, drew alongside CARMELITA'S MAN and bumped that rival late and lost a narrow photo. FLY THE SKY
rated in the two path early on, went up to apply pressure from outside, dueled into the stretch, took over in upper stretch but got outkicked by the top pair in
the final sixteenth. BEE CATCHER sped to the front from inside, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, maintained a short lead through the final
bend and dueled into the stretch, relinquished the lead at the top of the lane and flattened to fourth. ONCOMING bumped from outside in the beginning,
settled off the rail, tipped four wide leaving the final turn, moved out in the lane but could not rally. BENDER broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate,
angled down to the rail on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and failed to respond. GINSBURNED reserved early and moved down to the two path,
fought the rider then pulled forward to race outside the top pair on the backstretch, lost touch with the leaders nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, chased
three wide into the lane and weakened. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN AND, AFTER A REVIEW, RULED THAT
WIN THE DAY INITIATED THE CONTACT WITH CARMELITA'S MAN AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
HERO STATUS brushed lightly with inner rival at the start, was closest in pursuit along the three path early, bid outside the leader at the five-sixteenths
pole, headed rival at the quarter pole, took over shortly after, cleared at the top of the stretch and drew off under a crack of left-handed urging and coasted
in late. PIROLI broke inward from the inside, settled off the pace, was caught behind a wall of rivals on the far turn, steered out and came five wide into the
stretch and rallied to catch ENCODE for second. ENCODE sped to the front in the two path, fought with HERO STATUS on the far turn and gave up control
past the quarter pole, lost touch with that rival at the top of the stretch, churned on through the lane and lost the place. WESTERN CAPE stalked the pace
on the inside, pressed upon on the far turn and exited that bend two wide and lacked a rally. PALAGIO was off slow to begin, tracked off the rail through the
early stages, was on the moved four wide outside rivals on the second bend but flattened out in the furlong grounds. MAGNIFICENT was off a bit slow to
begin, tracked four wide around the first turn, three deep on the second bend and weakened. AMERICAN REFUGEE taken back early, traveled in the two
path early on, entered the lane three wide and came up empty. NAUGHTY NIKO broke out and brushed lightly with the winner, became rank chasing off the
rail on the clubhouse turn, tracked between foes in the middle stages, lost ground and angled to the inside late on the far turn and weakened.

EMPIRE PASS was closest in pursuit two wide into the turn, challenged with a quarter mile remaining, took over at the top of the stretch, disposed of
GYPSY LYNN nearing the eight pole and held safely. SHARED FUTURE dropped back early, went four wide into the turn, steered down to the inside near
the quarter pole, tipped out midstretch and rallied for the place. LOMA VISTA raced off the rail near the back, traveled two wide then angled out leaving the
turn, summoned a mild rally but failed to threaten the winner. GYPSY LYNN sped clear and set the pace up the backstretch, challenged by the winner at the
quarter pole, fought back to the stretch then gave up command and weakened in the final furlong. YOUTEYOURHONOR was off slow to start, tracked off
the rail, came four wide into the lane, got crowded a bit between rivals midstretch and weakened. KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT tossed her head after the
gates opened up, pulled hard past the half-mile pole and had to take hold nearing the turn, traveled along the inside then two wide into the lane, angled out
in the stretch and flattened. O'NEILL'S LEGACY stumbled and broke out, chased three wide into the turn, moved out and came six wide into the stretch and
weakened. SWEET TALKED broke a step slow, sat off the pace, entered the turn four wide then exited seven wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
THORNE HOUSE stalked the leader up the backstretch, bid from outside with three-furlong remaining, dueled and took over over past the quarter pole, put
away inner rival exiting the turn and drew off in the lane. QUICK FINISH broke well then settled on the inside, eased off the rail and came four wide into the
stretch, finished determinedly in the final furlong and proved second best. THE LITTLE H MAN raced off the rail at the back, went three wide into the turn,
angled down to the inside, tipped out and split foes midstretch and rallied belatedly for the show honors. NICE GUY CLAY forwardly placed in the early
going, entered the turn along the rail, tipped out and came three wide into the drive but flattened in the late stages. SMILEFORME tracked outside rivals,
rounded the bend four then five wide and lacked further response. PYEONG CHANG showed the way up the backstretch, gained company at the
three-eighths pole, dueled and lost command past the quarter pole, then gave way in the stretch. SMILING AT VAL settled off the pace, checked and threw
her head around at the quarter pole and failed to menace after. NORTHVALE ROAD was off slow and bothered from outside leaving the gate, raced near
the back early on, was along the rail then two to three wide into the stretch and lacked further response. LOUD MOUTH coaxed along racing off the pace,
went five then six wide on the turn and had little left for the drive. SQUALOTORO got crowded between rivals early then dropped back, trailed outside a rival
into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and made no impact. CURRY stalked off the rail, coaxed three, four, then five wide on the turn and came up
empty.

wide then along the rail early, went three wide into the far turn, steered out to the five path and improved position. PRINCESS CATERINA broke well and
vied three deep then bumped with inner rival early on the clubhouse turn, tracked the top pair off the rail then between rivals, angled to the inside on the far
