Footnotes
EL CALIENTE LADY was rated early three wide, then dropped to the inside to draft behind the duel on the turn, angled out four wide leaving the turn for
aim, made a bid and drifted in slightly by the sixteenth pole but was corrected and drew away late to prove best, driving. FORT PIKE set a pressured pace
early two wide, then dueled for the lead two wide on the turn, made a three wide bid leaving the turn, but could not hold off the winner late, second best.
EYESEEMONEY was reserved early, came sight wide into the lane and rallied well late. ST MARIA was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally in
an even effort. ABIGAIL G was settled early and raced four to five wide on the turn and had no rally. MOODY RAFAELA pressed the early pace and then
went up to duel for the lead on the inside on the turn and weakened the final furlong. VIOLET SHADOWS tracked the early pace four wide, then chased the
pace three to four wide on the turn and then was empty. I'M A CUSTOM TO IT was off three lengths last at the start and failed to menace.

Footnotes
UNCLE ARTIE prompted the early pace and made a two wide bid leaving the turn and drew off in the final furlong after a couple pops with the riding crop to
prove best. SOURNOIS set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled with the winner on the turn, ran on late to regain the place award, no match to the
winner. VINYL was settled early and was five wide down the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn and loomed boldly but flattened out the final
furlong. MEGANS LAD tracked the pace three wide early and lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. CANDIZAR was four wide into the first turn,
chased the pace four wide and tired. ITS A CITY DAY was settled nicely on the inside and dropped back. LUCKY STREAKER failed to respond.

Footnotes
TENOR dueled for the lead along the inside, made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear, then drew off to prove much the best under right handed crop
urging. HALF A DOODLE pressed the dueling leaders three wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn but proved to be no match for the winner but
clearly second best. MO VODKA was off slowly, settled in the back on the inside, angled out in the stretch and finished willingly to get up fot show award.
MY HEAVY SON was rated along early, saved ground on the turn and had no kick, missed show award. JUST HANGIN RIDGE dueled for the lead outside
the winner but weakened in the drive. DOUBLE BOGEY stalked the early pace four wide and was empty in the drive. OSO NEGRO was allowed to settle
early three wide and had no response.
