EMBRACE unhurried early, inside run to the turn full of run, angled out, responded well to run away in handy fashion while well clear. FLOYD G pressed
leader to the turn, dueled mid stretch while no match for winner and proving best of the rest. ROBUST was slow into stretch outside, ran on evenly from the
turn and stretch run while three wide for the show spot and no real threat to the top pair. INFINITE ZEAL rushed between horses to the front, could not
respond and gave way readily from the turn. PAPA RED was done early and faded back quickly. MAGNA RULER lunged at the start, regrouped, between
horses to the turn, angled out widest and stopped from the quarter pole.

QUEEN TIGER glided along chasing leader to far turn, took over into the stretch and dug in gamely to prevail. EIDA'S STORM perfect position to far turn,
loomed a threat in the stretch but could not sustain the bid and proved best of the rest. COMPETITIVE FIRE good position early, shuffled back at the half,
re-rallied for the show award.. MI ENLACE never far back, rallied wide at the half but went evenly in the stretch run. CHINA STAR speed to the front, battled
inside to quarter pole but came up empty. SWEET TOOTSIE LU saved ground throughout with a middle move but could not go on from that point. ROYAL
CHEYANNE through early, stopped.
