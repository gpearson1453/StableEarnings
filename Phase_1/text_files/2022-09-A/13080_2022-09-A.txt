Footnotes
LET'S HAVE FUN broke sharp to lead early on, gave way inside with two furlongs remaining, fought on stubbornly through the stretch inside to rebid with
seventy yards left and won inching away at the end. WESTERN TROUBLE was a bit slow into stride outside, quickly recovered to contest the pace into the
turn racing three wide, took command with a quarter to go and battled outside down the lane only to give way to his inside rival he passed nearing the wire.
STRIKING HEIR was on the rail keeping in close range to the contesting leaders through the turn, angled out for the drive in the three path, could not
threaten the top two down the stretch but finished up well enough to be a clear third. TOO LEGIT stalked mid pack between runners on the turn, was asked
for run with a quarter to go, battled with an outside foe at the furlong marker and got up for a minor share. BIG LEAGUE tracked mid pack outside of rivals,
was roused in upper stretch, battled for a small share through the lane and ran on evenly to the finish. PRIDE AND PASSION trailed the field down the
backside, angled to the rail midway on the turn, was roused in upper stretch racing on the fence and could not get involved.

Footnotes
MI TORMENTA tracked inside, cut the corner with lots of room turning for home, gradually gained then edged past inside the final sixteenth under steady
urging. MY FINAL TRICK attended the pace from outside, applied more pressure on the turn going three then four wide on that bend and striking the lead
leaving the turn, had a narrow lead till late and was outfinished. NICE COMPANY attended the early pace from between rivals, tracked in behind two to
three wide on the turn and into upper stretch, moved in a path and kept on evenly. SWIRLING CANDY set the pace racing off the rail, drifted to about the
three to four path turning for home, was overtaken in upper stretch, continued to float out a little bit in the lane and lacked the needed late kick. ALLPAIDUP
was a bit reluctant to load, settled toward the rear early, saved ground on the turn and improved inside. TAKE IT EASY switched outside a foe early, went
three then four wide on the turn, moved out a bit in upper stretch and ran on. WHAT A BEAUT was ridden along throughout racing outside off the pace four
to five wide, failed to rally. BOSSALINA failed to threaten while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
OL' BLONDIE tracked inside sitting just behind the engaging frontrunners throughout the turn, angled just off the leaders with a quarter to run, found her
best stride late and was drawing away at the wire. FOREST B broke sharp to hound the early speed just outside, battled for the lead two furlongs to go, put
away that inside rival to open up in mid stretch and could not hold off the fast gaining winner nearing the finish line. STERLING SPEED settled outside of
horses trailing through the turn, was angled out widest for the drive in the five path in upper stretch and closed belatedly to get up winning the photo for third.
SWIRLING DANCER stalked on the turn racing three wide just a few lengths behind the frontrunners, showed some late energy in mid stretch and finished
up between rivals to get up for a minor award. LOADED QUESTION was positioned near the back in the beginning, angled just off a tiring rival in upper
stretch and could not find enough late between runners to get involved at the finish. VEERY broke well and was hustled early to get the lead, was collared
outside with a quarter remaining and faltered in the late stages of the race. SPEEDY LYNN settled at the back in the early going, put in a mild run entering
the far turn to be in a good position inside with three eighths remaining, was ridden to go on in upper stretch and retreated on the fence down the lane.

Footnotes
TENPENNY NAIL settled toward the back and shifted in early, advanced between runners three wide into the turn, shifted six wide into the stretch, kicked
on to get up late under moderate hand urging. JIMMY IS A BREEZE stalked from outside just off the leaders, advanced four wide on the turn taking charge
past the quarter pole, was collared late. P. S. RISING STAR was brushed at the start, came in early forcing a rival in entering the gap, pursued the leaders
inside, angled five wide into upper stretch then shifted in about mid-stretch, ran on to get up for show honors. MOON POOL settled outside toward the rear,
went six wide on the turn coming eight deep into upper stretch, ran on. HUSHEMUP was forwardly-placed to contend for the lead inside, had no late kick.
REINS OF PURPLE was bumped lightly at the start, set the pace two wide facing pressure from an inside rival, lacked the needed late kick. PICTUREDAY
JESSICA broke outwardly brushing a rival lightly at the start, was then forced in by that foe having to steady slightly, saved ground on the turn then came
out in the stretch and ran on. SKIPOVER bumped a rival lightly at the start, was forwardly-placed stalking in behind the leaders three wide, came up empty.
SHE'S SO COLD raced outside mid-pack five wide into the turn, began to drop back while shifting in a bit about the three-eighths, continued to fade.

Footnotes
SILENT GUROO broke sharp to dictate the pace after the start, opened up on the field nearing the eighth pole and was kept to the task late to win
comfortably in the end. DANGER stalked outside mid pack through the turn, travelling four wide started to pass runners five sixteenths from home, had dead
aim on the winner in mid stretch and could not gain late to challenge at the finish. ONEZY'S DREAM tracked on the rail just behind the pacesetters through
the turn, was in a good position inside two furlongs remaining and could not offer enough late for the drive and had to settle for third. WICKED MIAH stalked
inside in the third flight through the turn, began to pick up horses at the quarter pole, rallied between foes in the three path at the furlong marker and finished
up late to be on the fringes. PLUIE D'AVRIL settled near the back in the beginning, angled out widest turning for home in the five path and passed tiring
runners in mid stretch. PINO IN A PURSE tracked outside in the second flight behind the frontrunners, was asked behind foes at the top of the stretch and
could not get involved late for the drive to the wire. GLOVANNA trailed in the early stages of the race and was never a factor. AIRY FAIRY pressed the pace
from the onset, was asked to go challenge for the lead three sixteenths from home, offered little response and backed away between runners with a furlong
remaining.

Footnotes
GORMLEY GIRL broke outwardly just a bit, was outpaced early, began to pick it up four then five wide on the turn, came in a bit in upper stretch on the
wrong lead, got into her best stride late to just get up nearing the wire. IS THERE A FOREST rated off the pace near inside, advanced willingly on the turn
while beginning to move out late on that bend, asked a bit past the quarter pole and entered upper stretch four wide, took over a furlong from home but was
outfinished. BLUEYED PRINCESS stalked the clear leader inside saving ground into the turn, came out while advancing to bid and take a brief lead at the
top of the stretch, had no extra to kick on with the top ones. SKINNY DIPPIN brushed with a rival lightly at the start, went three to four wide on the turn
gaining on the leaders, shifted in past the eighth pole and ran on inside but too late. CARLA'S HONOR brushed with a rival at the start, shifted in lacking
early speed and racing toward the back, went four wide on the turn coming six wide into upper stretch and improved position. MOMMA CARRIE pursued the
leaders mid-pack three wide, weakened. TAPITURE WAY was coaxed clear inside to dictate terms, weakened. ROYAL ROCKER broke a bit awkwardly
and slowly, moved up a inside up the backstretch, began to retreat about the three-eighths despite encouragement, tired.

Footnotes
HOMBRE kept close range to the frontrunner early, pressed the leader entering the turn rating kindly just off that ones flank, took control easily five
sixteenths out, opened up on the field in mid stretch and began to edge away even more nearing the wire. MONEY PRINTER stalked mid pack just outside
through the half, rallied four wide to bid turning for home, drifted inwards three sixteenths out while being urged and could not threaten the winner but had
enough left late to be a clear second. ENGLISH CONQUEROR tracked mid pack on the rail through the turn, was ridden aggressively between foes in
upper stretch and kept on the final eighth to hold well to the finish for the show award. AVOMAN was positioned near the back in the early stages, loomed
into contention racing five wide at the top of the stretch and stalled with a furlong left to settle for a minor placing at the wire. DUN DRUM settled near the
rear down the backstretch, trailed the field while saving ground through the turn, could not reach contention in upper stretch and passed a stopping runner
down the lane. HADDASSAH showed good speed to lead through the turn, was collared by the winner five sixteenths out, offered little resistance inside
turning for home and stopped at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
C C'S KINGDOM dueled inside, edged clear past the seven-sixteenths, had open lengths by the three-eighths saving ground on the turn, widened into
upper stretch and was kept to the task. TARADAR steadied from between rivals soon after the break, shifted in and advanced near but off the inside, was in
a bit tight on heels at the seven-sixteenths, had room to split rivals at the three-eighths, loomed a threat at the quarter but could not kick on with the winner
and held the place. POT COMMITTED switched outside a foe when in a bit tight early, raced in behind rivals three wide on the turn, came out in the stretch,
kept on but was too late for second. MIGHTY PELE was bumped at the break, angled in and advanced inside, was within striking distance early on the turn,
evened out in the lane. TRAGICALLY FUNNY settled off the pace, fanned seven wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit and ran on mildly. DETERMINED
FRIEND was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn and improved position. BOLD DIAMONDS BFF stalked outside five wide, failed to rally. FREE
CAT bumped a rival at the start, dueled briefly outside the eventual winner two to three wide, weakened. SCENIC HOLIDAY was forwardly-positioned
between rivals up the backstretch, in tight and dropped back a bit at the seven-sixteenths, continued four wide on the turn and ran on evenly. AORISTOS
chased briefly while off the inside, dropped back and failed to rally. PAINTING THE MOON broke outwardly, was outpaced and never near enough to
threaten.
