Footnotes
UNRIVALED QUEEN ducked out at the start, was urged disputing the pace outside a rival, then a bit off the rail racing into the turn and held sway to the end
under firm encouragement. FACCIA BELLA was urged inside the eventual winner prompting the pace in the opening stages, switched outside that rival
racing into the turn and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. SWEET SHUGS hopped, then was bumped at the start, settled last racing
to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and made an effort to gain some position. MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM broke inwards bumping MISS MAC
MAC, was righted to track the leaders three wide into the turn but lacked the needed late bid. MISS MAC MAC, bumped, then pinched back at the start,
switched outside foes to make some brief progress four wide racing into the turn, shifted inwards entering the lane and came up empty midstretch. TOP
HAT TIGRESS ducked out at the start, bumping MISS MAC MAC and dropped out early.

Footnotes
MS CORONADO CHROME angled to the inside stalking just off the first flight under light rating to the backstretch, switched out three wide nearing upper
stretch and produced a solid late response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm handling. PRINCESS OF MALIBU, off slowly, settled along the
inside racing to the far turn, angled four wide racing through the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. MIZHIPZLETUS
was urged prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the far turn, pressed the issue past midstretch but weakened late. AVARIE, off a bit slowly, was rated
along the inside just off the second flight, was prompted to advance along the rail racing into upper stretch, was caught in tight quarters midstretch and was
outkicked for a share. RATTLEME, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, dueled past midstretch and gave out late. MIZZEN
MILLIONS tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
TONKA WARRIOR was rated off the leaders three wide between foes racing to the turn, made a steady gain in that path racing into upper stretch and
responded to stout pressure to just edge WESTONS WILDCAT on the wire. The latter bobbled at the start, was urged prompting a rival's pace on the
backstretch, took over midway through the bend to go clear into upper stretch but just failed to contain the winner. GEAUX YOSHKA tracked off the first
flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire.
BUGLER, off slowly, then bumped at the, switched out four wide in the opening quarter, continued in that path into the turn and lacked the needed final bid.
LESLIE'S GOLD was urged disputing the pace inside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into the lane. FOREMAN, off slowly, was
urged to contention along the rail in the opening stages but faded early.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY HARRY was urged to the lead while angling inside, dictated the pace into the backstretch while extending the margin and held grudgingly to the
end under stout pressure. JUSTICE WARRIOR, caught four wide racing through the first turn tracking off the second flight, advanced three deep after a half
to bid outside the winner racing into the far turn, pressed the issue past midstretch but proved only second best. XAVEY DAVE was rated off the second
flight between foes to the far turn, then split foes three wide racing through the stretch to close the gap while prevailing for a share. KING OF THE KIDS
settled along the inside early, split foes racing into the far turn, swung five wide entering the stretch and continued willingly. NO SLO MO, off slowly, settled
outside foes off the second flight early, advanced four wide, then three wide between foes into the far turn but faded in the drive. ARDANWOOD settled
between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn making brief progress nearing the lane but flattened out
late. FREEDOM FLASH, urged to a forward placing along the rail racing to the backstretch, gave way into the far turn. CAN'T BEAT ME tracked off the
second flight along the inside, steadied off a tiring foe racing into the far turn and had no late bid. DON'T BOX ME IN, extremely reluctant to load in the gate,
was urged three wide pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch but emptied out between foes racing into the far turn. CITRUS BAY, restless in the gate,
flashed brief pace between foes as part of the second but dropped out early.

Footnotes
VISUAL MAGIC, unhurried in the opening stages dropping off the second flight, was prompted to make a steady advance three wide racing into the turn,
continued in that path into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wrest the advantage in time under strong handling. I AM THE BOSS was
urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, shook clear entering the turn while shifting to the inside, held sway to midstretch but faltered
late. AND ISLES, off a step slowly, was urged to contention inside rivals, tipped out racing into the turn to lodge a brief bid between foes entering the lane
but had no final kick. SAILING ALONG settled last in the opening stages, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and continued with interest to improve
position. BIG BLUE NOTE, urged along the rail prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, shifted out entering the lane and gave way. KARALINKA
was rated off the second flight in the opening stages, angled to the inside leaving the turn but had no closing bid. Y NOT SIZZLE tracked off the second
flight along the inside, raced in close quarters on the bend saving ground but offered no rally. LATER DAYS made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes
but emptied out early.

Footnotes
BIRDIE BE GONE, prominent four wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace three wide into the turn, lost some ground to a rival nearing upper stretch
but continued with a steady effort to wrest the advantage nearing midstretch and go clear under brisk handling. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN, in touch with the
leaders between foes in the opening stages, was eased off the leaders while switching four wide racing into the turn to track just off those rivals, then
continued in that path to late stages to prove best of the others. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN switched outside rivals in early stages, raced five wide into the
turn, continued in that path to upper stretch and prevailed for a share late. SECRET MISTRESS, forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages,
was urged to bid for command along the rail racing into the turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. KEBA
LUCKY DAY was rated just off the second flight between foes in early stages, angled to the inside racing through the turn but had no late bid. HALF SCOUT
vied for command between foes from the outset into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. PRICELESS MIRACLE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ROMAN PHAROAH, urged between foes, then outside a rival pressing the pace from the outset, edged clear entering the turn, held sway on a narrow
advantage into the stretch, then drifted out markedly in late stages while grudgingly maintaining the lead. ONE SON OF A CHIEF tracked just off the leaders
along the inside in the opening stages, tipped out racing into the turn advancing on the pacesetter between foes, bid three deep in midstretch, then altered
course inside the winner when losing his path late. MR NAVIGATOR tracked just off the leaders in the four path in early stages, continued three wide into
the turn, was fanned four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to finish on even terms for second on the wire. HI HO CHEERIO settled inside
foes in the last flight racing to the turn, tipped out entering the stretch and made an effort to gain some position between foes. CAN HE STORM was urged
inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, couldn't match terms with the winner entering the bend and gave way midstretch. BLAME
BISHOP settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn and failed to menace. FREIBURG settled between foes in the last flight and proved no threat.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF ONE SON OF A CHIEF LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
LATE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED,

GUEST CHECK, forwardly placed between rivals racing to the first turn, conceded the lead to track just off the pacesetter through the backstretch,
continued with a steady bid to challenge for command leaving the far turn, took over midstretch while shifting inwards under pressure and just held the late
challenge of SPEEDY DAREDEVIL at the wire in a stiff drive. The latter broke a step slowly, was urged three deep between foes to challenge for command
into the first turn, sped clear while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, held sway to the second bend, resisted when challenged on the far turn
into upper stretch, lost some ground to the leader, then lost his path to that foe leaving midstretch while being steadied slightly, switched out to the three
path in the closing stages and responded to stout pressure to produce a solid second effort to just miss at the wire. HONEY'S SUPERMAN was settled last
dropping well off the leaders racing to the far turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. RED WAVE,
forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the leaders to the far turn, faded nearing upper stretch. WILDCAT HAGRID was settled inside foes early,
switched out three wide on the backstretch to lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn but quickly came up empty. LL'S CLASSY DUDE, caught four wide
racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend, soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF SPEEDY ENOUGH
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST GUEST CHECK ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE STRETCH
RUN AND DISQUALIFIED GUEST CHECK FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.

GRUNDER was settled between foes in the last flight in the opening stages, dropped back entering the turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch gathering
momentum and rallied to the front in time under firm encouragement. COAL TOWN ROAD sprinted clear of the field along the inside racing through the
backstretch, held sway on a comfortable margin to midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. PERIPATETIC tracked the leader inside foes in second
flight, tipped off the inside racing through the turn, continued to make steady progress to gain terms with the pacesetter late but was outkicked by the top
pair. GLASSATO broke awkwardly when having his head turned at the start, was urged in brief pursuit of the leader three wide on the backstretch but
emptied out into the lane. WILDCAT SKY dropped out early.
