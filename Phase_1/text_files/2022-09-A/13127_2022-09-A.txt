was no match for the winner. SWEET LADY LANA broke slowly, was void of early speed, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid to along for show.
PRECIOUS ONE raced inside and had brief speed only. BIG WAVE BETTY was outrun in an even effort. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM showed speed to the
turn and stopped. The rider of SPEEDY GIGI claimed foul against the rider of MISCHIEVOUS EFFORT for alleged interference on the second turn. No

ARRABIATA stalked the pace, challenged between horses on the backstretch, drew clear into the stretch and widened while kept to task. TRUTH TO
POWER raced in the second flight, angled out for the drive and closed well to earn place. THE LONGEST NIGHT stalked the pace, challenged three across
on the turn, fell back, hung late and settled for show. FULL VISION saved ground, lacked a rally and did not threaten. HIGH FLYIN TIGER went seven wide
on the first turn and failed to threaten in an even effort. THE THIRD RING set the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. SHADYFIED was not a
factor. MIZZEN POWER was outrun. Hand timed.

position late. SENORADIABLO failed to threaten in an even effort. HOLY TUTTA BELLA pressed the pace along the inside, tired into the turn and stopped.

DISCERNMENT set the pace, drew off on the second turn for a clear lead and held well in a driving finish. MS SALLY was void of early speed, closed
willingly and was gaining late. LUCKY STEPPER raced close to the pace inside, bid, hung late and held safely for show. LILA'S LUCKY LADY was never far
back, had nothing left for the drive and faded. SEVEN POINTS failed to menace in an even effort. SHOE GAME got away well, stalked to the turn, fell back
and gave way. REALREALGOOD was not a factor. BURNADEBT was through after a half. Hand timed.

SUCCESS RATE stalked the pace, closed steadily, wore down his rivals and drew clear late. KONA COAST set a pressured pace to the sixteenth pole and
was outclosed to finish second best. UNCLE FLOYD pressed the pace while racing between horses, challenged on the turn, didn't have enough late and
settled for show. THEY'RE GRRREAT got away well, pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, bore out and dropped back. OUTLAW BY
NATURE was not a factor. SMILING MATT raced inside, showed speed to the turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. SPORT COAT broke slowly,
trailed the field and failed to contend. Hand timed.
