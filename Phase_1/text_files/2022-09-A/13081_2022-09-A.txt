Footnotes
LEAVE THEM BEHIND stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to engage BETTER BELIEVE nearing the quarter, vied with that rival and
edged away late. BETTER BELIEVE set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied with
that foe nearing the quarter and gave way grudgingly late. NEW MEXICO JEREMY pressed the pace of BETTER BELIEVE from the inside and gave way
through the final furlong. M G LOOKINGOOD lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths marker and back out
with a furlong to run and finished with a belated bid. DOER NOT A FAKER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, lugged in nearing
the furlong marker and finished evenly. DANJERUS STORM raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, was pushed inward in
mid-stretch and was not a factor. PAINTED SMOKE was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. MR RIGGER raced off the
pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. THE FINAL FOOTNOTE lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn and did
not reach contention. SOUTHWEST SILVER showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane.
