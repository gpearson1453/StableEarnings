Footnotes
REMOTE raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the
far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. TIMO trailed the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, began to improve
position while racing in the two path around the far turn, could not compete with the winner in the lane and chased that rival home, the best of the rest.
ANVIL led the field the first time down the stretch, continued to show the way around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground
around the turn, was caught at the top of the lane and kept on from there. DYNA MAST saved ground at the back of the pack in the early going, navigated
the far turn from the two path and gained some ground in late stretch while never threatening. SPIRITUAL GHOST raced in the two path in the early going,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the second bend and passed tiring horses in the lane. UNION LEAGUE
hopped up slightly leaving the gate, saved ground in the middle of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the
three path, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. TIGER TO REMEMBER saved ground around the first turn, chased
the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired in the lane. SMOOTH SAILING raced off the pace
on the outside in the early going, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid.

BATTLE BLING tracked in the five path, was cued while bidding from the five path at the top of the lane, and drew clear. JILTED BRIDE stalked in the two
path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. HASHTAG LUCKY led from the four path, was roused from the three path around
the far turn, but faded late to show. TAP DANCE FEVER stumbled at the start and trailed from the five path, was ridden in the seven path into the stretch,
but finished evenly. INSIDE THE BOX chased in the four path, was driven from the two path into the lane, but was empty. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) rated from
the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF SNOW bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to track the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path
around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and pulled clear in the final furlong. FLYIN BESSIE stalked the frontrunner on the outside through
the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground in late stretch. INVENTING ANNA was sent to an early lead despite
brushing with the horse to her inside at the break, showed the way while saving ground up the backstretch and around the turn and was caught late.
SILENT SWINGER bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
three and four path and improved position in the final furlong. HUMOR SENSE stumbled at the break, raced off the pace in the early going, swung to the
outside headed into the turn, entered the stretch in the five path and kept on from there. LEVISA trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path
around the turn, switched to the inside in upper stretch and passed tiring horses from there. HANG THE MOON raced in the middle of the pack on the inside
in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. SOUPER TROPICAL raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and weakened in the lane. LURE'EM IN brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered
to chase the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and flattened out in the lane.
SONG OF AMERICA pressed the pace between horses early, dueled from the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch. HIGH DONNA bumped with
the horse to her inside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack between horses, angled in to save ground around the turn and tired from there. REBEL
CONSORT raced at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the six path and was empty in the lane.

off in the final furlong. MATTA tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole, brushing
with JUSTWAVEANDSMILE in the process and chased the winner to the wire. YES AND YES raced off the pace in the early going, came around the turn in
the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late. COUNTY FINAL bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate,
settled at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and gained ground quickly in late stretch.
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the two path, was bumped and forced to take up when
MATTA came into his lane in midstretch and kept on to the wire. CANNON'S ROAR raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. NOBODY LISTENS pressed the pace on the outside through
the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch. SHOWTIME CAT trailed the field early, saved ground around
the turn and made no bid. WARRIOR'S PRIDE led the field up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and tired in the final furlong.
BLESSED ARION raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, was squeezed back and forced to take up headed into the turn, raced
in the two path from there and was empty in the lane. IMPERIAL KING bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack
between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. A OBJECTION WAS MADE BY THE RIDER OF

SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) broke a bit slowly, settled at the back of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far
turn from the four path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground quickly in the final furlong to pull clear late. SPARKLE BLUE raced in
the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued pursuit of that rival from the three path around the far turn,
was bumped and forced out at the quarter pole when THISNAMEISOKAY swerved into her and finished well from there. CANDY LIGHT trailed the field on
the outside through the opening half mile, began to improve position from the three path around the far turn and continued to gain ground in late stretch.
LADY PUCHI bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
raced in the two path around the far turn, was bumped hard and forced to take up near the quarter pole when THISNAMEISOKAY blew the turn and kept on
to the wire despite that. OMIXOCHITL raced in the two path around the first turn, settled between horses in the middle of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second bend, was forced to alter her route when THISNAMEISOKAY interfered at the quarter pole, dueled down the
lane and weakened late. FULL COUNT FELICIA raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, improved position while
racing in the four path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was outkicked. SURPRISINGLY raced in tight quarters while running in the two
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn still in the two path and finished
evenly. THISNAMEISOKAY led the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail coming around the second
bend, veered out sharply in upper stretch, taking out several horses in the process and tired between horses from there. SCHLOFMITZ saved ground
around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the next quarter of a mile, navigated the far turn from the three and four path and
was empty in the lane. PHAROAH'S SONG bumped mildly with the horse to her outside at the break, settled off the pace between horses in the early going,
navigated the far turn from the two and three path and was outkicked in the stretch. CATICHE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. OAKHURST raced in the three path around the
first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the far turn and faded further in the
lane. THEREARENORULES trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path
and made no bid. TREASURE OF WAR saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. UPON

CAPENSIS raced in midpack from the three path, ranged up under coaxing to bid from the six path at the top of the stretch, drifted in slightly throughout the
stretch, and drew clear. CALIFORNIA FROLIC rated from the three path, was driven along while swinging out to the eight path into the lane, and rallied
down the center for place. LIMITED LIABILITY was unhurried from the three path, moved up under a drive while in the five path around the turn, got
squeezed slightly at the top of the lane, and ran on to show. UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB) broke in at the start, was wellback and inside early, was ridden
along while tipping out to the six path into the stretch, and stayed on. MARWAD (GB) was behind and inside early, was hustled from the three path into the
lane, and gained late. CATNIP stalked from the three path, was cued while making a bid from the three path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly.
ROYAL PATRONAGE (FR) set the pace from inside, was coaxed from the two path into the stretch, but yielded. GRAND DAVID chased in the four path but
faded in the stretch. WOW WHATA SUMMER tracked from the two path, saved ground into the lane but was empty. VANCE SCHOLARS prompted the
