Footnotes
ELLAS MY LOVE very nice clean pocket position after leaving the first turn, stayed off the leaders down the backside, three wide pursuit around the far turn,
stayed outside top pair through the stretch, under a long steady drive went clear late. MYSTIC LINK pressed the leader around the first turn, stayed glued to
the hip of the pace setter entering far turn, felt pressure from both sides, fought on hard through stretch, finished willingly for the place. MOROCCO very
slow into stride, moved up between runners around the far turn, shifted out five wide when called on for best run, stayed middle of the lane and gained
ground late, never a threat to the top pair. DAVIDIC LINE coaxed his speed a long way around the oval, under constant outside pressure, called on for extra
leaving the quarter pole, could not hold off closers, finished evenly in deep stretch. VICARAGE raced off the pace and along the inside, moved up while
racing along the rail, came under a heavy ride around the far turn, finished up even under the wire. SASSY KING slow into stride, well off the pace down the
backside, pressed hard far turn, outrun. JEEZUM JIM tracked leaders around the first turn, raced off the pace and off the rail backside, urged on far turn,
outrun.

Footnotes
INTREPID DAYDREAM tracked the leader into the turn, raced along the inside around the turn, shook off outside foe, quickly pounced on the leader leaving
the quarter pole, clear sailing through the stretch. PLANE DRUNK slow into stride, came under a very serious ride around the turn, stayed under a steady
drive through the stretch, came home clearly second best today. FLAVA'S DREAM raced well off the early pace, moved up along the inside around the turn,
shifted out past weary foes nearing the eighth pole, gained ground late never a threat to winner. RATHER NOSY sent out front after the bell, held sway out
front around the turn, collared at the quarter pole, steadily weakened stretch. DECOUPAGE stalked early on, pressed along the inside for run, had no late
bid. SEQUIN LADY slow into stride, three wide around turn, outrun through the stretch.
