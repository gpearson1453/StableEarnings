Footnotes
MR MURGO was bumped at the break, quick to begin to set the early pace, raced near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and held to prove best
under steady pressure. OPEN CARRY raced off the early pace, hard ridden through the far turn while racing five wide, swung seven to eight wide through
the upper stretch to race from the outside in the drive and closed in well on the leader late to finish second best. HELLO JACK was bumped at the break,
chased the early pace, raced near the rail in the stretch run and moved up to improve position. MORE DRAMA was coaxed along while racing just to the
outside of rival while racing two deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. KING SPARROW chased the pace from the inside and weakened through the
drive. HELLO SUCKER was off slowly, raced two wide near the quarter pole and lacked a bid. MAXX MAGIC dwelt at the start, raced far back early on and
never was involved after the troubling beginning. Stewards reviewed the break and deemed Maxx Magic had a fair opportunity at the break. PLUMA ROJA
lost ground and raced far back to never threaten.

Footnotes
VINNIE VAN GO dueled for the lead from the inside, raced well clear through the upper stretch and held well under steady handling. NACHO PAPA chased
the pace from the outside, raced two wide near the five sixteenths pole, moved up five wide just past the three sixteenths pole and was no match for the
winner in the drive. CATCHING FISH dropped back off the early going, angled widest through the upper stretch and closed belatedly. OLD TIME REVIVAL
was void of early speed, raced six wide through the upper stretch and had not enough. BEINFUN coaxed along early, raced along the inside through the far
turn and raced evenly late. UNCAPTURED KING was off slowly, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and lacked a bid. UNPUBLISHED dueled from
the outside of rival while being hard ridden and gave way. PER RULING FROM THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, VINNIE VAN GO WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

hnadling. DOC BALLARD was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early, advanced through the far turn, raced five wide near the three sixteenths
pole and was no match for the winner. MAN ICE was coaxed along early, shifted out five wide near the quarter pole and made a good late bid. MAJOR
DEAL stalked the pace while racing three wide and weakened a bit through the stretch run. FAST LIVIN chased the early leader from the inside and
weakened. RUN MAX RUN was coaxed along early while racing four wide and was done early.

Footnotes
SPICY EMPINADA vied for the early lead while racing between rivals, dug in past the eighth pole and prevailed under all out pressure in a determined run.
FEISTY SARA vied for the early lead while racing three wide, had a clear lead near the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. TWO BEER BUZZ
chased the pace, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair. SARA KALI was away alertly, vied for the early lead
from the inside and tired. BRITTY veered to the outside at the break, was void of early speed and never was a factor. I LOVE IRELAND raced far back and
never was involved.

Footnotes
MEET THE BEAUTY chased the early pace, moved up two wide in the stretch run, surged late and got up under all out pressure. GOLDEN ISLE was quick
to begin to set the early pace from the inside, had a clear lead at the eighth pole, shortened strides late and missed in a game effort. KINGSTON QUEEN
tracked the early leader from the outside while racing two wide, raced four deep in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. YOGA QUEEN stalked
the pace from the outside, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out in the drive. ARROW SHAPE settled off the early pace, raced
five wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late. CUPID AUSTIN raced off the early pace, was four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a
rally. LOVIN MAKES CENTS was shuffled at the break, raced off the early pace, raced from the outside in the stretch run, clipped heels nearing the eighth
pole and never threatened thereafter. RIDE ON BEAUTY dropped back early, raced evenly and had no late rally. BELLA ROMANCE was off very slow, lost
a considerable amount of ground at the start and never threatened. MUGURUZA coaxed along from the inside and faded. SENORITA SALSA dropped near
the back early on, raced towards the inside and had no response.

Footnotes
RUNNING MEMORIES pressed the pace from the outside of rival while racing two wide, raced to the inside of Poseidon's Passion in the stretch run, dug in
and prevailed under all out pressure in a determined run. POSEIDON'S PASSION chased the early pace, raced two to three wide into the far turn, raced
four wide in the stretch run and just missed in a game effort. QUINOA TIFAH was hustled from the outside, raced four wide through the far turn and moved
up to improve position. MISS AURAMET showed good early foot from the inside to set the pace and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. DIAMOND
WOW was off slowly, raced near the rail at the quarter pole and had no late run. SAMMY'S TOWN void of early speed, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and never threatened. SIX FEET APART chased the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and weakened through the drive.
