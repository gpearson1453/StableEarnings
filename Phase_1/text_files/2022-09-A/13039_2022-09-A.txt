Footnotes
DRAMA CHORUS broke readily, angled inwards moving clear of the field dictating terms on a comfortable margin to the backstretch, held sway to the far
turn, widened through the stretch and was kept to firm left handed encouragement. TWO BY TWO was rated off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, shifted out splitting foes three deep nearing upper stretch, then angled inside rivals in the closing stages to edge a rival for the place honors.
SONNY SMACK tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the first turn, was reserved dropping back from that position racing to the backstretch,
swung out four wide nearing the lane and continued with interest while being just outkicked for second. HARD ATTACK tracked off the second flight outside
a rival in the opening half, shifted three wide on the far turn to gain position into the lane but had no final kick. ZUMURUDEE settled along the inside early,
switched out racing through the far turn but offered no rally. MY INDY tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, was urged to
make a brief bid entering the far turn and faded between foes into the lane. AX MAN tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight to the
backstretch, steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GOPHER, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the leaders to the first turn, gained terms with the first flight racing into the backstretch,
was eased off the leaders while angling inside after a half, saved ground on the far turn, tipped outside the leader racing into upper stretch and responded to
firm encouragement to wrest the advantage. RENTAL POOL, forwardly placed along the rail racing to the first turn, steadied out of tight quarters nearing the
backstretch, tracked just behind the eventual winner through the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, came out entering the lane to advance three
deep and prevailed for second on the wire. DAIGLE, urged between foes prompting the pace into the first turn, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch
disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, dispatched a rival's challenge racing into the far turn, went clear into upper stretch but failed to sustain that
momentum. ALL NATIVE, off slowly, was reserved in the last flight to the backstretch, split foes nearing upper stretch, then shifted five wide racing through
the stretch while steadily gaining position. NORTHERN ALLIANCE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, awaited an opening
between foes racing through the far turn, shifted outside foes nearing the lane, was fanned seven wide in the stretch and made no impression. SILVERA
threw his head at the start, was collected, then split foes three deep racing to the backstretch gaining striking distance with an early move, pressed the issue
outside a rival to the far turn, lost terms into the lane and emptied out leaving midstretch. SHES GOT THE POWER settled last along the inside to the
backstretch and never gained contention. INDAWIN tracked off the second flight inside rivals racing to the first turn, switched out avoiding close quarters
pulling between foes into the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the far turn but soon came up empty. ELEMENTAL was rated off the second flight
racing, three, then four wide to the backstretch and failed to menace. SNAP AWAY was hustled to the lead outside foes after the break, bore out badly
racing through the first turn, quickly dropped out after a half, was soon outdistanced but walked off the course under his own power.

JACK'S ADVANTAGE was rated just off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and produced a steady
late response to wear down KIERKEGAARD in time under firm handling. The latter broke awkwardly, switched outside rivals while being prompted to
contention, pressed the issue outside a rival racing into the turn, edged forward midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. TWISTED DIXIE angled to the
inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, switched out racing into upper stretch and continued with late interest to gain a share. TIME HEIST
was urged along the inside to set the pace in the opening stages, disputed the issue inside a rival into the turn, dueled to midstretch and gave way late. MR.
COUGAR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IN THE RED angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted out to bid between foes leaving the
midway point of the far turn, moved to the lead in upper stretch, drifted out under pressure but held LIZZ A BEE safe under firm encouragement. The latter
was rated off the second flight between foes in the opening half, angled to the inside racing into the far turn, saved ground to the lane and continued willingly
inside foes to challenge for command nearing the wire. SLIME QUEEN, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, was fanned three wide, then four wide
racing into upper stretch and finished evenly late. SHABAM was rated off the second flight along the inside from the outset to the far turn, tipped out three
deep racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SKYKAT settled last along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground throughout and made
an effort to improve position. FALL MOON, caught four wide in second flight racing through the first turn to the backstretch, never gained contention.
ACCORDING TO ASPEN settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch and proved no factor. DANZIG STAR was urged to dictate the pace on a
narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes into the far turn and gave way in the drive. LADY CLARE was rated
between foes in second flight tracking the leaders to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. DREAMING BIZ tracked the leaders three wide
between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half.

SIERRA HOTEL, off slowly, tracked the leaders while angling to the inside in the opening stages, awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, came through
inside foes to split rivals just off the rail in late stages and narrowly prevailed in time under firm handling. REMEMBER THE MAINE settled between foes
while dropping off the second flight racing into the turn, split foes three wide racing through the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors on the wire.
SAMURAI MIKE, urged between foes prompting the pace, continued inside rivals pressing the issue into the turn, switched outside the leader racing into
upper stretch and continued with a solid second effort between foes to lead late but was outkicked by the top pair. MASTER GUNS switched off the inside
tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing three deep into the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain
some position. GIANT GAMBLE, urged inside rivals prompting the pace, dropped off the leaders racing into the turn while switching off the inside, raced four
wide into the lane and faded in the drive. BOURBON TAN, pinched back at the start, settled last racing to the turn, then improved position inside foes in late
stages. EPIC DRAMA, urged three wide between foes pressing the pace on a narrow advantage, angled to the inside once gaining a clear a advantage
racing into upper stretch, dueled for command past midstretch and gave out late. RAOFTHESUN tracked the leaders five wide in second flight on the
backstretch and soon dropped out. TIM'S BUDDY joined the pace four wide racing to the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
CONQUEST COBRA settled outside foes on the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the bend, advanced three wide between foes when presented an
opening in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to just edge COLONEL KLINK in time under firm handling. The latter, off a step slowly, was
urged inside foes pressing the pace through the backstretch, edged clear racing into upper stretch and just failed to contain the winner. YOU SPLIT TENS
tracked just off the first flight six wide in the opening stages, advanced five wide on the turn to upper stretch to challenge for command leaving midstretch
but was outkicked. CUMBERLAND AVENUE joined the pace five wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue four wide into the turn and was outkicked in
the final stages. ATOMIC CANDY vied with the first flight three wide between foes into the turn and came up empty late. RELEASE THE BEAST flashed
brief pace four wide between foes in the opening stages, eased off the leaders while angling to the inside nearing the turn but soon gave way. BOLD
MINISTER was off slowly and failed to menace thereafter. JILOTEPEC, urged between foes from the outset pressing the pace into the turn, gave way after
a half.

MAY WE ALL tracked just off the pacesetter four wide between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to make a steady advance on that foe three deep
racing into the bend, moved to wrest the advantage in the final stages and just held CANNONBALL COMIN at the wire in an all out drive. The latter was
hustled clear of the field while angling to the inside on the backstretch, held sway into the lane, tipped off the rail racing through the stretch and grudgingly
resisted the winner to the winner. OUTRUN THE POSSE vied with the second flight between foes through the backstretch, angled to the inside on the turn
pursuing the pacesetter, continued willingly inside the top pair into the stretch but proved no match late. YESTERYEAR, urged three wide between foes
pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into the lane. KING OF THE COURT was shuffled back at the start and never gained contention. SWAY
ROAD broke a bit awkwardly and dropped out early. WESTERN SMOKE, caught five wide racing to the turn, gave way early. HATCHET CREEK tracked off
the second flight flight four wide between foes and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SAHM TEQUILA, caught in tight quarters at the start, was righted to track the leaders between foes racing to the bend, shifted out three deep on the turn
advancing to contention, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to prevail under firm encouragement. MY
DOMINATOR angled inwards in the opening stages while being rated off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, shifted nearer to the inside on the
bend, swung out to bid three deep between foes racing through the stretch and was just outfinished. TALKTOEACHOTHER sprinted clear of the field while
angling to the inside, held sway to upper stretch but yielded to the top pair late. JUST RIGHT MIKE switched out early tracking the pacesetter into the turn,
moved to challenge for command racing into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. NEW DICE ducked out at the start, settled along the inside early and
proved no threat. DAREABIGDREAM made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide to the turn and emptied out early.
