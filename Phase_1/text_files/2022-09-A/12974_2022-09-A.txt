ROARINGLIKETHUNDER prompted the pace outside OBER DARE, gained the lead approaching the finish and drove clear. OBER DARE set a pressured
pace along the inner rail, remained on her left lead until deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. UNRELENTING LOVE broke a bit awkwardly, raced three
deep leaving the backstretch and turned in an even performance. GRASS CUTTER came in a bit leaving the chute, saved ground around the turn and failed
to rally. SPYENTIST hesitated leaving the starting gate and was outrun.

Footnotes
SOMMER VELVET sprinted clear in the opening furlong, dropped in and set the pace, turned away a challenge from SHINY PENNY leaving the three
eighths, moved away under a hustling ride around the second turn, was kept alert with left handed asks in the lane and proved much the best. HONOR
YOUR MOTHER , off the pace while three wide, came under a strong ride heading to the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch, kept on grinding while on
her left lead and out finished SHINY PENNY for the place. SHINY PENNY angled out early and stalked the winner, moved up and challenged two wide near
the three eighths, failed to match strides soon after, gave hard pursuit into the lane and gave way grudgingly. DIAL EMMA REILLY lagged back, angled out
leaving the far turn but failed to generate a serious response. HICKTOWN , two to three wide, faltered in upper stretch and was taken in hand through the
final yards.

PRAY FOR THE U S A , quickly to contention under asking, pursued the dueling leaders three wide, came a bit wider with aim into the lane, leveled off
under left handed urging and when switching to her correct lead past the sixteenth pole, rolled to the front in deep stretch and went clear at the wire. LADY
MOSLER was hard sent inside rivals leaving the chute and joined ASHARA for the lead, sparred with that one into and around the turn, kept up the fight
past sixteenth marker, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. ASHARA dueled outside LADY MOSLER, held a slim lead into the lane, stayed on to deep
stretch then hung. HEARD angled to the rail nearing the turn and gave chase, came back out for the drive but lacked a rally. HOLY DELITE , outrun early
and off the inside, drifted in when green in upper stretch and failed to menace. MAKO MISS , brushed at the break, saved ground leaving the quarter pole
and failed to menace.

around far turn, dueled outside rivals into the lane, poked a head in front with about a sixteenth to go and drove clear at the wire. MUSIC AMORE , three
wide prompting the early pace, moved up to engage the leader past the three eighths, vied under a hustling ride between foes leaving the far turn, kept up
the fight between runners to mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and just saved the place. ROCKINHIPPIECHICK pressed the pace two wide early on, took
over early backstretch then dropped in to secure the rail leaving the three eighths, staved off rivals under asking around the final turn then kept on with

THERE , taken to rate, angled five wide for the drive but failed to rally. RED QUEEN set a pressured early pace while saving ground, ceded the lead soon
into the backstretch, failed to kick on past the three eighths and faltered

Footnotes
BLAME THE BOURBON broke alertly, sprinted to the early, moved to the inner rail approaching the turn, was pressed, dug in gamely and edged clear late. I
ONCE STOOD ALONE prompted the pace outside the winner in a game effort. PREACHER AMOS stalked the pace and failed to rally. BUCK WILD , three
wide on the turn, was not a threat. ECLIPTICAL DAVID , outrun down the backstretch, showed some late interest. MOON STORM , no factor, gave way.
BREWSINSKI chased the pace, gave way leaving the backstretch and was eased.
