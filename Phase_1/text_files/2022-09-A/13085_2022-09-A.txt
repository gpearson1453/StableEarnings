Footnotes
MR. SO FUNNY tracked off the second flight while switching outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady advance four wide into upper
stretch and continued with solid late momentum to wrest command and go clear under firm handling. PROTONIC AND GIN, caught in close quarters at the
start, was settled well off the leaders racing to the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and found his best stride late to gain the place honors.
FISHERMAN OSCAR tracked off the first flight in early stages, was urged to advance on the leaders three wide into the lane, continued in hand momentarily
when racing in close quarters nearing the sixteenth marker and was outkicked for second. WITHSTANDTHESTORM broke sharply, angled inwards forcing
the pace outside a rival into the turn, edged forward in upper stretch but couldn't fend off the top trio. NOTORIOUS MRSECRET, urged along the inside
pursuing the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the turn, had no closing bid. LEAOFLITTLEFAITH, shuffled out of tight quarters at the start,
settled last early and failed to menace. MR INSENSITIVE flashed brief pace outside foes in the opening three sixteenths but gave way early. KURT'S
CHOICE, urged along the rail from the outset disputing the pace into the turn, gave way abruptly midstretch.

NOEL'S ANGEL switched off the rail in the opening stages while being urged clear of the field, shifted to the inside racing into the bend, held sway on a
widening margin into the lane and was kept to firm encouragement. BAILOUT KELA broke readily, tracked the pacesetter four wide in the opening stages,
continued outside a rival on the turn with a steady effort and bested the others. SUMMER FIREFLYS angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of
the second flight racing into the turn but had no closing bid. CHAPLAIN tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the turn, shifted out to
the four path racing into the stretch but offered no rally. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the bend but
offered no rally. BALIMOS broke in the air while getting away slowly and never gained contention. BELLEFIRE broke slowly and dropped out early.

LOVER GIRL, forwardly placed three wide stalking just outside the leaders racing to the turn, bid for command with a quarter mile to go and edged forward
to a clear advantage under firm encouragement. THUNDERS ROCKNROLL broke readily, pressed the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the
turn, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch, shifted inwards midstretch and failed to match terms with the winner late. CUPIDS CRUSH was
urged along the rail from the outset forcing the pace into the turn, dueled into upper stretch, switched out of close quarters losing terms with the top pair
leaving midstretch and lacked the needed final kick. CHECKCASHINGCONNIE tracked off the first flight racing into the turn but had no closing bid.
DIAMOND MISSY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LORING PARK, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the far turn, tipped out splitting rivals just off the inside
nearing upper stretch, shifted out three wide leaving the furlong marker and responded to firm handling to go clear in time. BUBBA BOB reserved well off
the second flight while shifting inside foes to the backstretch, switched out racing into the far turn to bid four wide between foes in the stretch and continued
with a steady effort to narrowly prevail for the place honors. GABRIEL'S LEGEND, off slowly, settled last to the backstretch, swung outside foes on the far
turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to close the gap while earning a share. MIDNIGHT ROYAL, prompted to contend from the
break, shifted to the inside to track off the first flight to the backstretch, switched out after a half to advance on the leaders three wide into the far turn,
pressed the issue outside a rival to midstretch and flattened late. NORTH ARM BAY settled outside foes in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted in
nearing the lane to split foes just off the inside and continued with an effort to improve position. ANGEL'S MAGIC stalked just off the first flight to the first
turn, advanced to press the issue outside rivals after a half, gained the advantage nearing the far turn, dueled for command inside a rival into upper stretch
and gave out late. TALENT AND TRICKS tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and offered no rally. MR. D'S LEGEND tracked the
leaders outside rivals in second flight to the backstretch and came up empty racing into the far turn. MINNESOTA RED was hustled inside foes to the first
turn disputing the pace, was taken back off the pace after a half, switched outside foes racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive. SAINT
CHARLES joined the pace three wide in early stages, pressed the issue outside a rival for a half and abruptly gave way.

Footnotes
ELLE'S LIL DIVA was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing well off the rail in the opening stages, forged clear racing into the turn and widened the
margin while being kept to firm encouragement. DROPPED COLD tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out three wide
racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. ICE N LEMON settled last early, then split foes just off the inside racing into the lane to improve
position. BARBARA ROHLOFF was rated off the first flight between foes racing into the turn but came up empty into the lane. LET ME DOWN EASY, urged
inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset, couldn't match terms with that foe nearing the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and gave way.
CLASSIC CHARM proved no factor.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CURRENT stalked just behind the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out to three path in upper stretch and responded
when given her cue to wrest command and kick clear under firm handling. LET'S SKEDADDLE was rated between foes just off the second flight to the
backstretch, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to prevail for the place honors. SCENT OF SUCCESS was
urged setting the pace along the inside to the backstretch, held sway on a clear advantage while tipping off the rail nearing upper stretch, briefly resisted the
winner's bid but yielded in late stages. MOLLY'S ANGEL was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, bid along the rail entering the
stretch but had no final kick. ROZEY CHEEKS settled last racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then altered course three deep leaving
midstretch but offered no rally. START SINGING tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight, shifted three deep on the far turn and
steadily faded nearing the lane. IT'S HER TIME, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
STITZY was urged clear along the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, drifted out under pressure racing through the
stretch but maintained a clear advantage. XAVEY DAVE was rated off the second flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out four wide nearing
upper stretch, was carried out late but continued with interest to prevail for second. HOT SHOT KID, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter outside a rival
in second flight, was urged to bid between foes inside the pacesetter racing into the lane but was outkicked. THAT'S NOT FUNNY tracked the pacesetter
inside a rival as part of the second flight, saved ground throughout, was urged to bid along the rail through the stretch but was outkicked. TWOKO BAY was
rated off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, tipped out three wide racing into the stretch and finished evenly late. DEVIL VISION settled three
wide between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide in the lane and gained some position while making no impact. BENS MALICE settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch, continued three, then four wide between foes into the stretch and displayed some belated interest. ZOE'S DELIGHT
was rated off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, made some brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but flattened in the drive.
COUSVINNYSACANUCK, reserved between rivals near the inside, continued evenly into the lane. THICK HAZE worked his way to the inside early while
dropping well off the leaders and failed to menace. TRI SPOT, caught four wide racing off the second flight to the backstretch, offered no rally. KID'S
INHERITANCE was pinched back at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IT'S BOBS BUSINESS hopped at the start, then was held up momentarily along the inside leaving the gap, shifted out nearing the turn, split foes three wide
into the bend, circled rivals four wide into upper stretch and drove clear. HAND PAY was rated off the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to
advance three deep between foes into the bend and prevailed for the place honors late. SAM SEZ sprinted to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a
clear margin into the bend, dueled for command inside foes into upper stretch and gave out late. SCATAMARAN broke readily, tracked the pacesetter
outside a rival in the opening stages, was urged to bid between foes racing into upper stretch but flattened late. QUARANTENA BAMBINO angled in sharply
while pulling a bit against restraint, dropped back to last early and never proved a factor. ROSES BY LIAM, slow into stride, was prompted make some brief
progress five wide through the backstretch but quickly came up empty entering the turn. SIR STERLING, caught in tight quarters along the inside early,
failed to menace. JOSE PATIO was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter in the opening quarter but emptied out early.

Footnotes
LOVE THE NEST broke readily, was rated dropping off the leaders to track those rivals from out of striking distance into the turn, shifted inside a tiring foe
nearing upper stretch gathering momentum, tipped outside the pacesetter racing through upper stretch, then took over from that rival and went well clear in
time under firm encouragement. DOCTOR OSCAR broke sharply, was urged to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch into the turn,
shook clear nearing upper stretch while shifting to the inside, but proved no match when confronted by the winner. PRINCE RAMA tracked the leaders
inside rivals as part of the second flight in the opening stages, angled out five wide racing through the stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a
share. BAYOU BENNY, bumped at the start, tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, then was fanned six wide into the stretch while making an
effort to improve position. DAME PLATA settled along the inside early and proved no threat. MAGIC CASTLE, restless in the gate before the start, was
bumped by HAP HOT, then cut off by that rival at the start, switched out four wide nearing the turn commencing an early move but flattened out between
foes racing into upper stretch. THEALLIGATORHUNTER, urged inside a rival pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way abruptly racing into
upper stretch. HAP HOT broke inwards bumping MAGIC CASTLE at the start and dropped out early.

CHARLIE'S PENNY tracked the pacesetter outside rivals in second flight in the opening stages, steadily advanced on the pacesetter while shifting inwards a
bit racing into the bend, bid for command in the three path entering upper stretch, quickly took charge and widened her advantage under firm
encouragement. READY TO RUNAWAY tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing
into upper stretch and proved best of the others while no match. CLICKBAIT was rated inside foes as part of the second flight racing through the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being urged to advance but couldn't gain terms with the winner and was outkicked for second.
HOTASAPISTOL was rated off the second flight racing to the turn and offered no rally. STAR OF THE NORTH broke sharply, set the pace on a clear
margin while angling to the inside, held sway to upper stretch and emptied out in the drive. OWEN'S PLEASURE trailed throughout.
