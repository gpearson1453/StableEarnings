TOUCH OF PRINCE was well rated along the inside, shifted out three wide by the seven sixteenths to stalk the pace setter on the turn, made a four wide
bid leaving the turn and slowly edged away in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. RUN AWAY EMPIRE set the pace while racing off the inside,
then was two wide on the turn, was headed leaving the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly, second best. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was reserved early,
advanced between rivals by the quarter pole and had no late rally, bested rest. JUST CHECKING IN was void of early speed, swung wide and had a belated
rally on the outside. MISTER ARANGUIZ was allowed to settle early, was on the inside on the far turn and tired. FIFTH ELEMENT stalked the pace three to
four wi9de and tired.
