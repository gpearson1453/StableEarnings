TIZ A RUSH trailed early, split horses midway on the turn, closed willingly under a hand ride in the four path and was along in time. BUCKITITLEWAVE
away alertly, set a pressured pace through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. OLE WATASHI pressed
the pace two wide into the stretch then faded. THE MAN CAN stalked the pace two wide and failed to respond. PLATE IT UP with the second flight three
wide, was through after a half. JUST CHESTER had good early speed along the rail, checked entering the turn and dropped out of it.

BOX STEP stalked the early pace, dropped to the rail entering the turn causing the rider of FLATTER HER AGAIN to check, shifted out entering the stretch
brushing with the runner up, made the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run to win as much the best. BOOGIE BOOGEE chased the pace two
wide, was brushed entering the stretch, drifted out to the five path and rallied for second. LEXY ANNA away alertly, set the pace along the inside until deep
stretch then was outfinished. FLATTER HER AGAIN close up from the start along the rail checked entering the turn then came on again late.
LEDGENDARY KITTEN had good early speed then faded. NICEASAKITTENSEYES broke in the air, was rushed early then used up. THE RIDER OF
BOOGIE BOOGEE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE
STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

with a left handed whip and drew off to win as much the best. SAMMY'S SISTER allowed to settle, rallied late three wide and got up for second. BEST OF
YOU trailed until mid stretch then found her best stride late near mid track. EASTER PRIDE had speed from the start, offered a mild bid along the inside
through the turn then was outfinished. NORTHERN JOURNEY away alertly, set the pace along the rail to the top of the stretch then was outfinished.
PERSEVERING HONOR chased the early pace and was through after a half.

CITY SIGNS never far back, closed willingly in the three path through the stretch and was along in time. SEEKING THE MONEY dueled for the early lead
along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner. I GOT HOPE went evenly. FAITHFUL SOLUTION unhurried early, found her
best stride late. CHILLVILLE battled with the runner up two wide for a half then weakened. SURE FIRE READY had brief speed. BEAUTIFUL LASS was
through after a half. VAL'S RIPTIDE ducked in at the start unseating her rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
