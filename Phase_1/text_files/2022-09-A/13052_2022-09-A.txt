BEAR OAK inside chase to the half, grinded away in the stretch to go clear under energetic handing in the final furlong. TIZ OUR TURN inside speed well
handled stayed game in the stretch, held place. CAN'TBETEMALL loped along never far back to the far turn, ran on for show dough. DANVILLE was
slammed at the start, raced far back to stretch and only improved position through the lane. TEXAS HEDGE raced evenly with no late response when
needed. CHASIN CHARLIE bore in sharply start bumping rival, never menaced. ALTERED through early, dropped far back. FULCO stayed with the leaders
to the half, could not go on, stopped.
