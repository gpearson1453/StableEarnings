MADELINE'S GROGU away alertly to set the pace, raced off the inside turning for home, responded when roused and drew clear under urging. DIVINE
ROMANCE raced off the pace, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside and earned the place spot. RAW POWER stalked the
pacesetter, chased on the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, then was outfinished for second. LA DE PELUCHE was fractious in the post parade, then a
bit reluctant to load, off slowly, raced inside on the turn and did not factor. AMALFI LADY raced off the pace, two wide on the turn and was outrun.

outside of OCEANS MAP in the stretch run, wore down that rival and edged away late for the win. OCEANS MAP tracked close up early on the inside,
settled off the pace, moved up on the backside, bid two wide on the final turn, dug in gamely when challenged in the stretch drive and came up second best.
ROYNE was taken back to last in the early stages, trailed the field, moved up outside on the final turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly.
HIEROGLYPHICS raced off the pace, off the rail early on, then moved up inside on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and closed belatedly
inside. KINGDOM ON PAWS set the pace, opened up on the clubhouse turn, was pushed along on the backside, briefly shook free again nearing the far
turn, then dug in and weakened in the stretch. SA'AD (FR) raced off the pace, had an inside trip, chased on the final turn and gave way. STRONG EAGLE
raced off the rail, off the pace, three wide on the backside and gave way.
