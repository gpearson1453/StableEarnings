MIRACLE OF HOPE pressed the pace, rallied into the turn, assumed command, inched clear and held under pressure. MISS MALIA broke out, saved
ground, shifted out and bid between horses on the turn, closed steadily and was gaining ground. FABULOUS FORUM was unhurried early, closed willingly,
was gaining fast late and earned show. WAY TO FIRE pressed the pace along the insidee, fell back on the turn, came again, altered course near the eighth
pole and failed to gain. HINDU MISS CHEF was hustled along to set the pace to the turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. MIDNIGHT BABY was
crowded at the start, advanced outside to the turn to loom a threat, swung wide and gave way. Hand timed.

WINNING MAGIC broke slowly, was unhurried early, advanced on the turn, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. MORE FIREWATER set a
pressured pace, drew off leaving the turn for a clear lead and was caught late to finish second best. FINGLAS LAD pressed the pace while racing four
across, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back, went evenly late and settled for show. ROYAL TAP pressed the pace along the inside, fell back on the
turn, angled out, bid and hung. TENGAS MASTERPIECE failed to threaten in an even effort. IT BETTER BE GOLD pressed the pace while in tight quarters,
fell back into the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
MINISTERSDON'TLIE pressed the pace along the inside, fell back and angled out on the turn, bid between horses, dueled for the lead while drifting out and
drew clear late. CAUSE AND EFFECT vied to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly to finish second best. GOT EVEN SMARTER was slow early, bid inside
on the turn and closed well to earn show. SHANE ZAIN vied between horses, was carried out leaving the turn and gave way. PICK YOUR BID failed to
menace in an even effort. FAMOUS ROCK STAR was squeezed at the start, pressed the pace to the turn, was carried out and gave way. OSTINI broke
slowly and trailed the field. Hand timed.

Footnotes
TIZ TOFFEE pressed the pace along the inside, got through along the rail, inched clear and held safely. IZANAMI bobbled and was squeezed at the start,
raced in the back, found her best stride late and was gaining fast. JANERO ROSE pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, fell back and
finished evenly. SONGOFTHEDESERT set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back and weakened in the drive. MULLIGAN raced evenly and was vanned off.
MOUNTAIN PASS raced within striking distance, lacked a rally and failed to menace. FICETY LADY broke slowly, trailed and passed a tiring rival. WRIGHT
WINGED was through early. Hand timed.

THE BEAT pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and proved best. AVALON KING set the pace to the turn,
responded to duel through the stretch and was outfinished in a long drive. FINAL FINAL was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and got up late for
show. LARRY'S LEGEND raced in hand early, stalked the pace, rallied three wide on the turn and gave way. OLYMPIC EXPRESS raced close to the pace,
bid and came up empty. MORE HONOR was not a factor. Hand timed.

SCAT ATTACK vied two across, fell back on the turn, closed steadily and wore down her rival to get up late. LOW DOSE vied inside, inched clear on the
turn, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. STOLEN HALO was never far off the pace, lacked a late response and finished best of the
rest. CAROLYN'S WAY improved position in an even effort. AWESOME GALAXY held a good position, lacked a stretch response and dropped back.
AWESOME LADY was not a factor. PARTY POLICE trailed the field. Hand timed.
