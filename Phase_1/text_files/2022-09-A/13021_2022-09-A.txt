ZAROSHA never far back, closed willingly five wide through the stretch and was along in time. VOLUME OF TRUST chased the pace into the turn, rallied
three wide to make the lead in upper stretch then was caught in the final stages. KETTLE KING close up near the inside, was on heels nearing the quarter
pole, waited, shifted out to the five path near mid stretch then was gaining ground late. THE GOSPEL OF MARK passed tiring rivals outside. WHO CAN
WIN pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and weakened late. THANKSDAD broke in front, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then
gave way. WESTERN HOPE threw his head as the gate opened missing the break and trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT

FORTUNATE FRIENDS stalked the pace three wide for a half, drew on near even terms for the lead two wide on the far turn, dropped back a bit then came
on again late under right handed urging and proved best in a stiff drive. RAISON KARTER pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, set the pace
until deep stretch inside the winner, dug in gamely and just failed. ANGEL'S ENTRY trailed for a half then passed tiring rivals. GALTERO away alertly, set
the pace along the inside for a half then gradually weakened. CANDY CRUSHEM broke slowly, moved closer two wide before a half then came up empty.
