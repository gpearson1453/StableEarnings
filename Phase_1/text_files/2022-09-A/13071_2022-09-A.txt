Footnotes
RICKENBACHER broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions while in hand to the top of the lane, was given a few reminders while
pulling away in mid-stretch and was geared down late as much the best. INSTIGATE tracked the quick early pace, came three wide on the turn, was no
match for the winner in the drive but stayed on in the end to be best of the rest. RAY OF THE SEA bobbled at the start then was bumped leaving the gate
and was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn, came in tight while along the rail midway through the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, found his best stride
late and was clear in the end for third. AFRICAN PRINCE lacked early speed, chased the pace three wide on the turn, was not able to make a late impact
and passed tiring foes in the final furlong. THECHIEFHASTRICKS chased the quick pace while in mid-pack, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and was
not a threat in the stretch run. PLAYER OPTION was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the quick pace through the turn two wide, could not match
strides in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

APLOMBADO broke alertly then took back off of the early pace, pressed the leader two wide to the quarter marker, overtook WOLF'S LIFE in upper stretch,
was kept to task in the late stages and drew clear in the end. BLUE EYED JO chased the early pace from the rail, came two wide into upper stretch,
improved position inside of the furlong grounds, could not reel in the winner late but was up for second in the final strides. MIQUEAS chased the early pace
while outside of rivals, came two then three wide into the drive and rallied in the late going to get up for third. WOLF'S LIFE was sent to the early lead, was
confronted by the winner nearing the quarter marker, could not hold that off APLOMBADO leaving the bend, chased that one to mid-stretch and weakened
in the final stages.

Footnotes
PASSARANDO was a bit slow into early stride, recovered to track the pace to the turn, gained ground from the inside nearing the quarter marker, tipped out
in upper stretch, overtook IDAHO ONCE inside of the furlong marker and drove clear late. IDAHO ONCE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set
decent fractions through the turn while prompted, extended the lead into upper stretch, ran on the left lead in the drive, was overtaken by the winner nearing
the sixteenth-marker and was best of the rest in the end. STRENGTH OF AUTISM tracked the decent early fractions from a three wide path, lost position in
upper stretch and was outkicked in the final stages, while holding safely in the end for third. STOLEN VOTE was crowded at the start and was off a bit
slowly, chased from the rear through the turn, improved position in mid-stretch but did not mount a late rally. MONEY MUNCHER chased from mid-flight to
the turn, lost position two wide on the turn and faded in the stretch run.

STARSHIP ENDEAVOR was away in good order and cleared the field into the first turn, set the fractions through the backstretch run, extended the lead in
upper stretch and kicked clear in the final stages. IDA CLAIRE showed early speed and attended to the reasonable early fractions, advanced on the
pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and chased the winner home in the end as second best. BANDEENA stalked the
early pace four wide on the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost position on the far turn while three wide, ran evenly in the drive
and kept on to be clear for third. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) broke slowly and took back off of the early pace, came five wide through the first turn, settled
through the backstretch run, was steered two wide into the far turn and did not mount late rally. BOLD ARTICLE was keen along the first turn and came
under a snug hold into the backstretch run, maintained position into the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. LOTSABLING
settled off of the early pace, came three wide into the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the far turn, could not sustain that run in the drive and flattened
out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MAGICAL LADY settled off of the early pace while in mid-pack, gained ground two wide on the turn, waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker,
angled out five wide into upper stretch, overtook the runner-up nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear late. TRULY A MESS raced close to the early
pace, vied for the lead while four deep nearing the quarter marker, took command nearing mid-stretch and drew clear into the final furlong, was overtaken
by MAGICAL LADY in deep stretch and was second best. BOLD DAUGHTER lacked early speed, ran three wide through the turn, swung to six wide in
upper stretch, could not make headway on the top two in the lane but passed tiring rivals late to get up for third. QUICK TAKE was crowded at the start but
recovered nicely to be forwardly placed to the turn, gained ground nearing quarter marker, could not go on with that run in the drive and flattened out late.
NASHIRA'S FIRE broke in at the start, crowded QUICK TAKE leaving the gate and was off slowly, trailed through the turn, saved ground into the drive,
improved position nearing the furlong marker but was unable to threaten in the late going. GETAWAY CHARM chased the early pace, raced widest on the
turn, came seven wide into upper stretch and was not a late factor. JOHNEEDWNTHESTREET pressed the early pace, dueled for the lead midway through
the turn, was shuffled back while losing ground nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the stretch run. RAGTIME GIRL won the break and showed
speed while contesting the early pace, was headed nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
OPTIMISING (IRE) rated off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground on the far turn, was roused three wide in
upper stretch, overtook CRAZY DREAMS inside of the furlong marker and drove clear in the final stages. CRAZY DREAMS stalked the pace from a three
wide path on the first turn, prompted the pace to the second turn, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, overtook NUESTRO ENGREIDO in
upper stretch, was confronted and overtaken by the winner in mid-stretch and chased that one home late while besting the rest. CANELITO was allowed to
settle, mounted a three wide bid on the far turn, was outkicked by the top two in the drive but stayed on to secure third in the end. NUESTRO ENGREIDO
was hustled leaving the break and established the early lead, set decent fractions while prompted through the backstretch, came under pressure on the
second turn, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to mid-stretch and gave way in the late going. STAN THE HOT MAN showed early speed and raced
close to the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run, was asked for run nearing the top of the lane and lacked a late response. TOFINO BAY was
unhurried early on, trailed to the second turn, came three wide into the drive and was not a factor. SAINT IVES raced in mid-pack off of the early pace, came
four wide into the backstretch run, inched closer along the backstretch run, came within aim on the far turn while three wide, was outrun in upper stretch,
stopped in the final furlong, was eased through the late stages and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE TAYLOR hustled from the gate to gain the rail position, established a clear early lead, widened a bit on the turn, was roused entering the stretch
and continued strongly to the wire, further widening his lead under intermittent urging. SHORT RIB was part of the pack tracking the leader down the
backstretch, dropped out of contention on the turn but found a second wind at the top of the stretch and re-rallied late for the place. FORAGOODTIMECALL
showed early speed and tracked the pace to the turn, gained ground three deep nearing the quarter marker, chased the winner into the drive and was
outfinished in the final stages, while holding safely in the end for third. LOVER BOY TOM chased the pace from towards the rear early on, came four wide
along the turn, improved position in upper stretch but did not offer a late rally. DOUBLE THE GOLD showed early speed and tracked MY LITTLE TAYLOR
in the early stages, lost position two wide on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. EL TENAMPA was bothered a bit by
DOUBLE THE GOLD at the break, fell far back early, made a mild rally through the turn to regain contact with the field but couldn't sustain the bid.
