Footnotes
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR stalked from the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, dueled close off the rail on the
far turn, dug in leaving the turn to take over late yards and raced clear at the wire. FINAL SAY took over while tapering in toward the three quarter pole and
rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was steadily encouraged leaving the turn but gave up
the lead in late yards and flattened toward the wire. TOM TERRIFIC rated close in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. TOP HAT TREASON rated close to the early pace in the
three and four paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. GAMING JACK rated
close to the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. FIND
YOUR BOAZ settled back in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path and showed little
in the lane. STEP OUT DANCING saved ground. FU MAN SUE was reluctant to load, settled back off the rail on the opening turn and never factored.
BOBBY TWO TIMES raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn.
