Footnotes
BELLSWILLBERINGING went to the lead around the first turn, skillfully handled down the backside, was collard leaving the quarter pole, found that extra
gear along the inside, fought on gamely late for the victory. ANOTHER FLIRT track wide around the first turn, nice outside stalking position down the
backside, loomed a danger to leader leaving the quarter pole, could not quite pass leader in deep stretch, clearly second on this day. HUMMIN' THE FUNK
off the pace and ground saving trip, when called on rounding second turn, raced inside weary foes, willingly held the show spot. TINAS SHINING STAR
raced well off the pace, stayed off the pace and along the inside, came under a steady drive nearing the quarter pole, shifted out by faders, even strides
through the wire. YOURINDENIAL tracked the leader around the first turn, raced between runners down the backside, called on far turn, weakened through
the strecth. MAY BEAU slow into stride, raced four wide first turn, asked for run second turn, outrun through the stretch. C'EST PARTI broke a step slow,
raced off the pace backside, outrun stretch.

Footnotes
SUPERSTITIEUX always a dangerous threat, tracked the pace setter from the two path, queued up when nearing the quarter pole, quickly took command,
easy sailing under a nice hand ride. SIR PEEL tracked the leaders from a nice three wide position, sent into the fray nearing the quarter pole, steady drive
through the lane clearly second best today. NAVAL OFFICER coaxed from the opening bell, nice clear lead along the inside, was collard from the outside
leaving the quarter pole, could not match strides with top pair, gave a good effort through the wire. CHERRYS CROSS off to a slow start, called on for run
around the turn, came up empty stretch. RUBY ROAD slow into stride, pressed along for speed into turn, never a threat.

kept to task nearing the furlong marker, surveyed the field and came home an easy winner. TURNPIKE BOB took the leading roll around the first turn, tried
to rate speed down the backside, came under heavy outside pressure leaving the quarter pole, could not hold off outside challenger, clear second under the

lane, ground out a hard fought victory at the wire. PAY THE KID tracked from a very nice three wide placing, sent to the attack while in the three path,
cleared off the rivals to the inside, looked every part the winner nearing the eight pole, dug in gamely lost the trophy under the wire. IT'S FATE tracked the
leaders after leaving the first turn, found open clear running room down the backside, shifted out leaving the quarter pole, gained ground through the lane,
not a threat to top pair. TAPPIN FOR GLORY slow to get under way, raced off the pace along the inside, came under a drive far turn, went past the faders
late. UNIDENTIFIED MAN raced on the pace between runners, stayed between runners while attending the pace, could not match strides around the far
turn, outrun late. FRENCH TOAST sent away from the gate, clear lead into far turn, came under heavy outside pressure, outrun stretch.
