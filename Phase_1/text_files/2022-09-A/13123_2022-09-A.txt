GARBO SPEAKS tracked the pace up the backstretch, edged closer late on the turn, given cue four wide heading into the lane, took over the lead under a
drive and held clear. REMITTANCE SENT set a pressured pace in the opening quarter then held clear around the turn, got collared by GARBO SPEAKS in
upper stretch and stayed on for second best. CAMCORDIA raced in range through early stages and navigated three wide around the turn, came under left
handed urging in upper stretch, edged closer and prevailed for a share. SHELBY TO angled inside soon after the start, shifted out late on the turn, hustled
along into the lane and improved position. IVY ABAD GIRL prompted the early pace along the inside, chased the leader around the turn then flattened in the
final furlong. BIGMONEYHUNNY raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SHY RUNNER raced off the pace
in the opening quarter, moved up in contention four wide around the turn then weakened in the lane. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS chased three wide near
midpack up the backstretch, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

SMOKING GUN tracked the top pair into the turn, crept up closer then launched a three wide bid entering the lane, responded under left handed pressure,
briefly engaged FREER for the lead then took command and finished going away. FREER dueled outside of MY NOAH for the lead soon after the start and
batted on around the turn, shook free entering the lane, continued with response into the final furlong but could not contain the winner late. BALI STAR
raced midpack mid-way up the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn and stayed on for a share. DARE TO FAIL lacked speed and saved ground,
shifted out three to four wide heading into the lane and needed more for late impact. MY NOAH dueled inside of FREER for the early lead, battled on around
the turn then came up empty in the lane. KLIMCO showed response in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SPALDING STROLL made a move mid-way up the backstretch and took over the lead past the half mile marker, widened to a clear advantage, roused for
more at the head of the lane, responded willingly and drew off. A BRUSH OF LUCK raced four wide into the first turn then settled midpack, was ridden along
three to four wide around the far turn, stayed on three wide a furlong out and finished second best. MIDNIGHT RULES raced three wide into the first turn
then settled off the early pace, shifted out three wide at the head of the lane and headed in pursuit, had to shift a path wider near the furlong marker and ran
on for a share. BOTTOMLESS rated off the early pace, came under a ride and gained position along the rail around the far turn then weakened in the final
furlong. NAUTICAL MISS fanned out five wide around the first turn then settled off the pace, was ridden three to four wide around the far turn and failed to
rally. TWIRLING CHIEF was forwardly placed up the backstretch, chased two wide around the final turn then retreated in the lane. JUST JOHNNY showed
speed through the backstretch then came up empty entering the far turn, steadily retreated and jogged in.

Footnotes
MR. THUNDERSTRUCK wad allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in the back in the opening quarter, edged closer late on the turn, waited briefly in
upper stretch then roused forward two wide in the final furlong and edged away. DATA STORM tracked the embattled pair up the backstretch and around
the turn, hustled along three to four wide into the lane, roused forward into striking distance, briefly held the lead then got denied by the winner. LODE OF
BLARNEY vied outside of JUSTA STREAK in opening stages and battled on into the lane, shifted in a path under right handed pressure at the eighth pole,
ran on three wide then yielded in final stages. JUSTA STREAK vied inside of LODE OF BLARNEY soon after the start, continued to battle for command into
the lane and faded in the final sixteenth. SUN SQUALL raced two to three wide in range up the backstretch, failed to progress under pressure around the
turn, flattened out and offered no late bid. SECRET BLARNEY raced off the early pace, chased three to four wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
DIVA TREVA hustled along in opening stages and took over a slim lead, widened to a clear advantage heading into the turn, saved ground entering the lane
and kept to task under steady encouragement. ROME'S BURNING tracked the leader up the backstretch then coaxed three wide around the turn, sustained
a bid for DIVA TREVA through the lane and finished second best. ITALIAN JUSTICE settled three to four wide off the early pace, edged closer then
launched a four wide bid at the quarter pole, ran on four deep a furlong out and secured a share. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE prompted the pace along the inside
in early stages, chased after the leader along the rail around the turn then flattened in the lane. ANGEL'S MELODY was not too far off the early pace and
saved ground, came under a ride heading into the lane and failed to kick on. MISS MELODY was off slow at the start and raced in the back, chased two
wide around the turn and failed to move into contention. EURO ME raced off the early pace, was ridden four wide around the turn then retreated through the
lane.

TURFY settled in the opening quarter then picked up the pace four wide heading into the turn, came under left handed pressure at the head of the lane,
roused forward into striking distance in the final furlong, dug in gamely and edged by LAKE RADIO approaching the wire. LAKE RADIO tracked the pace up
the backstretch then edged closer around the turn, came under a drive two wide at the head of the lane, dueled outside of HIS GIANT a furlong from home,
shook free under a drive then got denied in closing strides. HIS GIANT held a slim lead up the backstretch and showed the way around the turn, took on the
challenge from LAKE RADIO at the head of the lane, battled inside of rival into the final furlong then yielded late. CAPTAIN DON raced off the early pace,
swung five to six wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. WESLEYAN dropped back shortly after the start and trailed the field, continued well back
around the turn, saved ground into the lane then angled two wide and gained position without threatening. TOO LATE was forwardly placed along the inside
in early stages, chased along the rail around the turn then tired in the drive. HELLEPHENT raced off the top trio in the opening quarter, flattened three to
four wide around the turn and continued to tire in the lane. MY BOY GUS raced up close in opening stages, remained forwardly placed around the turn then
retreated entering the lane.
