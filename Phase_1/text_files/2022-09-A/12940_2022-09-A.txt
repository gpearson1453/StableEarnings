Footnotes
RAHTID set the pace in the two path, drew clear leaving the three-eighths pole and widened under confident handling. HOLIDAY PRINCESS chased the
winner four wide, angled into the three path nearing the lane and was clearly second best. IRISH SAMURAI lacked speed, raced two wide and was along
late for the show. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY saved ground off the pace, made some progress at the rail in upper stretch but flattened out and lost the show
late. BLAME THE VETS failed to menace while racing three wide. RANSOMS REWARD had early speed between foes and steadily faded two wide.
SOLAIR pressed the winner from the three path and was through after a half. THE CUBAN MISSILE had brief speed and retreated four and five wide
around the turn.

QUEEN CUPID tracked the pace two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch and was up past the sixteenth pole. DIVINE CONNECTION stalked the pace
three and four wide, took the lead in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. NO DECAF threw her head at the start and dropped well back while rank in the
opening strides, rushed up outside, took the lead nearing the turn, set the pace two and three wide around the bend and weakened in the lane. DIGNIFIED
went evenly while racing four wide. LONGING TO FLY dueled inside and tired in the lane. ELISA'S SONG trailed outside. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND TOOK NO ACTION AFTER RULING THAT NO DECAF CAUSED HER OWN TROUBLE.

Footnotes
SIEMPRE ELEGANTE settled off the early pace inside, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn, tipped three wide near the quarter pole,
steadily gained outside of the pacesetter through the lane and edged ahead late. JAN'S GIRL set the pace three wide around the first turn, drew clear in the
two path rounding the far turn, led past the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. PRETTYKEEN raced off the pace three and four wide and was along for
the show. BIG BEE was in range three wide and lacked a closing bid. FELINE had early speed inside, was shuffled back early on the backstretch, was
forced in and hit the rail late on the backstretch, angled three wide entering the turn and lacked any further bids. SPIRIT OF POWER had speed inside and
faded after a half. STARSHIP BABE chased the pace two wide, was getting in down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, swung out in upper
stretch and was no threat while still appearing to try to get in through the lane.

ATOMICALLY set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. KITTY QUICK prompted the winner two wide, was no match for that foe but won a long
duel inside of STUCK IN MALIBU for the place. STUCK IN MALIBU chased the winner three wide, could not keep pace with that foe nearing the quarter
pole, battled outside for the place and just missed that position. MAJOR PRYCE failed to menace while racing four wide. TESTED POSITIVE played no
factor while racing three wide. FIND YOUR PASSION had only brief speed inside. REBATE was outrun while racing two wide. AWESOME MARINA trailed
in the two path.

STREET FACTS broke outwardly, saved ground off the pace, swung seven wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up late. CHARMING
CHARLIE pressed the pace two wide, was forced to steady when put in tight near the quarter pole, was in tight again nearing the eighth pole, swung five
wide soon after and finished willingly. TAPATERM was shut off at the start, trailed in the three path, advanced five wide around the far turn, shifted eight
wide near the quarter pole and rallied widest. KANTHARTANA settled off the early pace two wide, made a four wide move between foes around the far turn,
reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled inside of a foe from there to deep stretch but could not quite sustain the bid. BIRDMAN
RICHIE lacked early speed while racing four wide, made a five-wide sweep to the lead around the far turn, dueled to deep stretch and weakened late.
AUTHENTIC HEART raced in range two wide, angled six wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. FORTY FLASH raced off the early pace
three wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, took the lead three wide near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied three deep around much of the turn but
came up empty in the lane. BANKER'S HOURS set the pace along the rail, checked near the quarter pole and retreated from there. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA
stalked the pace two and three wide and was through after a half.
