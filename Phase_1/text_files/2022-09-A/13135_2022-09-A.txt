CALCULATED BREEZE broke alertly and led inside, widened in the stretch and just lasted in a drive. WHERESTHEPASSION lacked speed, weaved
through rivals and closed strongly too late. DANGNABBIT prompted the pace between rivals and continued gamely. CAPTAIN CHAZZ stumbled badly at
the start, advanced wide with mild rally. INSTANT CHAOS lagged far behind then offered some late energy while no threat. RAGING TEMPEST chased
extremely wide and lacked a rally. EXPLAIN saved ground off the pace and faded on the turn. OUTWORKNFORAKISS forced the pace three wide to the
stretch and faltered. COMPASS CAY was firmly rated off the pace and faded. HEZASTONECOLDFOX raced along the inside and gave way readily.

RUBY BLEU set a pressured pace inside, repelled repeated challenges from both side and battled gamely to gain the decision. DIVINE MIRACLE prompted
the winner outside, bid at the quarter pole, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. EXCURSION settled outside off the leaders, moved closer on
the final turn and finished willingly. MY FRIENDS BEER raced off the pace, made a menacing bid on the final turn then weakened through the stretch AWE
MUN lagged far behind and lost contact with his field.

CREATIVE JOY hustled close up early inside, angled out on the turn then edged away through the final eighth. IMAGISM rated outside the pacesetter, took
over near the five sixteenths pole, moved clear then weakened. SCARF lacked speed then advanced inside on the turn passing rivals. DAYS
REMEMBERED set a clear pace inside, was collared midway on the turn and weakened. CINNAMON DREAM saved ground off the pace and failed to
menace. PAGE ELEVEN dropped far back then passed rivals without menacing. GOVERNMENT GIRL began fading into the far turn and was no factor.
CHARLYS WILD ANGEL lagged far behind and was always outrun. RUBY DOOBY DOO urged within striking range early, drifted very wide on the turn
retreating. ESCANDALO dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI SUPERFLY set a clear pace along the rail, led under pressure. came in sharply late under a right handed whip and lasted gamely. CATCH MY
VIBE prompted the pace outside, loomed a stretch threat and finished gamely. SCREEN SAVER saved ground throughout, rallied into the stretch, was
taken up sharply late along the inside in the final yards. ABSENTEE trailed early, circled very wide on the turn and closed well. LAVERY broke a bit
awkwardly, moved closer in the stretch then flattened out. APPEALING FUTURE chased between rivals down the backstretch and tired. RACK GIN was
taken up near the half mile pole and lacked a further response. STRUM AND PLUCK was urged off the leaders four wide and began fading on the turn.
Following a stewards inquiry, SHANGHAI SUPERFLY was disqualified and placed third for causing interference in the stretch.

PACHELBEL settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out on the turn, led in midstretch and narrowly prevailed after a long drive. BACK TO D' FUTURE
saved ground throughout, vied along the inside and battled to the finish. BROADWAYCHARLYROSE eased back and moved very wide on the turn and
closed well. CREATIVE COPY set a pressured pace in the two path then came up empty in the lane. WINNING MOON urged close up between rivals down
the backstretch and faded. GIRL FROM TYRONE dropped back at the start and moved inside on the turn. RIVERVIEW ducked out sharply at the start,
rated close up wide and gave way. TEMPTED TO TOUCH lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AEGEAN SEA quickly sprinted clear, widened on the turn, drifted out through the stretch and coasted home handily. TITANIC ROSE trailed far behind then
rallied well inside through the stretch. IRIE EMPRESS was in tight briefly into the far turn, swung wide and came again to gain show. MADAME ROUGE
chased wide, made a brief bid into the far turn and flattened out. CLOSET SHOPPER broke slowest then made up ground without menacing. ADVOCATE
HARBOR raced off the pace in the two path, rallied briefly between rivals on the final turn and tired. SOLID GOLD DANCER raced wide throughout and
weakened steadily. BURANO raced in closest pursuit of the winner to the final turn and stopped.

CLASSY SADIE stalked the pace four wide, bid on the turn and was just up in a long drive. QUEEN CORDELIA saved ground throughout, slipped through
bidding into the stretch but was outdueled. MISS ALEX lacked speed, moved wide into the stretch and gained the show. HIT A HOMER HONEY was urged
close up between rivals and flattened out in the stretch. EMMA'S TOUCH trailed early and was never in contention. KISSIN COUSIN alternated for the
advantage inside and faltered in the stretch. NANA'S BOOPA dueled outside to the stretch and stopped abruptly. FRIEDER FANATIC was a late scratch in
the paddock on the advise of the track veterinarian.
