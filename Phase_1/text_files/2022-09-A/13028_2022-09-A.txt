SHE'S A BIG DEAL Away best, toyed with rivals early, took charge without asking, quickly put daylight on the field and then was under wraps late for the
lengthy win. STIMULUS CHECK Broke sluggishly, tracked along the rail, eased out and finished well while clearly no match. FIRST FOREVER Unhurried
along the two path, angled out four wide into the lane and was along for a share. LET'S MAGA Forced the issue early, tracked along the three path to the
lane and weakened. PEGGY SUE Broke slow, saved ground and failed to threaten. ALLURE FORTUNE Forced the issue early, tracked from between on
the turn and tired.

MISTER WINSTON Sent to the front, showed the way along the rail, responded in the lane and drew clear. SMOOTH TALES Out hustled to the front, close
up in hand along the rail, eased out in the lane, responded a bit and then finished well. BELLAGIO Well placed in hand along the three path, took the rail
into the lane and failed to gain. RINGGOOD Hit the rail into the first turn, unhurried along the three path, took that path into the lane and failed to take part.
COACH BAHE Stalked along the two path while in hand, continued on that path into the lane and tired. CORAGESCONTENDER Three path on the turns,
was outrun. SOUL FIGHT Saved ground and tired.
