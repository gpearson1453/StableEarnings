Footnotes
GENERAL JIM broke out at the start, went three then two wide around the opening bend, settled outside but with the benefit of cover, came under urging
outside the three-eighths, was urged three wide around the final turn then driven four wide into the stretch, took the lead while carried out inside the
three-sixteenths, drifted in inside the furlong marker, dueled with the runner-up in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. FLY RIGHT
was bumped at the start, pulled hard on the bit under restraint while inside through the first turn, was rated in a good position just off the pace, drafted along
the hedge on the far turn, was given his cue in the two path into the stretch, accelerated to make a bid inside the three-sixteenths, battled with two foes until
inside the furlong marker, dueled with the winner in the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place. SCRAMBLE tucked in down the opening
straightaway, raced inside early on the first turn then steadied some while swerving out keenly over heels, tossed his head shortly thereafter, remained keen
early on the backstretch, was reserved towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn, swung five wide while roused at the quarter-pole, remained on her
inside lead under urging while briefly behind a drifting duo in upper stretch, found clear space in front around the furlong marker then swapped to the proper
lead and finished with good energy but was too late while able to garner the show. ARI GOLD showed early speed between foes then was taken back off
the pace before the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, tracked outside in hand down the backstretch, raced three wide on the far turn, was
asked near the five-sixteenths, took the lead while asked for her best around the three-sixteenths then drifted out, lost the advantage to the winner outside
the eighth-pole, fought between foes until inside the furlong marker, switched back to her inside lead while dropping back coming to the sixteenth-pole and
weakened. PLEASE BABY hit the gate at the break, started the first turn in the two path then was carried out to the three path by SCRAMBLE, settled at the
rear down the backstretch, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CLASSIC CREATION displayed
speed from the outside post, rounded the first turn in the three path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked outside
the quarter-pole, lost the advantage around the three-sixteenths and gave way. GOOD NEWS ROCKET saved ground around the opening bend, settled off
the hedge, was urged along in the two path around the far turn and failed to rally. READ ON broke out and bumped with a rival then was pulled off that foe
by the rider, showed speed while a bit green on the inside, moved out entering the backstretch then stalked on the outside, came under coaxing around the
seven-sixteenths, chased in the two path on the far turn and capitulated. IMPECCABILITY was slow into stride, dropped well behind while traveling
awkwardly and was pulled up but walked off.

POWERFUL coaxed from the gate, showed the way briefly solo early on before being engaged in head to head combat by MARTY'S MAGIC to his inside
while racing three paths off the inside down the backstretch, dueled in hand with that rival tucking to the two path with seven-sixteenths to go, took over the
front and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under challenge from flanking threats, the rider flashing the crop in the face of TAPIT'S CONQUEST
down inside twice to the sixteenth marker and gamely rebuffed the pair to hit the wire loosely between foes at the end. TAPIT'S CONQUEST coaxed from
the gate, chased three then two wide from mid pack early on before advancing to be just off the pace midway on the turn, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch before taking to the rail straightened away, rallied up the inside issuing a challenge through the
final furlong getting the crop of POWERFUL flashed before him twice to the sixteenth pole while running on willingly to secure the place honors while
ultimately rebuffed by the top one. FULL MOON MADNESS coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled
four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the top pair a furlong out, battled on readily outside the top pair running on to the finish while
well clear of the rest for the show honors. PARKWAY broke in at the start bumping CODE OF KINGS and was away awkwardly conceding four lengths to
the front, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home,
swung three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. FIGHTERTOWN three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled out five wide into upper stretch and tired. MARTY'S MAGIC hustled from the gate, advanced after the start to duel inside of POWERFUL with five
and a half furlongs to go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off a bit near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch before
striking the rail straightened away knocking his hind quarters askew himself, then tired through to the finish. UPGRADE shied out at the start and was a bit
sluggish early conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SURPRISE PAYOFF broke sharply and outwards at the start, chased four wide forwardly placed, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths and faded, went six wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive. CODE OF KINGS struck the near side stall at the start then
got bumped by PARKWAY and got away near the rear conceding four lengths to the front, chased three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking
inside through the turn, got coaxed along midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

NO BURN brushed the outside of the gate at the start, went four wide around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, backed off just a touch
near the nine-sixteenths, was asked in the three path on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead until inside the
three-sixteenths, was pulled in by the rider to get a lead change at that point and responded, fought outside of the leading duo to the sixteenth-pole and got
up under good handling to prevail. STRONG QUALITY bobbled just after the start, went to the front in the two path on the first turn, showed the way while
inside of two foes, was urged along while inside on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, fought on well while remaining on his inside lead, battled
inside of two foes into the final sixteenth and missed while narrowly able to get the place. UP TO THE MARK went around the first turn in the three path,
prompted the pace loosely between foes, vied in the two path around the far turn, took the lead under urging in the four path at the top of the stretch, battled
outside of a foe while pursued by a rival to the outside into the final sixteenth and was outfinished and just missed the place while well clear for the show.
AUSSIE PRIDE bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, dropped back along the rail on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while moving
from the rail to the three path around the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. PERCEIVED was last to commence, raced in the three
path around the first turn, settled well off the pace, started the far turn in the two path, paused behind a stopping rival at the three-eighths then dropped to
the inside and failed to threaten. TIWANAKU broke in then brushed with a foe, was hustled in the two path on the first turn, established a good position just
off pace under coaxing, chased in the two path early on the far turn, angled four wide while dropping back at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. SEAL
BEACH bumped with a rival at the start while brushing with another foe, saved ground on the first turn, brushed the rail early on the backstretch, was well
placed to the five-eighths then began to drop back, lugged out from the rail to the three path around the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ANNAPOLIS bobbled at the break recovering outwards a step, showed the way rated just off the inside through the first turn and then three paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked back to the two path into the far turn and was given a notch midway to keep his three rivals at a safe distance behind,
swung three wide into upper stretch, got roused to a light drive with three-sixteenths to go and drew off, then got geared down through the final sixteenth to
the finish to prevail comfortably on the wire. CELESTIAL CITY tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while nose to nose through the final furlong to the finish running on to dead heat for the place
and show honors on the line despite a nudge by his main rival at the finish. FUERTEVENTURA just off the inside through the opening bend, settled tracking
the leader to the outside four then three wide down the backstretch and three wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths
remaining, swung three wide at the head of the stretch, proved no match for the top one while battling head to head to the finish with the aforementioned foe
nudging him at the wire and shared in the place and show honors when dead heating with that rival. ETHEREAL ROAD two to three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

CUSTOM BOBBY'S was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path around the turn, was set down while on even
terms with the runner-up in upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. SUGAR
GRAY LEONARD pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, was put to a drive while on even terms with the winner into upper
stretch, battled outside that foe while swapping leads back and forth in the vicinity of the furlong marker, was turned away outside the sixteenth-pole and
outfinished while clear for the place. MONTATHAM bumped lightly with a foe early, jostled some with rivals while rated behind horses, went three wide while
roused on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. BLINDING LIGHT was bumped at the start
then forced solidly into another foe, bumped lightly with a rival early, jostled with a foe down the backstretch, was urged along in the two path around the
turn then driven four wide into the stretch, came between horses into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. MISTER CHAIRMAN broke out at the
start, tracked the pace on the outside, was guided around the turn under extra left-rein pressure while three then four wide and came up empty.

just after the start then taken up some, raced at the rear under reserve, steadied some leaving the backstretch, was roused three wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and was no factor. MOON HUNTER brushed the inside of the gate at the start, settled towards the rear on the outside, went four then
five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DRINK THE WIND was well placed just off the pace on inside, saved ground
while asked on the turn and came up empty. N Y ANTHEM broke out and bumped with a foe, was rated behind horses down the backstretch, came under

Footnotes
CHAMPIONS DREAM shied in slightly brushing with AMERICAN HALITE, dueled briefly three wide down the backstretch before shaking away to a sole
command tucking to the two path briefly near the half mile pole, tucked inside through the turn coming under light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to
three wide for home, drew clear under a drive and held well to the finish. PRAIRIE DUNES got bumped at the start by AMERICAN HALITE, who came
inwards and then bumped that rival twice before angling in when losing his lane to chase two to three wide, tucked inside through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well angling in to avoid traffic nearing the sixteenth pole and was along safe for the
place honors while unable to threaten the winner. MINDTAP coaxed from the gate, chased inside briefly before racing two to three wide in pursuit, was
along the two path into the turn when bumping MO'S TREASURE near the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing tipped three wide at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. JUNGFRAU four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. DESERT WOLF lunged to the right side at the start and was
bumped solidly by AMERICAN HALITE coming inwards and then forced to steady when losing his lane to that rival, conceded five to six lengths to the front
before settling into stride, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to
kick on belatedly to the wire. CAGLIOSTRO broke in at the start and was corrected, raced four then three wide in aim of the front, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. KAON
coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide at the top of the stretch, offered no response.
MO'S TREASURE coaxed from the start, dueled briefly from the two path with the eventual winner before giving chase, tucked inside near the half mile
pole, got bumped and bobbled nearing the seven-sixteenths by MINDTAP to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and tired. AMERICAN HALITE got brushed by CHAMPIONS DREAM and came inwards trading a bump with DESERT WOLF and then
bumping PRAIRIE DUNES before having that rival come outwards and shoulder him twice just for good measure, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn under motivation with three furlongs to run, swung four to five wide for home and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
ELITE POWER was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide around the turn, was driven six wide passing the quarter-pole, gained while remaining
on his inside lead and leaning inward in upper stretch, made a bid while swapping to the proper lead under one light pop of a left-handed crop at the furlong
marker, moved clear coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best while eased up late. HOIST THE GOLD was hustled from the start then urged
along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive, kept on well in pursuit of the vanguard, moved out inside the
furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. MERAAS (GB) was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, moved in while speeding clear, vied in the
two path on the turn, was challenged at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch, led desperately while drifting out under a drive into the final
furlong then was collared and weakened but held the show. HIGHER STANDARD stood in the gate and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, was
ridden along on the inside, saved ground on the turn, gained while cutting the corner under a drive into the stretch but lacked the needed response and
flattened out. FOOLISH GHOST was hustled from the start then chased the solo leader, switched outside that foe near the half-mile pole, raced in the three
path on the turn, gained to make a bid at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch, vied under a drive into the final furlong and tired. AMUNDSON
bobbled inward at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. PAYNE
dropped back while urged along, went three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. COST BASIS was
urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty. SHADOW MATTER hit the outside of the gate while away very
awkwardly then bumped with a foe, spotted the front a few lengths, went four to five wide around the turn and was no factor.

INSTANT COFFEE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command just inside the eighth pole coming out two paths as ARTHUR'S
RIDE came inwards three paths to look one another in the eye and brushed with that rival a sixteenth out, then dug in gamely to the finish inched away at
the end. ARTHUR'S RIDE chased inside briefly before chasing two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
angled five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, came in under a right handed crop three paths when headed for the
front to look the aforementioned foe in the eye as that rival came outwards and brushed at the sixteenth marker, then ran on well clear of the rest to be
along second best. CRUPI broke out at the start bobbling and quickly lost ground to the tail of the field, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show
honors. DUBYUHNELL three to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. BRITERDAYZAHEAD coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch coming under growing threat
from a loosely flanking pair straightened away, got collared nearing the eighth pole and tired to the finish. FANTASIST broke in at the start bumping JUAN
VALDEZ into TSURIS against pressure inside coming outwards from ROCKET CAN, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. ROCKET CAN broke out at the start bumping TSURIS into JUAN VALDEZ against pressure outside from
FANTASIST, chased four to five wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. JUAN VALDEZ got bumped solidly
between foes and was forced to steady when squeezed back at the start conceding six to seven lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride,
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing near the three-eighths when improving position, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. TSURIS got
bumped between foes at the start and pinched back, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
SANCTUARY CITY went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on
the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased into the final furlong, moved out from behind a foe near the sixteenth-pole, brushed with a rival
and swapped to back to his inside lead at that juncture and closed well to get the nod at the wire. ANALYZE IT settled while traveling in the two to three
path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied to make a bid into the final sixteenth, held the slimmest of leads one stride from the wire but was
out-nodded and denied on the wire while just able to get the place. EYES ON TARGET went around the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the
outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked just after turning into the stretch, dueled outside of OCEAN ATLANTIQUE into the final sixteenth,
fought on well to the wire but just missed while narrowly able to get the show. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE was hustled to the front, dropped from the two path to
the inside early on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn, dueled gamely with EYES ON TARGET in
the stretch, fought determinedly to the wire and just missed while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. MONITION showed early speed then became
keen when taken in hand before the first turn, was rated just off the pace while inside to the two path, came under coaxing late on the backstretch, was
roused for more on the far turn, moved out some while chasing in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. GRADED ON A CURVE hit the outside of the gate
at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside towards the back, was roused nearing the seven-sixteenths, raced four wide on the far
turn, moved out in upper stretch, was fanned out near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. CLEAR VISION settled on the inside, was given
his cue outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and also lacked the needed response. NEVER
EXPLAIN was taken in hand early, went four wide around the opening bend, was rated just off the pace on the outside, traveled three wide while let out on
the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, brushed with a foe while dropping back coming to the sixteenth-pole and came up empty. LORENZ
(BRZ) was washy pre-race, settled at the rear in the two path, moved to the three path under urging around the five-sixteenths, came out a bit more into
upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
VIRGINIA JOY (GER) established the front and showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits, remained patiently handled until let out
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive a furlong from home, dug in under late threat and held safe to prevail. WAR LIKE
GODDESS settled unhurried saving ground near the rear of the field under a firm hold through dawdling splits, remained on hold through to spinning four
wide at the quarter pole and was roused when straightened away into upper stretch, came through a seam at the three-sixteenths roused and got on track
nearing the final sixteenth to close with a rush too late to be enough to get up at the end and had to settle for the place honors on the line. COASTANA
settled two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish to
preserve the show honors by a head. TEMPLE CITY TERROR settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked to the finish. FLANIGAN'S COVE tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. MARVELOUS MAUDE tracked the pace two to three wide, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and was outrun when the real running began.

Footnotes
OLYMPIAD established a forward position down the opening straightaway, stalked outside of the leader in the three path, was asked leaving the
backstretch, turned up the pressure in the three path around the far turn, gained the advantage at the five-sixteenths, shook clear in the four path into upper
stretch, responded well under a right-handed crop in the drive and held under steady urging. AMERICANREVOLUTION came away in good order, raced
with his head cocked to the inside down the initial straightaway, rounded the first turn in the four path, stalked outside while continuing to have his head
cocked to the inside down the backstretch, issued a challenge on the final turn, was roused late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch, chased the
winner in the drive and was second best. FIRST CAPTAIN tucked into the four path entering the first turn then dropped to the three path, settled off the
pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths, came under stronger encouragement in the three path around the final turn, was driven six wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. UNTREATED was last to commence, saved ground while well placed just off the pace,
came under urging with a half-mile to run, chased inside for most of the far turn then shifted three wide, spun four wide into the stretch then dropped inward
and lacked the needed kick then missed the show. KEEPMEINMIND was taken in hand while in tight off heels when FIRST CAPTAIN took his path early on
the first turn, went three wide around that bend, settled outside down the backstretch, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, traveled four wide around
the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to rally. DYNAMIC ONE angled in at the rear before the first turn, raced inside to the two path
around that bend, settled at the back, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, came eight wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. CHESS CHIEF rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on
the far turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond. TAX was hustled to the front, raced on his inside lead early before
switching to the proper lead, showed the way in the two path, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, came under heavy pressure on the final turn, lost
the lead at the five-sixteenths and capitulated.

Footnotes
MR BREADWINNER came under coaxing from the gate and came inwards bumping IRON LION IN ZION into SEANAN, showed the way just off the inside
through the first turn before tucking inside into the backstretch, dueled with PATIENT CAPITAL to his outside down the backstretch and into the far turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, continued the fracas knocking heads through the length of the stretch
getting brushed a sixteenth out as PATIENT CAPITAL came inwards, took narrow command for good with seventy yards to run and gamely held on to
prevail. PATIENT CAPITAL coaxed from the gate, went three then two wide through the first turn before dueling from the two path with the aforementioned
foe to his inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in continuing the duel through the stretch,
came inwards brushing with MR BREADWINNER a sixteenth out and was narrowly headed with seventy yards to go, ultimately got bested at the end
despite fighting on game to the wire while well clear of the rest. RIA'S ANGEL just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors narrowly over a rival. IRON LION IN
ZION broke in brushing the near side stall at the start then got bumped by MR BREADWINNER coming inwards under coaxing and bumped SEANAN,
chased just off the inside, tipped three wide put to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid and just missed for
the show honors. MIDNIGHT WORKER coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the drive. ONE MORE BABY hustled from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun
three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MILANO struck the off side stall at the start, chased three to four wide, came under coaxing four to five wide at
the seven-sixteenths, continued four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. SEANAN stumbled at the start and was bumped by IRON LION IN
ZION due to pressure from MR BREADWINNER, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch
and tired. KONG LOVES A FIGHT coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking briefly to the two path near the
far turn, went inside through that bend coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. COMMANDER
COMPTON coaxed from the start, went six then five wide through the first turn before chasing five then four wide down the backstretch, went three to four
wide through the far turn and into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
QUICK POWER NAP moved in while going to the front, shook clear coming to the seven-sixteenths, controlled the action while inside around the turn,
floated four wide into the stretch then drifted further out, was guided in inside the furlong marker and proved best under a right-handed crop late. MO
DAMORNINGGROUCH tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the two path around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, moved in
inside the three-sixteenths and earned the place while no match for the winner. ELI DANCER broke a bit awkwardly, settled on the outside, was roused
three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show. FULIGNI broke a
half-step slow, settled off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed kick then missed the show. MY CARA MIA MINE dropped back after the start, settled under some urging, went around the turn in the two path and
improved position. GALLEY HEAD settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOLLYGAG was
hustled from the gate then taken in hand and reserved near the rear, raced inside to two path on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, dropped to the
rail at the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. IZEAMALIBUMOON was taken up when the winner crossed in front early, settled off the pace,
was asked three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. RENT CONTROL broke a half-step slow, was
reserved behind horses at the rear, tossed his head keenly near the seven-sixteenths, was let out three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch
and was no factor. CHIARA was rated while tugging hard at the bit while keen behind horses, went two then three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the
stretch and came up empty. BUNTY WINDERMERE showed early speed then was taken back off the pace under a snug hold, saved ground around the
turn and had nothing left.
