Footnotes
KIDDIE HOLIDAY broke in a bit after the start and trailed in the early stages, began to advance between runners going into the far turn, angled out for the
drive going five wide and found his best stride late taking over in deep stretch pulling away at the wire. RUNNINFORCOVER contested for the lead travelling
three wide with a quarter to go with two inside rivals, poked his head in front mid stretch only to lose the lead inside the sixteenth pole to the winner and held
late to win the photo for place money. AMMUNITION tracked just behind the trio of battling leaders through the far turn, found a seam on the fence midway
through the stretch and ran on determinedly late getting up for third and just missing out for second. SAME AGAIN DOC tracked the frontrunner in the
beginning, contested for the lead between horses with a quarter to run, gave way with foes on either side at the furlong marker and had to settle for a small
share. MAD DOG N JOE took command after the break, was collared with three eighths to run on the outside, fought on briefly in upper stretch and began
to weaken late between runners at the finish. OCTOBER FROST broke out at the start, rated at the back going three wide into the first turn, commenced a
mild rally four wide on the far turn, angled out for the run to the wire and was in the hunt in upper stretch but could not find enough late to contend.
GLORIOUS TRIBUTE rated inside mid pack early on, was shuffled back to trail into the far turn, angled out to the seven path for the drive and offered no
finish.

Footnotes
DOWNLOAD settled at the rear shifting in early, advanced inside foes about the quarter pole, bid up the rail at the eighth pole and edged away under steady
handling. KLIMTOGLORY tracked from inside, switched outside the leader near the quarter pole coming three wide to the top of the stretch, bid in upper
stretch putting a short head in front, could not kick on with the winner but secured the place. ADELAIDE COURT set the pace facing moderate outside
pressure racing just off the rail, edged clear into the turn, was challenged in upper stretch and outfinished for second. COUSIN BOB stumbled at the start,
moved forward to chase in behind two then three wide on the turn, came a bit further in upper stretch and ran on. TARA TATTOO hopped slightly at the start
and was off a step slowly, raced three to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. LAMENT pressed briefly then continued to chase three then four wide to the
end of the turn, weakened thereafter. LUV TO WIN chased briefly from outside, steadily dropped back four to five wide, tired.

Footnotes
BROKE AN BROKEN broke out at the start, made a bold winning move swooping the field circling six wide through the far turn, was clear of runners in
upper stretch and had just enough left to hold off late gaining rivals at the finish. ANSELMO started to rally four wide outside runners with three furlongs to
go, could not keep up with the winner throughout the far turn but finished determinedly between horses down the stretch to make it close at the wire. THE
BAND COMING tracked inside behind the pacesetter down the backside, waited on the rail into the far turn, angled out with two furlongs to go to be in the
five path in upper stretch and ran on willingly to the wire gaining steadily on the winner. SOCIAL JUSTICE trailed the field into the backstretch, began to
advance between rivals sitting in a good spot going into the far turn, was in contention nearing the quarter pole but could not quicken enough with the
outside closers turning for home and ran on evenly to the wire settling for a small share. TWO YEAR CONTRACT pressed the early pace entering the
backstretch, was asked while between runners with three furlongs remaining, contended briefly midway on the far turn and raced on the fence turning for
home offering little for the stretch run. CANT GLIDE BY KATZ was near the back stalking four wide in the beginning, offered a brief run travelling six wide
entering the far turn, could not advance on the outside through the turn and made no impact down the lane. LILNMIGHTY broke sharp and took command
easily into the first turn, briefly was challenged entering the backstretch, opened up again into the far turn, was swallowed up by the field racing on the fence
five sixteenths out and was empty with a quarter mile to run.

Footnotes
THE GREAT OZ broke a step slowly, raced outside at the rear through the first turn, steadily advanced up the backstretch, began to move in earnest four
wide on the far turn, drifted out throughout the stretch but just got up late. SILVER SMOKE moved forward to take the lead into the first turn shifting in a bit,
moved nearer the rail when clear early on that turn, dictated terms up the backstretch, was clear into upper stretch, caught late. CLASSY WHISPER got off
the fence a bit pursuing the leading pair inside the second flight then moved nearer the rail and advanced closer to the leaders up the backstretch, saved
ground on the far turn, ran on. EAGLE CHIEF was caught five wide into the first turn moving in a path later on that bend, stalked just off the leading group
going three to four wide on the far turn, tipped out a bit in mid-stretch and went evenly. QUIET INTENT settled at the rear, fanned seven wide into the
stretch and gained but too little and too late. COOL LAOBAN settled off the pace two to three wide in the back half of the field early, continued in about the
same path before moving out at the top of the stretch, ran on mildly to improve position. WORKIN OUT shifted to the rail while prominent down the stretch
the first turn, switched outside the leader early on the first turn to stalk two to three wide, weakened in the stretch. RACING IN THE RAIN raced near but just
off the inside and failed to menace. DIXIE BOUND was a bit rank between rivals early chasing four then three wide into the first turn, continued to pursue
from mid-pack but steadily dropped back and faded. CHELSEA DAGGER raced off the rail three to four wide mostly and was never near enough to
threaten.

Footnotes
TRICKY MAGICIAN tracked inside all alone in third through the turn, angled out to the four path and began reeling in the frontrunner, took command from a
tiring leader inside the sixteenth pole and started to edge away late in deep stretch. GOLDMINE CAT tracked on the rail mid pack through the first half,
stayed on the fence through the stretch run and found another gear late to just get up and hold onto place at the line. WENJACK rallied on the rail with a half
mile to go, angled just off the fence mid turn continuing to advance, began to quicken more at the furlong marker in the five path and finished up well just
missing getting the three horse photo for place. MARTEN RIVER broke sharp to be in front in the early stages, was comfortably on top turning for home,
began to weaken with an eighth to go, was still holding onto the lead with a sixteenth left and tired nearing the wire losing positions in deep stretch.
EXECUTIVE SEARCH settled near the rear after the break, could not make up any ground through the turn running just outside of rivals, angled out in the
four path in mid stretch and passed tiring horses at the wire. EXECUTIVE SIGHT trailed the field at the half, was roused inside of runners at the top of the
stretch, could not find a closing run and was not a factor at the finish. CRAFTY CONQUEST chased the leader for the first half, began to weaken in upper
stretch and backed away at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
STORMY SOUL set the pace racing off the rail, edged clear on the turn, asked for run in upper stretch, extended the margin and held well. VELOCE stalked
from mid-pack off the inside, went two to three wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. MESA SKYLINE moved up inside heading up
the backstretch then had to steady on heels slightly near the half, switched out to be three wide coming to the quarter pole, angled seven to eight deep in
upper stretch and finished with solid interest but far too late. KEEN SAMURAI switched outside foes and settled at the rear, advanced four wide and outside
on the turn, evened out in the stretch. DYNAMITE KARMA tracked in behind early, chased two to three wide on the turn, had no late kick. D'S BEN attended
the pace inside, dropped back steadily and ran on evenly thereafter. MIRIAM'S SKY was ridden along throughout going three then four wide on the turn and
five deep into upper stretch, failed to rally. STREET LEGAL was off the pace early, went two to four wide on the turn, was never a threat.

Footnotes
NIAGARA SKYLINE rated well in hand on the rail behind the early pace through the turn, shot up the fence in upper stretch to take control at the furlong
marker and was geared down at the wire winning comfortably in the end. TOLD IT ALL trailed in the early part of the race, started to rally in upper stretch
travelling six wide for a clear run and finished strongly outside to be an easy second but could not offer a threat to the winner at the finish. RED
HIERARCHY chased the early pace just outside through the half, took command at the top of the lane, was headed with an eighth to run and levelled off in
deep stretch holding onto third. SIR SEAMUS showed good speed leading in the early stages, was collared two furlongs out, began to weaken between
runners at the furlong marker and held on for a minor placing. RECONFIGURE tracked the leaders on the rail racing mid pack, angled out four wide to rally
at the quarter pole contending in mid stretch and could not find another gear to be a threat at the finish. SALVATOR MUNDI settled near the rear in the early
stages, was roused in the five path for the drive and could not offer a strong rally in the late part of the race.

Footnotes
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH swung six wide into the stretch, took aim, under steady handling just got up. BABY MO set the pace racing off the rail, shook off
challengers to be clear through the turn and widened into mid-stretch but soon shortened stride and was caught nearing the wire. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND
was bumped both sides at the start, pursued the pace from outside four wide, ran on evenly. MIDNIGHT MEADOW was bumped lightly in the early going,
raced in behind rivals at the back into the turn while off the inside, fanned nine wide into upper stretch, ran on to get the nod for fourth.
SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA was a bit reluctant to load, raced between foes at the back early, in behind runners heading into the turn while off the inside,
moved out turning for home and ran on. MUMBLEBEE bumped a rival at the start, chased four to six wide, lacked the needed late kick. I AM I SAID bumped
the inner rival early, raced outside about five to six wide into the turn fanning ten deep into upper stretch, ran on evenly. VERI UNIFIED moved forward
inside up the backstretch to track the leader, dropped back, failed to rally. SHISHKA chased from mid-pack racing off the inside, came up empty. BABY
DRIVER angled in early, saved ground to no avail. ELITE PRINCESS bumped with a rival at the start but recovered to gain forward position pressing the
pace from outside three wide, gave way. PER RULING FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION, BABY MO WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE
TEST.
