ROLLING ON was away alertly from the outside, sprinted clear early on, raced off the inside in the stretch run and remained well clear under a hand ride. IL
MIRACOLO broke awkwardly, chased the early leader from the inside, continued a rail bid in the drive and was no match for the winner.
MYREDWHITEANDBLUE broke in at the start, chased the top pair, raced three wide in the stretch run and had not enough. THUNDER ECHO was coaxed
along from the inside, raced near the rail past the quarter pole, shifted out six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late run. BREAKOUT STAR
raced off the early pace, was near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid. SIR DANIEL was hustled along from the outside early,
raced three wide around the far turn and never was a factor.

LIGHTS OF BROADWAY prompt the pace from the outside while racing three wide, took command through the far turn and drew off in the drive to be clear
under strong handling. ANAMNESTIC rated along from while racing from the inside, moved up three to four wide through the upper stretch and was no
match for the winner. MY BILLEEBOY showed good early speed to set the pace from the outside and weakened through the stretch drive. UNIVERSAL
HERO was off slowly, eased up from the outside to stalk the pace while racing four deep and raced evenly late. HOLLYWOOD HERO was allowed to settle
early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. SEAX raced off the early going and failed to threaten.

LOVE HER LOTS tracked the pace from the outside while racing three wide and finished strongly to prove best under steady pressure. JAZZY T reluctant to
load, was off very slow, raced off the early pace, move up through the far turn, raced six deep into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire.
FLYING BLACK rated from the outside of rivals while racing four wide, dug in near the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. MARIA'S REVENGE was allowed
to settle early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled in to the rail and moved up through the drive. DOMINEERING stalked the pace along
the inside down the backstretch and lacked a rally. SMART SPENDING showed good early speed to set the early pace from the inside gave way in the
stretch run. MARVELOUS MARLENE raced up heels, checked in the early stages, raced mid pack early on lost ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
WICKED FINN showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in nearing the eighth pole and remained clear late under strong encouragement. FLY
THE W angled to the inside soon after the break, saved ground down the backstretch, continued an inside run near the quarter pole and couldn't cut into the
leaders margin to finish second best. BENELUX was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early on, moved up six wide through the far turn, raced
seven wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. KING THEO raced five wide around the first turn, rated down the backstretch
while racing off the inside, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. THENORTHREMEMBERS settled to the middle of the
pack, experienced traffic near the three sixteenths pole, angled in, raced three to four wide and lacked a closing rally. GO MIKE was allowed to settle early
on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole into the upper stretch and had no late rally. POCO CHARLIE settled off the pace, raced four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and failed to have a response. KATIE'S COWBOY tracked the pace while racing three wide and gave way in the stretch run. KOBLA MAS
was off slowly, dropped to the back of the pack early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. FARLEY raced six wide near the seven eighths pole,
raced from the outside down the backstretch and faded.

Footnotes
VIOLENT ZAP settled to the middle of the pack, raced five wide through the far turn, made an outside bid in the stretch and prevailed late under all out
pressure. CAPRIDREY dropped back early on, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced seven wide near the three sixteenths pole while racing
between and finished gamely to the wire. AWESOME APEAL stalked the pace from the outside, raced six wide through the upper stretch and finished
willingly to the wire. CHASING JOY dueled from the inside of rival and weakened the final eighth of a mile. BE NAUGHTY WITH ME dueled from the outside
of rival down the backstretch and weakened in the final stages. MISS YOUNIVERSE lunged at the break, off the early pace, moved up five wide near the
quarter pole, angled widest in the lane and never threatened. YEARS AGO stalked the pace from the inside and weakened through the stretch run.
BRIMAGE was off a step slow, raced five to six wide around the far turn and had no late rally. ATOMIC ROSE dropped back off the early going, raced near
the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid. UNBRIDLED CHROME unhurried early on and failed to respond. BUNKER BUNNY was
coaxed along from the outside and was done early.
