Footnotes
NOBODY'S SECRET set the pace along the inner rail, was under encouragement through the lane and drew away. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE stalked the
pace, moved to the three path entering the backstretch, chased the winner the final quarter mile and was second best. HOV LANE broke in the hand of the
assistant starter when acting up at the start, circled foes three wide around the far turn and finished willingly. GLIDE drifted four wide entering the first turn,
attempt to get out on the far turn and failed to rally. SHE BE A DANCER , no factor, raced along the inner rail on both turns. LADY KALAMATA prompted
the pace outside the winner and gave way entering the far turn. Following a stewards' inquiry, it was ruled HOV LANE ran for purse money only.

Footnotes
ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN , urged clear around the first turn, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure from DASHING LOU from the three eighths, came
off the rail when clearing near the three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling leaving the sixteenth pole and dug in tenaciously to prove best. OTHER
THINGS EQUAL , well placed while saving ground and in range, came under a hearty ride mid way through the backstretch run, edged up to the inside of
rivals nearing the furlong pole, eased out for room and finished gamely to gain the place. DASHING LOU angled off the rail early and prompted the pace
outside the winner, moved to apply more pressure three furlongs from home, chased three wide into the lane and kept on with effort. BIG RINNE , between
rivals a long way, edged up under pressure nearing the lane, steadied when blocked from the eighth pole to mid stretch then finished willingly once clear.
AMEN CORNER , three deep chasing the pace, shifted wider for the drive and came up empty. CAMP PENDLETON , three to four wide while in range past
the half mile marker, was put to a strong ride nearing the three furlong marker, remained in touch around the final turn then faded. GALLINIPPER , well off
the rail nearing the half mile marker, remained wide heading to the three eighths but failed to respond.

HE'S A SHOOTER prompted the pace two wide outside RAD PAISLEY, moved to engage that one after a half mile, dueled, gained a slim lead past the
three sixteenths, went clear under solid asking soon into the lane and held firm. RAD PAISLEY sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined
approaching the five sixteenths, dueled, ceded the lead three sixteenths out, fought on to upper stretch then gave way grudgingly. NOMO RON , towards
the inside, chased the dueling leaders around the final turn, came two wide for the drive but lacked a bid. GALLANT GOLD , three wide early, dropped back
leaving the half mile marker and failed to respond.

Footnotes
JOHN'S PROMISE disputed the pace outside JIMMY THE KID, opened a clear lead entering the stretch, was challenged on his outside by FLANK SPEED
in mid stretch, dueled with that one and got the bob. FLANK SPEED stalked the duel for a half mile, eased outside on the far turn, bid for the lead in mid
stretch and just missed. WICKED MAD , saved ground on the turns, eased out entering the stretch, advanced to mid stretch then flattened out. TAPPING
THE GLASS bobbled leaving the starting gate, trailed to the far turn, swung out approaching the stretch and offered a late gain. SOUTHERN BRIDGE was
not a factor. JIMMY THE KID disputed the pace racing along the inner rail, weakened a bit leaving the far turn and was steadied in narrow quarters at the
head of the stretch. CANT STOP THIS MAN , three deep prompting the pace around the first turn, faltered leaving the backstretch. An objection by the rider
of JIMMY THE KID against the winner for alleged interference at the head of the stretch was not allowed.

ONE TEN settled in last and off of contested pace, shifted out past the three eighths and was put to a hustling ride, circled four wide into the lane, closed
stoutly under left handed asking, took command inside the sixteenth pole, switched over to his correct lead and eagerly widened while geared down at the
wire. IT'S SIZZLING TIME , three deep nearing the first turn, dropped in past the half mile marker and sparred outside YES SIR ROBERT, poked a head in
front near the three eighths, shook clear into the lane, kept on with effort but was no match for the winner. YES SIR ROBERT took over between runners
entering the first turn, dropped in past the half and got engaged in a duel with the winner, carried the battle to the three sixteenths then faded late. ASKIN
FOR A BASKIN broke outward then corrected and sent up to be off the duel three wide, was under pressure pursuing leaving the far turn but failed to
respond. SAGRADA RAY , taken to rate off the rail, edged up between foes soon into the backstretch, angled in for the run around the final turn and faded.
SMARTY JOHN had speed inside then drafted back off the duelers past the half mile marker, dropped well back into the far turn then swung wide for the
drive.

MARKET OF STOCKS , taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, stalked the pace for a half mile, moved up in the three path on the far turn, secured
command entering the stretch and drew away while kept to her business. DIAL ME MAYBE disputed the pace outside MARTHARITA, faded and held the
place. IF THEN lacked speed, swung wide in upper stretch and rallied mildly. RATIONALMILLENNIAL stalked the pace, circled the far turn four wide and
weakened. MIDDLE ISLAND , unhurried early, was not a factor. MARTHARITA set the pace along the inner rail and gave way on the far turn. HOLDING
COURT , steadied when squeezed back leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on both turns and was no factor. OVERANDOVERAGAIN
stumbled leaving the starting gate and was outrun.

Footnotes
APPALACHIANHEIGHTS , squeezed back soon after the break, stalked the pace under patient rating, moved up in the two path on the final turn, led under
urging near the eighth pole then drew off under a hand ride. TARGE , carried out by SOME IS NINE entering the first turn, gained a two wide lead on the
backstretch, opened a clear lead on the final turn and weakened the final furlong. SPECIAL FREEDOM lost ground on all turns and passed tired foes late.
REAWAKENED , outside horses throughout, weakened. SOME IS NINE bore out entering the first turn, showed speed inside rivals and gave way leaving
the backstretch.
