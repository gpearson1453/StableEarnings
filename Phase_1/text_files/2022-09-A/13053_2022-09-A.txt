Footnotes
MISS AGGIE BLING broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside, turned back a rival racing through the turn and went clear
under firm encouragement. LUVIN BULLIES tracked just off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, shifted three wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to prove best of the others. AIKEN TO BE was urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter into the turn, then faded into the
stretch when proving no match. SILVER COIN tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, saved ground to upper stretch but
lacked the needed late bid. TAILORBESWIFT broke awkwardly while ducking inwards at the start, switched outside rivals on the backstretch while being
prompted to contend but came up empty racing through the turn. JAGGED ARROW dwelt at the start losing contact with the field and trailed throughout.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ROCKTIZWAY broke sharply to gain the advantage nearest the rail, was urged inside a rival into the first turn disputing the pace, pressed the issue through
the far turn into upper stretch and edged forward late under firm encouragement. MR. WHO threw his head at the start to break a step behind the eventual
winner, was prompted to force the pace outside that foe racing into the first turn, disputed the issue on a narrow advantage to the far turn, then into upper
stretch but weakened late while saving second. CASHANOVA angled to the rail in early stages dropping off the leaders, made steady progress inside foes
racing into the far turn, tipped out three wide racing past midstretch and made an effort to close the gap. CAMPS BAY settled last outside foes racing to the
backstretch and passed some tiring rivals into the lane. YAK settled outside a rival off the second flight in the opening half and offered no rally. MARK OF
VALOR was rated tracking off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch but faded after a half.

OFF RAMP, in touch prompting a rival's pace from the outset into the turn, came under stout pressure leaving midstretch and edged clear late. HONEY
BELLA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors
late. BREWHOUSE, urged along the rail disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the bend, dueled for command past midstretch but weakened late.
CHAI TEA tracked off the second flight outside rivals in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and continued with a mild bid to gain
position between foes late. HAMAZING LACE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and faded
in the drive. BETTY'S BAR, off last, settled along the inside in early stages and never gained contention.

Footnotes
BIGFOOT CITY broke readily, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage into the first turn, moved clear on the backstretch to
open a comfortable margin and held sway throughout under firm encouragement. WAR CHEST, carried out at the start, settled outside a rival in the last
flight to the backstretch, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch and produced a solid late response to edge rivals for the place honors. LOOKIN FOR
EIGHT shied outwards at the start crossing into the path of WAR CHEST, was righted, then urged to terms prompting the pacesetter into the first turn,
conceded the lead entering the backstretch to track the pacesetter a bit off the inside, was urged to advance three deep into the lane but weakened drive.
NOBLE PURSUIT was rated along the inside behind the second flight to the first turn, switched outside foes on the backstretch, was fanned four wide racing
into upper stretch and continued with mild interest while being outkicked for a share. TIO BLAS angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter just inside a rival
in the opening half, was urged to advance into the lane but lacked the needed kick. ROBINSON settled last to the far turn, tipped off the inside racing into
upper stretch, then altered course to the rail midstretch but continued willingly to the end. CHOCOLATEICECREAM tracked off the second flight three wide
racing to the far turn and gave way between foes in that path in the drive.

Footnotes
FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM broke readily, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, met the challenge of a rival
racing through the far turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch, then drifted well off the inside under pressure while maintaining a clear advantage to the
end. WHISKEY PLANK, reserved off the third flight a bit off the rail in the opening half, angled to the five path racing into upper stretch and continued with a
steady effort to prevail for the place honors. PAPA RIZZO, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival from the outset, pressed the issue racing into the
far turn and weakened through the stretch. STAGECOACH BOYS broke awkwardly, was settled last to the far turn, switched outside foes racing into upper
stretch, then shifted inwards racing through the stretch while making belated progress between foes to the end. SAMYAZA switched outside foes tracking
off the second flight to the backstretch, made some brief progress three deep racing into the far turn but faded in the drive. CAVE HILL angled to the inside
stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half but steadily faded nearing the lane. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM, pinched back at the start, never gained
contention. YOUR TIME'S COMING switched off the inside tracking behind the second flight racing to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
PIRATE BIRD, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, was settled last racing to the turn, split foes four wide nearing upper stretch gathering momentum,
was fanned five wide in the stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. KOVACS, in touch with the
leaders in the opening sixteenth, was eased off the pace while angling to the inside dropping off the second flight racing to the turn, swung outside foes
racing into upper stretch and found his best stride racing six wide though the stretch to prevail for the place honors. DIRECT ACTION, forwardly placed four
wide between foes tracking just off the first flight into the turn, continued with a steady effort in that path to late stages but was outkicked by the top pair. BIG
BOY MCCOY angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, came through along the rail on the turn bidding for command, edged
clear nearing upper stretch, held sway to midstretch but was collared late. MYNAMEIS PRINCE tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing
into the turn, angled to the rail leaving the furlong marker and continued with an effort to gain some position. GONE A LIL LU HU tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch and continued evenly into the lane. WEAREINITTOWINIT, off a bit slowly, settled
between foes just off the inside, briefly awaited an opening nearing the lane, then shifted four wide in the stretch while continuing evenly late.
HOLDENTIGHT, urged three wide between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way in late stages. BOOTLEGGIN POSSE broke
slowly, switched out six wide nearing the half mile marker while being prompted to advance, continued five deep into the turn and gave way after a half.
ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA settled between foes in early stages and failed to menace. SCARYATCANTERBURY was urged disputing the pace on a narrow
advantage a bit off the rail racing into the bend, was taken up when racing in close quarters midway through the turn, shifted to the inside nearing the lane
and quickly gave way. DYNAMOMETER, caught six wide in second flight racing through the backstretch, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
RUNNERS HEAT was urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset while being headed nearing the turn, contested the issue in a prolonged
drive, exchanging some light contact in upper stretch but edged forward to prevail under strong handling. MISS WILDCAT was urged forcing the pace
outside the eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn, continued in a protracted duel exchanging brushes in upper stretch and was just
outkicked. DREAMINGOFBLING broke a step slowly, tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening stages, then continued with interest outside a rival
in the lane to edge that foe for a share late. EXODUS AND HOPE tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, tipped off the rail racing
into upper stretch and was just outkicked for a share. FINAL TABLE settled last racing to the turn and failed to menace. MISS TATER TOT tracked off the
first flight between foes in early stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn and steadily faded into the lane.

Footnotes
EYES FLYING BYE switched outside the pacesetter prompting that rival through the backstretch, moved to wrest the advantage racing into the turn, shifted
to the inside once gaining a clear advantage and held sway on a comfortable advantage to the end under firm encouragement. SWEET ANALYZER, urged
to a forward placing four wide tracking just off the leaders, continued with a steady effort to the lane and proved best of the others. TAHKODHA KNIGHT
broke readily, was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command inside the winner into the turn, couldn't match that
foe nearing upper stretch and weakened into the lane. SOMERSETSLASTRIDE vied with the first flight three wide between foes through the backstretch
into the turn and gave way in late stages. R VOO'S TABOO, off slowly, switched outside foes nearing the lane but made no impact. JEROMIEO dropped out
early.
