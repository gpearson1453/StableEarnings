Footnotes
RED ROUTE ONE was well rated early, drafted behind the duo on the lead on the turn, eased out nearing the five sixteenths, made a three wide bid leaving
the turn, was clear by the furlong marker, and then drew out to prove best under a mild drive. LIFE AT SEA was allowed to settle and made it over to the
inside on the turn, eased off the inside nearing the five sixteenths, made a four wide bid outside of the winner, but could not go with that rival in the final
furlong, second best. WHAT A BLAST vied for the lead on the inside, made a bid to shake clear leaving the turn, but faded in the final furlong, bested rest.
LET ME LOVE YOU was settled back early and was three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, lacked the needed rally but improved position.
SAILOR'S CHANCE lunged at the start, then was reserved on the inside, saved ground on the turn and made a mild bid, but weakened the final furlong.
HOME SCHOOL was allowed to settle on the inside and tired. ZOOMSTER vied for the lead on the outside and tired. ON THE TEAR stalked the pace four
wide and stopped.

LET'S DUET was reserved early while two to three wide on the turn, shifted out and left the turn five wide, closed well and drew clear in the furlong grounds
to prove best, driving. ARLYNE'S CROWN set a pressured pace along the inside, then shook clear leaving the turn, then was headed by the furlong marker,
kept on gamely while no match for the winner, held place award. LIZY D was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, then angled out nearing the
sixteenth pole for racing room and surged late to gain the show award. LAMASCO was allowed to settle early, then pulled and was keen on the turn, was
hard held and then tipped out three wide leaving the turn and had no punch, missed show award. SCENIC VIEW prompted the early pace three wide, then
made a three wide bid to loom boldly by the furlong marker but faded late. SONADOR tracked the pace three to four steadied by the three sixteenths and
had no kick. NANA'S GRAY was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and had no rally. JE SUIS RAPIDE chased the pace four wide and

TIME FOR TROUBLE was reserved early, coaxed along three wide on the turn, came four wide off the turn and by the quarter pole, split rivals at the furlong
marker and then edged clear late to prove best under a drive. VERSTAPPEN stalked the pace and made a three wide bid in the stretch and was between
rivals by the furlong marker, then finished gamely to hold the place award. HILLIARD was settled back early, advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch, closed well on the outside but was outfinished late. BALLADEER set the pace on the inside and was well handled, then dug in gamely in the
stretch, but gave way grudgingly late. RED HORNET was allowed to settle and saved ground throughout, made a mild inside bid leaving the turn by the
quarter pole, but lacked the needed stretch bid late. FORWARDLY was allowed to settle early, made a two to three wide middle move to be in contention
after a mile, but weakened in the lane. BAKWENA was settled back early, was three wide by the quarter pole and lacked a rally. KENTUCKY MIST chased
the early pace three wide, then fell back and was on the inside by the five sixteenth and weakened. SETNA THE WISE was four wide into the first turn,
chased the pace four to five wide and tired. CIVIL WAR was settled back early, four wide by the five sixteenths and had no response. FORT DEFIANCE
prompted the early pace and folded.

CLUBBING vied for the lead on the inside, then made a bid to shake clear, then was challenged in the stretch by GOOD SOLDIER but dug in gamely and
edged clear late to prove best under a drive. GOOD SOLDIER was well rated along the inside, shifted out leaving the five sixteenths, made a three wide bid
to get on even terms with the winner but hung late, clearly second best. SHOGUN WARRIOR tracked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the
turn but flattened out in the final furlong, bested rest. FLUTE MASTER was allowed to settle on the inside, lacked the needed rally while getting up for the
final spot in the superfecta. CANTILLATE was reserved early, then was between rivals on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn at the five
sixteenths, then passed the tiring rivals. AFJAN was four wide into the first turn, reserved early and then improved position late. LONGSHANKS was
bumped at the start, vied for the lead on the outside and tired. SPUNS SON was reserved early, three to four wide on the turn and lacked a rally. URBAN
RECOVERY was reserved on the outside and failed to respond. PREDOMINATE failed to menace. SWIRLY was not a factor. FAITH RUNNER vied for the
lead between rivals and stopped.

urging. POINT ME BY chased the pace three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn and was on even terms with the winner by the furlong marker,

was slowly gaining late, missed place award. CREED was outrun early, swung wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally while on the left lead.

set the pace on the inside on the turn and weakened. VIVAR lacked a rally. BULLSEYE BUN vied for the lead and then prompted the pace three wide and
weakened. SPLIT THE WICKETS stalked the pace three to four wide and weakened. MUTAKATIF (IRE) chased the pace on the inside and tired. PALAZZI

Footnotes
VERGARA was with the pace while being well rated on the inside, made a bid to gain a short advantage on the far turn, then was challenged by SKIMS in
the stretch, dug in gamely and was resurgent to prevail under strong handling late. SKIMS (GB) tracked pace while in hand throughout, made a four wide
bid leaving the turn and dueled with the winner through the stretch but was outfinished to just miss. CALIFORNIA ANGEL was allowed to settle early
between rivals, then worked way to the inside on the far turn, cut the corner leaving the turn, then finished willingly. NEW YEAR'S EVE was settled back
early, advanced five wide by the five sixteenths, made a four wide bid in the lane, but flattened out late, bested rest. BEECHNUT TROPHY was well placed
throughout on the inside, then was boxed at the five sixteenths, angled out in the stretch and had no kick. TURNERLOOSE set a pressured pace and then
vied for the lead three wide and weakened in the drive. FANCY MARTINI was five wide into the first turn, settled while outside and tired. SILVERLEAF
tracked the pace two wide and weakened. SEQUIST was reserved early and failed to respond. HEAVENLY HELLOS chased the early pace and tired.
PRINCESS PAULINE failed to menace.

Footnotes
KITODAN was reserved between rivals, then remained between rivals on the turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole and closed full of run on the outside
and drew away to prove much the best. GRAND SONATA was allowed to settle on the inside, then cut the corner and made a inside bid but could not go
with the winner while being clearly second best. MOUNT RUNDLE was settled back early, made a five wide run by the five sixteenths but flattened out while
being along for the show award. ALWAYS ABOVE was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, then passed the tiring rivals while in traffic the final
sixteenth. DRIPPING GOLD was washy in the post parade, rated along three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the lane.
READY TO PURRFORM stalked the pace three to two wide on the turn and faded. SPEAKING SCOUT was reserved early, made a four wide run by the
five sixteenth but came yup empty in the drive. DOUBLE CLUTCH set the pace and dawdled along but gave way. RUNNING BEE chased the pace and
tired. RED RUN was allowed to settle early and dropped back. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE stalked the early pace, then ranged up three wide on the far turn
and tired. WESTERN RIVER was off slowly and never factored.

Footnotes
PLAY THE MUSIC was well rated early and made way to the inside, drafted behind the duel on the turn, then tipped out two wide leaving the turn, split rivals
at the quarter pole whuile in hand, then went on even terms with REPLENISH by the furlong marker, was given a couple right handed pops and kicked away
to prove best under confident handling. REPLENISH was reserved early, settled into stride two to three wide on the far turn, shifted out and came five wide
into the lane and by the quarter pole while advancing, made a four wide bid to go on even terms for command by the furlong marker but could not go with
the winner the final sixteenth while being clearly second best. WATCH THIS MUNNY was bumped at the start, settled into stride, advanced outside and was
six wide by the quarter pole, then made a five wide bid nearing the furlong marker, could not go with the top two while finishing willingly for the show award.
HOLD MY CROWN set the pace on the inside, then dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn and weakened, held last spot for the superfecta late. BEAT
THE ESTIMATES was rated along early three wide, made a four wide move by the quarter pole but then came up empty the final furlong. QUEEN'S
GARDEN passed the tiring rivals. BASILICA D ORO prompted the early pace and then went up to duel for command three wide on the turn and weakened.
PADDY GAL lacked a rally. SMOOTH LIKE ICE chased the early pace between rivals and weakened. FLY CONDOR was reluctant to load and then
showed brief speed and stopped. STORM RATE chased the pace on the inside and folded.
