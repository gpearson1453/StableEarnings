Footnotes
BETITO was asked to show speed and established the early lead, set solid fractions through the turn, was set down for the drive, extended the lead in
mid-stretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. OUR EXPECTATION was off a step slowly and was a bit slow into early stride, was steered outside of
rivals into the turn, rallied three wide on the turn, came within aim of the winner in mid-stretch but was outfinished in the end and was best of the rest. KING
EDDIE tracked the pace from the second flight while saving ground, maintained position on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and just held for third in
the final strides. THAT'S BIND BABE chased from the rear early on, improved position two wide on the turn, made a mild rally in upper stretch but could not
muster the needed late response and just missed for third in the late stages. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET showed early speed and tracked the solid early
fractions, lost position in upper stretch and faded in the final stages. CASH LIMIT chased the early pace, lost position while saving ground on the turn and
was not a factor in the stretch run.

Footnotes
FIRE DIAMONDS settled off of the moderate early pace, gained ground on the backstretch run, was roused three wide nearing the top of the lane, closed
with good interest inside of the furlong grounds, struck the front in deep stretch and edged away in the end. DEL MAR FLASH was hustled to show early
speed, steadied in tight quarters entering the first turn and was guided to the two path entering the backstretch run, prompted the pace to the second turn,
stayed in close pursuit of the pacesetter into mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final stages but held for second in the end. FANTASTIC SECRET was sent
to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, held rivals at bay through the second turn and into upper stretch, was
not able to hold off closing foes in the final stages and yielded late, while clear for third. SILK ROAD SALLY was unhurried in the early going, advanced on
the backstretch run, stayed within aim while three then four wide on the second turn and flattened out in the stretch run.

ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) established the early lead, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, extended the advantage
leaving the far turn, had the lead cut into a bit in the final sixteenth and was kept to task while clear in the end. BRITE TAN settled off of the early pace while
racing in the second flight, came three wide along the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but made headway late and was up for second
in the final stages. ARISTEIA raced closest to the pacesetter through the backstretch run, was not able to gain ground on ABSOLUTE SCENES in the
stretch drive and was edged late for second. FOGGY BOTTOM rated off of the early pace, saved ground to the second turn and could not muster a rally in
the late stages. NORTHERN ROSE was unhurried early on, trailed to the second turn, was asked for run in upper stretch and lacked a late response.

U S READY was away in good order and contested the early pace, took a narrow lead to the turn, extended the lead into upper stretch and drew off late in a
good debut. FUNKY GREY brushed with PETE'S INFERNO leaving the break, disputed the solid early pace, chased U S READY through the turn and into
upper stretch, could not keep pace in the final furlong and was no match for the winner late, while besting the rest. PETE'S INFERNO broke in at the start
and was off a bit awkwardly, chased from the rear to the turn, improved position two wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked by the top pair in the
drive and was an easy third in the end. MY NAME IS INDY chased the quick early pace, lost position on the turn and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
BROKEN FINGER showed early speed and stalked the early pace from a three wide path on the first turn, gained ground heading to the second turn,
confronted the pacesetter nearing mid-stretch, overtook UNUSUAL CODE inside of the furlong marker and held gamely over the quickly oncoming
runner-up. NOWHERE MAN settled just off of the early moderate pace, made a steady gain through the backstretch run and into the far turn, waited for
racing room nearing the top of the lane, closed well inside of the furlong marker and just missed for the win at the end, while besting the rest. UNUSUAL
CODE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set modest fractions through the backstretch run and into the far turn, was confronted by the winner in
upper stretch, could not hold off BROKEN FINGER in the late stages and was outfinished, while holding for third in the final strides. CANYON CREST saved
ground while rating off of the early pace, came in tight and lacked room nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked late and just
missed for third in the end. ORCZY (IRE) was unhurried in the early stages, was guided four wide into the second turn, swung five wide into upper stretch,
gained ground in the late going but lacked the needed late response. ENGRAM was unprepared at the start then hopped leaving the break and spotted the
field early on, trailed through the second turn, came six wide into the drive and was not a late factor. AWE settled off of the early pace, came three wide into
the backstretch run, advanced nearing the half-mile marker, tracked the pace three wide through the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in
the late stages.

Footnotes
ISOLA MIA rated off of the early solid pace, improved position nearing the second turn, loomed two wide nearing the top of the lane, overtook the pacesetter
heading into the final furlong and held the runner-up at bay in the late stages to prove best in the end. VINCERO GRANDE was pinballed at the start and
was off a step slowly, saved ground while settling off of the early pace, was roused two wide on the second turn, rallied in upper stretch, was held at bay by
ISOLA MIA in the final stages and was second best in the end. DISTORTED QUEEN broke alertly and showed early speed, disputed the early fractions with
HARBOR'S ROSE, shook free from that rival heading to the second turn, was confronted by ISOLA MIA in upper stretch, could not hold that foe off in the
late stages and was outfinished for second, while holding for third in the end. VRONSKY FEINT rated off of the solid early pace while in the second flight,
lost position on the second turn, gained ground in mid-stretch, lacked the needed late kick in the final stages and steadied while in tight quarters
approaching the finish line. SKY MAKER was allowed to settle in the early going, improved position three wide on the far turn, made a mild late rally in the
stretch but did not threaten late. SACRED BEAUTY was shuffled back at the start and was off slowly, trailed through the backstretch run, improved position
on the second turn but did not factor in the stretch drive. HARBOR'S ROSE was away in good order and showed early speed while contesting the pace, lost
ground on DISTORTED QUEEN nearing the second turn, dropped back nearing the top of the lane, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under
her own power.

Footnotes
REMEMBER SUE tracked the solid early pace, maintained position to the second turn, was roused two wide nearing the top of the lane, overtook
CARASYNTHIA inside of the furlong marker and pulled away late. CARASYNTHIA broke alertly and was hustled to the early lead, set solid fractions while in
hand through the backstretch run, drew off nearing the quarter marker, was confronted approaching mid-stretch, could not hold off REMEMBER SUE in the
late stages and was well clear of the rest for second. ALISO BEACH was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, mounted a three wide bid into
upper stretch, improved position inside of the furlong marker, jumped tracks in the late stages and bumped MOONSHINE CAT but held for third in the final
strides. MOONSHINE CAT was bumped at the start by KITTYBE QUICK and was off a step slowly, came three wide on the first turn while unhurried,
improved position nearing the second turn, gained a bit of ground nearing mid-stretch, was bumped late when ALISO BEACH jumped tracks and was edged
out for third in the end. COCORITA settled off of the early pace while racing in the second flight, saved ground to the second turn, gained a bit of ground in
upper stretch but could not sustain that run late and flattened out in the end. KITTYBE QUICK broke out at the start and bumped with MOONSHINE CAT,
was rank and hard to place into the first turn, lacked speed while trailing into the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SEA OF LIBERTY was unhurried early on, was roused three wide on the far turn, rallied four wide into upper stretch, closed determinedly in the drive,
headed UNION WAVE in deep stretch and made a final push to prevail. UNION WAVE was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions through the backstretch
run, extended the advantage nearing the top of the lane and into mid-stretch, met the bid of SEA OF LIBERTY in deep stretch and was gamely bested by
that one in the final strides, while holding safely for second at the end. DILIGENT tracked the solid pace from the second flight, gained ground two then
three wide on the far turn, continued that advance to mid-stretch, was outfinished in the late stages by the top two and held safely for third. BIG FLAME was
allowed to settle, maintained position to the second turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into upper stretch and showed good late
interest while unable to reel in the leaders late. LAMMAS (GB) flashed early speed and stalked the early pace, was floated out a bit along the first turn and
came three to four wide into the backstretch run, maintained position through the backstretch, slipped to the inside on the far turn, lost ground in upper
stretch and lacked a late rally. ROBIE raced close to the early pace, floated LAMMAS out a bit along the first turn, stalked the solid fractions to the second
turn, could not keep pace in the drive and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
ASCENDANCY broke out at the start, making contact with BIG ATTRACTION, established a stalking position in the two-path around the first turn while
under a tight hold, was let loose going into the far turn and moved up to challenge for the lead turning for home, chased a stubborn NAUGHTY NADINE for
a furlong but eventually wore down that rival in the end. BELLEO'S FOREST broke in at the start, kept to the inside and settled into a comfortable rhythm
near the rear, moved with steady forward progress down the backstretch, was in striking position but lacked a path through the turn, found a hole turning for
home, finished well and was up for second in the final jumps. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) was away in good order, steadied near the seven-eighths marker,
stalked the early leader from the rail position, held up a bit while waiting for room in the middle of the turn, shifted to the two-path, entered the stretch with a
slight lead, kept on determinedly but was outfinished late. KOKO'S MOM settled three wide in mid-pack, came two then three wide to the quarter marker,
was unable to make headway on the leaders in the drive and passed tired foes in the final stages. RED TIARA broke alertly and was sent to the early lead,
contested the early pace with SHE'S A BIT SASSY then shook free of that rival heading to the second turn, came under pressure nearing the top of the lane
and weakened in the stretch run. SHE'S A BIT SASSY was hustled along the first turn and contested the early pace into the backstretch run, lost ground to
RED TIARA nearing the half-mile marker, chased the leaders while still within range on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faded in the drive.
BIG ATTRACTION broke in slightly but was bumped by ASCENDANCY after the break, then appeared to clip heels and stumble causing her rider to take
up and spotting the field several lengths at the start, raced far behind the field throughout and was never a factor. MARGOT was fractious in the gate, off
slow and then moved up to regain contact with the field, bided her time near the back, was asked to pick up the pace passing the half-mile pole but never
mustered up a response.
