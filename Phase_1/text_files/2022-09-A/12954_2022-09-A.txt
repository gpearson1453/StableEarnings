Footnotes
DISKO TRIBUTE pressed the pace from outside, moved up to duel around the bend, put a head in front in upper stretch, put away inner rival nearing the
sixteenth pole and held the runner-up at bay. DRAW THE FOUL stalked duo outside a rival, chased three wide around the bend, drifted out in the lane and
finished gamely to the wire but could not get by. MY MAN BAGS was off a bit slow, keen early while stalking in hand, saved ground to the stretch moved out
in the lane and gained the show. UNCLE WILBUR set the pace with DISKO TRIBUTE alongside, dueled with that rival around the turn, was overtaken in
upper stretch, flattened late and got edged for the show. DIVINE FEMININE was off slow to begin, traveled along the inside then tipped out in the stretch
and failed to threaten. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE settled off the pace, rounded the bend four to five wide and lacked the needed response. QUICK INTRO
raced in range four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, continued off the rail into the stretch, got crowded between rivals at the
top of the stretch and weakened. TAKEITTOTHEBANK was off a bit slow from inside, chased two wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch, angled in
some at the top of the lane and also weakened.

Footnotes
KINGS RIVER KNIGHT vied for the lead from inside then moved back to stalk the pace, ranged up four deep on the far turn, took over in upper stretch,
moved clear then held off the late charges from MOBOU and MAMBA COOL in the closing moments. MOBOU raced in mid-pack on the inside, was on the
move but caught in traffic at different spots on the far turn, tipped out to the four path, finished well through the lane and was gaining to the wire. MAMBA
COOL got bumped leaving the gate, moved to the inside stalking the pace, steered out on the far turn, came out further and roused in upper stretch and
finished determinedly outside the top pair late. WORSE READ SANCHEZ was off slow to begin, settled off the rail then moved inside near the back, moved
out then swung widest into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. BUD KNIGHT tracked outside rivals then in three path, moved up outside the top pair
on the backstretch, asked three wide around the far turn and flattened in the final furlong. SHOT OF A LIFETIME sat off the pace and off the rail in the early
going, traveled four deep then five wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT prominent five then four deep early, ceded the lead and
stalked the pacesetter three deep on the clubhouse turn, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, dueled in the two path around the far turn, took
over past the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. SINGLE ME OUT tracked out of range, waited on the inside on the far turn,
angled out in upper stretch, steadied between rivals at the sixteenth pole and lost all late momentum. LIL NAS stumbled badly and bumped outside rival,
went up to vie between rivals then ceded control and began to pull first time in the stretch, stalked on the inside then two wide into the stretch and
weakened. ASARO was off slow to begin, angled down to the inside at the back of the back, swung out into the stretch and made no impact. GOLD RUSH
CANDY vied for the lead early then took full control, showed the way under pressure on the backstretch, dueled on the inside through the far turn, lost the
lead past the quarter pole and folded in the lane. QUICK BUCK vied four deep leaving the chute then pulled when ceding control first time in the stretch,
stalked between rivals, had to steady at the five-eighths pole, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
GO JOE WON vied for the lead inside, moved further out and went three wide into the far turn, maintained a short lead through the far turn and led two wide
into the stretch, drifted out and brushed while battling HIGH CONNECTION through the lane and gamely prevailed. HIGH CONNECTION vied between
rivals into the first turn then pressed from outside, headed rival on the far turn, brushed and got floated out by GO JOE WON in the lane, dug in late and
missed. NEWGRANGE stumbled leaving the gate, vied three deep or four wide into the first turn then chased the top pair around the bend, steered to the
inside for the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and held the show. IL BELLATOR broke a step slow then went up to vie four deep or five wide into the
first turn, chased the top pair between midway clubhouse turn, remained off the rail and came four wide into the stretch and was edged for the show.
ARMAGNAC prominent early five deep into the first turn then chased the leading pair while staying wide around the bend, traveled three to four wide on the
far turn and weakened. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN GO JOE WON AND HIGH CONNECTION
AND RULED THAT BOTH HORSES CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

entering the stretch, rallied outside QUINTECENTS and drove past late. QUINTECENTS stalked off the inside, closed in leaving the backstretch, challenged
into the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, cleared into the stretch, led into the final sixteenth and was overtaken late. WHAT SAY THEE sat off the pace
outside a rival then between foes, pulled at the half-mile pole, got shuffled between early on the far turn, angled out, put in a mild late bid and gained the
show. DANCING RINCA reserved in the early going while racing off the rail or outside rivals, moved into range nearing the far turn, driven four deep into the
lane, lacked the needed late kick and got edged for the show. CHICAGO SOLDIER (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, raced three wide near the back on the
first turn, advanced outside rivals up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and failed to rally. NAISMITH broke out, showed speed while moving
inside then stalked into the first turn, took closer order into the second bend, steadied at the three-eighths pole, waited for room on the far turn, tipped out at
the top of the stretch and could not rally. KEY PLAYER was off slow in the beginning, settled inside, waited for room then altered in upper stretch and
improved position. SMOOTH RIDE was off slow and bumped in the beginning, steered to the inside trailing the field, moved off the rail for the far turn,
angled out to the four path around the bend and improved placings. KAWAZAKI (IRE) was off a bit slow, steadied when put in tight along the rail into the first
turn, chased two wide on the second bend and into the stretch, moved out and failed to find more. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) bobbled at the start, stalked
3deep into the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch while getting bumped from inside and weakened. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS was rank early chasing the
pace, had to steady briefly at the three-eighths pole, entered the lane two to three wide and failed to menace. FACETIOUS sped cleared and showed the
way early, held a diminished lead into the far turn, pressured at the three-eighths pole, dueled on the far turn and gave up command at the quarter pole,

Footnotes
SLOW DOWN ANDY sped to the front from inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, saved ground into the lane, put to the right-handed stick in upper
stretch and held gamely to the wire. SPYCATCHER stalked in the two path, flanked the leader from outside on the far turn then chased two wide into the
stretch, finished gamely three deep in the final sixteenth but could not summon the needed late kick to get by. WAR AT SEA stumbled leaving the gate,
stalked on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out and bid between SLOW DOWN ANDY and SPYCATCHER but did not have enough late.
BALNIKHOV (IRE) was off slow to begin, steered inside then moved out a bit racing at the back, angled four wide into the stretch, chased five deep at the
eighth pole and made a late run for a minor award. CABO SPIRIT reserved on the inside, moved out for the far turn then angled five wide leaving the bend
and lacked the needed rally. MACKINNON bumped in the beginning, rated in the two path, roused into the stretch and failed to launch a bid. DANDY
WARHOL (IRE) guided to the inside early from off the pace, went two wide around the clubhouse turn, took closer order three deep on the backstretch,
tipped four wide around the far turn and lacked further response. ST ANTHONY settled in the two path then moved inside, put to left-handed urging in the
lane and failed to threaten. BARSABAS bumped at the start, stalked three deep around both turns and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
FLIGHTLINE got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, dueled with EXTRA HOPE while staying wide first time through the stretch, rounded the clubhouse
turn three to four wide, took control at the five-eighths pole, disposed of EXTRA HOPE at the half-mile marker, powered away around the far turn, roused in
upper stretch and widened through the lane then coasted in the late to win impressively. COUNTRY GRAMMER stalked two wide then tucked inside on the
clubhouse turn, moved out on the backstretch then steered back in and saved ground around the far turn and into the stretch, could not make any headway
on FLIGHTLINE but kept on to best the rest. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) chased between then moved to the two path racing at the back, asked two wide around
the far turn, could not summon the needed response but held the show. EXPRESS TRAIN bumped with the winner at the start, chased outside rivals then
steered into the two path for the clubhouse turn, came out to the fourth path around that bend, took the second turn three then four wide and got edged for
third. EXTRA HOPE dueled for command on the inside first time through the stretch, inched ahead on the clubhouse turn, was overtaken at the five-eighths
pole, chased the winner past the half-mile pole, dropped back around the far turn and tired. STILLETO BOY broke in and bumped FLIGHTLINE, tracked
from outside early, raced outside a rival three, four, then five wide on the first turn, remained wide to the second bend, took that turn four to five wide and
came up empty.

outside rivals on the backstretch, angled out into the lane, rallied five deep, led late and got nailed by the winner. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) tracked on the
inside, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, closed from inside but got outkicked by the top pair in the final sixteenth. TIZAMAGICIAN sped

going, went three deep into the far turn, got blocked behind a rival and altered in at the five-sixteenths pole, entered the lane two wide and improved
position. TANGO TANGO TANGO rated early and entered the stretch for the first time a bit off the rail, went up to challenge at the half-mile pole, dueled
inside MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS leaving the backstretch and through the far turn, fought back to midstretch, then weakened in the late stages.

and weakened. RED KING raced three deep near the back, angled in on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and failed to menace. TESORO was off
slow to begin, reserved at the back while off the inside on the first turn, trailed to the far turn, taken out wide around the bend and never got involved.
