Footnotes
CHARLIE THE GREEK was void of any early speed, saved ground through the home turn, was closing, took control in early stretch and drew off as an easy
winner. MY FRIEND LINUS was taken back early, raced far wide into the final turn, angled towards the inside through the turn, followed the winner home
and finished second best. ILOVECHARLYBROWN raced in mid pack early, advanced six wide through the second turn, couldn't match strides with the top
two and was along for third. AULD LANGE SYNE set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the second turn, drifted out through the turn and
weakened. SIGHT LINE pressed the early pace, went four wide through the second turn and faded. RUNNER RUNNER INDY was unhurried early, angled
out eight wide through the second turn and never fired. RAVENS DELIGHT stalked the early pace along the backstretch, angled out seven wide through the
second turn and flattened out.

competition rather easily, kept to task late, glided under the wire. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD found nice clean trip around the first turn, raced in a clear pocket
down the backside, shifted into the three path leaving the quarter pole, under a long drive secured the place money late. CONGRUENT very nice stalking
position leaving the first turn, rated while just off the outside flank of the leader, came under a drive leaving the quarter pole, could not stay with top pair,
held the show money under the wire. BRIGHT FORECAST stumble and bumped at the start, raced off the pace along the inside, pressed on far turn, even
through the wire. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED bump at the break, raced well off the pace and along the inside, asked second turn, outrun. I KNOW YOU

Footnotes
CODIGO set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turns, dueled with HIDDEN ROD to the wire, was hard ridden and prevailed for the win.
HIDDEN ROD tracked the early pace, advanced five wide into the turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled to the wire and finished second best. GHOST OF
KHOZAN pressed the early pace, was eased back off the pace along the backstretch, angled in late and finished a game third. BUSHWICK BRUISER raced
in mid pack early, went five wide into the second turn, was gaining and needed more ground. KING TSUNAMI was reserved off the pace, was taken back
first turn and finished belatedly. JONNY QUIST was taken back early, went three wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. REUNION TOUR was
void of any speed, went six wide into the second turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
GOLDEN JUAN sent after the lead at the bell, raced along the inside into turn, coaxed his speed while always under outside pressure, dug in leaving the
furlong marker, all out furious drive, held onto the gold medal under the wire. OMAHA RED very nice stalking position just outside the leader, loomed a
threat nearing the quarter pole, under a long sustained drive could not quite catch the winner through the stretch. BIG CITY BOB tracked the leaders into the
turn, crafty move slipping through along the rail, raced along the inside through the stretch, finished up willingly under the wire. FAST BREAKIN CASH clean
start, raced between runners into the turn, came under two sided pressure, even strides late. WHAT'S TO BLAME raced well off the pace early on, outrun
through the stretch. COMMISSIONER G slow to start, never a threat. TIMES PROVIDED FOLLOWING REVIEW DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
INANNA'S QUEST was allowed to settle early, raced three wide through the second turn, angled out in early stretch, was closing, took control at the eighth
pole and surged clear. OUR SWEET PEA set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail through the turn, kept on through the stretch, was no match late and
finished second best. NEW YORK ROCK STAR tracked the early pace, made a middle move along the backstretch, raced five wide through the second
turn, took a brief lead, couldn't sustain and flattened out. BRIGHTSIDEOFLIFE hopped at the start, was void of any early speed, angled out to the seven
path out of the turn, was gaining late and needed more ground. IRAZU was taken back early, went four wide through the second turn and finished evenly
late. BLAME THE GODS was unhurried early, saved ground into the home turn and never fired. SCAMPER ALONG was up close from between rivals and
faded.

the rail around the turn, steadily picking off rivals one by one, found a bit of traffic in deep stretch, waited and surged through the opening late. REDEEM

willingly late. MIDNIGHTCHARLY raced along the outside in the early duel, sent after the lead leaving the quarter pole, could not match strides with leaders
in deep stretch, finished off even late. AMATTEROFTIME slow into stride, raced well off the pace, under an aggressive ride, leaving the quarter pole, shifted
out seven wide deep stretch, found good strides, not enough late. ARCH CAT raced middle of the pack into the turn, came under a heavy ride around the

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN KATIE was unhurried early, loomed seven wide through the second turn, was closing fast, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear.
MAXINE MACHINE raced in mid pack early, advanced between rivals into the home turn, angled out through the turn, passed rivals and finished second
best. DAILY PLANET was reserved, early, went six wide through the second turn, made a bid at the quarter pole and flattened out. SOLEADA was reluctant
to load, was void of any early pace, raced between rivals through the stretch and found her best stride to late. SALLY'S MUSTANG pressed the early pace
from off the rail and tired. VODKATINI set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the first turn, angled in along the backstretch and weakened.
THREE COINS was allowed to settle early from between rivals and was no factor. GOLDEN EFFECT was not far back early, raced five wide through the
turn and was empty late. SYNONYMOUS was taken back early, raced four wide into the home turn and offered no late rally. MAGNIFICENT PEARL stalked
the early pace from the inside and faded. SAIGON tracked the early pace, raced four wide into the second turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DANCER'S MELODY The skipper put the squeeze play on early, took control of the pace around the turn, slipped away leaving the quarter pole, went clear
late under a comfortable drive. GHOST MAIDEN flanked the outside wing of the pace setter into the turn, came under a steady drive leaving the quarter
pole, unable to catch the winner, stayed on for the place money late. STORMBEAM tracked from the outside, sent to the attack while running in the four
path, shifted inside deep stretch, finished up willingly. MS. MALEVOLENCE hustled hard at the open, shuffled back while trying to secure the lead along the
inside, pressed hard turn, weakened stretch.
