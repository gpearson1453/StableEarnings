Footnotes
SHE TAKES FLIGHT was quickly clear, showed the way in hand staying off the rail, received some hand encouragement in the lane and proved much the
best ridden out. A KITTEN FOR KATIE gained the inside into the backstretch, angled two wide midway on the second bend to commence her bid, took over
second midstretch then could only pull away for the place late. MARIA'S GIFT trying to drift out while boxed in on the first bend, was checked solidly for
nearly a sixteenth of a mile, altered to the outside entering the backstretch, was widest taking the second turn and gained third deep stretch. DRAGONFLY
KISSES raced closest to SHE TAKES FLIGHT from outside, took the rail into the second turn and flattened out for the drive.

Footnotes
CAMARGO was sent to get the early lead, floated out some entering the backstretch, was challenged from inside, moved ahead when let out some on the
second bend, was roused leaving that turn then maintained control while kept to task to the wire. BUREAU bumped after the start, advanced from inside to
share the lead on the backstretch, did not stay with CAMARGO on the second turn, never relented in the lane, lacked the needed late kick but was easily
best of the others. KEEP ATTACKING broke a bit inward, did not stay close running widest on the backstretch, took over third two wide on the second turn,
fanned out some for the stretch run and could only pull away for the show. TRUIST forced in some at the start, bumped BUREAU, retreated from between
horses on the backstretch, moved to the rail into the second turn and gave way the last two furlongs.

SILVER POM POM broke on top and was sent to a clear lead, was then allowed to relax, showing the way just off the inside, fanned out some as she was
asked entering the lane, gradually drifted out but held sway under steady handling. FRIEND broke a bit outward, bumping WITCHING, chased from
between rivals, was two wide on the turn, lost considerable ground, fanning widest into the stretch, made a strong move the last furlong, came up short but
caught WITCHING for second. WITCHING bumped at the break, raced in the second flight just outside SILVER POM POM, moved clear for second on the
bend, lost ground swinging out to path five for the drive, found best stride too late but was easily best of the others. QUEEN EKATI void of speed, though
hustled along at the start, advanced from inside on the turn, angled outside SILVER POM POM into the stretch and had no late bid. EKATI PEACE retreated
from outside on the bend, swung out behind FRIEND entering the lane, angled in upper stretch and continued to fade.

HALO COUTURE on the backstretch, moved ahead when roused after a half mile, was just off the inside on the second bend, challenged from outside
approaching the quarter pole, took the rail into the lane, could not stay with KIMBERLY FRANCES, angled outside that one inside the final furlong, could not
close the gap on the leader but proved easily second best. DARING DAMSEL hesitated at the start, was urged up from outside, went for the lead four wide
on the second turn, began to yield leaving that bend and flattened out through the stretch. HALO COUTURE soon had the lead, was challenged from
outside on the backstretch and began to fade along the rail with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT broke on top, was rated inside off the early speed, angled outside JETS A GINNIN midway on the backstretch, was two wide on the
turn, floated out some entering the lane, rallied to take the lead inside the last eighth then drew clear under a drive. JETS A GINNIN lugged in some to bump
I LUV THIS BAR leaving the chute, took the lead after the first furlong, moved clear, saved ground on the turn, could not hold off DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT
inside the final furlong but was easily second best. I LUV THIS BAR bumped RACETOTHEFINISH at the break, was bumped and forced in some leaving
the chute, caught in tight quarters between horses at the half mile marker, was boxed in on the turn then flattened out from inside for the stretch run.
RACETOTHEFINISH bumped at the start, was crowded leaving the chute, moved out widest soon after that, did not keep up three wide on the turn, swung
outside DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT entering the lane and also had little to offer the rest of the way.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S MAGIC was kept close from outside, stayed in path three through the turn, began to gradually lug in under right handed pressure midstretch,
came beside ARCH FLYER nearing the sixteenth marker and edged ahead in the waning yards. ARCH FLYER broke on top, was settled off the early pace,
angled in entering the bend, rallied along the rail in the lane, took the advantage inside the final furlong, was challenged nearing the sixteenth marker, did
not have enough left in the late going but was easily second best. HELEN MAE'S SONG took the lead shortly after leaving the chute, stayed just off the
inside on the turn and began to wear down between rivals in the stretch. HOLD THE SPENDING chased from inside, angled out when her path was taken
into the bend, moved out widest at the top of the lane and failed to have a late bid. DEAUVILLE MIST was soon well back, stayed off the inside and was
empty for the drive.
