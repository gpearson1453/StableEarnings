take second the final strides. LEMONSONDESURPRISE stumbled leaving the gate, picked up the chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn just
off the rail, flattened inside the sixteenth pole and was nipped from second the final strides. IHEARTRAINACOMN gave chase, rounded the turn about the
three path and proved empty in the lane. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL engaged in close early chase outside, bore out on the turn and showed little more.

ARROWWOOD stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, took the nod past the half mile pole and dueled clear toward the quarter, was kept
sharp through the upper stretch then taken in hand later yards. RAVIOLI MAMA stalked the pace from the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then dueled through the upper stretch for second. I B NASTY was shuffled back at the start then saved
ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, improved in the three path of the far turn and came along for third later yards. BOCA
BIRDIE settled off the rail on the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the
far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. CALIFORNIA SUZY tapered in and rated the early pace inside, was met past the half mile pole and dueled close
through the backstretch, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. WHOSE THAT LADY
rounded the first turn in the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. BUFF N settled
toward the inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.

determinedly to deter the stretch effort of ZAINO BOYZ, who set a pressured pace, was met at the rail at the quarter pole but dug in gamely from that point.
SILVER CASTLE chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and finished well. SCOTTY SILVER chased and rounded the turn in the five and six paths
and finished well; widest. WIZARD OF ODDS chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn two deep then flattened the final sixteenth.

COMPANY CLOWN chased toward the inside, came through the turn in the three path, eased just outside ODIE leaving the turn and dug in to take over the
final strides. The latter came away a bit rank and made contact with Ruling then pressured the pace, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the
turn, dueled to a brief lead mid-stretch but was caught in the final strides. SHACKLEFORDS STORM took a quick lead while angling to the inside and set a
pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, but was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. INSIDE RISK gave chase from well back,
rounded the turn off the rail, angled to the outside leaving the turn and finished evenly widest. MISCHIEVOUS JESSE chased inside, raced near the rail on
the turn then weakened in the lane. KUKULKAN was bumped at the break, gave close early chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened in
the lane. RULING was bumped inward and into Kukulkan, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four and five path then weakened
from mid-stretch.
