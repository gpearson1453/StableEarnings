GIGGLES AND SMOKE sprinted to the lead from under pressure from outside rivals and was a game second. CHIEFTESS vied for the lead from the two
path through the turn and was empty in the drive. MERRY MIX UP was close up throughout while racing four to five wide giving an even effort. GARNETS
GAL pressed the pace from the two path and lacked the late response. FLAN was rank early, was five wide in upper stretch but never made a bid.
