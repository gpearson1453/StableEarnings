bumping THREE GIRLS into BODE'S GIRL, came under hustling and chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors on the line. BODE'S GIRL got bumped twice
at the start and was forced to take brief hold conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide down the backstretch
and then two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, traded some leans and light
brushed with KARA PARA, through to the finish while offering up late foot and showing good courage to secure the show honors. KARA PARA two to three
wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
trading some leans and brushes with the aforementioned foe while kicking on belatedly to the finish and was just up for the last major share. LUNA'S SONG
shied in at the start filling the space left vacant by the breaking inwards CAMP AKEELA, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then three to
four wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild kick but was outfinished in the late stages.
LADY QUINN coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
bid but was outkicked. THREE GIRLS got bumped when breaking in at the start by CAMP AKEELA bumping BODE'S GIRL twice, ranged up to show the
way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
under threat and was collared a sixteenths from home, weakened in the very late stages. SPOILS OF WAR coaxed from the start, chased along the inside
under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. STRIKING MELODY chased two to three wide
down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four wide for home and made no impact.

three wide into upper stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
BLAME IT ON DADDY broke a bit awkwardly, was urged along on the outside, went three wide for most of the turn then moved to the four path, gained
under a drive to make a bid into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead into the final furlong, switched to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and
just held under strong urging. UNCLE MARTY came in at the start then bumped hard with a foe, was allowed to settle at the rear of the field, went three
wide around the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then driven four wide into the stretch, brushed with a foe while rallying under a left-handed crop
outside the furlong marker, moved in behind the winner into the final sixteenth, drifted in while gaining late and just missed while able to get the place.
IMPRESSOR broke in then was hustled, pressed the leader on the outside while detached from the rest of the field, drew even in the four path around the
turn, inched clear coming to the quarter-pole, bore out nine wide into upper stretch then was put to a right-handed crop, took a straighter course under
left-rein guidance while fighting on in the middle of the track and missed but was clear for the show. ATLANTA'S ACUNA broke a step slow, moved up
under urging on the outside, pursued the front two under strong urging in the two path for most of the turn then shifted to the three path, gained to make a
bid into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished then taken in hand late. MR. MARLIN broke fast while bumped in the
hindquarters, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FLASHY ALEX was sent
hard from the start then hard ridden on the outside, went five wide early on the turn then dropped to the two path around the three-eighths, made his way to
the rail later on the bend, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. HYPER SPEED was bumped hard between foes at the start then
pinched back, settled under light urging, went three wide around the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SOMAMA
BEACH was hustled from the gate, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path around the turn, lost the lead before the quarter-pole and
faded.

Footnotes
EMARAATY (GB) coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and spurted away in the two path through the first turn, showed the way
settled into a comfortable rhythm just off the inside down the backstretch tucking to be along the rail at the seven-sixteenths, remained patiently handled
through the far turn along the inside as rivals in behind took closer order, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, held well and clear kept to
task to the finish to prevail. CITY MAN bobbled at the break, tracked the pace just off the inside leading the main flight, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but proved no match for the front runner while along clear for the place honors.
WINTERS BACK led briefly early on before settling along the inside tracking the spurting away leader in closest aim isolated between that lone rival out front
and main body of the field gapped behind, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths taking first run at the leader, angled three to four wide for home closing
in mildly straightened away into upper stretch before weakening in the late stages while safe for the show honors. OCALA DREAM tracked the pace along
the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no headway through the final furlong. DYNADRIVE
just off the inside tracking the front from the tail of the field, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch and came up empty.
MOUILLAGE (FR) settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
CROWDING OUT was hustled from the start, showed speed on the inside of a rival then was eased back before being switched out before the half-mile
pole, stalked outside from that juncture, vied in the three path around the turn, was asked inside the quarter-pole then took over in upper stretch, kicked
clear inside the furlong marker and proved much the best while kept to the task. UNION DOLLY broke awkwardly and was off a bit slow at the rear of the
field, settled towards the back, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole then was roused, came under a drive in upper
stretch and improved for the place. CROSSTALK bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front then showed the way in hand, vied inside of the winner in
the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back outside the sixteenth-pole and
weakened then lost the place while just able to get the show. MOSTLY HARMLESS stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe while off a bit slow, was
coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the two path around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and finished willingly
to just miss the show. LINN PIER settled towards the rear, was roused three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MY DELICIOUS was corrected off heels
after the start, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TIZMET was well
placed just off the pace, saved ground around the turn and came up empty. INFRINGEMENT broke out then was snatched up with the left-rein and off a
step slow, was urged along at the rear, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LEMON TAFFY was urged to
establish position early then tracked on the outside, went four wide while roused on the turn, floated six wide outside the quarter-pole then seven wide into
the stretch and capitulated.

BACKYARD MONEY broke on top and led early on before being displaced from command five furlongs from home, raced four then three wide in closest
aim of the leader coming under light coaxing and advancing to take over the front swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive and
was under hand urging to the finish. SISTER SUPREAM coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to just get up for the place honors in the last jump. NEW YORK BANKER coaxed from the start, advanced
to take command five furlongs from home and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing under threat at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch displaced from the front, weakened in the late stages getting nailed for the place honors on the wire. DAILY BRIEFING

the quarter-pole, was asked while tipping three wide into the stretch, bumped with WATERVILLE while making a bid at the three-sixteenths then took the
lead, responded well in the final furlong, fought with the aforementioned foe into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging. NEW GINYA broke a
step slow and was last to commence, settled towards the rear while saving ground, was roused while shifting three wide into the stretch, moved out inside
the eighth-pole, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss while clear for the place. WATERVILLE broke very fast, showed speed
then dropped just off the pace before the first turn, went around that bend in the three path, settled down the backstretch, was urged three then four wide on
the far turn, gained to make an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, bumped with the winner at that point, battled under a drive to near the sixteenth-pole and
was outfinished while clear for the show. FIST FULL OF DICE showed speed on the inside, was taken back off the pace late on the first turn, tracked
directly behind the leader down the backstretch, moved from the two to three path on the far turn, made a bid while asked coming to the five-sixteenths, took
the lead outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back inside the furlong marker and weakened.
RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA broke near the back of the field, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, started the far turn in the two path then
shifted four wide outside the five-sixteenths, moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. STELLA MARS traveled three wide
around the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty. I'M FINE settled
on the inside, came under coaxing late on the backstretch, was roused while continuing to save ground on the far turn and also lacked the needed
response. JUST OK IS NOT OK showed speed on the outside, went four then three wide around the first turn, moved clear onto the backstretch, showed
the way through moderate fractions, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked while being headed inside the five-sixteenths and gave way. LOOKIN
TO FLY went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused four then five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted out
around the furlong marker and came up empty. U GUYS ARE NO FUN rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, dropped back four then five

Footnotes

under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, shied out under a left handed
stick nearing the sixteenth marker, had the rider switch the crop and corrected with a right hand and shied inwards seventy yards from home while holding
safe to the finish. NOBILIS lunged slightly at the break, chased along the inside down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route at the quarter pole and tipped three wide straightened away into upper stretch, ran on willingly to chase the winner home
well clear of the rest and along second best. LT. MITCHELL broke in at the start under hustling and bumped ULUMALU, chased three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, floated four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. ULUMALU broke in at the start bumping ARCTIC
ARROGANCE, then got bumped by LT. MITCHELL, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. SOUNDS SPOOKY coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide for home and weakened. RADIO RED coaxed from the gate, chased six then five wide under coaxing
from three furlongs out, cornered five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. PAGETT coaxed from the gate, raced four paths off the
inside early on, then got out when climbing due to the kickback seven paths off the inside near the nine-sixteenths before being tucked in a darting fashion
to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing with three furlongs to run, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. GARTH
ROAD broke in at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BAL HARBOUR was coaxed to the front, showed the way while well rated in the two path, responded well around the final turn, spun five wide into upper
stretch and drew off under a strong hand-ride to prove much the best. PORTOS went five then four wide around the opening bend, settled towards the back
on the outside, was urged three wide around the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and earned the place while no match for the winner. WAR
STOPPER went four then five wide on the first turn, settled on the far outside, was urged five wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was
along for the show. HEALING was urged down the initial straightaway, went four wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside, chased in
the four path on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and tired. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the
outside in the three path, chased around the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. NIGHT OPS broke in and bumped hard with
a rival, traveled three wide around the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path under strong urging and failed to
respond. GENTLEMAN JOE was bumped hard at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, chased inside to the two path
around the far turn and capitulated. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS went four wide on the first turn, was reserved at the back, passed the half-mile pole under
urging, started the far turn in the two path then shifted four wide and was no factor. AIR ATTACK was bumped hard at the start and forced strongly into
another foe then taken up, saved ground while off the pace, was urged along on the final turn and failed to respond.

outside, chased four to five paths off the rail down the backstretch before tucking briefly three wide at the half mile pole and then to the two path once in the
far turn under light coaxing from the half mile pole, came under further motivation from the rider near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch
rallying to seize narrow command at the three-sixteenths, then dug in under a drive edging away to the finish kept to task. GULFPORT established the front
just after the start and showed the way five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch under some pressure early on from WESTERN GHENT to the
inside, tucked to the four path half a mile from home and shook off that inside prompter at the seven-sixteenths coming under some pressure from a pair to
the outside and floated out five wide midway on the turn, came under coaxing through the latter portion of the bend and continued to get out slightly as the
rider attempted to angle in and went seven wide at the head of the stretch, got collared with three-sixteenths to go and drifted an additional path a furlong
out, then ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest to be along second best. BLAZING SEVENS coaxed from the gate, chased six then five
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five

before tipping five wide put to coaxing at the three-eighths, retreated through the latter portion of the turn and swung six wide at the top of the stretch, dug in
under a drive and weakened in the late going being bested for the show honors in the final strides to the finish. BOURBON BASH came in at the start

Footnotes
CUPID'S HEART was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths then slipped through along the
rail to take the lead coming to the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch then drifted further out, extended the advantage under a right-handed crop
into the final furlong, drew off into the final sixteenth and proved much the best while eased up late. TOSCONOVA BEAUTY was hustled from the start,
raced just off the pace, dropped back into the kickback at the nine-sixteenths then moved out, went four wide around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch
and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. RIBOT'S VALENTINE was hustled to the front, showed the way while off the pace, went around
the turn in the two path, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the winner approaching the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch and tired.
JULIANA'S ROSE was urged along well off the pace, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. FANCY FELINE
chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and faded. BANKERS DAUGHTER was urged along at
the rear, went two then three wide on the turn and was no factor.
