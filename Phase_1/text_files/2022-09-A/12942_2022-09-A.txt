Footnotes
PRIVATE CREDIT set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused at the top of the lane, kicked clear under urging and
was in hand the final yards. VIDEO PRINCESS raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide at the half mile marker, chased two wide on the far turn
and rallied for second. TURF ACCOUNTANT raced two wide off the pace, moved up inside on the far turn, angled out at the eighth pole and rallied mildly.
ONE OF THE ONES pulled in the early stages on the rail, then tracked inside, chased inside on the far turn and lacked a bid. SUPER CARO ducked in and
was off slowly, raced off the pace with an inside trip and closed belatedly on the rail. BELMAR SUMMER was off slowly, raced two wide off the pace,
continued two wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. POET'S WOODS stalked two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, then chased and tired. RAPID MISS
TAPIT raced off the pace inside, then two wide on the far turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
EXPECT TO BE READY set the pace racing just a bit off the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled, responded when roused, shook clear in the
stretch, then was all out late to hold on. BEAUTIFUL STAR stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside in
deep stretch, was gaining at the wire and just missed. ALONG THE WAY raced three wide early, stalked three wide, bid between rivals on the far turn, then
dug in and chased the leaders to the finish. WHO U GONNA CALL raced off the early pace, moved up four wide at the half mile marker, chased three wide
on the far turn and tired. IMAGINE THE MOJO raced close up on the rail, steadied entering the first turn, continued tracking close up on the inside, chased
and gave way.
