Footnotes
ONEFINEDAY saved ground setting the pace, gradually drew off through the stretch and won as much the best. LIFE'S EMOTIONS prompted the pace
while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and held on well for the place while being unable to reach the winner. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL was
allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and finished willingly. WAHASHA was forwardly placed early while
racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. LONSDALEITE was not a factor while racing four-wide. CUTETIP stumbled badly at
the start to get away behind the field and was unable to recover.

MARQUE IT UP dueled with Prince of Luck for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off nearing the quarter pole, settled into the stretch with a clear
advantage and maintained a clear edge to the wire while drifting out slightly late. DENNARD was bumped at the start by Command Sgt Major, then was
unhurried, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT saved ground stalking the pace, moved closer on the turn, angled
out for the drive, then altered course to the inside leaving the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. NORSKI dropped back early, saved ground and passed
tiring rivals. COMMAND SGT MAJOR broke in to bump Dennard, the was reserved off the pace, moved up five-wide to offer a bid entering the stretch and
then flattened out. PRINCE OF LUCK vied with the winner for a half mile from along the outside and tired.

ANTECEDENCE prompted Judicial from along the outside, took the lead from the one entering the stretch and drew clear while being ridden out. BEAU
ROCKS saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and finished fast. JUDICIAL stumbled at the start, then saved ground setting
the pace to the stretch and held on fairly well for the show. CONFIDENCE BUILDER stalked the pace racing along the inside while in tight, angled out for
room entering the stretch but lacked a rally. WHATA FLIRT was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and weakened. GOLD ROSE check
from between horses in the opening sixteenth when Staracrossthewater came in, then dropped back was five-wide entering the stretch and was unable to
threaten. SASSY EDIE was prominently placed to the stretch while racing four-wide and tired. STARACROSSTHEWATER came in early taking the path of
Gold Rose, then dropped back, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

HEFTY GARCIA was prominently place while racing three-wide, took the lead entering the stretch and gradually increased his advantage. WHISPER AND
WINK vied with Vanora for five furlongs from along the inside, shook that one off, then was engaged by Hefty Garcia, could not match strides with that one
but was clearly second best. GHOSTFINDER bobbled at the start, then saved ground, moved up on the turn and finished in a mild rally. DREW BIG was
forwardly placed while racing two-wide, steadied in traffic nearing the half mile pole and gave way thereafter. VANORA disputed the pace while two-wide for
five furlongs and stopped.
