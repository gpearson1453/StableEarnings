eighths, moved up under a hustling ride past the three sixteenths, circled four wide into the lane, closed in to take command outside KOZY'S WILDCAT with
a sixteenth to go then was resolute to the wire. KOZY'S WILDCAT set a pressured pace inside, edged away slightly past the three sixteenths, dug in when
confronted nearing the sixteenth pole and held well. NEVER SILENCED drafted back inside, swung four wide into the lane and closed while drifting in.
AFTERMATH bounced around with the winner at the break, eased out and moved up between runners nearing three eighths, bumped again with the winner
soon after, dropped in to edge up past the five sixteenths, was stalled behind rivals nearing the lane, stayed inside but came up empty. PIT STOP MAN ,

SHE'S A TRIPP , taken to rate while saving ground, quickly gained inside foes past the three eighths, waited past the five sixteenths, swung out entering the
lane, surged four wide under left handed asking, took over late and spurted clear. KOBE'S GIRL ducked out the break, corrected and edged up off the
inside, moved between runners soon into the backstretch, sat chilly then was given her cue into the far turn, bid three wide outside the leader past the three
sixteenths, briefly moved clear past the sixteenth pole but was overwhelmed late. ELLAROUGE sped clear early, set the pace slightly off the inside, took
pressure past the quarter pole, fought on into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. PERFECT MOVE eased out early and prompted the pace
outside the leader near the three eighths, was under asking pursuing near the furlong grounds then gave way. SANCTIFIED TIME , taken in hand to track
early, drifted out to about the five path entering the backstretch, corrected and faltered.

ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) stalked the duel, gained a three deep lead mid way down the backstretch, pulled away and was under a hand ride until relaxed
late. LOST MY VOWCHER lacked speed, dropped back leaving the backstretch, raced four wide on the final turn and passed tired horses. OUR HOISTED
MAST disputed the pace racing along the inner rail, gave way leaving the far turn and drifted out in mid stretch. MAID THE JOURNEY disputed the pace two
wide and gave way on the final turn.

Footnotes
ACADIAN GIRL was nudged clear in the opening sixteenth and dropped in to set a rated pace, moved away leaving the half mile marker while in hand,
responded when shoved along past the three sixteenths, opened up a long lead into the lane and proved much the best while steadily hand ridden.
BREVIARY , off a step slow when a bit rank, regrouped and was sent up outside rivals, remained wide all turns, came under a strong ride past the quarter
pole, circled four wide into the lane and churned on willingly to earn the place. MAVILUS saved ground while in range, gave hard pursuit while inside into the
lane, failed to make an impact but kept on with effort. PRINCESS ADIRA , unhurried while off the inside, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a serious
response. MISS DILLINGHAM rated off the winner while stalking, was put to pressure leaving the five sixteenths, stayed on to upper stretch then gave way.
GOLD TIME VIXEN was steadied off heels around the first turn, edged up a bit and chased off the rail, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and weakened.
