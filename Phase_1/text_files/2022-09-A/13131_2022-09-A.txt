CEEBETT'S BOW tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. SHE AINT NO
JOKE stalked the early leader and had the lead on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. FLEEKA was well back, closed
the gap on the far turn and from the seven, path at the top of the stretch was up for show. IF SIX WAS NINE was in touch and roused on the far turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat. FAIRY was in range and saved ground on the far turn but had no impact. THE GREEN PLANET set
the pace but lost ground on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

HIATUS stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew off. DEEP EXPLORER settled off the
pace, raced evenly on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was second best. ROBUSTO was away alertly and had a slim lead on the
far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch faded. DOCTOR UPTOWN was off slow and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor.
HARD N'SWEET was hustled early but chased on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

no impact. BLIND TRUST was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally. KEEN SAMURAI

SUBZERO PLUS was in touch, had a good position on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. MISS TEA
BLONDE was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch just missed. FLECK was well back, closed the gap on the turn,
angled out in mid stretch and rallied late. MOKSGMOL set the pace, had the lead on the turn and vied from the three path through the stretch but was
outfinished. CASSIE'S RAINBOW was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch was outgunned.
ERRATIQUE was off slow and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. STORMY SUZIE was off the pace and hustled
along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no factor. GOLDEN GARTER checked early and saved ground on the turn but had no
impact. WESTLODGE INTRIGUE was in mid pack and roused on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch faded. KOZY KAT stalked from
the outside but chased on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was empty. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE
RESULTS AS POSTED.
