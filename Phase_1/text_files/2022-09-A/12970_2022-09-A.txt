BIONICA set a pressured pace from the inside, was well handled going into the turn when challenged then drew away in mid stretch and was clearly the
best. TESUQUE was unhurried early on then started a run on the far turn, rallied and moved out to be five wide in upper stretch and closed ground willingly
in late stretch to be second best. BIRDIE CURDY was unhurried early then rallied on the far turn, was three wide in the stretch drive while gaining ground
but was no menace. WATERWORKS pressed the pace while racing three wide on the backstretch, was in a long drive and gave way in the stretch. SEEING
DOUBLE was unhurried early then rallied along the inside on the far turn and stretch but was no threat. AMERICAN COALMINER pressed the pace while
two wide, was hard used then gave way. SAINT EROS GIRL was unhurried early then made a run on the far turn while inside, moved out to be three wide
but flattened out in the drive. ITS MY MONEY TOO was allowed to settled then raced two wide on the backstretch making a mild bid then faltered in the
drive.
