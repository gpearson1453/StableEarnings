Footnotes
JUST A WONDER took the lead from inside after the first sixteenth, was encouraged through the bend and steadily widened command under a drive in the
stretch. I DON'T KNOW MARGO advanced from outside to race closest to JUST A WONDER after the first eighth, was just off the inside taking the turn
then could only hold her position through the lane. LORI ATTACK broke on top and was hustled early, lost the lead after travelling the first sixteenth of a
mile, was still in contention while three wide through the bend, lacked a stretch rally and also just held her position late. MORNING LINE NEWS angled out
some looking for a clear path, made contact with MOON PIES IMAGE briefly approaching midway on the backstretch, angled in to save ground taking the
turn and showed interest in the lane as she gradually closed the gap between her and LORI ATTACK. MOON PIES IMAGE crowded and brushed
approaching midway on the backstretch, was widest taking the turn and also found best stride too late in the lane.

Footnotes
PACHI was kept close from inside, angled outside MIND YOUR OWN BIZ into the turn, was roused as he was carried out by the latter entering the stretch,
soon took the lead from between rivals and drew off under urging inside the last furlong. R H SMOAKEM raced in contention from outside, lost ground in
path four on the bend, was forced out further into the lane, battled for second the final eighth and got the nod at the wire. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ set a
pressured pace just off the inside, drifted out to path four entering the stretch, fought gamely to keep second the last furlong, did not have enough late but
was easily best of the others. TALE OF THE NILE hesitated then made a small leap from the gate, was void of speed, advanced from inside on the turn,
floated out some for the stretch run, had a striking position from inside horses with a furlong to go but yielded and drifted out in the waning yards.
RENEGADE BOB moved to the outside early on, stayed in path three on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run, gradually angled out in the lane and
had no late bid.

Footnotes
FOGGY KITTEN broke inward, moved outside COOKIN ROSES midway on the backstretch, took over when allowed on the turn, drifted out some into the
stretch, lengthened command and kept TEMPLUNA at bay under late urging. TEMPLUNA in contention early from outside, advanced two wide on the bend,
gained second with a sixteenth left and was closing belatedly in the waning yards. COOKIN ROSES reluctant to load, broke in stride once the race began,
showed the way from inside, was overtaken on the turn, lost ground fanning out to path six for the drive and ran evenly the final furlong. JUKEBOX MONEY
was caught in tight quarters leaving the chute and bumped with GHAALEB'S SICILIAN, was an early factor between rivals but faded three wide on the bend.
GHAALEB'S SICILIAN soon trailed, though hustled along from the start and was not a factor in a ground-saving trip.

LILY'S WOOFY rated just outside TIZ HOPPIN, went for the lead on the bend, edged ahead upper stretch then drew off under urging the last eighth. TIZ
HOPPIN displayed early speed from inside, was headed on the turn, floated out some into the lane, wore down the final furlong but narrowly lasted for the
place. AROSE FOR LYLA settled inside, picked up her pace on the bend, angled out widest upper stretch and found best stride too late the last furlong. LIL
BIT TIPSEY raced in contention three or four wide to the lane then gradually wore down. KHOZYS CROWN chased from outside, began to angle in
approaching the end of four furlongs, had the inside entering the stretch and failed to have a late bid.

Footnotes
FINE GRAYDAR prominent between rivals from the beginning, moved clear for second two wide on the bend, weaved in some then back out under urging
upper stretch, engaged EVIDENCE inside the last furlong, was all out and edged ahead nearing the wire. EVIDENCE soon had a clear lead, saved ground
taking the turn, was challenged from outside inside the final eighth, fought gamely but did not have enough left in the waning yards. MUNCH bumped from
the rear at the break, was hustled along from between horses early, two wide on the turn, fanned outside TEA AFTER BALLET for the stretch run, rallied
belatedly but caught the latter for third near the wire. TEA AFTER BALLET raced in contention just off the inside, progressed along the rail on the bend to
gain third, swung outside FINE GRAYDAR into the lane and also found best stride too late. COPPER CROSSING was an early factor toward the outside,
failed to keep up four then five wide through the turn and made up minor ground the last furlong. CLEVER BOY broke a step slow and inward, bumping
MUNCH, trailed from inside, advanced some on the turn, angled outside COPPER CROSSING at the top of the lane and improved position a bit without
threatening. B'S TURNING POINT stayed well off the inside throughout and showed little. SWEET LITTLE RUE prompted the pace from outside on the
backstretch but gave way between rivals on the bend.

Footnotes
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE broke in stride, showed the way in hand just off the inside, floated out a bit midway on the turn, was put to urging upper stretch and
drew off the final sixteenth. MARYS LAST SONG prominent between rivals, came next to DELIGHTFUL BREEZE into the turn, was shuffled back
approaching the end of a half mile, moved to the rail leaving the quarter pole, moved clear for second upper stretch, was no match for the latter in the late
going but was unchallenged for the place. TRIPLE SCOUT in contention just outside MARYS LAST SONG, also went for the lead into the turn, was beside
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE nearing the end of four furlongs, flattened out for the drive but was clearly best of the others. WAR COLORS chased from inside,
angled outside TRIPLE SCOUT for the stretch run and had little to offer. AUNT STELLA pressed the pace on the backstretch but gave way from path three
with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
THAT KHENNY pressed MY LITTLE TIPSY from just outside, rallied inside the last furlong, took the advantage inside the final sixteenth and moved clear in
the waning yards. MY LITTLE TIPSY broke on top, showed the way from between horses, moved clear just off the inside on the bend, floated out some for
the stretch run and slowly wore down inside the final eighth. IRISH DECLARATION chased from off the inside, advanced along the rail on the turn, fanned
out some into the lane, altered inside for a clear path midstretch and gained third with a sixteenth left. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY lost ground five wide through
the bend, angled in between rivals upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late. LONESOME DREAM pressed from inside, did not keep up on the
turn, began to gradually drift out midstretch and lost position between horses nearing the last sixteenth. YOU'RE IN COREY was prominent from outside on
the backstretch, failed to stay close three wide on the bend, swung out five wide for the stretch run and had no significant response. WILDWOODS DREAM
was an early factor between rivals but faded from path four on the turn.
