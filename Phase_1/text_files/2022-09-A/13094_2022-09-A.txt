Footnotes
MAGNIFICENT ROCKET stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close through the turn and dug in determinedly to take the nod in the
final strides. DIVA GAL rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far
turn, dueled through the stretch but gave up the nod in the final strides. SHOOFLY PIE settled just off the pace inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole, entered the far turn near the rail, was eased to the five path into the lane and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. VIEDMA rounded the
opening turn in the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn at the rail and could only improve her position.
QUINCYS WAY rounded the first turn in the four path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the five and six paths of the far turn, lugged in past
the eighth pole and flattened stride. CHOPRA saved ground on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase toward the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, eased to the outside entering the stretch and showed little more.

was steadily handled to hold on well. SENECA ROCKS stalked off the rail, bid nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished well
while settling for second. FEEL THE LOVE saved ground on the first turn, bid past the five sixteenths pole, eased outward on the far turn and entered the
stretch about the five path and came along for third later yards. MADY ROSE stalked from the three path, challenged leaving the three eighths pole but
faded in the three path approaching the top of the stretch. CEDARS BULLS EYE settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. KATALIMA settled back in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the

Footnotes
MR HOOVER settled close off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and dug in through the lane to get up the final
yards. HOBE SOUND rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure to turn back Tizbit through the backstretch, rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in
under steady stretch handling but was caught in the final yards. RRACE DAY WARRIOR stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and came along for third mid-stretch. TIZBIT raced with the early pace two deep, challenged
leaving the half mile pole and raced close through the backstretch, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn.
FLOWER HOUSE saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. GEORGIAN MONARCH rounded the first turn five wide, ran in the
three path the second turn and was not a factor. SMOKIN CARAQUENA saved ground.

Footnotes
SHERIFF'S KID angled in early and stalked inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, drew clear into
the lane and was steadily handled to hold on. CHINA CAT saved ground, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path,
drifted into the lane but took second past the eighth pole and was gaining late on the winner. LADY MACHO came away awkwardly and rounded the first
turn in the five path, left the turn outside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced evenly through the lane and got up for third later yards.
LADY KAZA took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail midway
on the far turn then weakened in the lane. MAE SAI PRINCESS checked off the heels of the errant Sheriff's Kid shortly after the start, rounded the first turn
about the six path and left the turn outside, gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, angled to the five path leaving the turn and
showed little more. HANNAHS RED RUBY settled in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn in the four path then weakened. HIDDEN PERSUASION steadied at the rail leaving the five eighths pole, trailed the field from that point, was eased
into the stretch and walked off while appearing sore. The Steward reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Sheriff's Kid for interference shortly after the
start, lodged by the rider of Mae Sai Princess, and disqualified the former to fifth place as a result.

NOID rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the top of the stretch and held
on well under steady handling. WELL EQUIPPED stalked off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide and dueled for
second mid-stretch. BLUE N GOLD saved ground off the pace on the first turn, gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four
paths, angled to the outside leaving the turn and closed for third later yards. AMIDSHIPS stalked from the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, dueled to a slim lead at the quarter pole and contested the edge in the three path of the far turn, but was caught toward the head of the lane
and flattened the final sixteenth. MY BOY CLYDE settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
and showed little in the lane. CHANGE YOUR LUCK rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole then weakened leaving the
far turn. AZURE FIRE saved ground well back, was pulled up in apparent distress leaving the first turn and was vanned off. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MISS WILD stalked two deep on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the quarter, contested the
edge at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to notch out the win over SAX, who steadied off the heels of rivals into the first turn and left the turn
outside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, challenged two deep approaching the top of the lane and dug in gamely to the finish. WATERLOO
ROSE saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and came along for third the final
stride. MONGOLIAN MISSION stalked the early pace three wide, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then
flattened the final furlong. TOOLEGITTOQUIT veered outward leaving the gate then settled off the rail on the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path then flattened widest in the stretch. LAMBEAU LADY bobbled leaving
the gate but recovered to set the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail at the quarter and started to weaken
on the far turn. SARAH BELLUM was never a factor. COLOROFACLOUD saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened at the rail on the far turn. LOOKIN BACK stalked the early pace about the four path, faded past the three eighths pole and was eased the final
quarter.
