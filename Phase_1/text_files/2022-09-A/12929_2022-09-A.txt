DOS REALES was unhurried early, advanced eight wide through the turn, was closing, took control late and edged clear. EL JOKER tracked the early pace,
raced five wide into the turn, angled out, was no match late and finished second best. BERNAVE was void of any early speed, raced nine wide through the
turn, drifted in and was along for third. RED CHILE raced in mid pack, advanced five wide and gave way late. WHO'S ON THE RUN was outrun early from
between rivals and passed tired rivals. LA CHEVA set a three wide pressured pace and faded. SEA OF INDY was reserved early, raced between rivals, lost
path mid to late stretch and weakened. DIABOLICAL PACKAGE pressed the early pace from off the rail and faded. CASINO MAN was unhurried early
drifted out and never fired. CHA CHING CHARLIE was taken back and was no factor. CRAIGS VICTORY was allowed to settle early and was no threat.
