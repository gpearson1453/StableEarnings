ARIZONA ANDREW led early, fell back to stalk, closed steadily and wore down his rival to get up late. BOSS BRIDE was hustled along between horses, set
the pace to the final strides and was outclosed in a good effort. JOHN'S KID was unhurried early, saved ground, finished well and got up for show. IDA
NEEDA DRINK stalked the pace while racing inside, bid, hung late and lost position. PAISLEY'S VISION broke sharply, raced close to the pace towards the
outside, bid and came up empty late. NOBLE CRUSADER failed to threaten in an even effort. DAHLIA'S DANCER broke slowly, swung wide leaving the
turn and was outrun. Hand timed.

set the pace, responded when challenged to duel, was no match late and finished second best. MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY was never far off the pace, raced
inside to the stretch, shifted out for the drive and lacked the needed late response. THE THIRD RING raced mid pack in an even effort. RI' PIN SNAP was
not a factor. MUSICAL GEM raced inside annd had brief speed only. W. WHITEHOUSE raced far back to trail the field and showed little. Hand timed.

DON'TTEASETHETIGER moved up along the backstretch to vie two across, swung out leaving the turn, inched clear and held safely. THE PUBLIC HALO
was in tight between horses on the backstretch, was carried out leaving the turn and went willingly to the wire. WESTFEST got away well, led around the
first turn, vied to the second turn, fell back, went evenly late and settled for show. INCLUDE HOO was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn, found his
best stride late and was gaining ground. LINEMANS CHECK lacked a bid in an even effort and failed to menace. RUN TAPPY was outrun. ITS FIVE
SOMEWHERE pulled up and was vanned off. Hand timed.
