lead until late and drove clear. BLISS THIS sped to the early lead, raced slightly off the rail around the turn, raced along the rail in the stretch and weakened
in the drive. AWESOME DYNAMO , lightly steadied along the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung three wide leaving the bend then chased the pace in a
willing effort. SAM LORDS , four deep on the turn, failed to menace and passed tired horses. SLOE GIN BIZ raced between horses on the turn and
weakened. CRIMSON ROCKET , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in upper stretch. BLAMEITONTHEFUN , between horses around
the turn, gave way. OBOY , steadied in traffic about a furlong after the break, was outrun.

Footnotes
WEST NEWTON (GB) settled outside a rival, angled out and came four wide with momentum into the lane, closed steadily under pressure, took over
between runners in deep stretch and held firm. PURSUING PACE rated in the clear early on, angled out and came under a ride around the final turn, shifted
five wide for the drive, closed in, had is rider lose the whip in mid stretch, kept on gamely but was denied in the final yards. BALLYHOO PRINCE eased out
early and edged up to prompt the pace in hand, moved alongside the leader into the far turn, dueled, shook clear into the lane, kept on past mid stretch, dug
in when confronted a sixteenth from home then gave way grudgingly. T REX rated three wide, edged up near the half mile marker, moved up under a drive
and took on the leader near the sixteenth pole, vied then hung late. CALLOWAY PEAK , in a bit tight at the break, steadied when a bit keen inside rivals
while advancing to the first turn, eased out to race between runners, saved ground into lane, angled out under a hustling ride and came back on a bit.
WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY led early then rated back and dropped in to track, eased out past the five sixteenths and moved between runners, chased past
mid stretch then steadied when in some traffic. TRANSIT saved ground, angled out nearing the lane but only generated a mild kick. SAINT MARCO took
over outside a rival into the first turn then cleared and secured the inside, set a rated pace, took pressure into the far turn, battled with BALLYHOO PRINCE
from the three eighths to the five sixteenths, stayed on to upper stretch then weakened. DIVINE LAW failed to menace and swung well wide for the drive.
ROWDY JESS angled in early and was outrun.

Footnotes
SUPER CHOW came out leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail, dueled with JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY, disposed of that one near the sixteenth
pole and drew out under steady handling. HELDISH broke a bit awkwardly and hit the outside of his starting gate stall when bearing out, recovered to stalk
the pace, lacked the needed rally and passed a tired foe. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY came in and bumped with GRAND ESCAPE leaving the starting gate,
disputed the pace outside the winner and gave way late. DONTINVADEMYSPACE bumped with CAVALRY COMMAND soon after the break, bumped with
GRAND ESCAPE was taken back about a sixteenth of a mile after the start, swung wide in upper stretch and showed some late interest. CAVALRY
COMMAND , forced out leaving the starting gate, failed to be a factor and remained on his left lead in the stretch. GRAND ESCAPE , bumped around
leaving the starting gate, bumped with DONTINVADEMYSPACE about a sixteenth of a mile after the break, was no factor and raced on his left lead in the
stretch.

Footnotes
HE'S INCREDIBLE bobbled at the break, disputed the pace outside BERNIE'S ON FIRE, wrested command under pressure soon into the lane, was roused
clear past the three sixteenths, kept on under strong handling, dug in when joined by THE WOLFMAN in deep stretch, stayed tenaciously and dug in to be
on even terms at the wire. THE WOLFMAN , in close attendance while four deep heading to the far turn, dropped in a path and pursued the embattled
leaders three wide, closed determinedly under solid pressure, drew alongside HE'S INCREDIBLE inside the sixteenth pole, kept on grinding and earned the
tie. SUBSTANTIAL , three wide between rivals while forcing the early pace, dropped back under pressure past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide and
came back on with good energy to gain. BERNIE'S ON FIRE moved up to the inside of three rivals early and gained command, sparred inside HE'S
INCREDIBLE around the turn, ceded to that one in upper stretch, stayed willingly past mid stretch then faded. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) , off a tad slow,
was hustled up behind the quartet and gave hard pursuit, angled five wide for the drive but came up empty. NOVA BOY lost ground four wide and failed to
respond. EXCALIBUR dropped in early and was outrun.

Footnotes
LITTLE NUTTER , patiently handled inside horses down the backstretch, began to move up entering the far turn, swung to the four path leaving the turn,
bobbled approaching the eighth pole, swept to command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. NIBBLES set the pace along the inner rail, opened up
leaving the far turn and gave way grudgingly. SULLIVAN STREET chased the pace, was in the three path in upper stretch, drifted in slightly late and
finished willingly between horses. CALL ME VIVIAN lacked speed, hugged the inner rail in upper stretch, swung to the four path in mid stretch for clear
racing and rallied outside. SILVER SEA stalked the pace, was well positioned between horses in mid stretch and was caught in quarters in the late going.
PRINCESS PALMER , along the inner rail for much of the trip, lacked a rally. BLOCK PARTY bumped with LUNAR ICE leaving the starting gate, was three
wide both turns stalking the pace and gave way in upper stretch. MELIPONINI BEE was not a factor. LUNAR ICE bumped with BLOCK PARTY at the break,
steadied when pinched back soon after the start, lost ground on the turns and was outrun. FASHIONISTA , four wide the far turn, gave way.
MORETHANASTORM raced between horses down the backstretch and gave way. NANCY MY LOVE trailed. An objection by the rider of SILVER SEA
against SULLIVAN STREET for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed. The seven furlong time was not available.

short lead contesting the pace outside the winner, fought on after being headed past mid stretch, wandered outward late and just wasn't quite good enough.
CANOODLE , four wide outside rivals and under early rating, edged up some leaving the far turn, came back out for the drive and churned on. MATTITUDE

top pair soon into the lane but kept on with effort to the wire. NO MORE MASK , close up under rating between runners early, dropped in around the turn
and continued willingly. DECO STRONG , bumped early, rated along between foes then shuffled back near the half mile pole, came three wide into the lane,

six wide in upper stretch and had some late interest. PEYTON ELIZABETH , close up while saving ground past the five eighths, came under pressure

Footnotes
SIBELIUS took over from between rivals without little encouragement, set a rated pace towards rail and handled some outside pressure, moved clear
approaching the lane, responded when shoved on past the three sixteenths then powered away under a steady hand ride. JAXON TRAVELER broke alertly
then was taken to rate off the leaders while saving ground, eased out three wide under asking nearing the lane, gave willing chase but simply was no match
for the winner. WUDDA U THINK NOW , a bit sluggish from the gate, was taken off the rail early on, came under a ride leaving the far turn, shifted out for
the drive but lacked a serious response. NIMITZ CLASS , fidgety just prior to the gates being sprung, broke slowly, raced off the rail into the lane and failed
to menace. WENDELL FONG , off the pace, lost ground four to five wide and failed to respond. QUICK TEMPO prompted the pace outside the winner,
failed to kick on under asking in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SET PIECE (GB) lacked speed, was patiently rated behind horses down the backstretch, commenced his move in the two path entering the far turn, moved
wide turning for home, gained command approaching the sixteenth pole then drew out under steady handling. PAO ALTO (FR) , unhurried early, raced in
the three path down the backstretch, remained three deep around the far turn, gained the lead inside the three sixteenths pole and was no match for the
winner. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) , along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out leaving the far turn, swung outside in mid stretch and passed tired
horses. SIFTING SANDS (GB) , along the rail around the far turn, eased out turning for home, worked between horses and failed to rally. ENGLISH
TAVERN prompted the pace outside BIZZEE CHANNEL and weakened the final furlong. BIZZEE CHANNEL set the pace along the inner rail and gave way
approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
KOBE'S GIRL rated close up while two wide, saved ground into the lane, altered back out past the the three sixteenths, moved up under a drive and
collared RED PRIESTESS inside the furlong grounds, took over with about a sixteenth to go and drew clear. RED PRIESTESS sped to the lead inside rivals
and set a rated pace, edged clear near the quarter pole, came off the rail soon after, kept on under pressure past mid stretch, drifted out after being collared,
failed to kick on with the winner in deep stretch, was gathered up when getting out and just saved the place. HOV LANE , urged along chasing the pace,
saved ground into the stretch and rallied. I HAVE COURAGE , roughed up at the break, dropped well back, raced three wide mid turn, shifted out and came
on late. FOLLOWING WIND bore out at the break bumping a rival and causing a chain reaction of contact, corrected and prompted the pace three deep,
chased into the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way. C TWO , bumped at the break, raced three wide leaving the far turn, angled in and
failed to menace. ISOLA , jostled and forced out at the break, failed to make a serious recovery. HEAVENLY SLAM , slammed sideways at the start, raced
three wide mid turn and gave way. DESPITE THE GIN broke a step slow and was outrun. An objection by the rider of RED PRIESTESS against the winner
for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed
