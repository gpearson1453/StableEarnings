Footnotes
CLASSIC VINYL tracked the pace from the outside down the backstretch, was ridden along near the three eighths pole and finished well to prevail under all
out pressure. FANCEE GRACE C showed good early speed from the inside, dug in inside the eighth pole and finished gamely to the wire.
ANGELOFCANTERBURY pressed the pace while racing between rivals and weakened through the drive. ICESTORMING chased the early pace, raced
along the inside at the quarter pole and raced evenly late. LADY THOR was off slowly, raced off the early pace, was three to four wide in the stretch run and
lacked a bid. TOUGH GAME was void of early speed, raced along the inside around the far turn and never threatened.

around the turn, called on top of the stretch, stayed on well through the wire. BLONDE SAMARITAN slow into stride, moved up along the inside while under
a steady drive, shifted inside leaving the furlong marker, finished up willingly through the wire. CHI TOWN HEAT coaxed along for early position, pressed on
around the turn, heavy pressure leaving the quarter pole, faded through the stretch. PEEP'S DAY tracked the leaders into the turn, shifted out wide at the
top of the stretch, came up empty late. LOST LUGGAGE off the early pace, chased from a seven wide position, urged on while racing wide around the turn,

latter stages. MISS KRISTY stalked the pace, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch, moved up but was no match for the winner.

in the drive. GIVING SPIRIT was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced off the inside in the stretch run and gave way. SOCIAL LADY was
unhurried early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out to race from the outside in the lane and had no rally. BIZ AS USUAL raced seven wide
