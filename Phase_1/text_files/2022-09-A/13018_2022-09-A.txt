STAR OF SHANGHAI tracked the pace back, saved ground and gained position through the second turn, came through inside the leader into the stretch,
made a steady gain and drew off while being kept to the task. SIGN AND SEAL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off down the backstretch,
then drifted out into the stretch, weakened and held the place. TOOSWEETFORME well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed the place. THE X FACTOR well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through
the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and could not gain. DUPLICATED was never involved. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION, THE
FINISH MARGINS WERE ESTIMATED BY EQUIBASE.

the show. CAKE AND EAT IT TO well placed and off the rail, dropped back through the second turn, came through inside into the stretch and passed tiring
rivals. MARSAC well placed, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. ZERO GRAVITY allowed to settle,

Footnotes
A COTSWOLD VILLAGE well placed and off the rail, angled in and moved up through the second turn, came through inside into the stretch, then drew off
under steady pressure. PEMAQUID PETE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the late going, then was no match for the winner and
held the place. UNFLAPPABLE MAX rated close up and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader
into the stretch, then weakened and held the show. CHIC N WILBUR allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled widest in the stretch and
closed well for a share. BEAT THE DEALER well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and evened out.
ROUGH NIGHT hopped at the start, was no factor. CEDUNA was pulled up in the stretch and vanned off.
