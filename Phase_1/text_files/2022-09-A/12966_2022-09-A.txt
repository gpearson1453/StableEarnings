GATHER IN BALI pressed the pace from the outside of Born Into Bad New, took command through into the far turn and was well clear late under steady
handling. MISS TONALIST was off slowly, void of early speed, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and was no match for the winner in tehd drive.
BRADEE CASH stalked the pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had not enough for the top pair in the drive. YES I'M A LADY settled off the
early pace, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and lacked a bid. BORN INTO BAD NEWS showed good early speed from the inside, was pulled up
into the upper stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BATTY stalked the pace while saving ground down the backstretch, moved up just to the outside of Beyond the Hype through the far turn, took command
into the upper stretch and raced well clear late under strong pressure. BEYOND THE HYPE pressed the early leader from the outside, lead nearing the
quarter pole and was no match for the winner in the drive. TABLE ONE was slow early, made an advance through the far turn, raced three to four wide in
the strech run and moved up. BACKGATE BELLE settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly
late. BABY MAYBE was off slowly, raced off the early going and lacked a bid. CONNECT IT raced off the early pace, raced near the inside and never was a
factor. TIZ MY PLAN was unhurried early on and failed to respond. TOOSIE showed good early speed from the inside and gave way the final quarter of a
mile. CABO SUNSET failed to sustain a bid.

ACCRUAL pressed the early pace while racing between rivals and drew off to be well clear late under strong handling. PIONEER TOWN vied for the early
lead from the inside and was no match for the winner late to finish second best. LET'S GO ROMEO chased the early pace from the inside early on,
continued an inside bid through the far turn and had not enough for the top pair. CITY BOY EASTWOOD settled off the early going early, raced five wide
through the upper stretch and raced evenly late. HENNY'S TURN pressed the pace from the outside and weakened through the drive. BAY BE GONE
stalked the pace from the outside, raced four to five wide in the lane and lacked a rally. SNAKEBIT pressed the pace from the outside and weakened in the
stretch run. G'S LAW settled off the early pace raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. BERNUCCI was slow early while racing off

Footnotes
SILVER N LAI pressed the pace and drove clear while racing three deep. WHISKEY'S GONE showed good early foot to cross over from the outside to set
the early pace but was no match late for the winner to finish second best. COLOR FAST stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and
kept on to the wire. THE GRAY BLUR was bumped at the break, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. SYDSTER settled
off the early going and failed to respond. SENATOR CON was shuffled back at the break, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no late response.
LUCKY STREAKER dropped back early and failed to respond.
