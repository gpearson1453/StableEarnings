Footnotes
DASH OF FIRE pressed the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under a strong hand
ride. BRILLIANTBENNY dueled for the lead between horses two wide for a half then was no match for the winner. PLAYING BALL stalked the pace into the
stretch and finished with good courage three wide. NOSEY POWER went evenly. GRANDE RED dueled for the lead along the rail for a half then weakened.
JOHNS BIG RED was no threat. BAD BACK lost contact with his field on the turn, was distanced and eased to the wire.

Footnotes
STARRY JAYLEN pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch, made the lead and drew clear late under brisk handling. SWEET OUTLOOK was
bumped hard at the start, settled close up four wide, bid three wide into the stretch and finished second best. NEXT GENERATION bore out badly at the
start bumping hard with SWEET OUTLOOK, settled mid field then had a mild late rally three wide. MOBIL CHIC trailed early, swung wide and closed ground
late in the middle of the racetrack. THE DEVIL'S DREAM pressed the pace two wide early, and began to faded on the turn. INDELIBLE IMAGE back early,
swung wide and closed a gap late in the eight path. HITCH CITY sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch
then weakened. DIAL AGAIN had brief speed. CLIFTONS BALLERINA was no threat. SUSHI Q settled along the rail and lost her jockey just past the three
eighths pole. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

DREAM never far back, rallied four wide past the quarter pole to make the lead in upper stretch, edged clear late then couldn't handle the late charge of the
winner. KOSCIUSZKO matched strides for the lead between horses two wide down the backstretch, checked nearing the turn, dropped back them came on
again late. YO BERBS dueled for the lead three then two wide into the stretch and was outfinished. ALL STAR JUSTICE stalked the early pace, bid three

late rally in the four path. VOLUME OF TRUST bumped at the start and closed some ground late in the five path. SURROUNDER had good early speed
