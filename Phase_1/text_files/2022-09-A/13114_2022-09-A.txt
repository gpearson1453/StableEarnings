Footnotes
JUST SAY WHEN was away alertly, then was rated off the lead to prompt the pace two wide on the turn, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole and
hit the front at the furlong marker and kicked away to prove best, driving. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) set the pace on the inside and was headed by the winner at
the furlong marker, dug in but could not go with the winner late while staying on to be second best. TWO BIRDS was allowed to settle and saved ground on
the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn, then was up to win the bob for the show award. MUMAYAZ tracked the pace and was three wide on the turn,
came four wide by the quarter pole and had no kick, lost bob for the show award. B D VALESKI was reserved early, three to four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the lane and had no rally. CREATIVE MIRACLE passed the tiring rivals. BONUS APPRECIATION was outrun early then showed some late foot.
CAN'T HUSH THIS was well placed along the inside and tired badly the final furlong. WORDS OF WISDOM was settled three wide and failed to respond.
NOT YET CHARLIE stopped. ROMANCER tracked the pace in between rivals and stopped.
