DIXIE MO set slow pace inside under mild pressure, opened up before final turn, galloped away in the stretch. SAVAGE LOVE trailed to stretch, finished
well up the rail to take the place. FOX APPEAL stalked wide, made a good advance outside final turn, rallied to make a place bid, missed. WITT'S TENNY
TEN steadied mildly behind the winner into the first turn, remained well placed inside to the stretch, lacked rally. BLAME IT ON BREW forced slow pace
outside for half, well placed to stretch, tired. ARAMON stalked outside, faded stretch.
