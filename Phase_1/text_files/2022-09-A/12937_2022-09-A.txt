STICKINITTOTHEMAN bobbled at the start, then was reserved off the pace, came three-wide into the stretch angled in during the drive to split rivals and
finished fast to be up in the final strides. GOAT ROCKS sprinted clear early, set the pace racing slightly off the rail, drifted out during the drive and just failed
to last. GRAZED N' CONFUSED saved ground stalking the pace and finished in a mild rally. YOGYA war prominent from the start, came four-wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. FOREVER AMBER stumbled at the start to get away behind her field, then was unhurried, came four-wide into the stretch but was
unable to recover the lost ground. ISLAND BEAUTY dropped back early while saving ground and failed to menace.

a safe advantage. SILENT DECLARATION was allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. J C EXPRESS was
bumped at the start by Man in Black, then was unhurried, moved up on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. FIRING PIN
dropped back early, swung out to come four-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. MAN IN BLACK dueled with the winner for the lead
from along the outside to the quarter pole and tired. MOON CIRCUMFERENCE saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, but lacked a rally when

Footnotes
STEPHEN JAMES prompted the pace set by Jedi Knight from along the inside, dropped back slightly on the turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole to split
rivals, caught Jedi Knight nearing the eighth pole and proved best under strong handling in a track record setting performance. JEDI KNIGHT set the
pressure pace racing slightly off the rail, responded when challenged and held on gamely to the wire. MISO FAST was unhurried early, came three-wide into
the stretch, angled in during the drive and was gaining late. UPPER ROOM stalked the pace while racing two-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole
but lacked the need late response. CANDIED LUTE was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and
then flattened out.

IGOTTABOOBOO stalked the pace racing in hand, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to just miss. FAITHFUL SON was shuffled back at
the start, then moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished fast to lose a tough decision. WHATSTHEDIFF
dropped back early while saving ground, swung out to come five-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. SUMMANUS bobbled at the start, then saved
ground but lacked a rally. MOOGIE SON was off a step slow, then raced three-wide and failed to threaten. TRINNI VALANTINE saved ground setting the
pace to near the quarter pole and tired.
