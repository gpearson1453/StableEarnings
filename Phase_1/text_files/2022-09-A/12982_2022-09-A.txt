Footnotes
HUNTINGCOCO stalked the pace on the inside, closed in past the quarter pole, swept by the leader in upper stretch and drew off under right-handed
urging. CARLA away quickly then ceded the lead to SHE'S INTHEARMYNOW, chased outside a rival to the turn, went three then two wide around the bend
and bested the rest. MOONLIT MISCHIEF was off slow and bumped inner rival, chased between foes then two to three wide on the turn, moved out in the
lane and kept on while unable to get up for second. KANTHARA drifted out early then got crowded a bit on the inside, losing ground, pulled leaving the
backstretch, saved ground through the turn, raced a bit greenly in the stretch and showed mild response. SHE'S INTHEARMYNOW came out leaving in the
beginning then sped to the front, cleared CARLA and showed the way up the backstretch, led two wide through the turn and into the stretch, overtaken by
the winner in upper stretch and weakened. CARMEL BY THE SEA tracked the lone leader outside rivals, raced three to four wide around the turn and
weakened. CALMING SEA was off slow and bumped at the start, trailed two to three wide around the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
HAIL FREEDOM took control early from inside, got pressured late on the clubhouse turn, cleared at the five-eighths pole, remained clear into the final
sixteenth and held under hand urging. AMERICAN ADMIRAL chased on the inside then two wide on the clubhouse turn, repeated the same paths on the far
turn, put in late bid outside the winner but ran out of time. BOLD ENDEAVOR broke a bit slow from outside, chased five wide around the first turn, remained
wide and navigated the second bend four wide and was along for the show. IMPOSSIBLE TASK was along the four path chasing the leader early, came
three wide into the stretch, tipped out at the eighth pole and lacked a bid. AFFABLE bumped leaving the gate, stalked three wide early on, raced outside
rivals into the far turn, remained three wide into the stretch and flattened out. WICKED TRICK was a bit fractious in the gate, broke slow and bumped with
AFFABLE at the start, moved to the inside trailing the field, saved ground to the stretch and passed a tired rival. TIO MAGICO raced up close in the two path
then went up to press the pace late on the first turn, lost touch with the leader at the five-eighths pole, chased between into the far turn, paused in the middle
of rivals at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane.

MYSTIC FLYER vied between rivals up the backstretch, moved to the inside when FASTTRAINTOTEXAS could not keep up nearing the turn, fought along
the rail through the bend, inched ahead upper stretch, then drew clear in the final furlong and remained strong to the line. RHINO vied four deep up the
backstretch, three deep around the turn, challenged for command to the eight pole, then saw the winner slip away but stayed on to secure second. GOLF
DRAMA vied three deep between in the early going, moved into the two path on the turn while battling between rivals, could not match the winner in
midstretch and got edged for the place. SHIP AND SCAM chased in the two path around the bend, steered out in the lane and put in late run outside the top
trio. TOM AND JAZZY was off slow to begin, chased off the rail, two to three wide on the turn, lugged in upper stretch, straightened out and churned on to
the wire. SURE PROSPECT dropped back off the pace, went three to four wide around the turn, ran up behind rivals and altered out into the stretch and
could not rally after. MAXIMUS DECIMUS was off slow from outside, traveled in mid-pack well off the rail, navigated the turn four to five wide and lacked a
rally. SLIGHTLY DIRTY hit the gate, trailed inside and failed to menace. BARBACOA came away slow, quickly moved into range, chased three to four wide
on the turn and weakened. FASTTRAINTOTEXAS broke a step slow then sent to vie for the lead inside a trio of rivals, failed to keep up leaving the

NEVER FOR MONEY pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the turn, cleared in upper stretch and began to lug out, responded when challenged in
deep stretch and held gamely. DANCING CRANE raced up close on the inside, tipped out into the stretch, drifted out in the lane, drew alongside the winner
in the final sixteenth but could not get by. STORMING LADY settled off the pace three deep, steered five wide leaving the bend, angled out further in the
stretch, closed well and kept gaining to the wire. NICE ICE chased two wide into the turn, traveled between rivals around the bend, came three wide into the
stretch, got floated out in the lane, lost path late but was not getting by the top trio. BLUSHING (FR) got crowded shortly after the start then took a bumped
from outside early, began to pull the rider along up the backstretch, moved inside and saved ground around the turn, tipped out in the lane and finished
evenly late. BOWL OF CHERRIES raced in mid-pack between rivals, went two then three wide around the bend, angled out in the lane, lacked room and
had to steady near the sixteenth pole and could not regain momentum. LOUD LOUD MUSIC came in and bumped early, went two wide into the turn, angled
out to the four path, steered out widest in the lane, got brushed from inside and could not rally. A NEW PEACE got shuffled back early, raced along the
inside then three wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane, got floated out and brushed in the stretch and improved position. INVINCIBELLA (GB) trailed
on the inside through the turn and failed to menace. MADEIRA WINE broke a step slow to begin, raced near the back three deep into the turn, angled five
wide leaving the turn, moved inward in the stretch and lacked a rally. SUPERSONIC FLYER set the pace under pressure to the turn, dueled around the
bend, lost the lead at the top of the stretch and weakened. MALIBU MISTRESS chased outside a rival then three deep on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, moved out then got floated some in the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MEMORIES broke out a bit then sped clear and moved to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch then gained company at the
seven-sixteenths pole, dueled with DESERT DAWN through the far turn and into the stretch, maintained a short lead into the final furlong and edged away
late. DESERT DAWN stalked the leader from inside then moved out into the backstretch, applied pressure at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled around the
far turn, kept the pressure on through the lane but failed to find the needed late kick in the final sixteenth while clearly second best. GRACE ADLER was
along the three path through the first turn chasing the speed, tracked four wide through the far turn, could not summon the needed response in the stretch
but finished a clear third. CINNAMON CAT up close in the two path early, stalked outside a rival or off the rail in the middle stages, dropped back under
asking three wide on the far turn and weakened. UNDER THE STARS threw her head and came away slowly at the start, trailed three wide around the
clubhouse turn, went four to five wide on the second bend and failed to threaten. MALIBU MARIE settled in the two path early on, took closer order up the
backstretch and steered to the inside, saved ground to the stretch and weakened.

PRIMER DIMER chased five to six wide on the clubhouse turn outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, collared the leader past the eighth pole and
drove past. GRANADA FLAVOR tracked five wide into the first turn, angled down to the two path around the bend, came three wide into the stretch, moved
out in the lane and rallied to gain the place. ROCKY GIBRALTAR got knocked into rival at the start, raced off the rail then angled in on the first turn, bid
inside on the far turn, took over midway around the turn, cleared at the top of the stretch, overtaken near the sixteenth pole and got edged for second.
STAYIN' OUT LATE chased four wide into the first turn, four to five wide on the second bend, within striking distance in the final furlong but lacked the
needed late kick. BRAVESTONE sped to the front from inside then moved out a bit off the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, overtaken past the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive. OCULUS got bumped from inside at the start, became rank and was climbing while wide on the first turn,
remained wide through the second bend and could not rally. ECONOMICAL broke in the air and spotted the field several lengths at the start, steered to the
inside, moved out on the backstretch, angled four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. HEY JASPER veered out and bumped rival leaving the gate,
prominent early between rivals in the two path, dropped back a bit and chased between foes, angled in on the far turn and had to pause behind a rival past
the quarter pole, tipped to the two path and had little left for the drive. PAUL L pressed the pace from outside early on, lost touch past the five-sixteenths
pole, angled in with a quarter mile remaining and faded. PORT O' CALL was off a bit slow to begin, went four wide into the first turn near the back of the
pack then angled down to the rail, trailed on the far turn and angled out into the stretch and tired.

stretch, launched a bid from inside, took over past the eighth pole and kicked clear under hand urging. LANE WAY bumped repeatedly with inner rival then
got crowded early, had to check at the three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch and got up for second. COULTHARD (IRE) settled three deep in
mid-pack, stayed off the rail to the stretch, moved out in the lane and finished well but got edged for the place. DUBAI KEY (ARG) sped to the front from
inside, challenged around the turn and dueled into the stretch, clung to a slim advantage at the eighth pole, overtake shortly after passing the marker and
flattened to fourth. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN away quickly in the beginning then dropped back off the pace, checked behind rival at the five-sixteenths
pole, entered the stretch three wide and kept on through the furlong grounds. CHASIN MUNNY raced near the back outside a rival, got put in tight and had
to wait on the turn, chased two wide into the lane, then moved out and improved position. SUPER OCHO (CHI) got bumped repeatedly early, chased on the
inside the shifted to the two path entering the turn, gained while tipping outside the top pair and bid three deep into the stretch but weakened in the late
stages. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) got shuffled between rivals early, chased while outside rivals, steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, swung five wide
into the stretch and could not rally. NERO chased off the rail then between runners, suffered a shuffle when rival came out at the three-eighths pole, raced
two wide into the lane, found traffic in upper stretch and could not rally after. MAVEN away well from outside, raced up close then challenged around the

AWAKE AT MIDNYTE away quickly and came in early, chased four deep then went up to vie for command three deep leaving the backstretch, took over
around the turn and cleared past the quarter pole, led three wide into the drive and drew away. FUN TO DREAM veered in and bothered rivals then lost her
path shortly after, chased five deep then went up to vie four deep into and around the turn, chased the winner into the lane, was closest in pursuit through
the stretch and finished a clear second. REINECKE stalked up the backstretch and altered around rival near the half-mile pole, spun three wide into the
stretch and showed a mild response to earn the show. SCENIC MASTERPIECE broke a step slow, took some bumps from outside early, swung out into the
stretch and finished willingly. TAMING THE TIGRESS got pinballed between rivals and checked early, stalked widest up the backstretch, came five wide
into the stretch and could not threaten. ANACAPA raced up close outside rival, vied between leaving the backstretch and turn, chased the winner two wide
past the quarter pole and weakened. ONE SILK STOCKING pressed the pace from outside early, inherited the lead then vied inside a trio of rivals, failed to
keep up with the winner with a quarter mile left to run and weakened down the lane. DRAW ME got forced into rival and lost her path early, dropped back to
last early, raced five wide into the turn, angled down to the two path then steered back out leaving the bend and could not make an impact. AQUA JULIA got
pinballed and lost her path early, chased five wide into the stretch and came up empty. SMITTEN BY KITTEN fractious in the gate, sped to the front from
inside, went wrong and was pulled up at the half-mile pole, stopped on the turn and walked into the van. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND AN
OBJECTION MADE BY THE RIDER ABOARD TAMING THE TIGRESS AGAINST FUN TO DREAM AND AWAKE AT MIDNYTE. FOLLOWING A REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED FUN TO DREAM FROM FIRST TO NINTH FOR VEERING IN AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO SEVERAL
RUNNERS EARLY IN THE RACE.
