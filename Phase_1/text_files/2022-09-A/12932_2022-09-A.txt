SOPHIE MCTROPHY contended the pace from the rail, disposed of rival leaving the backstretch, moved clear approaching the stretch and was kept to task
under light handling. HUMBOLDTSTRONG stalked the early pace while three wide, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole but was unable to stall the
winner and finished clearly second best. MIDNIGHT TAKE rated well off the pace, gained closer order in the far turn, and rallied outside for show. CHILLIN
WITH CHIP chased outside, rallied outside and improve position late. MISS DIRECTED saved inside and came up empty in the drive. SOARIN DIVA
pressed the early pace, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and gave way.

WICKED WOMAN stalked the pace from the two path, went in pursuit of the leader nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead in the final sixteenth and held
under a late drive. LITTLE HARPER settled five to six wide, closed determinedly late and just missed. MUSICAL RELOAD showed the way through the
backstretch, was overtaken into the stretch, and gave way inside. STOLEN JEWEL slow away then moved up inside, and failed to threaten in the stretch.
STEAMIN DEMON tracked three wide early, and faded gradually. SMOKEDYA dwelt at the start, was distanced by the field, and walked off. STEWARDS
INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving SMOKEDYA. After review of the films SMOKEDYA was deemed to have
had a fair start. No change.

CAB SAV brushed leaving then saved ground while setting the pace, repelled challenged from ETU BABOU entering the lane, and was kept alert in the final
sixteenth. ETU BABOU bumped leaving, sat mid pack while five wide, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, moved up alongside CAB SAV at the three
eighths pole, was unable to get by and kept on gamely. BUCK WEST broke inward, tracked the pacesetter from the four path, cut the corner into the final
turn, was all out into stretch but was unable to improve contending position and held for show. BODEMONSTER settled inside early, chased outside nearing
the quarter pole and closed late. SILVERFOOT rated the early pace inside, and lacked a response when called upon into the stretch. STRONG BELIEF
broke inward, and never reached contention.

BIG AL'S VISION took a quick lead, remained unchallenged into the stretch, and held under pressure. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES trailed early, rallied into
the stretch from the rail, and inched up for place honors. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER stalked the pacesetter from the rail, hustled three wide off the final
turn, and was edged out late. DAD'S LEGACY chased the pace outside, dropped back in the final turn, and rallied mildly late. DUNE D'ORO chased three
wide early, and raced on even terms through the stretch. LONE PIONEER never far back early and lacked a kick needed.

SNAP COUNT sat in striking position, rallied determinedly through stretch outside of PUMP THE BRAKES, dug in late and got up in the final yards. PUMP
THE BRAKES vied outside for the early lead, showed the way through the far turn, responded gamely to challenge from SNAP COUNT and was out
finished. PULL THE PIN trailed the field, swung out into the lane and closed late earning show. CHARMING VINTAGE broke outward leaving, and lodged a
mild bid in the stretch. ESTIFRAAD chased from the three path and failed to threaten. GREAT VISION stumbled leaving, lost rider, did not finish and walked
off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving GREAT VISION. After review there was no change made
to the order of finish.

Footnotes
CHICA HERMOSA took a quick lead while angling to the inside, contended the pace inside of QUICK DIAL, shook clear approaching the stretch, and was
kept to task. AMBER PRINCESS allowed to settle early while racing four wide into the opening turn, gained outside nearing the quarter pole then closed
steadily under urging and got by for second. QUICK DIAL prompted the pace in the backstretch, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, flattened
late and was edged out. ADDYDIDIT reserved off the early pacesetters, urged forward in the final turn then went evenly through the stretch and weakened.
SHIP'S CREEK saved ground early, and passed tiring rival. QUEEN RHONDA chased in the two path, and gave way. VALENTINO ROSSA showed little.
LUCKY HALO hustled away then steadied in the opening turn, chased the pace in the three path and was done early.

Footnotes
FIRST PRINCE vied leaving the chute then saved ground showing the way through the backstretch, responded to looming threats at the quarter pole, drifted
out in the stretch, was under pressure late and dug in to fend off EXHI KID in the last yards. EXHI KID unhurried away, moved up into striking position along
the rail, waited for racing room nearing the quarter pole, was roused into stretch then dueled inside of FIRST PRINCE but was out finished. RED
CHOCOLATE gained outside in the final turn, circled into the lane then finished well and missed for second place. TANGERINE TAXI showed early speed
outside, fanned three wide into the far turn, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole, and lacked the kick needed. LIGHTENING ANNA chased four to
five wide in the backstretch, and lodged a mild bid in stretch. FLASHY SISTER passed tiring rivals late. ADMIRAL VANNGO vied four wide leaving the
chute, was unable to keep pace with the field and faded. MAKE'N TRACKS offered little.

Footnotes
EDGE OF OKOTOKS broke alertly to set the pace, responded gamely to looming threat from CAPA BELLA into the stretch, and held firm while under
pressure late. CAPA BELLA vied outside for the early lead, sat in striking range outside, loomed boldly at the head of the stretch but was unable to stall the
winner and finished second best. IT'S ALEXUS saved ground early, drove three to four wide off the final turn, improved steadily through the drive and held
show. MANGOTANGO jostled away then trailed the field, gained closer order under encouragement, and rallied late missing out. NO COLLUSION brushed
leaving, circled into the lane, and rallied outside in the later stages. CHATTY GAL bumped leaving, lodged a rail bid into the stretch, and evened out late.
TALA tracked inside, drove four wide at the head of the lane, and came up empty for the drive. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE unhurried early, chased wide into
the final turn, brushed FLASHY BIZ in the final sixteenth and weakened. DAZZLING CHIC rated off the pace, drove inside nearing the three sixteenth pole
and gave way in the final furlong. FLASHY BIZ took closer order nearing the quarter pole, kept on evenly then was brushed, rider steadied and yielded.
SANDY BEACH never far back, and tired early.
