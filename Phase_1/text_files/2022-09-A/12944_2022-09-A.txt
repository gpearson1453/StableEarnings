FIVE O ONE tracked the embattled trio in opening stages and raced three wide around the turn, edged closer then given cue in the final furlong, responded
gamely, rallied three to four wide and finished going away. SAILOR CHOW dueled for the lead soon after the start and battled for command around the turn,
shook free at the head of the lane, continued clear into the final furlong then failed to contain the winner late. SACRED KIKI BIRD hopped and came away a
step slowly at the start then hustled up to take a slight lead, vied into the turn then chased up close along the inside, came two wide into the lane, weakened
off the lead but stayed on and captured show. SOLDIER BOY dueled three wide in opening stages, battled on with SAIILOR CHOW around the turn then
flattened in the final furlong and got nipped for show.

Footnotes
BONNIEVIEW vied inside of rivals in opening stages and dueled around the turn, shook free heading into the lane, responded gamely when roused for more
and pulled away from the field while ridden out. FLAT OUT ROSE hustled along in steady pursuit, edged closer along the rail late on the turn, sustained
inside bid into the lane and cleared second best. DREAMINONTHENILE got bumped at the start and raced up close in opening stages, dueled for command
around the turn then flattened off the leader and stayed on for a share. MOLLY BYE O bumped with rival at the start, raced up close in opening stages and
dueled around the turn then tired in the dive. THE AWFUL TRUTH raced off the early pace, chased three to four wide around the turn and lacked a rally.
KID BIZ lacked early speed, chased three wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. KAMEA showed response in early stages then flattened
midway around the turn and continued to tire in the lane.

SING LUCY SING broke sharply from the outside and angled in, set the pace and held firm around the turn, pulled away in the upper stretch and kept to
task while ridden out. GOOD N LUCKY was forwardly placed soon after the start and chased two wide up close around the turn, weakened off the clear
leader in the stretch but stayed on with response to clear second best. FARRAH FOWLER raced three wide up close around the turn, flattened in the final
furlong and just lasted for show. S C SKYLARS EMPIRE hustled along the inside around the turn, came two wide into the lane and narrowly missed show.
SMACKIN GOOD TIME lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally. GOOD TIME GIRL stumbled at the start, was not
too far back midway around the turn then faded.

held firm. YEARS FLY BY raced two wide between rivals just off the embattled flight late on the turn, came two wide into the lane then shifted to the rail in
upper stretch, edged closer and and finished second best. MR. SOLO tracked the embattled into the turn, edged up closer four wide near the quarter pole,
