Footnotes
BEL RAGAZZO set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew off and extended the lead while kept to task. DEPUTY KNIGHT stalked the pace,
challenged between horses on the turn, dropped back and was no match for the winner. SHACKEY'S LOVE raced close to the pace along the inside, put in
a steady effort and just lasted for show. HERE'S YOUR DRINK lagged early, closed inside, was outnodded for third. SPORT COAT moved up along the
backstretch, challenged three across into the turn and gave way. ALEMOON was eased and walked off. Hand timed.

SWEET LADY LANA bumped at the start, rushed up outside, challenged leaving the turn, was carried out, dueled for the lead and inched clear late to prove
best. GATO SICILIANO broke sharply to set the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, responded when challenged to duel and yielded late. AX 'S SHORE
bumped at the start, flashed speed, fell back, went evenly late and held safely for show. BELLA VINO was not a factor. SACRED SONG lost her rider. Hand
timed.

Footnotes
MADISON'S QUARTERS was slow early, rallied around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and wore down her rivals to get up at the
wire. AVA K'S GIRL pressed the pace along the inside, fell back and angled out on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed well, got the lead late
and was caught at the wire. REIGN OF FIRE pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, bid willingly, was in contention late, didn't have enough and settled for
show in a good effort. DAZZLING MIST set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and stopped late. PALACE STAR flashed speed, fell back,
continued in a steady effort and failed to menace. TWITTERATI was off a step slowly, put in a steady effort and did not threaten. LILA'S LUCKY LADY
trailed the field. Hand timed.
