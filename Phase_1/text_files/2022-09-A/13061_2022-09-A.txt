HOSANNA battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, responded under right handed urging and drew off to win going away. YOU NAME IT bore out at
the start, battled with the winner along the inside for a half then was no match while second best. LADY FORTUNE unhurried early, swung wide and closed
ground late outside in the six path. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM never far back, finished with good courage in the four path. COSTUME JEWELRY was shut off
at the start, moved up quickly outside on the turn then leveled off. PENNIESANDDIMES well placed, failed to respond. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT failed to
menace. DEB'S ALL OUT was outrun. SHADY BABY was through early. MINE ALONE was no threat.

Footnotes
AMADEVIL chased the pace in the five path down the backstretch, surged two wide in the three path through the turn, made the lead nearing the quarter
pole, was struck once with a right handed stick past the sixteenth marker while drawing off to win as much the best in rapid fashion. WINE ME UP BABY
sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace for nearly a half then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. ROLLIN ALL THE
WAY stalked the pace and turned in an even effort. TIVIS failed to menace. ANGEL'S SASSY close up early two wide, was through after a half. MARKET
SUCCESS was no factor. TOTALLY OBSESSED had brief speed.

pressured pace along the rail into the stretch then gave way late. AHIMELECH vied for the lead three wide into the stretch then weakened. SURF AND
