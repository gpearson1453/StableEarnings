Footnotes
HIGHLAND SOCIETY rated kindly tracking the early speed, easily reeled in the frontrunner at the top of the lane, drew away in mid stretch and won
comfortably in the end. BIG BROWN BREWSKII was allowed to settle midway on the backside trailing rivals, began picking off horses through the turn
rallying three wide and closed belatedly in the stretch to be a clear second. MAXIMUM DANGER was roused between rivals mid point on the turn only to
weaken inside at the top of the stretch, found some late interest with a furlong to go and passed tiring runners to get up for third. UNSPEAKABLE broke out
badly at the start, quickly recovered to lead at the half, opened up early on the turn, was collared at the top of the stretch and faltered the last sixteenth to
narrowly hang on for a minor award. STEEL WOOL was shuffled back on the rail through the turn to trail and could not recover to be a threat in the run
down the lane. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT tracked just outside mid pack in the early stages, offering a mild bid running through the turn to contend at the top
of the stretch and stopped with a furlong left.

Footnotes
SYSTEMATIC was coaxed forward from the break to set the pace near the inside and in the clear, extended the margin in upper stretch, continued to hold
well under strong and steady urging. UMNEYAAT tracked from inside just off the leader, came off the fence past the quarter pole, chased the winner home
but was no match while second best. PEMBERLEY settled off the pace two to three wide early, moved in a bit late on the far turn then back out, was best of
the rest. HENRY'S GAMBLE stalked from outside three wide through both turns and up close but failed to rally. RETAIL THERAPIST settled at the rear off
the inside, made a mild move four to five wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. REMEMBERING RHODA raced outside three to four wide early,
asked for run three wide on the far turn shifting in late on that bend, was empty for the drive. MUM'S THE WORD chased briefly from between runners,
steadily retreated, was eased through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SASSY MARTINI battled for the lead outside in the three path, began to inch away from the pack turning for home, was roused in mid stretch to keep to the
task and was drawing off late at the wire. PIPESTONE contested the lead between rivals in the early stages, fought through the turn with runners on either
side, chased the winner with a quarter left to go and ran on stubbornly to the wire holding onto place. ROSE RING was void of early speed and trailed early
on, rallied through the turn travelling four wide around runners, loomed in upper stretch but stalled at the furlong marker and had to settle for a clear third.
SPEAK ENGLISH settled near the back after the break, waited through the turn to angle out five wide for clear run for the stretch drive and finished up
outside winning the battle for the minors. SOMEONE ELSE rated just outside the dueling pacesetters into the turn, was ridden outside of horses to go on
with three eighths remaining, could not make an advance and finished evenly to the wire. WAKE UP MAGGIE tracked the trio of pacesetters inside, angled
off a fading runner into the two path with a quarter to go, was roused between rivals at the top of the lane and had little response making no impact through
the stretch. ROYAL CITY REIGN broke sharp to lead, contested for the front end on the rail through the turn, began to weaken two furlongs out and backed
away on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
VESPOLINA , unhurried early trailing the field while kept wide, began to advanced four to five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six to seven deep,
steadily gained to get up late. CLASSIC QUEEN settled off the pace, asked to pick it up about three furlongs out going four then five wide on the turn, bid in
late stretch but was outfinished. BLAZING SKY stalked from outside just off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, bid in late stretch but was
outfinished. LETS RUN TWO was coaxed forward to set the pace inside, challenged in the stretch, yielded only grudgingly. SIMPLE SOUVENIR got away
well then settled in to stalk the pacesetter two to three wide, was within range at the quarter pole, came out and asked at the top of the stretch but ran on
evenly and failed to rally. VIVIAN ANN broke inwardly, shifted in racing mid-pack two to three wide, had no rally. PRACTICAL GIZMO was forwardly-placed
tracking inside, came out in upper stretch while dropping back, had no late bid. BODY OF LAW shifted in early, raced well off the pace two to three wide on
the turn, was unable to threaten. CALL ME KITTY raced off the pace near the inside, came out turning for home, was never a threat. DAZZLING DIVA
switched outside foes racing toward the back, went three to four wide on the turn, never produced a bid.

Footnotes
SILVER MAGNATIZED settled nicely on the rail behind the early pace, waited inside throughout the far turn looking for the seam, found room at the top of
the stretch racing three wide for the drive and was full of run between horses at the furlong marker to win easily at the line. BUTTERED TOAST trailed
horses entering the backstretch, made an early middle move in the three path to be in contention three eighths to go, raced four wide through the far turn
and closed willingly to be the best of the rest. SHES THE NORTH tracked the early pacesetter through to the far turn, took command with two furlongs to
go, could not open up on the closing winner in mid stretch and gave way losing second late nearing the wire. WAR EMPRESS settled near the back inside,
trailed into the far turn on the rail, advanced up the fence with a quarter to go and angled just outside to pass tiring runners in the stretch. SILENT SCARLET
stalked in the beginning stages mid pack outside, was roused on the far turn angling out to the four path for the run for home and could not get involved for
the drive. NEW YORK COMMANDER showed good early speed to lead through the backside, was headed midway on the turn giving way in upper stretch
and stopped on the fence in the final eighth.

Footnotes
SO SUAVE (IRE) set the pace from just off the inside into the first turn then nearer the rail, was challenged by an outside foe late on the far turn, kicked
clear when asked and held well under steady urging. ANTIGONE broke inwardly bumping a rival, was forwardly-positioned to track along the inside, came
out at the top of the stretch, chased the winner home but could make no headway. REDOUTE'S LIGHT shifted in early, saved ground on the inside through
both turns racing off the pace, ran on in the stretch. MOON OVER MONTANA broke a step slowly while tossing the head and was then bumped by a rival,
switched outside a foe entering the first turn, went three wide on the far turn, moved out five deep turning for home, kept on from between foes to regain a
better placing. TAOS (FR) stalked just off the winner mostly two to three wide, came up empty. SWAMP SOUFFLE broke outwardly, raced outside toward
the rear three deep, went three to four wide on the far turn coming six deep into upper stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE SOUSI was roused entering the far turn and seemed to offer little response initially, began to pick up runners at the top of the stretch racing
five wide, drifted inwards under right handed urging a sixteenth out and got up in the final strides at the finish. CITRUS BOY broke out at the start, dueled
outside for early lead, put away his pace rival at the quarter pole, held well in mid stretch only to weaken very late and was caught just before the wire.
SOVEREIGN CAUSE tracked the contested pace mid pack on the rail down the backside, started to rally at the quarter pole angling off the fence to the four
path for the run to the wire, was steadied between runners with a sixteenth to go and still finished on late to just get up for third. TEMPO MADNESS tracked
just outside off the early pace battle, loomed at the top of the stretch for the lead in the three path, stalled with a furlong to go and had to settle for a minor
placing. CEREBRO showed speed early battling for the front through the half, began to give way midpoint on the turn inside and had nothing left for the
drive after contesting a quick early pace. BROADWAY SKY was slow into stride trailing through the backstretch could not get involved and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SPOOKY SPICE brushed a rival at the start, moved forward inside to set the pace facing outside pressure, was clear in mid-stretch and held under steady
handling. OUR SOUPER LOVE was a bit hard to load, raced mid-pack outside rivals going five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep, kept
on late to get up for second. CRIMSON SKY attended the pace from outside three to four wide, near the furlong marker but needed more. SPEED CHESS
was mid-pack between runners into the turn, went three to four wide on that bend coming five deep into upper stretch, ran on. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS
was brushed at the break, chased from between runners, lacked the needed late kick. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER lacked early speed, raced three to four wide
on the turn, ran on evenly. FREE CARRYCOMB chased from between runners three wide, shifted in a bit leaving the turn, was never able to threaten the
top ones. MOHAYMEN DAY chased two wide between runners early, was in a bit tight past the five-sixteenths, failed to rally. SO BREANNA chased inside,
dropped back and failed to rally.
