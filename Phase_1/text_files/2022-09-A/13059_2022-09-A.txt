RUTABAGA rated back inside in the early going, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady
gain, edged ahead late and held. SO MOXIE unhurried early, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the lane, made a steady
gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. BABY DRAGON allowed to settle, looped
three and four wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed well for the show. SERENE WARRIOR set the pace off the rail, shook clear
through the turn angling in, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. QUALITY TOO SPARE stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground
three wide through the turn, then faded in the stretch. TUDOX ROADSTER well placed and outside, faded on the two path through the turn.

under steady pressure. TARQUIN unhurried in the early going, moved up inside through the turn, angled to the two path into the stretch, then angled in for
clear racing room late, made a steady gain and missed. PITON well placed and between, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide
into the stretch and evened out. GRAVE DANGER well placed and outside, lost some ground four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the
stretch, drifted in and had a mild gain. HE IS READY tracked the pace, moved up and angled out through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and
weakened. SPIRITED DEBATE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. JUST
PRAISE well placed and between, lost some ground three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. GAISGEACH was never involved. BARCO DE
SUENOS broke awkwardly from the gate, ran greenly and was outrun.

Footnotes
WATERLOO SUNSET mid pack and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
made a steady gain and drove clear late. EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then stayed
on to hold the place safe. LIMONATA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed well for the
show. YES IT'S ERIE mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and closed for a share. RUN LAUGHING
tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. CYBERBURG never far back,
moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. CHARLIV improved her position, inside. MAGNA G
FORCE was never involved. GET SASSY well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and faded.
