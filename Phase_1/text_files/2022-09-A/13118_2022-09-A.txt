CREATIVE CADENCE chased inside early on, moved up on the rail nearing the turn, took over, dueled with PROUD MULE at the quarter pole, battled back
gamely inside of that rival in the final furlong and prevailed late. PROUD MULE was off a bit slow, stalked outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled outside
of the winner passing the quarter pole, rallied to a short lead, dug in gamely outside and was outfinished late. ANGELAS PARTY GIRL was off a bit slow,
outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane and rallied in the stretch. SEA MAIDEN broke through the gate prior, reloaded
smoothly, raced off the pace, two wide on the turn and failed to threaten. COMODA raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn and flattened out in the
lane. BUSTIN DOWN DOORS showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled briefly and gave way on the turn.

BLIND SIGHT stalked two wide, advanced on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, took over, drew clear and then dug in gamely late to prevail.
ANOTHER SAUCY SIX raced two wide off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside and dug in gamely outside
of BLIND SIGHT to the finish. TWIN BRIDGES raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, closed mildly and earned the
show spot. ASYENA chased on the inside, advanced on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch and flattened out. CRYSTAL ORB was outrun early
and closed belatedly. LEAH'S LEGACY broke sharply for a clear early lead, showed the way, dueled into the stretch and faltered. HERALD ANGEL bobbled
at the break, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

MORETHANACONQUEROR vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, battled heads apart with CHIEF ENGINEER passing the furlong marker, shook
free from that rival near the sixteenth marker and edged away. STRAIGHT TIME bobbled at the break, raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the
lane, angled in, rallied late in the two path and surged to get up for second. CHIEF ENGINEER vied inside for the lead, dueled with the winner into the
stretch, dug in gamely inside of that rival, yielded and lost second at the wire. SHARP SENSATION chased on the inside, rallied inside in the stretch and
closed well late on the rail. NEVER (IRE) was bumped at the start, stalked the pace, tracked the leaders while saving ground on the turn, angled out for the
drive and lacked a bid. HE'SAREARVIEWTOWN raced off the pace inside, rode the rail into the stretch and closed belatedly. BOBBY'S CANDY chased
outside, raced two wide on the turn and faded. EXAGGERATEDDEFENCE was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, settled off the pace, went three
wide on the turn and failed to respond.
