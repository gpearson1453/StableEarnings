Footnotes
SHE TOLD YOU SO was allowed to settle early on, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, shifted to the outside through the outside while racing six to
seven wide and closed gamely from the outside to be clear late under steady handling. VOODOO MISTRESS broke to the inside, chased the early pace
from the outside, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and was wore down late finishing willingly to the wire. KHOZY TAP was bumped at the break, stalked
early on, ridden along entering the far turn, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. SMART IZZY was squeezed at the break,
raced off the early pace, came in near the three sixteenths pole, forced rival to take up sharply and was disqualified and placed seventh. TAKEOVER TIME
stalked the early going from the inside, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and raced evenly late. HAILEY'S JEWEL chased the early pace, angled
soon after the break, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had no late rally. FOREVER FAMILY showed good early speed to set the pace along the
inside, raced in tight quarters through the upper stretch, checked just past the three sixteenths pole, jockey of Forever Family claimed objection against
Smart Izzy for interference through the stretch run and stewards disqualified Smart Izzy and placed her behind Forever family. DANCING TRICK was off
slowly, void of early speed and never was a factor. MISS CONTINENTAL was fractious in the gate, pressed the pace from the outside and gave way
through the stretch run. UMEA ZING GRACE dropped back early, raced five wide near the quarter pole and had no response.

Footnotes
COPPER BELLE rated along early, waited for racing room just past the five sixteenths pole, shifted four to five through the upper stretch and finished
strongly to be clear under steady pressure. THIRSTY SISTER was slow in the early stages, angled six to seven wide through the upper stretch and rallied
willingly to the wire. MONGOLIAN DIAMOND coaxed along early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire. SHAMEFUL
PRINCESS settled off the early pace, moved up through the far turn, waited near the five sixteenths pole while racing from the inside, shifted four to five
wide in the drive and had not enough late. CANDY'S STORY chased the pace from the outside, raced five wide near the quarter pole and had no final bid.
WITCHY DEVIL was quick to begin to set the pace from the inside and gave way in the drive. GYPSY SOUL pressed the pace while racing just off the
inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
VARSITY FLYGIRL made a quick move to take command down the backstretch, raced well off the inside in the lane under left handed urging and held
gamely to remain clear under strong pressure. BLAZING CHARM rated in the early stages near the inside, angled out to race from the outside in the stretch
run and finished willingly to the wire. TRULY A ROCKET showed good early speed, reserved early on, ridden through the far turn, raced from the outside in
the drive and kept on to the wire. SHESMYBROKER settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced four wide in the stretch and showed good late interest.
BELLAMY CAY dropped back early on, raced from the outside in the drive and had not enough. GIRL THIRSTY stalked the pace, raced two to three wide
and had no response. MALARTACH was slow early on, raced five wide through the upper stretch and never threatened. CAVE CREEK raced near the
inside around the far turn through the stretch run and lacked a bid.

SEDUCTIVE U S A was allowed to settle in the early stages, waited for racing room near the quarter pole, found room through the upper stretch to raced
two wide and drew off late to be clear under steady pressure. FREEDOM FACTOR rated in the early stages, moved up four wide near the quarter pole,
raced five wide through the drive and finished second best. VIM AND VIGOR stalked the pace, raced near the rail in the stretch run and finished willingly to
the wire. AWE SHACKLE stalked the dueling pair down the backstretch, raced four wide into the upper stretch, raced between rivals in the drive and kept on
to the wire. EXTIRPATOR dueled from the outside of rival and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MORE THAN BLESSED was unhurried early, angled
widest through the lane and lacked a rally. MAJESTIC SIGN dueled for the early lead from the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
UNIFIED ASSETS was rated along from the inside in the early stages, continued an inside bid into the stretch and finished strongly to edge clear under
steady handling. PLUTONIUM stalked the pace, was ridden along past the five sixteenths pole, raced three to four wide into the upper stretch and couldn't
match strides with the winner late to finish second best. MAD ADAM tracked the leader along the inside down the backstretch and kept on to the wire. ASTA
LAVISTA HONEY stalked the pace from the outside, raced four to three wide in the lane and had not enough. DARK MATTER showed good early foot to
set the early pace and weakened a bit through the stretch run. TOUGH START settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced three to four wide in the
stretch run and lacked a rally. FORTHCOMING was unhurried in the early going, raced three wide near the quarter pole, shifted out five to six wide and had
no late response. DOVER STRAIT settled off the pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and lacked a bid. LONG WARRIOR was bumped at the
break, raced off the early going, raced evenly and had no rally. MR. G T O stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide around the far turn and
weakened. MAJOR FREAK was bumped both sides, shuffled back at the break, raced at the back of the pack early and failed to respond. ACCEL JOE was
bumped at the break and never threatened.
