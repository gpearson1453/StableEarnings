kicked in gamely a furlong out, rallied while moving inward and drove clear. BRAVO KOLT was forwardly placed in opening stages then vied for the lead
around the turn, shook free past the furlong marker then failed to contain the winner late. HE'S A SHOWBOAT hustled up on the inside and held a slim lead,
vied inside rivals around the turn, fought back past the furlong marker then gave way. POE MANS RIDE vied three deep around the turn then flattened and
ran on evenly in the lane. DAY MONEY was not too far back early on, saved ground around the turn and weakened through the lane. STROLLN DOWN

Footnotes
DOT COM DREAMIN tracked the early leaders on the inside, moved up closer late on the turn, tipped two wide in the upper stretch, steadily moved up
closer and forged clear. PURE CRYSTAL vied for the lead soon after the start, shook free late on the turn, angled inside at the head of the lane, continued
to show the way into the final furlong then failed to contain the winner late. STAR OF MINE tracked the top pair in early stages, hustled along four wide late
on the turn, swung four to five wide into the lane, ran on and got up late for show. SOUTHERN SMOKE vied outside of PURE CRYSTAL for the early lead,
could not match strides late on the turn but stayed on and got nipped for show. FRANKLY EPIC lunged and came away slowly at the start, raced in the
back, saved ground around then turn and lacked a rally. MILTON STREET chased midpack into the turn, came four wide into the lane and offered no late
bid. VAUDEVILLE MEWS lacked speed and raced four wide up the backstretch and into the turn, failed to respond under pressure and weakened.

GONE WITH THE FINN broke sharp and angled to the inside, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch and around the turn, continued well clear a
furlong out and kept to task while ridden out. HIDDEN RULER chased after the clear leader into the turn, hustled along two wide into the lane, was no match
for the winner but finished clearly second best. MUCHO BLING chased the top pair three wide around the turn and ran along for a share. JAMES'S
MOONSHINE trailed the field, pulled up in the stretch and vanned off.

Footnotes
LEAPIN TY MAN was forwardly placed in opening stages then engaged NINETEEN HUNDRED for the lead midway around the turn, dueled into the lane,
shook free approaching the sixteenth pole and held late under a driving finish. TALONS TIME raced in contention and hustled along three wide around the
turn, ran on three to four wide into the lane, kicked in gamely in final stages, surged to the wire but failed to reach LEAPIN TY MAN in time. NINETEEN
HUNDRED sped to the lead at the start then took on the challenge from LEAPIN TY MAN midway around the turn, battled for command into the lane and
yielded late. QUARTERNIGHT was ridden along off the early pace, chased two wide around the turn, stayed two wide into the lane and improved position
without threatening the top trio. TEMPLE CITY RUN raced in range in opening stages, saved ground around the turn and faded through the lane. GLOME
lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. PALACE JESTER failed to move into contention.

I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL raced off the early pace and angled inside, quickly advanced along the rail late on the turn, cut the corner and took command
entering the lane, responded willingly under a drive and finished going away. SUCCESSION tracked the embattled trio into the turn, launched a three wide
bid approaching the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and finished second best. TAP ON BY dueled inside a duo into the turn, got collared by the
winner entering the lane and weakened to show. LEADING THE CAUSE raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn and improved position
without threatening the top trio. MADETHEDEAN'SLIST dueled three deep around the turn then tired in the drive. DARK BARON dueled between rivals into
the turn, flattened near the five sixteenths pole and continued to tire in the drive. DARK WHISKEY saved ground around the turn and never threatened.
DOING DAYS failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
DIANNA'S JET sped to the lead at the start and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held clear around the far turn, came two wide into the lane,
widened advantage and kept to task under a driving finish. DIXIELAND CANDY stalked the top pair up the backstretch, headed in pursuit three wide around
the far turn, sustained a two wide bid for DIANNAS JET through the lane and finished clearly second best. FLYTA was unhurried and raced in the back,
swung five wide into the lane and got up late for show. FLATOUTANDFOXY raced off the early pace and shifted inside, urged inside around the far turn, cut
the corner entering the lane and got edged for show. TAKE ME AS I AM stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, coaxed two wide around the far turn and
flattened in the lane. LAURIEANN raced midpack through early stages, chased three to four wide around the far turn and gave way. SHE'S A BIG STAR
raced four wide around the turns and had no response.

Footnotes
DIAMOND OF EKATI raced in range near the inside then shifted three wide at the quarter pole, responded under right handed pressure a furlong out,
surged to the lead and held clear. KENZIE LOU raced off the early pace, swung wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and cleared second best. RUN
A FIRE raced in contention into the turn, coaxed three to four wide turning for home and ran on for a share. STREET RINGER pressed the pace in opening
stages, dueled around the turn, fought back in the upper stretch then flattened out. ALWAYS VALENTINA sped to the lead at the start, set a pressured pace
then dueled inside of STREET RINGER around the turn, held a slim lead a furlong out then came up empty. UNBRIDLED MONEY was off slow at the start,
raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and failed to rally. SPITFIRE SUZIE was not too far back in the opening quarter, chased three to four wide
around the turn then retreated.
