Footnotes
EL DIABLO GRANDE stalked the pace while in the three path made a move turning for home and edged closer to the leaders went by the frontrunners
inside the eighth pole and was clearly best while under a hand ride. GONE PARADISE was away in good order to take the lead and the rail was pressed
from the outset and gave way in the final furlong. LONE SHOTGUN RIDER showed good early speed while in the two path but was the first to give way in
the stretch. BRAVE HELIOS was along the rail on the turn angled out for the drive nut made little headway through the stretch run. NOT NECESSARILY
raced three wide the entire race and never mounted a rally. MERRY MIX UP was in the back almost from the outset while racing along the rail and never
mounted a rally.

Footnotes
OUTLAW QUEEN was prominent in the two path on the turn edged alongside the pacesetter in the stretch and slowly wore down that rival to earn the
victory. SMARTY TIGRESS showed good speed and was able to get to the rail into the turn took a clear lead in the stretch but was not able to fend off the
winner in the final sixteenth. ONE HOT REDHEAD popped the gate and had a lead a few jumps out was allowed to settle on the outside and raced three
wide but could never get to the top two. ATHENIAN PRINCESS chased the pace along the inside in the early stages but had no rally through the stretch.
POPS GIRL ALEXA raced along the inside in the middle of the pack and had no rally. LANKY LOU raced along the inside and never mounted a serious
rally. SMART ACT raced three wide on the turn and faded through the stretch and was never a serious factor. DIXIE TRIXIE was away in good order and
close to the front was checked while in tight and dropped back quickly and was never a factor.
