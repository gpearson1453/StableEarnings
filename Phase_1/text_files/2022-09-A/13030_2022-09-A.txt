Footnotes
SIMPLY FAST rated off the early speed, moved to the outside after travelling a furlong, was let out after two furlongs, took the lead two wide midway on the
bend, floated out entering the lane, gradually drifted out until inside the final sixteenth and held sway. BEZEL SET took the early lead and the inside, was
overtaken after the first sixteenth, chased from inside, was checked when she lost her path after three furlongs, altered out three wide, fanned widest into
the stretch, gradually angled out to keep a clear path outside PRINCESS CONSUELA, was crowded briefly by the latter inside the last eighth and edged
ahead for second nearing the wire. PRINCESS CONSUELA took the lead after the first sixteenth, showed the way just off the inside, moved to the rail into
the turn, was soon overtaken, lost ground fanning outside SIMPLY FAST, steadily angled outside that one to keep a clear path, battled for second in the late
going but did not have enough left in the waning yards.

Footnotes
READY REDDING rated just off the early speed, went for the lead between rivals into the second bend, moved clear under a drive upper stretch and
maintained full control under steady handling. JOHNNY LONGBOAT settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, angled out through the second turn,
lost ground fanning four wide entering the stretch, took over second with a sixteenth left, came up short but was clearly second best. CARTE BLANCHE
hesitated then broke inward, advanced from inside, angled out with a half mile left, vied for the lead three wide on the second turn, floated out some into the
stretch, wore down the final furlong but was unchallenged for third. JOEY B rated between rivals, moved to the inside approaching the second bend, gained
a striking position along the rail on that turn, fanned out for the stretch run and gave way. PRINCE OF MAYHEM soon had a clear lead and the inside, was
challenged on the second turn and began to yield after six furlongs. CHERNYAHOVSKIY chased from outside and had little to offer for the stretch run.

Footnotes
TIZWOW broke alertly, was rated on the front end from outside, two wide on the turn and shook off CELEBRATING HAL inside the last eighth.
CELEBRATING HAL pressed the early pace, went for the lead outside TIZWOW on the bend, battled in the lane, did not have enough left inside the final
furlong but was clearly second best. BALI'S BACK advanced four wide on the turn, dueled outside RED BIRD for third in the lane and edged out the latter in
the late going. RED BIRD in contention early, angled out two wide on the bend, edged ahead from between rivals for third nearing the eighth pole but did not
have enough left to hold his position late. HIGHLY PERFECT displayed early speed from inside but began to wear down before finishing a half mile. SMALL
SAILOR hustled along early between rivals, gave way on the bend. MAN ON ATTACK showed little. MADELYN ATTACK chased from outside, angled in on
the turn and steadily gave way.

WILDWOOD SICILIAN broke in stride and soon took the rail, was challenged on the backstretch, roused leaving the quarter pole, bumped with COMFORT
ME NOW at the head of the lane, was angled in some, gradually edged ahead inside the last eighth and held on under steady handling. COMFORT ME
NOW came off the rail early on, engaged WILDWOOD SICILIAN on the backstretch, was also put to urging leaving the quarter pole, bumped by the latter at
the top of the stretch, fought gamely the rest of the way but had to settle for being easily second best. TWO WORLDS chased from outside, angled in on the
second turn, swung back outside the top pair for the stretch run and had no late bid. MKAR THE FAST showed little.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME broke on top, was rated between horses, commenced his bid just outside PITAMAN on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch, was put to
urging with a furlong left and steadily lengthened command. FIXICO without early speed, picked up his pace two wide on the bend, angled to the outside for
a clear path upper stretch, gained second inside the final sixteenth then could only hold his position late. STOSH raced in midpack from inside, fanned out
behind ONE WAY HOME for the stretch run and gradually improved position between rivals to take third in the waning yards. PITAMAN was hustled to a
clear lead, showed the way just off the inside, could not stay with ONE WAY HOME upper stretch and wore down inside the final eighth. BEL BIMBO made
a small leap from the gate, trailed from outside, angled in entering the stretch and passed inside tired ones. PENALTY SHOT chased while toward the
outside on the backstretch, was three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run and failed to have a significant response. RAHFEE TOWN in
contention early, angled to the outside into the turn and soon gave way. MADE TO FIT helped prompt the pace from outside, began to yield four wide on the
bend and gave way between horses in the lane.

Footnotes
MILLARD'S SMILE rated off the early speed, was let out two wide after a half mile, came to CHEEKERS on the second turn, moved ahead when put to
urging upper stretch then drew clear inside the last eighth while kept to task until near the wire. CHEEKERS was quickly clear after the break, rated from
inside on the backstretch, challenged on the second bend, no match for MILLARD'S SMILE when set down for the drive and proved easily best of the rest.
BRIANS WAY prominent from inside, angled out on the second turn, came into the lane from path three, battled for third inside SEMINOLE BEACH and
prevailed for the show. SEMINOLE BEACH reached contention widest on the backstretch, closed the gap outside BRIANS WAY on the second bend, fought
that one for third in the stretch but did not have the needed late kick. SHANGHAI SILVER was very reluctant to load, bore at the start, was quickly corrected,
was a factor outside MILLARD'S SMILE on the backstretch but gave way from between rivals with three furlongs to go. ARROW STRIKE soon distanced
himself from the field, loped to the second turn, was pulled up and walked off.

PRANCIPANTS was settled back after the break, commenced her bid between horses on the turn, altered in two wide for a clear path entering the stretch,
quickly took the lead and kept IGGY BIGS at bay under steady handling. IGGY BIGS in contention from the start, lost ground four then five wide taking the
bend, rallied in the stretch, angled in to threaten PRANCIPANTS inside the last furlong, had every chance but leveled off in the waning yards. BOBBIE TOO
TOO prompted the early pace, vied for the lead three wide on the turn, was forced out a bit further into the lane, lost her path between rivals inside the final
eighth, altered in and did not have enough left the last sixteenth. WILDCAT BOBBIE somewhat slow at the break, chased from inside, came off the rail
some for a clear path into the stretch, had a striking position inside rivals with a furlong to go, could not sustain her bid but was easily best of the others.
MISS WINDY SLEW was a step slow at the start, rushed up to have the lead briefly, was soon challenged from inside, floated out some into the lane and
gave way. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN was also a step slow at the break, moved up quickly from inside to contest the pace but began to yield before finishing a
half mile. B N A NATIVE GIRL faded from outside early on.
