Footnotes
ZAYDEN stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole, gained command with a furlong to run and held off the
closing CHA CHING CHARLIE to prevail. CHA CHING CHARLIE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and was gaining
on the winner late. SUPER HUNK settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a steady bid.
EXTREMELY WICKED raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, angled in with a furlong to run and
finished willingly. WILDCAT ECHO showed no early speed, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. JAMIE CAN'T DANCE was
hustled along to open a clear lead soon after the stretch, raced three-wide while setting the pace and weakened through the final furlong. JEDIZEE lacked
early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. HUNKY DUNN was void of early speed, raced nine-wide through the turn and was not a
factor.. CORA BELLE raced off the pacesetters from the inside and gradually weakened. BALD IS BEAUTIFUL chased the leaders while racing three-wide
and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
HOT CHARLIE broke sharply to duel for the lead with ROWDY MAMBO while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with
complete authority. ROWDY MAMBO was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final
furlong. JUST AWESOME M was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole and finished with good late
energy. ASSISTANT lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. BRIGHT WAY settled off the leaders from the inside
and lacked needed closing response. RIGHT ON TIME was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. MAGNUS
WHO was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. GO FOR THE LAUGH showed no early speed, raced five-wide through
the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
MICHELLE WHO settled off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker, opened a clear lead, drifted out slightly
and held sway to the wire. LATENITE SLEWZY raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole,
checked when the winner drifted out and held the place late. SHORT POCKETS raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in
with a furlong to run and finished willingly. LIPPY was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. RAISE OUR
FLAG was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. MISTY MATT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not threaten. JEDI JENNIE pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gradually weakened.
RANGER MOLLY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened in the drive. EBB AND FLOW showed no early speed, raced five-wide through

Footnotes
HAUTE LADY set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker, increased that advantage into the stretch and
was ridden out to the wire. CATTY DOM settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive and
finished well to gain the place. LOOKOUT FOR LANDRY broke in the air, lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and
rallied late. BLUSHING BABE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and failed to gain in the drive. UNDER RAPPES was forwardly placed early, moved
five-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. MISSY MIA was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
MAGNIFICANT MONEY pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened in the drive. CHA CHA TOUCH raced off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn and weakened.
