Footnotes
MAMA'S DREAM moved in and bumped with a foe while going to the front, cruised clear then showed the way, dictated terms while inside on the turn,
responded well when shaken up inside the quarter-pole, drew off while kept to the task into the final furlong then was eased up while much the best. ALPHA
SONNY bumped with a rival at the start, was bumped by the winner in the hindquarters early, tracked that foe on the outside, chased in the two then three
path on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and held the place while no match for the winner. STANLEY ROUGH bumped with a rival at the start
then dropped back while off a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, climbed into kick back and lost ground late on the backstretch, moved out into the turn,
was hard ridden while three then four wide on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and safely secured the show while displaying late interest.
MONTAUK SURF was fractious in the gate, bumped the hindquarters of a foe and was off slow while awkwardly into stride, spotted the front a few lengths,
was urged along near the back, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. QOROKWE broke in at the
start, dropped back early then was urged along well off the pace, departed the backstretch between horses, went around the turn in the two path and failed
to respond. ONOFRIO was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, raced just off the early pace then dropped back near the five-eighths pole, saved ground
on the turn, drifted out near the furlong marker and faltered.

Footnotes
MORNING CUP moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, cruised around the turn in the two path, responded well when
asked inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear into the final furlong and proved best. MUDVILLE NINE broke out then was hustled, pressed the pace on the
inside then dropped just off the pace, drafted along the rail on the turn, came off the rail briefly into the stretch then dropped back in, was put to a drive in
upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and earned the place. BAD LARRY was hustled from the gate, chased the
early pace, made a bid near the nine-sixteenths pole, vied in the four path while asked on the far turn, battled with the winner under a drive in upper stretch
and tired while just able to get the show. SOUTH STREET dropped back after the start, was ridden along at the rear while climbing some, went four then
five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved to just miss the trifecta. MOVING PICTURES moved up under urging near the
nine-sixteenths pole, chased the pace, raced in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the
superfecta. BIG SAVE broke awkwardly then was taken up and dropped back, spotted the front a few lengths, settled off the pace, drafted in the two path
on the turn, altered course to the inside then back out in upper stretch, gained into the final sixteenth, was taken in hand behind traffic late and missed the
superfecta. FLASH KISS was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, went six wide on the turn and came up empty. FIGHT FIERCELY was
hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the inside of a foe, went five then four wide on the turn, dropped back between horses near the furlong marker
and capitulated. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

Footnotes
BENDOOG contested the pace on the inside, shook clear on the far turn, was roused into the stretch, drew off while kept to the task until the sixteenth-pole
then was eased up while much the best. GOOD SKATE was sent hard from the gate then urged into the kickback into the first turn, went four then three
wide while climbing some on that bend, moved up near the five-eighths pole, chased in the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch,
pursued the winner in the drive, drifted out two to three path late then brushed with LEADING CONTENDER and narrowly earned the place while no match
for the winner. LEADING CONTENDER settled while two to three wide, was urged along on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, angled out
near the three-sixteenths pole, battled outside of the runner-up for the place into the final sixteenth, was brushed by that foe and carried out late then just
missed the place while well clear for the show. HARVARD raced in the three then four path on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, chased in
the three path on the far turn and tired. ROCCO STRONG had a shoe repaired in the paddock, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
urged five wide on the far turn and came up empty. LORD CAPTAIN went three to four wide on the first turn, tracked the leading duo from third, was urged
four wide on the far turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased but walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN, GOOD SKATE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE FINISH

Footnotes
M B'S MUNNING pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead into upper
stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and just held under strong urging. GENTLEMAN JOE dropped back after the start then was ridden along at the
rear, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide over heels outside the five-sixteenths pole, rallied five wide into the stretch, gained while remaining on
his inside lead until just before the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, closed well on the outside into the final sixteenth and just missed.
SAGAMORE MISCHIEF was coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger urging late on the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn and
finished willingly for the show. LITTLE LUCA set the pace under pressure, vied two path to the inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. WRITER'S REGRET was hustled from the gate, moved up to race just off the
pace, chased inside on the turn and weakened. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN chased the pace, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn,
was urged into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SWEET REBECCA pulled while taken under tight restraint early then was rated on the inside, drafted behind the leaders on the far turn, shifted to the two
path into upper stretch then was roused, rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under a hand-ride
to the finish. FAITH UNDERSTOOD went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. CURLIN'S GIRL steadied along the rail
early then tugged keenly on the bit under tight restraint, saved ground at the rear under reserve, was let out on the far turn, came under urging after turning
into the stretch, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and improved to narrowly earn the show. LIVING MAGIC lunged at the start and was off a step slow,
went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, was roused after turning into the stretch, raced between
horses into the final furlong and just missed the show. MUNNY GRAB broke a bit slow then angled in quickly at the rear, raced in the three path on the first
turn, was reserved on the outside, went three wide while asked on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
YOUKNOWNOTHING went around the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, dropped back
into the final furlong and was taken up between foes late while weakening. MISS MOTTLEY prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked
on the far turn, dropped back between horses into the final furlong and came up empty.

KANT BEAT THE ROCK broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, held a reasonable
striking position into the final furlong but flattened out then just missed the show. CLUBHOUSE tracked the pace, was urged two to three wide on the turn,
gained to make a four wide bid in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. GOLDEN REIGN showed speed then moved

MISCHIEVOUS ANGEL settled on the outside, tucked in behind horses near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper
stretch, rallied in the final furlong and closed fast to get up at the finish. ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) broke in then was hustled, rushed up to get the lead, showed
the way on the inside, responded well when set down in upper stretch, held a clear advantage into the final sixteenth, fought determinedly to the finish but
was denied. YARROW raced just off the pace between horses, was asked in the two path on the the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive in the
stretch, kept on with good courage to the finish but missed while clear for the show. SUMMER IN ADRIANE broke a half-step slow and was last away,
settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ACOUSTIC AVE was spotted
just off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. KING MOONRACER settled off the pace
then angled in, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. FAMOUS GENT settled
off the pace, was shuffled back behind ACOUSTIC AVE on the turn, moved out while asked in upper stretch, checked off heels at the furlong marker and
lost any chance. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, was in tight while dropping back in upper
stretch and came up empty.

bend, was reserved under a tight hold, advanced inside the half-mile pole then gained more into the far turn, was asked in the four path on that bend, rallied
to make an outside bid outside the eighth-pole, dueled with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. GEM MINT TEN
went to the front, showed the way on the inside, shook off foes after being asked at the quarter-pole, was challenged by the winner outside the furlong
marker, dueled with that foe to the finish and was denied while clear for the place. EZ ROLL was eased back between horses nearing the first turn, rounded
that bend in the two path, settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the far turn and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. THE

into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. KING FREUD prompted the pace on

so slightly at the start, was caught five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside under some restraint, was asked while three then four wide on the far
turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PROVISION was taken under a tight hold early, traveled around the opening bend in the two path,
was reserved off the pace, went three then four wide on the far turn and failed to rally. OCTOBER BLISS saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace,
