Footnotes
WILD ARMY BRAT led the way on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and held clear to the wire. BEATIFUL KARLA
bobbled leaving the gate, recovered to track the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and dueled to the wire to give way
late. VINGATIVA bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced off the pace on the outside early, continued around the turn in the four path and
improved position in the stretch. MOON ROSE raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and
showed no kick. NOVELLIE bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and was outkicked in the lane. GRAYTANA pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the three path and tired in the stretch. VALIANT VICTORIA stalked the leader on the outside through the opening stages, continued
around the turn in the three path and faded from there.

NIGHT CAP pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, took over the lead while racing in the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane.
SEA ART bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, settled off the pace early, navigated the turn from the three path and never threatened the
winner. SADIE BABY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, led the way on the rail up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the leader
while saving ground around the bend and tired in the stretch.

some ground in the stretch. NO PROBLEM JOE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and passed
tiring horses from there. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the
bend in the four path and improved position mildly in the stretch. BAD HENRY was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch,
