Footnotes
WOODSONG'S CASTLE settled back in the three path the first turn, made up ground leaving the three eighths pole and rallied to striking position in the four
path on the far turn, dug in to take over past the eighth pole and extended her lead late yards. MEDWAY QUEEN rated the pace inside, came under
pressure toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met past the eighth pole and dueled to mid-stretch before relenting. STRONG
WILLED raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and dueled
through the stretch for third. SMOKIN LADY raced with the early pace inside then stalked off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. WE'LL SEE raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn
about the six path and showed little in the lane. LIME AFTER LIME saved ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn and weakened. SO RED THE ROSE saved ground. SALTY SAUL raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ESTRELLA FUGAZ became anxious in the gate then raced with the pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and dug in determinedly to eke out
the advantage over the game stretch challenge of DOG TOWN ALLEN through the lane. The latter tapered in and raced with the pace, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the turn and finished well at the outside withers of the winner. J. WICK engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded
the turn off the rail and dueled through the stretch for third. BOP ZAPPER broke in and made contact with ON A WHIM then engaged in close early chase,
rounded the turn about the four path but was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. The latter was jostled at the break, gave chase through the backstretch,
raced off the rail on the turn, eased outward through the lane and finished evenly. MONKEY WRENCH gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then
flattened later yards. DIRECT THE SHOW became a bit anxious in the gate, exchanged contact with On A Whim at the start and dropped well out of it. HE'S
CLEVER raced mostly wide and never factored.

CONGRESS HALL rated a slim lead toward the inside, was met at the three eighths pole and dueled from that point, contested even terms nearest the rail
leaving the mid point of the far turn and dug in determinedly to keep the advantage through the lane. TOUGH ENOUGH raced with the pace then
challenged nearing the three eighths pole and dueled from that point, drew to even terms two deep midway on the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish.
PRUSSIAN BLUE settled in the two and three paths, left the second turn toward the outside and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn about the four path then flattened stride. ONE LAS OLAS settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH saved ground off the pace then eased out into the backstretch, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. MISS ANTIETAM raced in the five path on the turns, left the second turn outside, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened past the five sixteenths. SWEET TALIA raced just off the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the

Footnotes
STARSHIP BLANCA was bumped leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn and bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved from
that point, raced in the four path on the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and held well with steady handling. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY was bumped
sharply outward and into Starship Blanca then settled well back off the rail, started her bid past the half mile pole and steadily closed, raced in the five path
on the far turn and finished well to take second later yards. DORITA'S HEART took a quick lead and rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was met while flattening stride mid-stretch. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY saved
ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then angled to the outside leaving the turn and passed some tiring rivals.
SHERIFF'S KID saved ground racing well back, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and passed some rivals.
MAKINLIMMARGARITAS stalked from the four path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the
far turn, but steadied mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. MIDNIGHT REGRET saved early ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened. SOMMER VELVET stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase into the backstretch but
weakened at the rail on the far turn. BRAVO ZULU raced in the five path the opening turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole but weakened in the seven path on the far turn. BESTLA ducked outward and made sharp contact with A Little Bit Crazy leaving the gate, left
the first turn toward the outside and showed little response.
