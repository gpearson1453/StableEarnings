Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE MIKE behind the pace just off the inside up the backstretch, continued behind traffic and the lead pack through the turn, two path into the
lane when moving to challenge between horses entering the stretch, drove well clear. KANT CONQUER ME with the pace while four wide and between
horses into the turn, continued to vie in the three path into the stretch, proved no match for the winner, dueled for the place, edged clear for that position
late. INTERRUPTER carried out early, with the pace between horses, also had little for the winner in the stretch, outkicked for the place. THIS TIME BLUE
forwardly placed while well out in the strip in the run up the backstretch, five wide into the turn, three wide exiting, went evenly through the lane.
MANSOURA bothered early and steadied to fall well back, raced inside, continued to save ground through the turn, steered out a bit around a tiring rival
turning for home, improved position through some traffic, no real threat. STORM CAT EYES moved up on the outside to be within striking distance and six
wide into the turn, four wide exiting, lacked a closing kick. REV TOO void of speed while racing off the inside, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat.
DIFFERENT FLAME made little impact while racing off the inside. TIME FOR ANOTHER lacked speed well wide, five to six path through the turn, failed to
muster a rally. MISCHIEVOUS MAX with the early pace toward the inside, allowed a rival up inside late backstretch, closest to the rail after that rival gave
way late in the turn, backed up through the stretch. SOUTHFORK bothered early, was used to move up and make the lead flight along the inside by late
backstretch, gave way late in the turn.

Footnotes
ROYAL ACT jostled at the start to be last away, raced back, began a steady advance in the two path after a half, angled four wide late in the final turn,
challenged on the outside of the first flight when straightened for home, edged clear late under steady handling. CLASSIC KING forwardly placed while
three wide, advanced and challenged three path second turn, inside the winner nearing the furlong grounds when holding a slim lead, could not match that
one late, determined second. KOWBOYKABIN prompted the leader early from the outside, continued in a forward position into the far turn, challenged
between horses soon after, dueled upper stretch, also could not match the winner late, outkicked for the second spot. COLOSI settled off the pace inside, in
the two path turning for home, lacked a winning kick the final furlong. WARTIME HERO broke back, lacked speed, came four wide into the lane when
improving, flattened out a bit in the late going to finished up evenly. RICKY BOBBY lacked early foot, three wide trip, lacked a serious closing response.
BIZZY LEGS five wide into the first turn, continued back, four wide through most of the second bend, failed to rally. CHAPEL BARN got clear after breaking
in good order, set the pace for six furlongs, gave way when headed. TOMA TODO was finished after a half. D TWO raced wide, always outrun.

Footnotes
AUTO GLIDE unhurried early while in the two path, closer in some traffic late in the second turn, steered out a bit for room upper stretch, closed with a late
surge to be up in time. OWN THE FIELD carried out to be six wide into the first turn, angled in sharply to save some ground soon after, second flight and
three wide into the far turn, advanced and challenged, dueled into the stretch, shook clear a furlong out, nailed in the final strides by the winner. FUNNY
UNCLE settled behind the pace while just off the inside, came three wide for the drive, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest. RABBIT HOUND
carried out to be five wide into the first turn, tracked the leader off the inside, challenged between horses far turn, dueled inside the runner up into the lane
then faltered. RIVETAGE void of speed, remained back in the run up the backstretch, began to advance far turn, fanned six wide into the lane, continued
with moderate interest while remaining widest through the lane to improve position. WALDRIP back off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the
final turn, lacked a closing kick. CANAVALL sprinted clear through a glib first quarter, continued to show the way up the backstretch toward the inside,
began to weaken when headed in the second turn. MAZING MARK last away, four wide in the first turn, four to five wide second bend, tired in the drive. WE
MISS ARLINGTON got out into the first turn carrying out a couple of outer rivals, began a steady fade after a half.

Footnotes
THE BIG CALHOUNA broke alertly, set a pressured pace in the two path, shrugged off nearest pursuer late in the turn, drew off under her own courage
through the lane to win ridden out. TORREY STREET lacked early foot, steered out to be four wide for the second half of the turn, staged a rally while
remaining out in the strip to be clear for the place, no threat to the winner. TEXAS HOTTIE in mid pack, moved inside, continued to save ground into the
lane, altered course for room midstretch, staged a mild rally to gain the nod for the show. RED VOLTA pressed the winner in the three path for a bit less
than a half and began to weaken, crossed to the rail nearing midstretch and continued to tire. SHEZA SHENANIGAN in mid pack while racing off the inside,
lacked a closing response. SAFECRACKER SUE remained back while racing just off the inside into the lane. DIXIE RAG broke back, lagged well back,
passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. WILD CHEROKEE in the second flight early along the inside, staged a steady retreat. AMOUREUX in
the second flight while four wide into the turn, gave way in the drive.

HEIR TO GREATNESS outrun early, moved closer along the inside far turn, steered out to be four wide turning for home when moving to challenge, put a
head in front inside the furlong grounds and kicked clear. JEWELSTOWN lugged in just after the start to tighten up an inner foe, was righted and stalked the
pace while three wide, moved to challenge on the outside second turn, showed the way upper stretch, could not match the winner the final furlong, lugged
out to bother LEGENDARY LORE with just over a sixteenth to run, held that one off late. LEGENDARY LORE four wide into the first turn when off the pace,
second flight in the run up the backstretch, moved closer in the two path and in some traffic late in the second bend, lacked clear room in traffic past the
furlong marker, shifted out, bothered, altered course a sixteenth out, outkicked for the second spot. CHELSEA DAGGER bothered slightly at the start,
settled in mid pack while three wide, moved closer to become a threat turning for home, stalled past the furlong marker, finished up evenly. PRODIGIOUS
BAY broke best of all, alternated up front in the two path, continued to duel the middle half, held a slight advantage midway on the final turn, weakened in
the drive. CITY OF CLOUDS within striking distance just off the inside, roused late in the second turn in traffic, steadied when in tight, fell back then went
evenly after recovering. DEEP STATE void of early foot, continued back while in the two path second turn, improved position through some traffic.

Footnotes
RADICAL RIGHT outrun in the early going while off the inside, advanced three to four wide through the turn, challenged just inside the furlong grounds
outside the leader, gained command then held the runner up safe late. OUR LAST CHANCE in the second flight up the backstretch along the inside,
covered up in some traffic into the turn, continued to save ground, got through to move closer in upper stretch, altered course to the outside for room past
the furlong and finished up willingly. ZAMBEZI in the second group while between horses, set down for the drive, proved determined for the show while not
a serious threat late to the top two. MACRON in the second flight while four wide early, moved closer outside the two leaders late in the turn, flattened out in
the drive. BLACK POWDER void of speed outside, raced four wide through the turn, improved position in the stretch with some mild, belated interest.
MISTER ICEMAN last away, trailed early to be devoid of speed, steered out three wide through the turn, found best stride too late. SQUIRE CREEK dueled
up front while closest to the inside, began to weaken when straightened for home, lost another few positions the final furlong. BOHEMIAN BO broke alertly,
dueled up front off the inside, briefly clear when straightened for come, caved in late. MOWINS remained back while just off the inside. ULTIMATE was
finished early. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK in group while between foes, squeezed when appearing to start to tire turning for home, continued to back up.

Footnotes
WINNEMAC AVENUE took command soon after the start, set a soft set of fractions while rating kindly in the two path, saw that advantage narrow into the
stretch, found more late to hold off the runner up. BEN FRANKLIN last to leave, raced back early off the rail, moved closer three wide the middle half, closer
still four wide turning for home, mild bid late, could not get by. HARLOCAP within striking distance while along the inside, maintained contact with the winner
while continuing to save ground, lacked a winning kick through the stretch. HEROIC MOVE forwardly placed into the first turn, crossed over to outside the
winner midway on the opening bend, prompted that one the middle four furlongs, in some traffic turning for home, went evenly when clear to the wire.
WARREN L went one paced while racing off the inside. ALEJANDRO fell back to trail after the start outside, lacked a closing rsesponse.

Footnotes
STRATO away well from the outside, closest to the leader into the turn, collared that one at will turning from the outside, drove well clear the final sixteenth.
TWO DOLLAR EDDIE also broke well, cleared to the inside, continued to hold daylight far turn, offered little resistance to the winner when that one came
calling exiting the turn, clearly second best. PEARCY ROAD lacked speed off the inside, angled out to be four wide late in the turn, finished up best of the
rest. MR. BUTCH broke back then bobbled between horses, void of speed for a half, angled four wide into the stretch and finished up with good late energy.
CHROME'S ECHO back off the pace along the inside, steered out in the two path around a rival midway on the turn, cut the corner to improve to race
closest to the top two past the furlong marker, flattened out in the late going. RYNO WRECKER one paced while four wide into the turn, continued to race
evenly through the stretch. HAYAHLOOKATME in some traffic then was shuffled back into the turn, three wide through the bend then also lacked a closing
response. GENTLE BEN broke back, lacked speed, raced in the two path through the turn, improved by passing mostly tiring rivals through the stretch.
DEBATER within striking distance early, traffic into the bend, remained in the second group through the turn then tired in the drive. TURQUOISE BLUE main
group outside, three to four wide turn, also tired in the drive. SISK'S STORM was never a factor. RED RIVER chased early, began a steady retreat before a
half.
