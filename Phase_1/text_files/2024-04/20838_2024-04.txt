Footnotes
GRAND DESIGN made the pace about the two path while pressed throughout, continued well into the lane and kept safe under steady handling.
BRICKBAT moved three wide to bid in the second turn, continued to press outside the winner and could not run that one down while holding the place late.
SIDE STREET DAVE saved ground just off the early pace, continued inside into the lane and made a mild bid to narrowly miss the place. PAYNTER'S BOY
moved four and five wide to bid into the final turn then could not produce the needed late rally. STOCKPILER moved up three and four wide going to the
final turn but came up short in the drive. BLAKE FROM TISH moved in going to the second turn while trailing, improved position but did not threaten. FAKE
SOLUTION failed to mount a bid three wide. FREE MAKER was always back. TOUGH COMPANY showed some early speed five wide in the first turn,
continued outside and weakened. BIG HEARTED FACTOR was not a factor.

Footnotes
JOCOTE was pressed throughout while making the pace about the two path, shook off the challenge from JUST LUCK in the far turn and held safe late.
INEWAGALLIKETHAT stalked the pace four wide in good position, rallied in the lane and closed late to just earn the place. JUST LUCK angled three wide
to bid into the far turn, dueled the winner into the lane and came up empty late. TELLITTOTHEJUDGE saved ground and moved up but could not reach the
top ones. ZIBBY TOO failed to mount a bid three wide. MISS ADDISYN K prompted the early pace outside the winner, continued to the far turn and
weakened. JOSIES SCORE was always back. JULIE JEAN bobbled at the start and was always back outside. WENT HOME was not a threat four wide.

Footnotes
SAMURAI'S GRANDSON tracked the early pace outside to bid three and four wide into the far turn then edged clear in the lane. RYAN EXPRESS was
towards the back three and four wide early, swung six wide into the lane and closed late to gain the place. MEET GEORGE JETSON was five and six wide
out of the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up in the far turn but could not reach the top ones. FREEDOM FLASH stalked the pace in good position
four wide but lacked the needed late run. WITHSTANDTHESTORM made the early pace about the two path and weakened once headed into the lane.
CALEB CAT was three and four wide and lacked a solid closing bid. SHARP AZ NAILS failed to mount a rally two and three wide. NOBLE CONNECTION
was not a factor. CORTE was always back. KATRAKA was finished after a half three wide.

into the side of the gate, moved up three wide but lacked a solid bid. LEGEND OF GOLD was not a threat two and three wide. YUTAN TAPIT was not a
factor. ROCKETSHIP RUN stalked the pace three wide and weakened. ONE LUCKY BOY showed brief speed out from the rail and weakened.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SMOOTH settled just of the pace three and four wide, rallied to bid in late backstretch and edged clear nearing the lane then held safe late.
SWIFT AS I AM angled four wide in the far turn to rally into the lane and continued on well to gain the place. OUR CORNERSTONE was just off the early
pace four wide, bid into the far turn but could not hold position late. MEDICINE TAIL was on the pace out from the rail while pressured throughout and came
up empty in the drive. ARTHURIAN was along the inside and lacked a final closing run. JUST PLAIN ORNERY was near the front when a rival went bad
and checked from between foes, moved out five wide into the lane and weakened. EXACTING showed early speed inside rivals and weakened. DIAMOND
CITY contested the lead four wide, pulled up and walked off under his own power.

but came up short. U S NAVY CROSS trailed early saving ground, moved out to rally four and five wide and just missed the show late. A. K. SAFARI stalked
the pace three and four wide make a mild bid into the far turn and weakened. CHIEF TY HE tracked the early pace three wide and weakened. CAMPS BAY
saved ground and lacked a bid. FERRARI ROAD sped to a clear early lead and tired. GONE PREACHIN saved ground and tired.
