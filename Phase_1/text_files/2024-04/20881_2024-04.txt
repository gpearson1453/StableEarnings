Footnotes
HOOSIER DADDY NOW broke well, stalked the early pace in the four path, bid in early stretch, dueled late and got the nod under mild urging. COSTLY
PASS led inside foes in the three path, bid in early stretch, dueled late and was outfinished. KNEEDEEPJUSTICE pressed the early pace inside, settled
back on the trail, bid at the quarter pole but faltered in the drive. LORD ANTE was unrushed early, bid at the quarter pole, was bothered slightly by
KNEEDEEPJUSTICE in early stretch, then faltered in the stretch. TREMOR pressed the pace outside of COSTLY PASS but then faded in the stretch.
MAGIC IN MOTION raced in the four path but offered no late bid. GET ME ONE TOO was off awkwardly, then saved ground to no avail.

DOMHNALL was clear early and held sway under steady urging. DROP IT rushed the gate, stalked the pace in the five path, then was no match late and
was declared a non starter. NEOKING was unrushed early and rallied belatedly in the four path to gain the show spot late, then being made the place horse.
SHIPSHAPE stalked the pace in the three path but had no late bid. ROCKET DOCKET was squeezed back at the start, raced in the five path, angled to the
rail at the eighth pole but faltered. MON AMI FUZZIE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace between rivals and gave way at the quarter pole. CONTACT
TRACING was brushed at the start, stalked the pace in the three path but faded in the stretch. VERSATILE raced inside but had no late move.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, DROP IT WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER AFTER RUSHING THE GATE. ALL WAGERS INVOLVING DROP
IT WERE REFUNDED OR SWITCHED TO THE POST-TIME FAVORITE WHERE APPPROPRIATE AND A CONSOLATION DAILY DOUBLE WAS PAID.
