Footnotes
COOL PAPA G moved right to the lead, set the pace while kept well off the inside, moved clear on the turn, extended the margin in the stretch and held
safe. BUGLER settled at the rear tracking inside, came out at the top of the stretch, secured the place while no threat to the winner. BRADY BOY stalked
from within range, went evenly. JIN TONG raced between foes at the back into the turn, moved out past the five-sixteenths bumping a rival, was six deep
coming past the quarter pole, ran on. MEDIMPACT switched out and raced outside foes at the back, was bumped outwardly past the five-sixteenths to be
seven deep coming to the quarter pole, needed more. ROYAL HALO chased from inside but off the rail, faded.

ROYAL JOKER bumped a rival at the start, stalked the loose leader early, edged closer on the turn, took command at the quarter pole, drew away in the
stretch despite drifting out, was taken in hand late. DELTA DELTA pursued from between runners four wide into the turn, angled eight deep at the top of the
stretch, kept on to secure the place. MONGOLIAN NINJA was bumped at the start, chased from between foes five wide into the turn, floated out nine deep
turning into upper stretch, kept on late. CASH'S CAT settled off the pace, shifted in entering the turn, saved some ground, made a mild advance inside in
upper stretch then evened out. GOALINE lacked early speed from the gate and dropped back to last early, advanced outside seven wide into the turn
floating eleven deep into upper stretch, evened out in the lane. MAESTOSO chased from off the inside in about the three path, lacked the needed late kick.
STREET MINISTER moved in while dropping back from six to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. LUCKY LARA sped clear setting the pace from off the
inside, drifted out in the stretch, came up empty.

Footnotes
BANGO'S HEAT stalked from four to five deep into the turn, came out eight wide by upper stretch, took the lead in mid-stretch and drove clear. CURLIN'S
LIL GAL was fractious behind the gate, broke a bit awkwardly and was slow to gather, soon advanced four to five wide to be near mid-pack, shifted in once
in mid- to late-stretch seeking room, was gaining late. SWEET AND EZ pressed inside on the turn, asked for more by the five-sixteenths, took a narrow brief
lead in upper stretch, was outkicked. ARIZONA REINA was caught five to six wide racing outside on the turn, floated nine wide into upper stretch, kept on
late. EZ ARIZONA set the pace from about the three path, weakened. LOTSA STEEL chased from inside early then two to three wide on the turn heading
into upper stretch, ran on. ARIZONA LINDY was off the pace and outside, swung eight wide into upper stretch, was not a threat. TIA SUZI was outpaced
early racing off the inside, came to the top of the stretch six deep, was not a threat. CYBER STORM pressed briefly from inside, faded.

Footnotes
COLOR ME LEGENDARY had the early lead into the first turn but ceded that advantage to an outside foe content to press from just off that one's inner
flank, retook the lead about the half, drew clear turning into upper stretch, held safe. SIPPIN WHISKEY settled inside at the back saving ground throughout,
came out a bit in the stretch and secured place. IMISSBAYMEADOWS broke a bit awkwardly, shifted in early, saved ground on both turns mid-pack, came
out at the top of the stretch, was best of the rest. WESTERBERG raced about three to four deep throughout while off the pace, kept on in the stretch.
GORM settled outside a foe at the rear early, continued well back two to three deep on the far turn, improved position but needed more. COPPER SKY was
caught outside four deep through the first turn, raced a bit closer up the backstretch still outside, fanned eight wide turning into upper stretch, was not a
threat. LITTLE RED RIFLE shifted in to the two to three path stalking mid-division early, floated seven wide turning for home, failed to rally. MANDELA
EFFECT moved forward outside and forced the pace early up the backstretch, began to weaken on the far turn, drifted five to six wide coming out of that
bend and turned up empty.

FOR LOVE NOT MONEY broke sharply, set the pace shifting in a bit, raced four deep on the turn, dispatched an inside challenger in upper stretch then
drifted out bumping a rival lightly in mid-stretch, turned back that one to retake command and held. EYES FOR GOLD stalked from outside five wide, asked
to pick it up three furlongs out, bid near the furlong marker drawing even, was bumped soon after and turned away. HOLY TUTTA BELLA stalked in behind
racing up close two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN was bumped at the start, settled toward the back, went three to four
wide on the turn, came out seven wide for the drive, kept on. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE bumped a rival hard at the start, advanced inside past the half, made
a mild bid in upper stretch then evened out. COME CORRECT was caught wide going six to seven deep on the turn and coming out a few paths for the

Footnotes
SHE'S RESILIENT came out at the break but was quick to lead, set the pace, drifted five to six wide leaving the turn, drew clear and held safe.
CLUBHOUSE SAINT got away well, settled off the pace, fanned nine wide and finished strongest of all but too late. YOUR RINGER raced up close in
behind on the turn three to four deep and went evenly. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE settled, shifted seven to eight wide turning into upper stretch, kicked on
with mild late interest. ALEX'S GIRL broke in the air, moved forward to stalk, fanned eight wide into the stretch and in range, lacked the needed late kick.
PRINCESS JAYLEEN saved ground inside, came out a bit turning into upper stretch, failed to menace. ELDORADO DREAM chased from inside, failed to
make a bid. BIG MAMA THORNTON pressed the eventual winner, floated six to seven wide, weakened. LOW DOSE raced off the inside coming into upper
stretch five wide and was never near enough to threaten. IMA TROUBLE MAKER broke very awkwardly, was outside at the back, came into upper stretch
six deep, was not a factor.

Footnotes
WHERE'S FRANKIE stalked the leaders going four to five wide on the turn, drove past inside the final sixteenth. BABE'S GOT APPEAL moved up outside
forcing the pace after the opening furlong, continued in range through the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led till late but was second best. MARY
MARGARET broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back three wide into the turn, angled eight wide in upper stretch and was gaining late. LAKER JET saved
ground inside through the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, went evenly. MARY WALKER broke outwardly, stalked five wide and went evenly. WRIGHT
WINGED switched out into the turn, went six to seven wide on that bend, was within range turning into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick.
OLIVIAN shot clear just after the start, was soon engaged by an outside foe, dueled inside, weakened. BLUE GESSAMI shifted in early, failed to threaten.
CIELO DIAMANTE was bumped at the start, lacked early speed while switching out off the inside, swung eleven wide into upper stretch, was never a threat.
DAHLIA'S DANCER bumped a rival at the start, chased inside, came up empty. DODROPIN shifted in four wide heading into the turn, fanned nine deep for
the drive, failed to rally. TOTHEMOONANDBACK was forced out at the start, raced mostly seven to ten wide and was not a threat.

Footnotes
MOVE OVER (GB) settled mid-pack two to three wide, made a rapid advance inside runners past the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, bid
in mid-stretch and edged away late. INESPERADO stalked four wide, drew even three furlongs out, had a narrow command by the quarter pole, led till late
stretch but was outkicked. COASTAL WATERS advanced runners up the backstretch into the far turn, swung eight wide into the stretch and secured show
honors. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) saved ground inside early, came out on the second turn, moved out five wide into upper stretch, showed good late
effort. ZUMURUDEE settled off the pace near the inside, rallied mildly between runners in the stretch. PLAYOFF BOUND shifted in, saved ground, went
evenly. AVALON KING was coaxed forward outside the leader into the first turn three deep, forced the issue up the backstretch, weakened. NORTHCUT
steadied entering the first turn, eased back off the leading pair stalking in behind two wide, fanned six wide for the drive, failed to rally. KALINE raced close
up stalking three to five wide early, fanned eleven deep turning for home, was unable to threaten late. ROLL DEM BONES sped clear and shifted in, set the
early pace briefly, was overtaken up the backstretch, steadily retreated. SUMMER SHANDEE was not a factor.
