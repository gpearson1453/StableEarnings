MISS CASEY stumbled at the start, stalked outside, chased on the turn and lacked a bid. AWESOME PAL stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and
tired. MS. MALEVOLENCE stalked two wide, chased on the turn and gave way. JULIET'S MUSIC raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S VENDETTA settled inside, split rivals rallying on the final turn, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and edged off. SENSIBLE JIM forced the pace
between rivals, shook loose on the final turn, weakened and steadied slightly tiring near the sixteenth pole. FOREVER WICKED trailed early then rallied
mildly outside for the show. SAL N LOUIE outrun early, moved close on the final turn then faltered. DREAM OF BLESSINGS dropped well behind and was
never a factor. WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS prompted the pace three wide to the far turn and retreated. RUNNIN JOKE alternated for the advantage inside then
stopped abruptly in the lane. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

AWESOME LAUNCH dueled outside, took over before half a mile and extended his lead while kept to urging. CITY RAGE stalked the dueling leaders in the
clear, was asked for run on the turn and lasted for the place. JONNY QUIST saved ground off the pacesetters and closed well. ALLEVARE earned a narrow
lead inside the winner then began tiring after the half. TEXTPECTATION dropped far behind early then offered some late energy. RELISHMENT saved
ground early, angled out on the final turn and lacked a response. SOCIAL GROUP was urged off the leaders outside and lacked a response. CARTIER CAT
raced very wide off the pace and lacked a rally. MARCO ISLAND chased in midpack early then gave way readily. MOLIERE lagged far behind throughout.

MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE vied between rivals for the lead, shook free on the turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely in the stretch run and held well
under urging to prevail. MILAGROSO vied three wide for the early lead, chased three wide on the turn, dug in gamely outside in the stretch drive and proved
second best. FULL CONTACT vied inside for the lead, chased inside on the turn, weakened and held for third. T'WAS THE NIGHT was outrun early,
advanced at the quarter pole and closed belatedly on the rail. SPIRIT'S HERO was a bit fractious prior to the start, then off slowly, raced off the rail, off the
pace, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. STAVROS was off a bit slow, raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. DEVINE FLAMEAWAY chased

I DON'T SEE COLORS dueled inside pair of rivals, shook loose nearing midstretch and edged away under moderate pressure. TATUM vied between rivals
to nearing the eighth pole and tired while easily holding place. IT'S A PITY saved ground off the leaders and continued well for the show. CHIEF FORTY
lacked speed outside then picked off rivals without menacing. HOT LOVE raced off the leaders inside, angled out in the stretch and flattened. BURN THE
EVIDENCE dueled three wide to the stretch and came up empty. RENEGADE SERENADE steadied and eased back early and was never in contention.

Footnotes
RON DON SCORESE pressed the pace early on, then vied two wide on the backside, dueled with WHAT DOES IT TAKE on the far turn, continued to battle
heads apart with that rival in the stretch run and prevailed determinedly late. WHAT DOES IT TAKE set the pace on the inside, then vied inside on the
backside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and battled on willingly to the finish. WISH FOR PEACE was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, chased inside on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside the dueling leaders and
was outkicked in the final sixteenth. LOOKIN AT ROSES tracked on the inside, checked sharply midway on the far turn and dropped back, then came again
late inside for fourth. LAST ROMANCE raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, raced inside on the far turn and failed to threaten.
