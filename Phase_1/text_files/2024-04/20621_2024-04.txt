Footnotes
TAKE TIME TO DREAM showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from PROPER GRAMMAR to the outside, tucked inside into the turn and
came under challenge from LADY BANKER when shaking off that initial prompter, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and drew clear under a drive to prevail. LADY BANKER forwardly placed four wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide through the
turn to latch on the leader midway, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
running on to secure the place honors. AFILADA chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, kept on one
paced to the finish. ALTERINA chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. BRAVO REGINA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. PROPER GRAMMAR prompted the leader from the
outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths in the midst of being shaken off, faded through the latter portion of the turn and spun
two to three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
VOLEUSE was urged along off the pace, chased three then two wide on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid inside the
furlong marker and got up in the final sixteenth to prevail. BELLE OF THE BALL moved out while showing speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival
while well off the rail, moved in leaving the backstretch, dropped back while moving from the two path to the rail early on the turn then was roused, chased
inside through that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive, kept on with renewed energy in the final furlong and got up for the place at the finish. WILL
BE FAMOUS unseated the rider after coming onto the track then ran free four about a half-mile pole before being apprehended, was deemed fit to run by
the state veterinarian, showed early speed, disputed the pace on the outside, moved to a solo lead while three then two wide on the turn, was asked near
the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in upper stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker, led to the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken by the winner
then denied for the place at the finish. RIVER TAY (IRE) broke in at the start, chased the pace on the inside, steadied while shuffled back behind BELLE OF
THE BALL early on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FRANNIE LEW was coaxed along on the outside, chased four
then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. GHOSTLY GIRL chased the pace while off the rail,
steadied in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide near the three-eighths pole, drifted in inside the furlong marker and failed to respond.

THE SHOE LADY dueled inside of THIRTEEN RED FLAGS, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and edged
away under a drive to prevail. WALK WITH ME chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed
along from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. MYSARIA broke out a step at the start brushing
STRESS RELIEVER, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide for home and
kept on to secure the show honors. THIRTEEN RED FLAGS dueled three then two wide with THE SHOE LADY to her inside, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. STRESS RELIEVER
got brushed at the start by MYSARIA, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing

Footnotes
IRISH JACKSON disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, kicked clear when asked for her best into upper stretch, drew off
under a drive until just outside the sixteenth-pole then was geared down while much the best. LAVON settled off the pace, was urged along passing the
nine-sixteenths, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. RAYYA
VALENTINE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, remained on her inside lead in the stretch and
lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. DOLCE SERA was urged along off the pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn
in the three path and failed to rally. SHELLY disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.
LADY FORTUNA was urged along at the rear, rounded the turn in the five path, dropped to the four path near the quarter-pole then moved in a bit more into
upper stretch and failed to threaten. ALLEY'S SONG was well placed down the backstretch, dropped back in the two path into the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
COLLOQUY was bumped on both sides at the start, settled under some urging, went around the turn in the two path, rallied along the rail to make a bid in
upper stretch, fought determinedly inside of the runner-up into the final furlong, determinedly gained the advantage into the final sixteenth and prevailed
under good handling. BOURBON CALLING settled under some restraint, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased inside on the turn, gained to take the
lead approaching the quarter-pole, spun off the rail while put to the crop into the stretch, came in under a right-handed crop to tighten up the space of the
runner-up at the furlong marker, lost the advantage to that foe into the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the place. KHAFRE broke out and
bumped with a rival, followed the solo leader down the backstretch, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased three then four wide on the turn, made a
bid near the quarter-pole, battled outside under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. FIRST GLIMPSE broke in and bumped
with a foe, settled off the pace, was urged four then five wide on the turn and failed to rally. PREDICTED was hustled to the front then went clear early,
opened up a sizable advantage while off the inside, raced in the two then three path on the turn, lost the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, drifted out
near the furlong marker, remained on his inside lead in the drive and tired. TRAFALGAR dropped back then was urged along on the outside, went five then
six wide early on the turn, shifted to the four path near the three-eighths pole, moved to the five path late on the bend, came six wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
ROCKET AND ROLL went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when asked near the
quarter-pole, was put to the crop in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. UNION LIGHTS moved out leaving the chute, settled on the far outside,
chased in the five path on the turn and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. STRONG LIGHT angled in outside the three-quarter pole,
settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. ZAPRUDER raced well back in
the field, went around the turn in the three path, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. DADS GOOD RUNNER moved out leaving the
chute, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn and tired. DISAPPEARANCE was urged along at the rear, angled from the rail to
the four path outside the three-eighths pole, came six wide into upper stretch and failed to respond.
