Footnotes
R FIREBIRD dueled on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and drew off in the lane. BEAUTIFUL ASTRAY raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the four path and improved position in the stretch. BLACK AND SILVER raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and kept on to the wire. LUNA AMARILLA raced off the pace up the
backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. FINAL NOTE dueled on the inside through the early
stages, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and weakened in the lane. TOUCHED BY QUALITY dueled between horses up the
backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and faded from there. BINGO'S DREAM raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the
turn in the four path and showed no kick. MIGGI trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
