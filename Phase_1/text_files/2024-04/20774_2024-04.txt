Footnotes
POSEIDONS WAVE battled for the lead with inner rivals into the turn, then gained command at the top of the turn and was kept to task down the stretch to
prevail in the end. VALDINA DREAMS vied from the inside into the turn, was urging steadily on the turn to gain second position heading into the lane, could
not catch the cleared leader and held onto the place prize. RED DRAW battled between rivals while maintaining the lead by a nose into the turn, was out
kicked by the outer rival at the top of the turn, was in a hard drive throughout before giving way in the stretch and was best for the show prize. RICHARD'S
TX BLING stalked the battling trio from the four path, rallied on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. COWTOWN FLYER chased the leaders from the
inside at an even pace throughout and needed rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
DARYLSKLIMTOMANIAC broke inwardly and bumped rival, then chased the leaders from the two path while in a steady drive, inched up while three wide
leaving the turn to take command in the upper stretch then drew clear in the final yards to succeed in the end. ROMAN GENERAL was unhurried early, then
came out four wide leaving the bend, rallied in the late stretch and was improving and was up for the place position. IMPOVERISHED led the way from the
gate before dueling with an inner rival into the turn, gained command again momentarily, before being over powered by an outer rival at the top of the
stretch and kept on for the show position. BARBACOA was reluctant to load, then chased the pace from the inside, bid mildly in the upper stretch and came
up flat. GIVE HIM TIME was unhurried early, then came out five wide leaving the turn to rally in the stretch and came up empty in the end. SON OF
PREACHERMAN was allowed to settle along the inside at the back of the field, bid mildly in the lane and was no threat. TIGER BY THE TAIL was reluctant
to load, then urged eagerly along the rail to duel with an outer rival into the turn, was hard used and tired in the stretch.

LEVY pressed the pace into the first turn, gained command in the late backstretch, was challenged by an outer foe at the quarter marker to spar grudgingly
down the home stretch and was up at the wire to prove best. JIM NED saved ground in the early stages, then came out four wide leaving the far turn and
surged down the lane and was up for the place prize. DEFINE tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was moving up from the three path on
the far turn to confront the pace setter and duke it out down the lane and hung in the end also missing the place prize. UNCLE NICK tracked the pace from
the inside, was in a long drive leaving the far turn, rallied in the home stretch but it was not enough in the end. UPTOWN BIGBADJON tracked the pace
from the three path in the early furlongs, then bid on the far turn while two wide and did not fire in the stretch. GAMMA RAY was unhurried early and no
menace. HA HA FOR YOU emerged to lead the pack leaving the first turn and into the early backstretch, was over taken by an inner rival, continued to
press the pace while two wide throughout the far turn, was used up and weakened in the home stretch.

furlongs then rallied in the late stretch to gain second position but could not catch the cleared TAPE to TAPE in the end. JACKMAN'S RIDE was moving up
while two wide to press the pace from the inside in the late backstretch, settled back on the turn then re bid in the stretch to duel for the show prize and was
up at the wire. EMPIRE OF GOLD broke outwardly, was unhurried early, then moved up swiftly while three wide on the turn to gain second position mid

second place. DRIVEHAPPY was brushed at the start, saved ground in the early furlongs, then came out four wide leaving the far turn to rally in the stretch
and was up for third place. MOR LANA SPIRIT brushed rival at the start, was rank on the first turn before tracking the pace while two wide down the
backstretch and into the far turn, then rallied mildly in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end. TED was forwardly placed into the first turn to duel
with an inner rival down the backstretch, was in a long drive then gave way after the far turn. SHAMAYIM drifted inward and bumped rival, then tracked the

Footnotes
GET READY GAL saved ground in the early furlongs, then improved position along the inside heading into the far turn, came out three wide at the top of the
stretch, dug in gamely to split rivals and was up in the final strides to prove best. TIZ A KNOCKOUT was allowed to settle in the four path down the
backstretch, then swung eight wide leaving the far turn, rallied gamely in the stretch and was up for the place prize. KARA saved ground in the early stages,
then bid from the inside leaving the far turn, met with traffic, steadied, then re rallied in the remaining yards and was up for the show prize.
COMMANDEERESS raced in the middle of the field down the backstretch, was well rated while three wide on the far turn, came out seven wide heading in
the stretch and closed willingly down the lane just missing the show prize. FICKLE MISTRESS stalked the pace from the inside, then steadied at the three
eighths marker, regained stride on the far turn, came out six wide in the upper stretch and kept on down the lane despite prior circumstances. UNLUCKY IN
LOVE was unhurried early, then moved up between rivals in the late backstretch, rallied leaving the far turn but it was too little too late in the end. IN A
MINESHAFT stalked the pace while four wide down the backstretch, then moved up to vie with inner rivals heading into the early stretch, was able to lead
briefly by a nose then gave way in the end. UTSIRA pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then inched up on the far turn to battle
between rivals heading into the stretch, could not retain bid and gave way in the end. LEONE set the pace heading into the first turn, maintained the lead
heading into the far turn before being met with outer rivals to battle at the top of the stretch was hard used and stopped. PRONUNCIATION stalked the pace
while three wide down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. KOLLYNS JULIE was allowed to settle while two
wide and was no factor.
