Footnotes
ENJOYMENT was bumped, shuffled back at the start, raced off the early pace after the poor start, moved up near the rail around the far turn through the
stretch and surged up late under all out pressure. ELLIE'S BOYFRIEND showed good early foot to set the early pace, raced well clear near the eighth pole
and missed in a game effort racing three deep through the stretch run. NAK NAK BOLT stalked the pace down the backstretch just off the inside, raced four
wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. FAMILY FACTOR coaxed along early two deep just to the outside of Enjoyment, drifted a bit
through the upper stretch, eased back in through the drive and weakened the final eighth. MIDWAY MIRACLE void of early speed, angled in to saved
ground and lacked a bid. SHOGUN BE FAST was under a hard chase early and faded through the drive racing two to three deep.

Footnotes
TAPIT FIRST raced mid pack early, was three deep into the upper stretch, angled to the rail through the drive and finished well to just get up under strong
handling. CARIBBEAN WIND quick to begin from the inside to set the early pace, was well clear near the eighth pole and just missed in a game effort.
WHATINTHELITERAL hard chase just off the inside, swung five to six wide in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. VODKA WITH A TWIST was off
slowly, raced from the inside around the far turn, shifted out four deep in the stretch and was outkicked late. FLEET STREET hard chased early on, three
deep around the far turn, checked deep stretch and weakened. GOOD LOOKING angled in to save ground and never threatened. RABBLE off slow, raced
off the early pace, swung wide into the upper lane and lacked a bid. CLOUD ANGEL broke awkwardly, saved ground and never was a factor. VOODOO
PRINCESS failed to respond.

Footnotes
RELAMPAGO VERDE set a pressured early pace along the inside and prevailed late under strong encouragement. UNIT ECONOMICS (GB) settled off the
early pace, moved up through the far turn, fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. UNO MAS BOURBON rated along the
inside down the backstretch, angled out four wide into the upper lane and finished gamely to the wire. ACCIDENT pressed the early leader two deep and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. COINVEST dropped back to race mid pack, raced two to four wide through the stretch and had no final winning bid.
FRENCH BREAD settled off the early pace setters, saved ground and had no late rally. SURF CITY raced four wide around the first turn, five deep around
the second turn and was even with no late closing bid. SATURDAY LONG LEGS unhurried early on, raced eight wide into the upper lane and lacked a rally.
GAMBLIN GEORGE stalked the pace, raced three wide around the far turn and faded. SAN MARTIN raced five wide around the first turn, angled in down
the backstretch, raced near the rail past the five sixteenths pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
ACCEDE rated along under a hold along the inside down the backstretch, angled four deep into the upper stretch and finished well to get up under strong
handling. AMARETTI tracked the leader two deep from the outside, led nearing the quarter pole and gave way to the winner grudgingly. ERVADEAN settled
off the early pace setters, swung five wide into the lane and flattened out with no closing run on the top pair. UNSUNG MELODY quick to begin to set the
early pace from the inside and weakened through the drive. YES DAY void of early speed, dropped in to saved ground through the far turn into the lane and
lacked a bid. LURE'EM IN was unhurried early, hard ridden near the three eighths pole from the inside and tired to race far back.

Footnotes
DECANTED set his own uncontested early pace and held well in the drive to prevail under strong encouragement. JOHN THE BEER MAN was brushed
between horses at the start, steadied among foes while forward into the first turn, settled in midpack to track from the two path, shifted four wide in upper
stretch to take aim on the leaders, leaned in and bumped a rival before putting that one to cramped quarters in midstretch while launching a rally, sustained
a grinding charge while shifting in through the final furlong, ranged to the leader late but needed more. ST. NEOTS tracked the early pace near the rail, dug
in deep stretch between rivals and kept on gamely to the wire. VESTURE stalked outside of the leader early on, chased three wide and between horses in
upper stretch, steadied out of crowded quarters while getting outkicked in the final furlong, yielded yet maintained fourth. CLOUDY HOLIDAY dropped back
early to race with the second flight, had an inside run throughout and not enough in the drive. REBEL RED (GB) unhurried early on, was two deep near the
five sixteenths pole, four wide through the stretch run and never threatened. HAMILTON'S WAY settled off the early going, swung six wide into the lane and
had no final winning bid. SPECIAL DISPATCH stalked the pace from the outside of rivals, was four to five wide into the upper stretch and weakened a bit
through the drive. PILKINGTON was off slowly, raced three wide around the far turn, raced from the far outside in the stretch run and never menaced.
MARINA GAMBA bobbled soon after the start, was slow early on, raced two to three wide in the drive and had no response. AGAPEE MOU failed to sustain
a bid. DOOLGAROUX raced mid pack early, saved ground and faded in the drive.
