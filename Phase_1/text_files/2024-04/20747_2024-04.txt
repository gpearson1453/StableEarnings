FORCIBLE ENTRY vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, dueled with SAM'S PROMISE down the lane and proved the best. SAM'S
PROMISE raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, dueled down the lane and was a clear
second at the wire. LEGENDARY DRAGON lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a late bid, racing five wide, proved no match for the
top two, but was a clear third. TALK OF THE TOWN challenged on the front end in the beginning and faded. GLORIA'S BOY raced in the middle of the field,
came around the turn three wide and weakened. KAH NIGH bumped at the start, lacked early speed and was never close. TIME ON THE TOWN bumped at
the start, always raced near the back and was outrun.

GEAUX VOTE stalked the leaders in the early going, while saving ground, moved to the outside entering the final turn, pulled away down the lane and won
handily. SHEZA CAT hesitated at the start, racing in the rear, made a steady gain, coming around the final turn on the outside and was a clear second at the
wire. BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and faded. WILLAMINA challenged on the front end in the beginning,
faded and finished evenly. GRAEME'S DEAL raced near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was never a factor. CAT B CAUSE void of
early speed and showed little. BOSTON BELLE dueled on the front in the early part, saved ground and dropped back.

outside around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. GATSBY'S FORTUNE lacked early speed, made a wide bid and finished
willingly. HARPES HILL void of early speed, made a wide gain, but was no factor. THE BOYZ PRIORITY pressed the early pace and faded. BIG FIG always
raced near the back and showed little. DOUBLE BOGEY lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn and was outrun. ZOEY'S HIPPIE showed early
speed and dropped back.
