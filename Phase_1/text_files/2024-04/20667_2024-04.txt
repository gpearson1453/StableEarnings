Footnotes
BOUNDTOBEOK raced with the early pace inside, eased out and rallied to the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, drew clear toward the quarter, rounded
the far turn at the rail and held well under steady handling. VICTORY ROYALE came away a bit awkwardly and was shuffled back early then saved ground,
bid nearing the three eighths pole, drifted to the four path on the far turn and dueled through the final sixteenth for second. WINDSOR'S PLAY tapered in
and took the lead early, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met approaching the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail into the far
turn and was outfinished for second the final sixteenth. STEPHANIE MY LOVE settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn then flattened stride. MAGIC GLASS raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through
the backstretch. CASTLE REVIEW rounded the first turn about the three path, left the turn outside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ARROWWOOD raced with the early pace inside, dueled nearing the five sixteenths pole and took over at the rail midway on the far turn, raced clear into the
lane and was steadily handled to hold on well. SNEAKY LYNK saved ground just off the pace on the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, steadily
improved at the rail on the far turn and finished well to take second mid-stretch. MISS LAUREN stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and came along to take third later yards. EMBERLY raced with the pace in the two and
three paths, took the nod passing the nine sixteenths pole and was pressured for more toward the five sixteenths, but gave up the lead midway on the far
turn and weakened into the lane. BONNIE BLUETOOTH stalked the early pace from the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but
flattened in the five path on the far turn. PRINCESS HALO rated close to the early pace about the three path, left the first turn outside and gave chase from
the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
JAYJAYDEE settled just off the early pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead at the three eighths, ran clear
into the far turn and was steadily handled to the late going before being taken in hand. ZEN MASTER rounded the opening turn about the three path, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, entered the far turn in the three path then angled out approaching the head of the land and dug in to clear second later
yards. JUNGLE BEAST saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back at the rail past the quarter,
drifted nearing the head of the lane then relented in the stretch duel for second. NO LOVE FOR JUBA settled in the five path the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path then angled toward the inside entering the stretch and weakened in the drive. SUBJECT
TO CHANGE stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, but was carried out entering
the stretch and flattened stride. RIDICULOUS rounded the opening turn in the four path, gave chase into the backstretch and raced in the six path on the far
turn. KENNY HAD A NOTION settled close in the four path the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch but faded in the four path on the far turn. TWO BIT
KID showed little response. MONTAUK DADDY set the early pace inside, was caught approaching the three eighths pole and gave way readily. The
Stewards reviewed, and rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Jayjaydee for alleged interference in the vicinity of the quarter pole, lodged by the rider
of Jungle Beast.

Footnotes
RRACE DAY WARRIOR stalked the early pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod entering the stretch, dug in from that point
and cleared ROYAL THUNDER in later yards. The latter rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and kept the advantage
nearest the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane and remained a factor through the upper stretch, but relented later yards. WELLING saved ground
racing well off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved off the rail on the far turn, came between horses leaving the turn and took over
third the final stride. NEVER CHANGE rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole and closed the gap near
the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but was nipped from third the final stride. MAILMAN'S A FLYER settled in the four path the opening turn, gave
chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little more. MR HOOVER angled in and stalked the early pace
two deep, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened in the three path on the far turn. GANDY DANCING raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase into
the backstretch but weakened in the four path on the far turn. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. MYSTIC POINT angled in and stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole then weakened past the
three eighths. JAMMIN STILL was not a factor.
