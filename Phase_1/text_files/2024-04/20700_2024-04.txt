Footnotes
REMEMBER ME disputed the early pace outside QUEN OF HEARTS, went clear leaving the turn, remained well off the rail through the stretch and lasted.
LADY LIGHTFEET , a forward factor along the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, checked lacking room near the half mile pole, swung four wide mid
way on the turn and rallied gamely outside the winner. BABY SOX raced in the two path between horses on the turn, had room inside the winner in the
stretch and flattened out. PEPPERMINT CLASS , three deep around the turn, chased the winner and weakened. LOVELY LIZA , far back after breaking in
the air, swung very wide in upper stretch and finished gamely. MISS FOXANN , well positioned in the three path on the turn, weakened. QUEEN OF
HEARTS showed early speed along the inner rail and gave way leaving the turn.

Footnotes
HONEY B B tracked four wide and outside the leader, cruised up to engage leaving the far turn, moved clear in hand mid turn, was put to a strong drive in
upper stretch and kept and outside threat from FLOGE at bay. FLOGE settled off the early pace while well off the rail, moved up leaving the far turn, chased
and shifted out five wide for the drive, ranged up to loom a serious presence in mid stretch, switched over to her left lead near the sixteenth pole and was
denied. NEXT GIRL , two to three wide early, edged up off the inside mid turn, swung out six wide while under pressure into the lane and churned on
without really threatening. AMORICA saved ground well off the early pace, remained inside and offered a belated run. FUNZALO lagged back, raced
removed from the inside in upper stretch and failed to menace. SALTY GIRL broke inward and bumped with CONCRETE FAZE, corrected and saved
ground pursuing the leaders, angled out into the lane, failed to go on in mid stretch and weakened. MISSY BOSS sped clear early, set the pace off the
inside, failed to resist the winner around the turn, chased to the three sixteenths then gave way. CONCRETE FAZE stumbled at the break and bumped with
an outer rival, regrouped and settled off the pace, raced between runners in upper stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
CARSONS COOL WOMEN lacked speed, raced between horses in upper stretch, eased out wide in mid stretch, closed determinedly outside DIANE and
was up approaching the finish. DIANE , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead entering the stretch, went clear and weakened in the
drive. HAPPYINITIATIVE worked between horses in upper stretch, swung outside near the sixteenth pole and passed tired foes. TIA MAYIN , a forward
along the inner rail on the turn, eased out for the drive and failed to rally in an even effort. DIVINE SPIRIT disputed the pace outside WIND BREAKER and
gave way the final furlong. REZOOM , steadied when bearing in and bumping WIND BREAKER at the start, raced wide into the stretch and was no factor.
WIND BREAKER , bumped at the start, rushed up along the inner rail to make the lead, saved ground on the turn and tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ENERGY EFFICIENT , off a bit slow and brushed with an outer foe, regrouped and eagerly made his way forward between rivals, prompted the pace three
wide outside BAZINGA D, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, took over in upper stretch, shook clear leaving the three sixteenths then
steadily widened under a solid drive. BAZINGA D gained the early lead between rivals then set a rated pace off the inside, was hounded by the winner
around the turn, ceded to that one into the lane, stayed on to give hard chase past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly in the final yards and managed to
preserve the place. MARGIE'S FUN SON rated off the pace and outside rivals heading to the turn, angled out mid turn, circled six wide into the stretch and
offered a mild rally. RENEWING VOWS , brushed with the winner at the start, gained a forward spot while in the clear and off the inside, chased the
embattled leaders four wide into the stretch, stayed on with effort to about mid stretch then faded. VERBIER , off the pace and between runners mid turn,
angled out some in the drive but lacked a rally. GREAT CALL vied inside foes leaving the chute then rated back a bit to track towards the inner rail, stalked
mid turn, came under a ride in upper stretch and weakened. STEADY JOHN secured the rail leaving the chute, settled off the pace, eased out in the lane
but failed to generate a run.

Footnotes
NICK'S LITTLE BOY stalked the early pace, raced in the three path around the turn, put a nose in front approaching the stretch, drifted out a bit in mid
stretch and drew off under steady handling. LUV YA BYE BYE rushed up four deep leaving the turn and flattened out in the drive. RAHMER raced in the
three path leaving the turn, was fanned six wide by CLASS ACTOR in upper stretch, angled in approaching the sixteenth pole and passed tired rivals.
DISPUTED NOTION lacked speed, circled horses on the turn, entered the stretch four deep, offered an advance to mid stretch and failed to sustain the
move. CLASS ACTOR , two wide chasing the pace on the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and weakened.
HELMS DEEP bobbled at the break, hugged the inner rail chasing the early pace and weakened. BERMONDSEY sped to the early lead, stayed along the
inner rail and gave way. NEVERFOLD trailed.

Footnotes
JAY dropped in a couple paths then rated behind rivals into the turn, angled out mid turn then gathered steam four wide into the stretch, leveled off under
stout left handed asks in mid stretch, forged past the leader leaving the sixteenth marker then drew clear while steadily hand ridden late. CAR RIDE , four
wide outside rivals nearing the turn, edged closer while three deep past the five sixteenths, remained three wide into the lane, churned on with interest and
got the place. RAPIDITY broke sharp then prompted the early pace three wide, raced between runners mid turn, dropped in towards the rail with pursuit in
upper stretch, altered out late and came back on between runners in gritty fashion. HOLONUI was nudged clear early on, set the pace towards the inner rail,
spurted away a bit while under a drive past the three sixteenths, could not resist the winner's charge leaving the sixteenth marker then weakened late.
LUCKY PRINCE was sent up early and stalk the leader two wide, dropped in and remained close under asking mid turn, dropped back some past the three
sixteenths, shifted back out late and found more to bridge the gap. DEPLOYMENT bobbled slightly at the break and was away last, recovered and was a bit
keen advancing inside runners heading to the half mile marker, steadied when in a bit close leaving the far turn, dropped back, to last, altered out in the
drive but came up empty.

Footnotes
THE JUDGE AND JURY stalked the pace, stayed in the two path on the turn, drifted out a bit entering the stretch, wrested command in upper stretch, drifted
out near the eighth pole and was kept to his business in the drive. JEOPARDY JAMES bumped with NORTH HIGHLAND leaving the starting gate, circled
the turn four deep, was fanned five wide in upper stretch, drifted in in mid stretch and rallied. NORTH HIGHLAND bumped with JEOPARDY JAMES at the
start, saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail turning for home, was in hand waiting for room approaching the eighth pole then rallied gamely between
foes. EASY DAY , in the two path on the turn, raced between horses in upper stretch, swung outside in mid stretch and was no menace. MIDLANER , a
forward factor in the two path between horses on the turn, weakened in the drive. CHILDERS accelerated to the front, set the pace along the inner rail, lost
the advantage in upper stretch and gave way in mid stretch. MONDAY MORNING QB , up close early, hugged the inner rail on the turn and faltered.
MARCHED bore in leaving the starting gate, raced forwardly in the three path on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
CARROLL GIRL , quickly to the front, set a rated pace in the two path, handled outside pressure from BIG CHEEKS nearing the half, spurted back clear
leaving the far turn then kept on under solid handling through the final furlong to prove best. BIG CHEEKS , three wide between rivals around the first turn,
prompted outside the winner, moved to apply pressure a half mile from home, could not quicken with the winner soon after, came under a hustling ride past
the three eighths, chased to the inside of PEYTON ELIZABETH past the five sixteenths, came back out with pursuit in upper stretch, was denied late but
stayed on with good effort. HAZARDOUS HUMOR saved ground while in range through the opening half, saw the leaders get away leaving the far turn and
was put to a serious ride, remained inside while evenly through lane but managed to get past a fading rival to get the show. PEYTON ELIZABETH hopped
at the break and was away last, was used four wide to contention, stalked four wide and outside BIG CHEEKS into the far turn, gave closest chase into the
lane then weakened through the final furlong. STOP THE CAP , fractious in the gate, raced four then three wide around the first turn, settled in the clear
nearing the five eighths, edged up a bit nearing the turn, chased but lacked a strong stretch kick. BOUND BY DESTINY , squeezed back early, recovered to
save ground off the pace but never got untracked.

Footnotes
ELLIE VICTORINA , a bit sluggish from the gate, was outrun off the rail into the turn, picked things up three wide leaving the three eighths, advanced
between runners leaving the furlong grounds, kept on grinding under a drive and just got up to the inside of foes. BULLOCK broke outward, corrected and
forced the pace outside KAYA'S HALO, entered the lane in about the five path while dueling, gained a short lead nearing mid stretch, clung to command
despite drifting out inside the sixteenth marker, kept on gamely but was nipped on the line. SANSA ARIEL chased outside the leaders into the turn, dropped
back a bit leaving the far turn, picked things back up and circled four wide into the stretch, worked between runners late and finished willingly while earning
the show. KAYA'S HALO sped to the front, set a pressured pace off the inside, dueled four wide to the inside of the BULLOCK into the lane, kept up the
battle past mid stretch, drifted out late and gave way grudgingly. LA SAMANA LAURA saved ground, moved up a bit near mid stretch, failed to sustain past
the sixteenth pole and faded. ALLIALLIOXENFREE hit the outer portion of her stall and was away slowly, recovered and moved up nearing the turn, failed to
kick on mid turn, faltered and was eased.
