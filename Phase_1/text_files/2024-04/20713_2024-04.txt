RED MOUNTAIN stalked the pace, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and edged up late in a game effort under strong handling. SONIC POSSE
rated along under a firm hold, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole to take command, led deep stretch and missed in a game effort. GOSPEL
CRUSADER dueled two deep from the outside of rival and weakened a bit through the drive. BROWN RESERVE was off slowly, raced off the early pace,
was five deep near the quarter pole racing from the outside of rivals and raced even with no closing run. VIENNA PRIZE was off very slow, raced near the
back after the poor start, ridden from the inside near the quarter pole, angled out into the upper stretch, raced from the far outside in the drive and never
threatened. FRONT ROW SHOW dueled for the early lead along the inside and gave way. COLE TRICKLE was slow early on, swung five to six wide into
the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
TENSAS CLEAR stalked the pace, moved up three wide in the stretch run, split rivals near the eighth pole and edged up under strong handling. RUN A
FIRE settled off the early pace setters, raced from the inside around the far turn, made a good rail bid in the stretch and rallied for the place position.
CATALINA SUNRISE was off a step slow, raced with the second flight early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and rallied gamely late. OKIE HOPE
had a poor start, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, angled in, raced from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and closed in
gamely. MISS DOUBLE dropped back off the early pace, raced three to four wide in the stretch and moved up to improve position. SALT CREEK CAT
dueled near the rail and gave way in the drive. HALE'S LUCKY LADY dueled two path outside of foe and faded. EXHI LIL DARLIN stalked the pace, raced
three wide between near the quarter pole and weakened. GOOD LIQUOR raced mid pack early, made a four bid to contention near the quarter pole and
faltered in the drive. DEM CATS LUV ME dropped back early and failed to respond.
