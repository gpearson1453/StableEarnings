Footnotes
MOVE OVER (GB) angled in heading into the first turn, saved ground settling toward the back, continued inside through the far turn, bid up the rail in
mid-stretch taking command by the furlong grounds, quickly moved clear then was eased up late. EL ALTO HOMBRE broke inwardly, moved straight to the
front, set the pace from off the rail, was overtaken in mid-stretch and no match for the winner. ZUMURUDEE broke a step slowly and was squeezed back at
the start, switched outside a foe heading into the first turn, stalked from off the inside, moved out four to five wide leaving the far turn and under urging, kept
on in the stretch but needed more. KALINE was put to stout restraint while headstrong in the early going rating in behind the pacesetter on or just off the rail,
came out a bit in upper stretch then moved back in and ran on evenly. FRISCO KID stalked two then three wide between runners early, stalked the leader
up the backstretch, edged nearer on the far turn drawing nearly even briefly past the quarter pole but could not sustain the effort. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE
settled off the pace three wide early, swung out and drifted further leaving the far turn to be eight wide at the top of the stretch, failed to menace. SHARP
WARNING raced mid-pack outside three to four wide early, moved out five deep on the far turn, failed to rally.

FEEL FREE was coaxed forward inside foes to the lead, set the pace from off the rail, drew clear in the stretch, was kept to the task while losing the whip
inside the eighth pole. HEAVENLY VIOLET was prominent in a forward position between runners in the early going, floated five wide turning for home,
lacked the needed late kick. CAPO SORELLA broke inwardly a bit, chased but was outsprinted early, raced between foes into the turn, came out six wide in
upper stretch and fran on. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY was outpaced early racing near but off the rail, passed foes in the stretch. LOTSA LOU was prominent
early contending outside, floated seven wide turning for home, failed to rally. SALLY STANFORD failed to threaten racing near the rail. CHEDOODLE
RYLEE showed very brief speed then readily dropped back racing outside foes into the turn, swung eight deep, failed to rally.

Footnotes
INCREDIBE MO stalked just off and outside the pacesetter, took the lead at the quarter pole, drew away in the stretch when roused. WESTERBERG was
mostly two to three wide, shifted in a bit three furlongs out advancing inside on the far turn, was second best. INNOCENT MAN settled well back off the
inside, advanced between foes in upper stretch, was best of the rest. SUBITO SLEW raced mostly four wide outside advancing closer about the half but
failed to rally for the stretch run. BIYOMBO set the early pace from just off the rail, was in just a hair tight near the half as the loose horse passed and
crossed in front, weakened in the stretch. FED GRANT tracked from inside, moved out abruptly near the furlong grounds, had no late bid.
IMISSBAYMEADOWS reared at the start losing the rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS RULED ALL
RUNNERS HAD A FAIR BEGINNING AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

BORN TO REIGN stalked just off the leaders four to five deep, bid coming to the quarter pole, forged clear in the stretch. TIZ FOR REAL settled off the pace
caught five to six wide in the early going, swung nine deep turning for home, kicked on well but too late. A THOUSAND DREAMS switched out off the rail
entering the first turn, tracked from mid-division in the two to three path, advanced inside tiring foes in upper stretch but still off the fence then evened out
late. METAROSE was well-placed not too far off the leader having moved out from four to six wide on the first turn, continued the pursuit four to five deep
through the far turn and went evenly in the stretch. KEBA LUCKY DAY stalked then pressed the pace from outside four to five wide, drifted out seveal paths
late on the far turn, kept on in the lane. COME CORRECT settled toward the back inside saving ground, came out at the top of the stretch four deep, ran on.
CRIMINAL RECORD was urged at the break and soon made the lead, set the pace from off the rail, came up empty. LILLY CHROME raced toward the rear
racing off the inside four to five deep, swung seven wide turning for home, failed to rally. REALREALGOOD broke a step slowly, was caught six to seven
wide through the first turn, shifted in a few paths for the far turn, failed to rally.

RUN SNAPPY set the pace facing outside pressure racing off the fence in the two to three path, moved clear leaving the turn while drifting five deep, lasted.
KHAIKY'S COMMAND was among the early leaders before easing back and switching outside that pair, chased through the turn floating six wide for the
drive, kept on well and was gaining late but missed. CLUB MESQUITE shifted in early on the turn, raced two to three wide on that bend, kept on to improve
position. PAUL VINCENTS POEM settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, steadied slightly past the quarter pole, kept on in the lane. BEDROCK
fanned nine wide turning for home, altered in several paths in upper stretch, kicked on well but too late. NUMEROLOGIST lightly bumped a rival at the start,
settled well back off the inside, moved out from four to six wide on the turn, ran on. CHUCK NAZTY wasn't too far back of the leaders racing outside, swung
out nine wide for the drive, failed to rally. DARNQUICK was lightly bumped at the start then strongly urged forward, prompted the pace of the eventual
winner, drifted seven wide leaving the turn, came up empty. SO CAL MEMORY tossed the head at the start, chased from mid-division going about three to
four wide on the turn, came up empty. ECONOMICAL was toward the back off the inside three to five wide through the turn and never near enough to
threaten. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF PAUL VINCENTS POEM AGAINST CLUB MESQUITE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
GODSEND chased the pacesetter, moved to the lead taking a narrow advantage over that one at the three-eighths, went three to four wide on the turn,
forged clear in the stretch. MR. CAPTAIN JACK sped clear, set the pace from off the rail, was no match for the winner, saved the place from a fast-closing.
CRYSTAL BANDIT , who settled well back racing off the rail, angled eight wide at the top of the stretch, finished strongly but too late. FLEET OF FLAGS
broke in just a bit, chased from outside going four to five wide on the turn, kept on evenly. WESTPORT CAPTAIN chased from off the rail, came out five
wide for the stretch, ran on. BRAVO KOLT raced near but off the fence, evened out in the stretch. I AM FREAKY FAST was never a threat racing off the
inside. ORTH broke just a step slowly and in a bit tight, came into upper stretch six wide, failed to rally.

CHARMANT E tracked the leaders, advanced inside foes but off the fence to the lead past the quarter pole, cleared in the stretch having drifted out a bit,
held sway. NANG SINGHA brushed the gate lightly, settled at the back, rallied between foes in the stretch. SHE'S MY NIECE shifted in, advanced inside
then evened out. GODDESS OF WAR was bumped at the break, chased inside, came out, evened out. HOT LAVA CAKE broke sharply but outwardly, set
the pace facing outside pressure racing well off the inside part of the track, faded in the stretch. BANGO'S HEAT chased mid-pack, shifted nine wide, failed
to rally. OH ANGEL bumped a rival at the start, raced toward the back off the inside and was never a threat. STARDUST DREAMS prompted the pace from
outside, floated eight wide turning into upper stretch, tired.
