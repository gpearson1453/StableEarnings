Footnotes
NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) was closest in pursuit a bit off the rail then moved inside, drew closer into the far turn, eased over to the two path still
patiently ridden on the far turn, drew alongside the leader approaching the stretch, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away under right handed urging.
MIGHTY KAI unhurried in the early going and moved inside, saved ground to the stretch, got boxed in along the fence at the eighth pole, moved out a bit
into a clear path, split foes late and got up for second. WHAT A DUDE stalked the pace along the inside, came off the rail a bit on the backstretch, moved
back inside early on the far turn then tipped two wide, moved out in the lane and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. SYNTACTIC reserved early on and
moved inside, drew closer on the far turn, came off the rail at the top of the stretch and also finished evenly down the lane. MOBE TOWN cleared the field
and steered to the rail, showed the way to the far turn, challenged by the winner entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
DERECHO DANDY settled between rivals in the two path, remained there to the stretch and lacked a rally. MY PARTNER GLEN traveled three deep out of
range early, continued in the three path into the far turn, tipped four wide around that bend and failed to menace. HARD MISSION traveled between rivals at
the back on both turns and offered no response when asked. REMOTE laid off the pace three deep and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
WARRIOR LADY broke through the gate and was reloaded, stalked between into the first turn then moved over to the rail, challenged inside the leader at
the quarter pole, took over midstretch and held gamely to the line. HALF NELSON cleared to take control and led three then two wide around the clubhouse
turn, challenged by BOSSY BRUIN GAL past the half-mile pole, disposed of that rival early on the far turn, met the bid from WARRIOR LADY at the quarter
pole, resisted to the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and stayed on gamely to the wire. BOSSY BRUIN GAL stalked three deep then three
wide early, launched a bid from outside leaving the backstretch, could not keep up with HALF NELSON and chased again in the three path, then weakened
in the lane while churning on for the show. GLORY OF CHROME chased inside a trio of rivals then dropped back and trailed in the two path, raced along
the rail then two wide on the far turn and passed a tired rival in the drive. MIDNIGHT SILENCE chased four wide throughout, drifted inward in upper stretch
and weakened.

Footnotes
GRAZEN IN THE SUN set the pace down the hill under pressure from PROOF SHE ZIPS to the outside, met bids two more challengers entering the lane,
fought with the runner-up in the final furlong and drew clear late. ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS raced up close while a bit keen early on, took back a bit to stalk
the top pair two then three wide around the bend, bid four wide into the lane, kept the pressure on the winner to the sixteenth pole and got turned away late.
HEADED FOR OM tracked two wide down the hill, got shuffled back a bit at the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane, angled out into the clear and
finished willingly for third. HEY DEMPS had to steady off the heels of a rival early, chased three wide into the turn, angled out at the quarter pole, came five
wide into the lane, bid four deep into the stretch but flattened out in the furlong grounds. TRUE PATRIOT lacked early speed and moved inside, eased out to
the four path around the turn, kept on through the lane but failed to threaten. SATOSHI saved ground tracking the pace through the turn, came off the rail
into the lane and could not rally. SWEET LAYLA RAE traveled outside a rival at the back, steered out and entered the lane six wide but was never a factor.
PROOF SHE ZIPS pressed the pace from outside to the top of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
THE BIG CHEESEOLA forwardly placed four deep early, chased the top pair four then three wide on the turn, drew alongside runner-up with a sixteenth
remaining and dug in to edged ahead late. ANTONSEN dueled for command from outside, inched ahead in upper stretch, held a short lead between rivals
at the sixteenth pole and got outkicked by the winner. TROTSKY was off a bit slow then lacked early speed and dropped back, trailed three wide into the
turn, got floated out leaving the bend, closed belatedly and got up for third. DANCE MAN dueled for the lead inside ANTONSEN to the top of the stretch,
kept the pressure on into the furlong grounds, faltered in deep stretch and lost the show. CAPITAL OUTLAY fractious in the gate, raced up close three deep,
chased three then two wide around the bend, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. L SQUARED sat off the pace up the backstretch, traveled two wide
then drifted out leaving the bend, angled out from behind rivals in upper stretch and weakened.

in, trailed three wide into the turn, made progress outside rivals around the bend, angled out across the dirt, launched a bid in upper stretch but flattened in
the late stages. CHARGE FOR GOLD sped clear early, confronted by KING OF GOSFORD (GB) from inside on the turn, drifted out crossing the dirt, fought

SATELLITE HEART tossed her head and came away slow, chased briefly then went up to vie for the lead three deep on the backstretch, continued three
deep through the turn, took over past the eighth pole, dueled with WE'LL DO IT LIVE in deep stretch and dug in to prevail. WE'LL DO IT LIVE dueled for the
lead from outside then between rivals, put a head in front with a furlong remaining, lost command shortly after, battled back in deep stretch but was
outgamed by the winner. BELLE EPOQUE dueled for the lead from inside then fought inside a pair of rivals leaving the backstretch, inched ahead around
the bend, lost command at the eighth pole, weakened a bit late and managed to save the show. DORIE MILLER chased four wide into the turn, three wide
into the lane, moved out in the lane and missed the show. KYTHIRA stalked behind the leaders up the backstretch, raced along the rail then took aim two
wide into the stretch and could not find the needed late kick in the final furlong.

BREEZY BLUE chased from inside out of range, saved ground through the turn, summoned a mild rally in the lane and bested the rest. JANE KENDEIGH
bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, chased three deep into and around the turn, lugged in through the lane and lost the place. EPIONE stalked three
deep up the backstretch, moved into the two path nearing the turn, chased between in the final furlong and lacked a bid. PIPPA PHILIPA bobbled leaving
the gate, lagged behind early, saved ground then angled out in upper stretch, got forced out at the eighth pole and kept on in deep stretch. ANNIE FOX
settled off the rail then between rivals, had to check at the three-eighths pole, angled to the rail on the turn, was forced to steady again at the eighth pole
and could not rally. CASTAGNA stalked from inside, saved ground through the turn, chased between in the lane and weakened. R MARILYN LONHRO
saved ground off the pace, came out at the eighth pole and lacked a response. CLUB TEASER broke a step slow, coaxed along in mid-pack early, got
blocked behind a rival leaving the backstretch, traveled three deep around the bend, got impeded and took up at the eighth pole and could not regain
momentum. HAVE PATIENCE bumped leaving the gate, altered out a bit at the seven-sixteenths pole, ran four wide around the turn, got forced out and
checked at the eighth pole and made no impact. LADY P was rank chasing between rivals up the backstretch, dropped back two wide on the turn and gave
way in the lane. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN SEVERAL RUNNERS AND AFTER A REVIEW
RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

LANSDOWNE (GB) dueled from inside, cleared with three furlongs remaining, met the bid from PATRON D'ORO at the eighth pole, put that rival away
approaching the sixteenth pole and was kept busy to the wire. PATRON D'ORO stalked from outside, took the turn four then three wide, challenged the
winner at the eight pole but was turned away. ESTABLISHED chased the top pair three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, lacked
a bid in the stretch run but kept on to secure third. HEARTFULLOFSTARS broke a step slow, chased six wide into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and
could not rally. AFTERNOON HEAT broke well then dropped back to last, took the turn seven then six wide and passed tired rivals. EL DIABLO ROJO
broke a step slow, moved into range, rounded the bend five then four wide and weakened in the drive. SAI CON (FR) had good early speed to take the front
then dueled outside the winner, could not kick up early on the bend, dropped back on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LAULNE (FR) tracked outside a rival then tipped three wide across the dirt, took aim from outside entering the final furlong, drew alongside ALLURING past
the sixteenth pole, dug in late and won the bob on the line. ALLURING was closest in pursuit from the two path down the hill, confronted GIRL OF MY
DREAMS at the top of the lane, put a head front at the eighth pole, led through deep stretch and lost the bob at the wire. GIRL OF MY DREAMS away
quickly to clear from outside, crossed over and showed the way along the inside through the turn, remained clear into the lane, challenged by ALLURING at
the top of the stretch, relinquished the lead with a furlong remaining and stayed on well to the wire for a game third. ANTIFONA (FR) unhurried in the
beginning, traveled outside a rival into the turn, between runners at the quarter pole, roused into the stretch, chased within striking distance through the final
furlong but finished evenly late. INVINCIBLE MOLLY (GB) tracked along the inside through the turn, moved out in the lane and lacked the needed late
punch in deep stretch. ZONA VERDE (IRE) settled off the pace, entered the two wide, chased three deep at the quarter pole, altered out over the dirt
crossing and could not rally. SHE IS ROMANTIC reserved in the early going from inside, saved ground to the stretch, put to right handed urging in the lane
but failed to respond.

along the fence and overhauled the runner-up. MOTORCADE hustled from the gate and went up to duel from outside, cleared inner rival leaving the bend,
met bids in the lane but could not fend off the winner late. AMERICAN CAT chased four wide into the turn, spun three wide into the drive, bid in the lane and
finished willingly to the wire. THALES forwardly placed five wide leaving the backstretch, chased four wide into the lane, challenged in upper stretch but
faltered late. D D S EXPRESS chased six deep into the turn, five wide into the stretch and finished evenly from the middle portion of the track. DUTCH BUS
lacked early speed, went six wide into the turn, moved in a bit around the bend then came back out approaching the stretch, produced a mild rally but
needed to find more. MISTER BEAMS stalked off the rail, rounded the bend in the three path and flattened in the final furlong. TAHOE SECRETS traveled
near the back and moved inside, shifted to the two path around the bend, tipped three wide into the lane and failed to menace. RUNNING TIGER coaxed
early from outside, dropped back off the pace and moved into the two path on the backstretch, angled to the inside and saved ground on the turn, tipped out
at the eighth pole and could not make an impact. FAMOUS STAR broke alertly to take the lead then dueled inside a rival, fought along the rail through the
turn, could not kick on with the leader entering the lane, bumped with outer rival in upper stretch and gave way.

held well under a drive to the wire. BRITISH ISLES rated along the inside, came under a ride on the far turn, finished well through the lane and kept gaining
to the wire. FAST CHAZ stalked outside a rival, closest in pursuit two wide through the far turn, took aim from outside into the stretch and weakened in the
late stages. THE OLD NINE (IRE) off slow to begin, chased between early then got bumped into the first turn, came back into the two path and continued
between rivals, had to pause when boxed in from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, altered to the inside for a clear path, asked in the lane
and failed to rally. SIENNOIS (IRE) off slow from inside, pulled briefly at the nine-sixteenths pole, traveled along the rail then tipped out into the lane,
bumped a rival at the eighth pole and kept on to improve position. NITTI (IRE) settled outside rivals and took a bump into the first turn, settled outside a rival
near the back on the backstretch, rounded the far turn two then three wide, moved out in the lane and also kept on to improve placings. SHOT OF
COURAGE bobbled leaving the gate, chased four deep early, three deep on the far turn and could not answer when called upon. AMERICAN GLORY (GB)
broke a step slow, traveled two wide then moved inside on the first turn racing at the back, went between rivals into the second bend, eased further out and
came four wide into the drive and failed to menace. TRIPLE PASS got pinched back at the start, chased three then two wide towards the rear on the first
turn, rounded the far turn three to four wide and lacked a rally. LE MANS broke a step slow, drifted out and bumped into the first turn, settled in mid-pack
