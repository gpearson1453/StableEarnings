GURL YOU FINE forced the pace outside ITSNOTMYJOB to bid in upper stretch, wore that rival down and was going clear late. ITSNOTMYJOB made the
running inside the winner to upper stretch and could not handle that one in the drive. JULIARD HONOR tracked the top pair two to three wide and could not
produce the needed late run. DONNAS FINAL WORD was along the inside and could not threaten late. THINKITASADONATION was three to four wide and
lacked a final closing run. PICTORIAL was not a factor four and five wide.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SMOOTH stalked the leaders while saving ground in the opening half mile, moved out heading up the backstrech to bid 3-4wd into the lane and
rallied clear under steady handling. SHAKEN AND SHIMMY was with the pace three and four wide to show in front going to the final turn then could not
handle the winner in the lane. NAUTILUS (BRZ) settled off the pace three or four wide, moved out in the far turn rally six wide into the lane and went well
clear for third. KAELY'S BROTHER stalked the pace three and four wide to make a mild bid with the winner in the far turn but lacked the needed late run.
HOLD TIGHT moved up inside but was not a threat. WILBERT was on the pace out from the rail to late backstretch and weakened. THUNDERSHOOK tired
three and four wide.

GOIN OWEN was on the pace about the three path while pressed, shook free in the far turn and drew off under urging in the lane. BEST UP saved ground
to rally through the far turn, continued up the rail in the lane and gained the place. ROPE BURN stalked the pace from four wide and lacked a late bid.
PROOF OF PURCHASE moved up three and four wide to bid outside the winner and weakened. DUTTON'S REVENGE moved up four and five wide while
not a serious threat. KHOZANTHEDESTROYER weakened from along the inside. COLONEL PUNCH showed brief speed along the inside and weakened.
CHEAT CODE stalked the pace three wide, steadied in traffic midway of the far turn and dropped back. WANN BOMBER was not a factor.

and was worn down in the lane. FLYWHEEL EFFECT stalked the pace three and four wide but lacked a final closing kick. ANGIE'S REVRAC was in reach
three wide but lacked a final closing run. POPS GIRL ALEXA was along the inside and lacked a rally. BLOOMING HILLS was four and five wide in the first

LEGEND OF GOLD rallied four and five wide to bid through the far turn into the lane, lugged in while straightening for home while clear and held safe.
MAGNOLIA SPEED rallied four wide in the far turn to bid with the winner but could not sustain the run. FIRESPITTEN KITTEN was three and four wide to
the far turn, angled in then waited briefly late in the turn and could not produce the needed late run. TOOMANYNAMES dueled on the pace inside HOG
HEAVEN and came up empty in the lane while finishing on even terms with that foe. HOG HEAVEN dueled outside TOOMANYNAMES on the lead to the
far turn and also came up empty. TAPITBOY was five and six wide in the first turn, settled three wide and never threatened. HAT TRICK JACK was always
back outside.
