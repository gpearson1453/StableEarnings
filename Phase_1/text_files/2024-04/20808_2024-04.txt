COMPANY YOU KEEP stalked the pace in the three path, dueled outside of the leader in the stretch, then drew off at the eighth pole under steady urging.
PATCH O'BRIEN stalked the pace inside, dueled through the stretch but was no match in the drive. CUSP stalked the pace between rivals before giving
way on the far turn. CHEESESTEAK was hesitant at the start, being back three lengths, raced in the two path, rallied at the quarter pole in the five path and
faltered. BOURBON LIFE tucked inside early in the two path behind horses, then had no bid. QUENCIO was clear early but gave way in the stretch. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TEXAS FREE pressed the pace in the two path, bid in early stretch, was clear briefly and then held off the closer. BUCKLE UP stalked the pace while inside
in the second flight, angled three wide at the three-sixteenths pole, rallied and missed. SOUTH DECATUR stalked the pace in the three path but had no late
bid. T. V. VICTORY was clear early inside, then gave way at the eighth pole. PAIGE PERFECT and MY PAL GREG raced evenly. FANCY STREAK was
never close. TREASURE KEY pressed the pace inside before giving way at the three-eighths pole.
