Footnotes
NORFIE stalked the pace in the three path, reeled in the pacesetter nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear under left-handed urging. COOLER KING set
the pace in the two path, yielded near the sixteenth pole and kept on for the place. SIXTEEN CIGARETTES chased the pace four wide and was one-paced
through the lane. TEJOTA raced up close between foes early, exchanged bumps with SMOKIN BOW near the half-mile pole, raced in the two path around
the turn and lacked the need the rally. SMOKIN BOW exchanged bumps near the half-mile pole, steadied soon after, raced in the three path and had no
further bids. DANLEY trailed inside, swung widest in upper stretch and was no threat.

Footnotes
ETENDRE stalked inside, came under a ride while tipping outward midway around the turn, bid in the four path at the top of the lane, and drew clear of the
inner pacesetter in the final furlong. DAVID'S SONGS showed the way in the two path, waited while under a nudge along the inside around the turn, was
cued in the two path turning into the stretch, lost the lead just before the eighth pole, but stayed on to hold place. THIRTY POUND TEST broke in at the
start, rated in the three path, was driven four wide midway around the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and kept on for show. FRANKS MIMI
trailed in the three path early and made no impact from the six path in the stretch. EMBRACE THE DREAM chased in the four path, was ridden between
foes while three wide rounding the turn, but flattened down the lane. WINE GOGGLES was prompted from up close in the three path but weakened between
foes midway around the turn. RUBY'S BIG RED raced off the pace in the five path and never threatened from the seven path in the stretch. SOUPER
ICONIC raced wellback in the six path and never menaced.

Footnotes
DIVINE showed the way in the two path, was cued passing the three-eighths, dug in from the three path turning into the lane, and drew clear passing the
eighth pole. RELIABLE LADY bumped with foes on both sides at the start, pressed in the four path, bid under coaxing from the three path midway around
the turn, but floated out to the seven path on her left lead in upper stretch, switched around the eighth pole, and chased on for place. GIOIOSO bumped with
an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace inside, checked going into the turn, received a right handed cue passing the three-eighths, but then steadied
again just after the five-sixteenths, angled out to the six path at the top of the lane, and drifted in while along for show. DREAMING OF KATIE raced off the
pace out in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn, but flattened. THEFORCEBEWITHYOU chased in the five path, was ridden in the three
path around the turn, but weakened. GOULDIAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path early and never threatened. REINA MAR
bumped between foes at the start, raced wellback in the three path and never menaced.

Footnotes
ECHO LANE saved ground in range, angled three wide leaving the three-eighths pole, steadily gained through the lane and was up and clear late. K
CROWN pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, led past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner
late. SILENT AND VIOLENT saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. DONTBESOOGROUCHY saved ground off the pace, steadied midway
around the far turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. MI DINERO set the pace along the rail, gave way near the
five-sixteenths pole and had the rider lose the whip late. CACIQUE ABARRIO raced in range three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. IKE'S
GAMBLE played no factor while racing two wide. DARTH was outrun while racing two and three wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF
DONTBESOOGROUCHY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FAR TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
IMONRA trailed in the four path, was roused midway around the turn, took aim in the five path at the top of the stretch, and inched ahead of the inner
pacesetter in the final sixteenth. DRIFAROS set the pace in the two path, was cued while just off the rail midway around the turn, ran on from the two path
into the stretch, but was edged out in the final sixteenth to place. LOVE APPEALS tracked in the five path, ranged up to bid in the four path approaching the
quarter, but evened out in the final furlong to show. STARSHIP NALA stalked in the three path, got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe and had to
steady between foes midway around the turn, then did not factor. MUSIC CITY STAR pressed in the four path, bumped an inner foe while in the three path
midway around the turn, then gaveway. COUSIN KRISTI was prompted from up close in the two path but got bumped by an outer foe while along the rail
midway around the turn causing her to steady and never menaced.

ICE THE KICKER set the pace in the two path, dueled two wide around the far turn and through midstretch, drew clear near the sixteenth pole and lasted.
THE HONEYMAN was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide, rallied through the lane and just missed. DESIGNATED HITTER stalked
the early pace from the rail, came through inside to take the lead down the backstretch, dueled inside of the winner past the eighth pole and weakened late.
BEYOND REPROACH was bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide, saved ground around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. HEATHCLIFF
prompted the pace three wide and faded around the far turn. MAGICSHADOW had his head turned at the start, raced in range four wide and had little left
for the drive. GO GO GE bumped at the start and again just after, steadied repeatedly through the opening quarter, raced three wide and trailed.

Footnotes
ALLEY OOP JOHNNY showed the way along the inside, was cued from the rail passing the quarter, opened slightly on his left lead while tipping out to the
three path in upper stretch, and held sway. TREASURE KING prompted the pace in the three path, bid midway around the far turn, lost touch with the
winning pacesetter while floating out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and chased on for place. SMART STRIKER tracked in the four path, ranged up
while under a ride and three wide midway around the far turn, got carried out to the six path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. SIGRUN FAST BOY
rated in the three path, was ridden in the five path around the far turn, but made no impact on his left lead. JERRY'S TURN slowly hopped at the start, then
steadied along the inside around the first turn, trailed in the two path down the backstretch and never threatened in the four path down the lane. THE
GREAT OZ stalked in the two path but weakened in the stretch.
