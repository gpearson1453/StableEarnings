Footnotes
KOMFORT KID was quick to the lead, set the pace from off the rail, widened on the turn, held safe. CHANCE TO DREAM exchanged some light bumps just
after the start, settled inside at the back, shifted seven wide turning for home, gained mildly late but was only second best. QUICK TRACK brushed a rival at
the start, chased from inside, saved ground, kept on. SWEET BUT FIERCE exchanged light bumps at the start, raced outside at the back, came into upper
stretch four to five wide, needed more. WALK ON WHISKEY was just a bit fractious in the gate, raced mid-pack, went two to three wide on the turn and
evenly. MUSAITERS PRIDE chased, dropped back three wide on the turn, faded.

Footnotes
CELEBRITY GIRL was strongly urged forward from the start, forced the pace inside a rival, soon took charge with just a narrow advantage, extended the
margin in upper stretch then held safe. BURNINGDAYLIGHT chased from between foes into the turn, was encouraged by the quarter pole, came into the
stretch three to four wide, secured place while no match for the winner. K P BLAMENGAME broke sharply and with the clear early lead, was soon joined by
an inside foe, pressed then chased that one, lacked the needed late kick. BULLDACIOUS KROME chased inside, came out in upper stretch, was unable to
threaten. ICY REBEL was outpaced early bringing up the rear inside, failed to threaten. BEBBANBURG failed to menace racing off the inside.

MY GOOD GOOD BOY quickly moved clear and shifted in, set the pace near but off the rail, met the challenge of a rival in upper stretch and held that one.
WRECKING STORM chased, was asked for more past the quarter pole racing three to four wide, drew nearly even in a mild bid in upper stretch but was
held off. I'M A DREAMER TOO chased four to five wide, asked for more about the quarter pole, needed more. CODIS BREAKER raced outside at the back,
shifted seven wide turning for home, ran on. DISTORTED GUY settled at the back inside, failed to rally. GRONKSKY failed to rally racing off the inside.

LITTLE PINCH quickly moved clear and shifted in just off the rail to set the pace, faced outside pressure into the far turn, dispatched that rival and drew
clear in the lane. JUST KEEP LAUGHIN switched outside a rival into the first turn stalking that one three deep, edged nearer up the backstretch to press
into the far turn, was no match. KAMMYS KASH tracked in behind the leader on or just off the rail and inside foes. DOM PROUD lacked early speed
bringing up the rear racing off the inside early, moved inward and saved ground on the far turn, failed to menace. ART CURATOR raced mostly three to four
wide through the turns, failed to menace. EMMYS SILVER broke a half-step slowly, raced off the inside toward the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
AUSPICE bobbled slightly at the start but still got away alertly and with the early lead, was soon outsprinted nearing the four-and-one-half, pressed and
dueled with new leader to the inside, took a narrow advantage in upper stretch, saved the win by getting the nod. ATTILAS TORNADO was coaxed forward
to the lead after the opening quarter mile, dueled with a rival all the way to the wire and just missed. INDIAN NIGHTS was off the leaders, saved ground but
needed more. PLAYING FIELD fanned five wide into upper stretch, was not a threat. ZACH WHO was urged forward to within range of the early leader,
chased briefly, steadily weakened. VINCE'S CORNER saved ground on the turn, was never a threat.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD TIZ stalked mostly four wide, moved nearer heading into the far turn and took the lead about the five-sixteenths, drew off in the stretch.
THIRSTY MOE bumped a rival a the start, stalked two to three wide early then forced the pace up the backstretch, was challenged by the eventual winner
heading into the far turn, was no match for that one but saved place. PASS IT AROUND was bumped into a rival at the start, tucked in early saving ground
inside on the first turn, tipped out heading up the backstretch, was within range two to three wide on the far turn, came out a bit in the stretch and ran on.
SUENO REAL bumped somewhat hard with a rival at the start but recovered to set the early pace inside on or just off the rail, dropped back and switched
out, raced three to four wide on the far turn still in pursuit, kept on but needed more. SI PASA ALGO was bumped lightly at the start, raced mostly three to
four wide travelling evenly. EL OCHO chased four to five wide early, weakened. HAPPY SLAPPER was caught five wide into the first turn before dropping
back and shifting in a bit, raced mostly three wide thereafter and failed to menace. ITSNOWTROUBLEATALL exchanged a hard bump at the start, was not
a threat racing off the inside.

LUCK IN MY EYES settled mid-pack five wide, moved on the far turn still five deep taking the lead at the top of the stretch, drew clear. EFFORT N
RESULTS stalked close to the leaders four wide, was asked for more about the five-sixteenths, kept on in the lane to get up for second late. RIG RIDER
was urged forward, made the lead and set the pace in the clear just off the rail, was challenged while moving out a path on the far turn, weakened.
ABSTRACT KAT moved out from three to four wide on the first turn racing toward the rear, settled to the far turn, moved out from four to five deep on that
bend while beginning to advance, improved position. BLACK EYED BANDIT tracked in behind racing up close in the two path into the far turn, weakened.
SENSE OF URGENCY stalked mostly three to four wide, failed to rally. ZENFULLY ZESTY saved ground inside but could only run on evenly. STRYDER
tucked in behind foes from four to three wide on the first turn then moved in further still racing in the back half of the field into the far turn, failed to rally.
BOOMER WHO settled at the rear racing off the inside mostly in the three to four path, was never a threat.
