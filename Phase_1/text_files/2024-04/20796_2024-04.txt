rallied late inside. COWBOY IMAGE pressed the pace in the three path, dueled outside of the winner and yielded in the stretch. BOOMING bumped with a

improved position late. TACKLIN FUEL pressed the pace inside before fading in the stretch. MARIACHI JUSTICE was through early. GENTLEMAN LOGAN
moved up early in the four path but gave way at the quarter pole. WHISKEY JUSTICE stalked the pace in the six path and then gave way in the stretch.
