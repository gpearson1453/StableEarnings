DUNVEGAN DOLL always within striking distance, waited patiently through the far turn while two wide, shifted out entering the stretch, dug in late three
wide under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. GRAY ROYALITY stalked the early pace, went up to contest the lead two wide nearing the far
turn, battled the balance of the trip inside rivals and just missed in a game effort. BIG JAVA trailed around the clubhouse turn, surged three wide to draw on
even terms for the lead entering the far turn, matched strides two wide until deep stretch then was outfinished. PRANCIPANTS set the early pace along the
inside, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SPECIAL BEACH pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, made
the lead, set the pace past the three furlong marker, kept on into the stretch then was used up.

CONSTITUTIONALIST vied for the lead along the inside for a half, shifted three wide entering the stretch, rallied under strong right handed urging to make
the lead at the furlong marker and drew clear under strong handling. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the turn to
gained a narrow lead nearing the quarter pole, set the pace to mid stretch then was no match for the winner and just hung on for second. ROSY APPLE
trailed into the stretch, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the middle of the racetrack. LA CUMPARSITA pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then
faded. SPEEDY BUBBLES sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for nearly a half, kept on into the stretch and tired in the

LUCKY ANDY trailed from the start, responded with a burst of speed four wide under right handed urging to make the lead in deep stretch and drew clear
under strong handling. UNIDENTIFIED MAN stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead entering the
stretch, maintained his advantage past the furlong marker then was no match for the winner. JACK'S ADVANTAGE allowed to settle, finished with good
courage two wide. CHACO SPIRIT failed to menace. MORE THAN GOOD pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, gained a narrow advantage
early on the bend, kept on until mid stretch then came up empty. JUNE GLOOM was no factor. WIZARD WILLIE broke in full stride to set a pressured pace
along the rail into the turn, matched strides into the stretch and gave way late.
