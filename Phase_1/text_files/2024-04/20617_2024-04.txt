Footnotes
MOMENT'S PLEASURE showed early speed three deep, raced on even terms at the quarter pole, took over into the stretch, battled through the lane and
held gamely to the wire. STOP DIGGING raced in range off the inside, took the turn three wide, moved out in the lane, rallied into deep stretch and could not
get by the winner. HAYLEY AMBER set the pace under pressure from a pair of rivals to the outside, headed at the quarter pole, lost command exiting the
turn, fought back from inside through the lane but was outkicked by the top pair and held the show. TINY PRANCER stalked the pace from inside into the
turn, tipped out into the lane, finished willingly under left handed encouragement but missed the show. MIZ CLUBCALI chased out wide then angled in on
the backstretch, took the turn two then three wide, angled out in the lane and kept on to improve. DANZINGWITH MAXINE pressed the pace from between
rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, fought to upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. ANZA SKY traveled in mid-pack and moved to the
rail early, got put in tight at the three-eighths pole, continued to save ground to the stretch and lacked a rally in the late stages. LAST ELIZABETHAN
tracked outside a rival in the two path, raced greenly in the lane and could not rally. FASCINATOR settled outside rivals, went three wide into the turn, got
moved out to the four path midway around the bend, angled back into the two path and failed to threaten. GIRLCANTHELPIT off slow to begin, traveled
near the back off the rail then went outside a rival, took the turn three to four wide and proved no menace. STAKEMAKER also came away slow, sat off the
pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and could not make an impact. RADAR LOVE jumped onto the dirt crossing then raced greenly
near the inside trailing up the backstretch, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BALL DON'T LIE broke well then pressed the pace outside the leader, chased the pacesetter leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend three then two
wide, bid from outside past the quarter pole, inched ahead in upper stretch and drove clear in deep stretch. SANTARENA brushed with inner rival leaving
the gate, got bumped between rivals early, went up to take control then cleared leaving the backstretch, led two wide then moved to the rail on the turn,
confronted by BALL DON'T LIE past the quarter pole, relinquished the lead but fought on to midstretch, yielded with a sixteenth remaining but was clearly
second best. WINTERFELL stalked from outside, went four wide into the turn, moved in a bit before coming back out into the lane, lacked the needed rally
in the furlong grounds but finished a clear third. TOUR PLAYER bumped with outer rival at the start, chased off the rail, spun three wide into the lane and
could not rally. CANADA GATE brushed leaving the gate, got floated out by IN SUSPENSE and bumped with outer rival, began to climb shortly after, was a
bit green on the turn in the two path and weakened in the drive. BROHEIM broke in and bumped TOUR PLAYER, chased five wide around the turn and
weakened. IN SUSPENSE drifted out to bother rivals early, showed early speed then chased from inside to the half-mile pole, saved ground to the stretch,
then faded in the drive.

drew alongside the leader in upper stretch, gained the advantage nearing the sixteenth pole and edged clear late. ALTERNATE ROCK brushed inner rival at
the start, settled early, raced two wide then along the inside on the turn, closed through the lane and finished well between rivals late. EXCELIA (IRE)
dueled for command from outside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, cleared briefly into the stretch, challenged from both sides shortly after, relinquished the
lead midstretch and managed to save the show. FOOLISH stalked the top pair from inside, brushed the rail past the quarter pole, challenged from inside in
upper stretch but got outkicked in the late stages. JENNIFER'S D'LIGHT sat off the pace outside a rival, took the three then two wide, tipped out in the lane
and kept on to the wire. SHE'S GOT A WAY brushed leaving the gate, sat off the pace and steered to the inside, saved ground around the bend, found
traffic behind rivals at the top of the stretch and could not rally once in the clear. HAYLEY LEVADE dropped back early, trailed near the inside then shifted to
the two path entering the turn, swung out into the stretch and never threatened. QUEEN MOLOTOV dueled for the lead from inside, chased outer rival two

Footnotes
ROBERTA'S LOVE sped clear then dueled inside CLUBHOUSE RIDE up the backstretch and around the turn, put that rival away at the eighth pole and
held well over SAFA in the late stages. SAFA brushed the gate and broke inward, rushed up between rivals had to pause behind the dueling leaders,
chased two wide around the bend, tipped out in the lane and finished well from outside but lacked the needed late punch to get by the winner. CLUBHOUSE
BRIDE chased briefly then went up to challenge ROBERTA'S LOVE for early lead, fought two wide through the turn and into upper stretch, could not kick on
with the winner with a furlong left to run and weakened a bit late. QUICK KATE raced in range three deep, angled down to the rail on the turn, came back
out with a quarter mile remaining and weakened in the furlong grounds. MIRINDA stalked the dueling pair from inside to the stretch and weakened in the
drive. GREASE MISSLE off slow to begin, climbed early chasing well off the rail, navigated the turn four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
KATHYNMARISSA broke a hair slow but was quickly hustled to a forward position, stalked the lone leader outside a rival, spun three wide into the lane,
collared TAHINI midstretch and drove clear. LOTERIE (IRE) off slow to begin, sat off the pace on the inside, tipped two wide past the five-sixteenths pole,
angled out in upper stretch and rallied for second. SHE'Z THE LAW stalked from the rail behind the pacesetter, chased two wide into the lane, finished
willingly in the furlong grounds but got outkicked for the place honors. CERTITUDE (FR) hit the gate to lose a step at the start, became rank while chasing
along the rail, continued along the fence to the stretch, came off the rail in the lane and went evenly late. TAHINI sped clear and crossed over to the inside,
showed the way unchallenged to the eight pole, confronted by the winner approaching the sixteenth pole and yielded. POPPY'S JOY moved into the two
path racing towards the rear, swung out leaving the far turn and improved position. STRIKE WHEN READY off slow in the beginning, tucked inside at the
back, trailed a bit off the rail into the lane and passed tired rivals. BLUE FASHION reared up in the gate before settling for the start, came away slow, settled
inside near the back, pushed on through the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and lacked a response. GREER MY DEAR traveled outside a rival off the
pace, rounded the far turn two then three wide and failed to menace. BRUNCH WITH AMY tracked the pace from the two path, started to weaken on the far
turn and faded down the lane.

NOTHING LIKE YOU coaxed from the gate and took a stalking position along the rail, waited behind KINZA on the far turn, gained an opening approaching
the stretch and was given her cue, surged clear in upper stretch and widened through the final furlong. KINZA cleared the field early and showed the way
from inside, took pressure from KOPION past the half-mile pole, maintained command inside rivals through the far turn, led a bit off the rail into the stretch,
overtaken by NOTHING LIKE YOU at top of the lane and churned on to hold second. CORPOSO stalked in the three path around the clubhouse turn, bid
three deep on the second bend, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and could not get by KINZA for the place honors. KOPION was off alertly
and was well placed stalking KINZA from the two path, applied pressure from outside past the half-mile pole, fought between rivals on the far turn, chased
two wide into the lane and weakened. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST broke well then dropped back and tucked inside, lagged behind throughout and never got
involved.

Footnotes
ROYAL CHARTER (GB) was keen early when rated off the rail then settled three deep on the first turn, chased two wide through the second bend, bid three
deep with a furlong remaining, took over midstretch and won going away. IRRESISTIBLE FORCE closest in pursuit from the two path to the far turn,
challenged the leader from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, fought between rivals at the eighth pole and was no match for the winner late. HENNYS
CRAZY TRAIN stalked the pacesetter along the rail, roused leaving the far turn, lacked room in the lane before altered out near the sixteenth pole and got
up for third. JUST NAILS cleared quickly from outside and steered across to the rail, controlled the pace to the far turn, met the bid from an outer rival
midway around the bend, clung to a short lead fighting with a pair of rivals to the outside at the eight pole, relinquished the lead midstretch and weakened
late. SUNSHINE BABE sat off the pace in the two path, tipped four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. MRS. ASTOR unhurried in the early going and
moved inside, tipped two wide into the lane, found mild traffic in the lane and kept on to the wire. IRISH PATSY traveled two wide near the back, angled out
into the lane and improved position. PASTICHE (GB) steered to the inside and settled in mid-pack, came under a ride on the second bend, swung out into
the lane and needed to find more late. PLEASANT WAVE reserved early on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, got put in a bit tight near the sixteenth
pole and could not rally after. KLEEN KARMA taken back to last, went outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, trailed three wide into the lane and was never a
factor. NOT NOW became rank early, settled in mid-pack two wide, driven three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SUMMER LAKE pulled early,
chased between rivals and had to take hold when running up on heels on the first turn, moved inside in the middle stages, tipped out upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
AG BULLET bumped with inner rival early, dueled outside GRACELUND GRAY to the top of the lane, cleared that rival in upper stretch and inched away
while drifting in. MISS LIZZY got bumped by AG BULLET early, trailed in the early going, raced along the inside into the turn, steered off the fence around
the bend, spun four wide into the lane, closed through the stretch and rallied between runners at the sixteenth pole to get up for second. GETTHEMONEY
stalked the dueling pair off the inside then moved to the rail on the turn, came out late on the bend, chased within striking distance in the final furlong but
could not summon the needed late kick and lost second at the wire. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) tracked two then three wide, drifted out across the dirt, kept on
through the stretch and earned a minor award. GRACELUND GRAY dueled for the lead from inside down the hill, lost touch with the winner outside the
eighth pole and faltered late. CHISMOSA sat off the pace outside a rival, steered out and came five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. COMANCHE
COUNTRY (IRE) settled off the pace, moved inside, spun three wide into the lane and weakened.

STRONGHOLD stalked off the rail in the early stages, chased in the two path into the far turn, roused on the far turn back lacked room at the quarter pole,
split foes at the top of the stretch and took control outside the eighth pole, battled outside IMAGINATION through the final furlong and dug in to prevail.
IMAGINATION broke alertly and was prominent outside early outside TAPALO, stalked in the three path around the clubhouse turn, went up to apply
pressure in the middle stages, lost contact with the leader at the three-eighths pole, re-bid with a quarter mile left to run, took over into the stretch, lost
command approaching the eighth pole, battled back inside STRONGHOLD in the furlong grounds but lacked the needed final kick to get by. E J WON THE
CUP chased four wide early, moved up to challenge three deep on the backstretch, could not keep pace and chased three wide around the second bend,
re-bid four deep at the top of the stretch but flattened out in the final sixteenth. CURLIN'S KAOS settled along the rail, angled out past the quarter pole and
failed to produce a bid. TAPALO threw his head at the start to come away poorly, went up to take control from inside and cleared around the first turn, took
pressure from a pair of rivals on the backstretch, cleared at the three-eighths pole, challenged again by IMAGINATION at the quarter pole, relinquished the
lead entering the lane and faded in the final furlong. WYNSTOCK chased in the three path early, started to weaken two to three wide on the far turn and was
not persevered with in the stretch. MC VAY broke a step slow, drifted out a bit on the first turn then had his rider lose his iron and almost fall off before
regaining a footing approaching the backstretch, chased outside a rival at the back around the far turn and could not make an impact. TESSUTO pulled
early, checked off heels on the clubhouse turn, raced at the back and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ALIGATO sat off the pace in the two path, moved closer three deep on the backstretch, stayed off the fence and came four wide into the lane, drew
alongside the leaders with a sixteenth remaining and drove by late. FAUSTIN vied for the lead between rivals, pressed the leader from outside through the
far turn, fought back onto even terms in the lane but was outkicked by the winner. MYSTIFICATION vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, inched ahead at
the three-eighths pole, held a narrow lead with a furlong remaining and yielded grudgingly late. MAN AMONG MEN stalked two wide then moved inside,
roused and asked right handed on the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, then finished evenly once in the clear. BARELY FUNTIONAL tracked between
rivals in the two path on both turns, lacked room in upper stretch, roused when finding room midstretch and kept on trying to the line. SANTO DIOS (ARG)
sat off the pace three deep on the first turn, chased two to three wide on the second bend, challenged in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages. ONE
OF THESE DAYS (IRE) traveled along the inside off the pace, chased in range from the rail on the far turn, remained along the fence in the stretch and
could not produce a bid. OTTOMAN PRINCE (IRE) off slow to begin, raced near the back in the two path, tipped out approaching the stretch and could not
rally. SHORTMAN hesitated and came away last, trailed on the inside early, went outside a rival into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and made no
impact. SYDNEY STREET (GB) unhurried in the early going and steered to the inside, suffered a mild shuffle on the far turn, trailed into the lane, moved out
and proved no menace. STAMP MY PASSPORT reserved early, saved ground through both turns and was not a factor. FLEET FEET vied three deep then
drifted out on the first turn, reengaged the top pair while drifting into the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
SHADY TIGER stalked off the rail, had to take hold when running on heels at the nine-sixteenths pole, angled out at the five-sixteenths pole, took aim four
wide into the stretch, surged clear approaching the eighth pole and won going away. STAY ON THE FENCE stalked along the rail into the turn, waited for
room to develop sitting behind the leaders, lacked room in upper stretch, altered out at the eighth pole and got up for second. TWO BY FOUR brushed
leaving the gate, raced near the back off the rail then moved inside, moved out to the two path around the bend, tipped out into the stretch, finished willingly
and missed the place. TOM SEAVER antsy in the starting gate, stalked outside rivals to the turn, challenged three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, led into
the stretch, yielded to the winner shortly after and flattened to fourth. KNOWN IDEA prompted the pace from outside up the backstretch, vied between rivals
past the five-sixteenths pole, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. REFOCUS traveled in mid-pack well off the
rail, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path before angling five wide leaving the bend, then weakened in the stretch run. PRINCE
PRANCEALOT set the pace under pressure from outer rival in the early going, fought inside a pair of foes past the five-sixteenths pole, lost command
exiting the bend and gave way. PUDDIN HEAD JONES brushed with outer rival at the start then dropped back under urging, trailed two wide into the stretch
and never got involved. LAST CALL LONDON brushed leaving the gate, traveled three deep into the turn, angled down to the inside and tired.
