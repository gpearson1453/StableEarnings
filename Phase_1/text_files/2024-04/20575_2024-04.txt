Footnotes
FREEZE 'EM came out at the break, swung outside mid way down the backstretch, advanced four deep on the turn, gained a short lead entering the stretch
and drove clear late. HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE set the pace off the inner rail and inside the winner, was not quite good enough but finished well ahead of
the others in a sharp effort. A LOT OF VERVE came in at the break, was a forward inside horses on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and weakened.
GOLDEN AFFAIR , swung to the four path entering the turn,, remained wide and weakened. CAPALA stayed along the inner rail around the turn and was
not a factor. DAVID'S FAITH , four wide on the turn, was outrun. RECKLESS WARRIOR chased the pace and gave way on the turn.

DIRT FLIRT , patiently rated in the two path for six furlongs, swung wide leaving the far turn, closed outside, led late and drove clear. LOCK IT DOWN set
the pace near the inner rail, raced a bit erratically in the drive and gave way grudgingly. SINGLE LADY stalked the pace near the inner rail, eased out in
upper stretch and weakened in the drive. STREET SHADOW , rated along the inner rail, was set down in upper stretch and failed to rally. DELUSIVELY ,
three wide both turns, was in range of the leader turning for home and gave way. FINANCIAL ADVICE (FR) stalked the pace between horses down the
backstretch and faltered turning for home.

HONKY TONK HERO , reserved inside horses the first turn, moved out entering the backstretch, raced wide around the far turn, gained the lead in mid
stretch then drew off. MARKSMAN ON TARGET , sent into contention entering the first turn, chased the pace, dropped back some on the far turn, swung
out in upper stretch and rallied. EMPEROR'S CHOICE , sent leaving the starting gate, sprinted clear on the backstretch, set the pace to mid stretch and
weakened late. ELUSIVE LOVE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, was five to six wide on the far turn and rallied outside foes. UPO swung to the eight
path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. BRANNIGAN , wide the far turn, lacked a rally. TIGER BY HIS TAIL , four deep the first turn, chased the pace
outside horses and weakened. ITS BIG , no factor, steadied in between horses near the sixteenth pole. SMOOTH PAPA chased the pace, raced along the
inner rail turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
HORSE DOCTOR stalked the pace down the backstretch, eased outside near the three eighths pole, closed steadily and was up at the finish for a dead
heat win. LAUNCHED , right to the early lead, stayed well off the inner rail while setting the pace and dug in tenaciously to share in the victory. LIE AND
DENY came out at the break, was a forward factor in the four path between horses on the turn and lacked the necessary rally. BRAVO KOLT , bumped
leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path between horses entering the stretch and failed to menace. SPEEDING STYLE , between horses on the turn,
weakened. PUSH THROUGH , no factor, raced along the inner rail around the turn. THIRSTY , wide down the backstretch, chased the pace, gave way,
pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
LIMITED HEATWAVE , bumped leaving the starting gate, was nicely rated inside horses down the backstretch, moved out in upper stretch, closed
determinedly, led late and drove clear. LEGALLY REDDY , a forward factor outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn,
gained a short lead in mid stretch and finished gamely. FIREMAN DAN , carried wide entering the first turn, worked between horses on the far turn, drifted
wide in upper stretch and rallied. MARICOPA COUNTY lacked speed, raced between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. ORTH disputed the pace,
raced inside horses in the stretch and weakened. J C'S A LEGEND , fractious going to the starting gate, came out and bumped the winner at the break,
saved ground disputing the pace and weakened. INCREDIBE MO bore out entering the first turn, raced wide around the far turn, weakened and was eased
late. LUKA GRAZIE was not a factor.
