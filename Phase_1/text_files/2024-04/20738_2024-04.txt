Footnotes
HEZAKOOLKAT showed the way from the inside into the turn, was challenged by an eager rivals on the outside heading into the turn, continued to be
pressed down the lane but held on grudgingly to prevail in the end. BANDERA BLING pressed the leader while two wide, maintained a gamely rally entering
the lane but could not catch the leader and was best for second. RIPSTER tracked the pace from the inside at an even pace throughout and needed more in
the stretch. DARYLS TRUMP CARD stalked the pace while three wide, then menaced on the turn in attempt to gain the lead, lacked the winning bid and
gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
CREAM PUFF REAPER veered outwardly and hindered rival, then tracked the pace from the inside into the turn, switched leads in the early stretch to edge
clear and prevail under strong drive. SARAH P tracked the pace while two wide and in second position into the turn, then rallied in the stretch, cleared the
pace setter but was out finished by an inner rival and held onto the place prize. HIGH CALIBER CATCH was impeded at the start, then saved ground, came
out four to five wide leaving the turn and was improving in the late stretch. EARLY SPRING broke inward at the start, then set the pace from the inside,
cleared the turn then faltered in the late stretch. TAPITSGOTAPISTOL drifted inward shortly after the start, then chased the pace while two wide and in a
strong drive, then rallied leaving the bend but it was not enough in the end. THREAD OF GOLD broke outwardly, then was squeezed back at the start,
trailed behind the field, then rallied too little too late in the stretch and came up empty. DOC'S BUD was hindered at the start, then chased the pace from the
inside, was in a steady drive on the turn then bid in the late stretch and came up flat in the end. RUBY SOHO chased the pace while three wide, then urged
eagerly on the turn, came out five wide in the upper stretch to make a brief bid before giving way in the end. FREE DROP GYPSY was out run and no
factor.

Footnotes
GANGSTER RAP was hindered at the start, then reserved ground in the early furlongs, circled six side leaving the far turn, then found the best stride in the
late stretch to be up in time to prove best. MISTY CAT was forwardly placed in the two path heading into the first turn, then set the pace down the
backstretch, was in a long drive entering the home stretch then was caught at the wire. BETYAR AZETS pressed the pace from the three path down the
backstretch, remained in close on the far turn under a strong drive, then rallied in the stretch but could not catch the leader and missed the place prize in the
end. HASHTAG WINNER tracked the pace two to three wide in the early stages, then bid gamely leaving the far turn and kept on down the lane but it was to
no avail. SIMPLE PLEASURE tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, then bid in the upper stretch and came up evenly.
MAYAPRETTY was allowed to settle along the inside and was no menace. DANZIG UP A STORM led the way into the first turn, then pressed the pace
down the backstretch and into the far turn, was in a hard drive then flattened out in the late stretch.

TAKE ACTION was off well to lead the way down the backstretch and into the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was ridden out to the wire confidently.
BLOCKED stalked the pace while two wide, then rallied on the turn and into the stretch in attempt to catch the cleared leader, was unsuccessful and held
place in the end. GRAZEN BOY was allowed to settle along the inside, then bore out seven to eight wide leaving the turn and was best for the show prize in
the end. KELL'S BELLS stalked the pace from the inside then menaced on the turn before giving way in the stretch. EYE OF THE PANTHOR stumbled at
the start, then trailed throughout and was no factor. BAFFIN'S BEST SHOT raced in the middle of the pack from the inside, then pulled up after the turn and
walked off. There was an INQUIRY following the race. After review no change was made.

Footnotes
TEAM GORMLEY pressed the leader while two wide into the turn, was in an all out drive heading into the stretch, found more and was able to get up in time
to prevail. BABY OF THE FAMILY showed the way from the inside into the turn while being pressed by an outer rival, was in the clear in the upper stretch
then was out finished by said rival in the end and was second best. UP UP AND AWAY raced three to four wide towards the back, was in a lax hand ride
throughout the turn, then rallied in the early stretch, lacked the winning bid and was best for the show prize. ALL MIGHT was unhurried early, then angled
along the rail leaving the turn to bid mildly in the stretch and came up empty. MOVEN VAN chased the pace from the two path, rallied gamely on the turn
then flattened out in the stretch. XANDER S chased the pace from the inside and was flat throughout and needed rally in the end. DOC HENRY RIDGE was
out run and no threat. TOO INTIMIDATING chased the pace while two to three wide, then bid briefly on the turn before fading in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHE SPEAKS was floated outwardly and bumped rival, then dueled with an outer rival into the turn, gained command at the quarter pole and lasted to the
wire under a strong drive. CROSS CLAIM chased the pace while two wide and while in a steady drive, then dug in leaving the turn and was gaining in the
deep stretch and hung in the end. BLING IT TO ME was hindered by an inner rival at the start, urged steadily at the back of the field while two wide, then
shifted out to the four path in the early stretch and closed willingly. PHUNK drifted outward at the start, then dueled from the inside into the turn while in a
mild drive and lacked the winning bid in the stretch. THE NEXT BIG BLING was allowed to settle along the inside, raced at an even pace throughout the turn
then bid in the late stretch but it was not enough to make a difference in the end. FAST TRACK stalked the pace from the two path, then saved ground on
the turn before bidding in the early stretch but it was to no avail in the end. BLING ON THE LIGHT broke outwardly then bumped rival, chased the pace from
the inside into the turn, then rallied mildly in the lane and came up empty. KAUSE I'M DEVINE hopped then bumped rival at the start, was unhurried early,
then rallied too little too late in the stretch. TEXAS STAR was bumped at the start, then stalked the pace from the inside, rallied while three wide leaving the
bend and into the early stretch then gave way in the end. SHINING EXAMPLE raced at the back while three wide, then bid from the inside and was no
threat.
