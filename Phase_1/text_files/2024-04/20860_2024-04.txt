TRUTH AND HONESTY raced in range four wide, steadily gained through the lane and was up late. SOUPER SUNSHINE was reluctant to load, pressed
the pace two wide down the backstretch, dueled inside around the turn and through the stretch and just missed in a game try. GABAGOOL prompted the
pace three wide, inherited a share of the midway around the turn, dueled on a short lead from there to deep stretch and was narrowly outifnished between
the top two finishers. SUENO PROFUNDO (ARG) saved ground in range, angled out in the stretch and was one-paced through the final furlong. MODERN
LANE trailed in the two path, made some progress inside in upper stretch, angled four wide leaving the sixteenth pole and had a slight gain. SERGEANT
SINATRA saved ground off the pace, steadied midway around the turn, swung five wide near the quarter pole and was no threat. MIDNIGHT CHAOS failed
to menace while racing three wide. GRAN ROQUE set the early pace along the rail, was pulled up around the turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
GRIMES stalked in the two path, tipped out to the three path and was cued passing the three-eighths, bid in the four path at the top of the lane, and drew
past the inner pacesetter around the sixteenth. NICHIREN pressed an outer foe from the three path, waited along the rail rounding the turn, was coaxed into
the stretch, and ran on for place. LUNAR ROCKET bumped with an inner foe early, tracked in the five path, was coaxed along in the four path around the
turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and kept on for show. RICHY set the pace in the four path, merged into the two path under a nudge going into
the turn, was roused into the stretch, but hung on his left lead, and evened out between foes around the sixteenth. IMMORTALIZATION bumped with foes
on both sides early, chased in the two path, was cued passing the three-eighths, swung from the five path into the stretch, and made no impact. WINE
EMPIRE bumped between foes and had to check early, raced off the pace in the three path and never threatened. THE CONNECTOR got bumped by an
outer foe while along the rail and had to check early, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FIELD OF BLOSSOMS settled off the early pace, advanced two wide around the turn, seized command leaving the three-eighths marker and drew off under
a drive. HOLY KINGDOM raced off the pace four wide, was no match for the winner but ran on to gain the place late. LADY MONIQUE saved ground off the
pace, was hustled along down the backstretch and around the turn, tipped two wide near the quarter pole and was outfinished for the place. LOLA LOCA
saved ground and failed to menace. SPREAD THE RISK played no factor while racing three wide. FOR THE THRILL set a clear pace along the rail, was
collared by the winner leaving the three-eighths pole and retreated inside. REVOLU chased the pace two wide and was through after a half. MISS
ATHLETIC stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner midway around the turn but retreated soon after.

Footnotes
HARRINGTON tracked in the three path, was coaxed through an opening along the rail to take the lead passing the three-eighths, and drew clear from the
three path down the lane. CANDY STREET stalked in the four path, was cued while three wide midway around the far turn, and chased on from the five
path in the stretch for place. SHAKE YOUR BONES laid in midpack in the five path, was driven in the four path around the far turn, and finished evenly for
show. GO GO GE trailed in the five path and made no impact from the seven path in the stretch. BELLY OF JELLY chased in the four path but did not
threaten. NOBLE WAVE rated in the two path but never menaced. DRUM AND DRUMMER set the pace in the three path but faded from the two path
turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
CATHOLIKA settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up late. STRIFE raced in range
three wide around the first turn, bid three deep down the backstretch, dueled two wide around the far turn, put away the pace rival near the sixteenth pole
but could not withstand the winner late. ON MOONLIGHT BAY pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths marker, dueled inside
around the far turn and through much of the stretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. CHARDAN saved ground in range but was one-paced in the lane.
ROGERS PARK set the pace along the rail, was collared nearing the far turn, chased inside around the bend, angled out in upper stretch and faded. C. S.
VIVACE was off slow, was rank early and was outrun while racing two wide. CORONA PRINCESS played no factor while racing three wide.

GENERAL LEDGER chased in the five path, was driven in the three path around the turn, bid turning into the stretch, inched ahead of an outer foe in the
final sixteenth. ETENDRE rated in the six path, ranged up under a ride from the four path to bid passing the quarter, took the lead turning into the lane, and
dug in but got stood up on just after the sixteenth, and was caught by an inner foe late. IMPROPTUDE raced off the pace in the three path, floated out to the
seven path turning into the lane, and finished evenly for show. BIG EFFECT showed the way along the inside, but lost the lead near the quarter, tipped out
to the six path passing the eighth pole, and faded. PURE CLASS trailed in the two path and never threatened. SQUINTS stalked in the three path but
backed up around the turn. THE MONOPOLY MAN tracked in the five path, floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and came up empty.

GRANDMA'S PUDDING set the pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. QUEEN DEYMAR came in and bumped at the start, raced off the pace
three wide, advanced in the three path around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and could only the narrow the gap on the winner. BULLET
VALENTINA had early speed, rated back three wide, went four wide around the far turn and rallied outside. R AWESOME SAUCE was squeezed back at
the start, saved ground off the pace and passed tiring rivals. BRACCESCA was bumped between foes at the start, raced three and four wide and never
threatened. ANONYMOUS SOURCE chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. FUNTASTICA hesitated at the start and was never in contention
while racing in the two path around the first turn and four wide around the far turn. BONNIE SANDRA broke outwardly and bumped at the start, advanced
four wide around the first turn, chased two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane.

the three-eighths, was driven between foes from the four path at the top of the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. AJAAYB broke out and bumped an
outer foe, tracked in the three path, ranged up to bid passing the quarter, swung from the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. BLACK FURY set
the pace in the two path, lost the lead along the inside passing the three-eights, dug in gamely while hanging on his left lead from the two path in upper
stretch, but flattened late to show. MISSOURI RIVER chased in the six path, was driven in the four path around the turn, but made no impact from the eight
path in the stretch. HOURS IN A DAY prompted the pace in the four path but backed up in the two path around the turn. DANCINGINTHESTORM hit the
inner part of the gate at the start, trailed in the four path and never threatened. D HOPPER got pinched at the start, then had to steady early, raced wellback

Footnotes
SAINT IN THE CITY tracked in the four path, came under a ride going into the far turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and kicked past
the inner pacesetter in the closing stages. CAP'N DUSTY laid in midpack in the two path, was coaxed from the rail midway around the turn, and ran on up
the inside for place. IL SICILIANO had a slow start and trailed in the two path, was coaxed from the rail midway around the far turn, and rallied from the two
path down the lane to get up for show. DITHER set the pace in the two path, was cued midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of
the stretch, and stayed on, but was caught on both sides late. ONE BITE rated in the three path but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. BIVOL
chased in the five path, was ridden between foes from the three path around the far turn, but did not factor in the seven path down the lane. CALYPSO
CHARLIE stalked in the three path, bid passing the quarter, but faded in the four path down the lane. FIGHT TIL DAWN raced off the pace in the five path
but never threatened. CUCUY had a slow start, drifted out to the seven path early into the first turn, raced wellback in the six path and never menaced.
