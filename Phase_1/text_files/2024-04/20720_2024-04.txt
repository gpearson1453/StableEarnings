Footnotes
KRYSTALHEIR bumped with a rival at the start, angled to the outside early, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked near the seven-sixteenths pole,
gained in the four path to make a bid near the five-sixteenths, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, was asked for her best into upper stretch, battled
outside of the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. TEN TEN prompted the pace on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch,
vied in the three path for most of the turn then dropped to the two path, passed the five-sixteenths pole between horses and on even terms for the lead,
fought on with the winner in the stretch and missed while well clear for the place. KHALI'S STORM leapt marks on the tracks nearing the seven-eighths
pole, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while inside on the turn, failed to have the acceleration needed to come up inside the leader near
the five-sixteenths, shifted two then three wide late on the bend, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. JINGLE
JANGLE stumbled badly at the start and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn and failed to respond. TERESA
angled out near the seven-eighths pole, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and also failed to respond. OUR REWARD moved
in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside of an opponent, was asked under threat in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage at the
five-sixteenths then dropped to the inside and faded.

Footnotes
CINDERELLA'S CAUSE was rated just off the pace on the outside, gained to make a bid in the five path on the turn, took the lead just before the
five-sixteenths pole, shook clear into upper stretch, drew away under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. PRETTI
XTREME settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch under a
drive then moved a bit further out and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. HALO CITY prompted the pace on the outside of the leader,
passed the half-mile pole on even terms for the lead, vied three wide between horses on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired while able to get
the show. TONED UP was coaxed to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival, was urged along late on the backstretch, vied along the rail on the
turn, lost the lead with three furlongs to run, dropped into the stretch and also tired then just missed the show. MY FIRST LOVE stalked the pace on the
outside, vied in the four path under urging while between foes on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths pole, came five wide into the stretch then
moved a bit further out, remained on her inside lead in the drive and weakened. WHISTLER'S STYLE was slowest into stride, settled at the rear, moved
closer near the five-eighths pole, drafted inside on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, shifted to the two path into the stretch, dropped back to the
rail near the three-sixteenths then chased the leader, steadied for several strides while in tight quarters along the rail starting at the furlong marker, moved
out late and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
KHOZY COLBY coaxed from the gate, dueled early on from the two path with KAZ' ROSE to her inside, took over command near the half mile pole and
steadily shook away through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away to the eighth
pole, dug in and held well to prevail. SPEIGHTS DANCE coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide
into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to the finish to secure the place honors. YOU'RE FOREVER coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing
from three furlongs out, tipped four wide at the head of the stretch, weakened in the late stages. ALLEY'S SONG broke in at the start, chased just off the
inside and then along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path straightened away and
improved position through the final furlong. TAVIN coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide at
the top of the stretch, offered no response. MISS BOURBON four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, weakened. KAZ' ROSE dueled inside of KHOZY COLBY down the backstretch until headed half a mile from home, steadily got shaken off through
the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths and faded, swung three wide at the quarter pole, tired in the stretch.

final furlong and closed well to get up late and prevail. NEWSDLEY moved in while hustled to the front, contested the pace on the outside then in the two
path on the turn, moved clear inside the five-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while just able to get the place. FOXY
CARA dropped back early then was urged along at the rear, rounded the turn in the four path, came out nine wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the
final furlong, drifted in while gaining fast late and finished well to just miss the place while clear for the show. EASY PLAY dropped back then was coaxed
along off the pace, went around the turn in the four path, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MOULY steadied briefly
when having his path taken by the outside foe early, was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also lacked
the needed response. MERAVIGLIOSO was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn and failed to rally. GHOSTBUSTIN was hustled
from the gate, showed speed on the inside of foes then dropped back near the half-mile pole, moved out leaving the backstretch, chased in the three path
on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. CHASING DAYLIGHT was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of a
rival, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and faded.

caught by a pair of rivals in the final strides to the finish. KITTEN'S APPEAL chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and closed well to just miss for the show honors on the
