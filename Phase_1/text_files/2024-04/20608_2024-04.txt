Footnotes
HUNTERS GHOST prompted the pace set by CRANKSHAFT while racing two-wide, took the lead entering the stretch and quickly drew clear. TONYS
MORNING LINE saved ground while being forwardly placed early, angled out to be three-wise leaving the quarter pole and closed well. MON AMI FUZZIE
was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, angled out during the drive and finish in a mild rally. MAC PANDOWDY saved ground while being unhurried,
moved up nearing the stretch while angled out to be two-wide and then went evenly late. MKAR THE FAST drooped back early, came five-wide into the
stretch and improved his position late/. DYNABLUE settled in the middle of the field early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. IRISH
DECLARATION dropped back early and was not a factor. CRANKSHAFT saved ground setting the pressured pace to near the stretch and gave way readily
when headed.

Footnotes
HAWAIIAN HIDE AWAY saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased his advantage. MONEY AGENT saved ground early while being forwardly
placed, came two-wide into the stretch, was brushed by SOLOMON VANDY nearing the eighth pole then came out into that one and finished well for
second in a steady effort. SOLOMON VANDY was reserved off the early pace then rallied four-wide into the stretch, came in nearing the eighth pole
brushing with MONEY AGENT then was carried out by that one late and finished willingly for the show. SHARPENYOURFAITH chased HAWAIIAN HIDE
AWAY from along the outside, was three-wide entering the stretch, steadied briefly nearing the eighth pole while in tight and weakened late. BROADWAY
RED was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. BUBBY BOY was shuffled back early then dropped further back
while saving ground and failed to threaten. ICE VORTEX was prominent early while racing three-wide and tired after six furlongs. THE RIDER OF
SHARPENYOURFAITH LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST SOLOMON VANDY AND THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
ACTIONS OF MONEY AGENT BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS FOUND INSUFFECIENT INTERFERNCE AND MADE NOI CHANGE IN THE ORDER
OF FINISH.

ELECTRIC CHARGE was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch, caught EUCLID AVENUE to take the lead nearing the eighth pole and
prevailed under strong handling. EUCLID AVENUE set the pace racing removed from the rail, drifted out leaving the quarter pole, responded when headed
and continued on gamely to the wire. MYSTIC POWER saved ground chasing EUCLID AVENUE, slipped through during the drive and finished well for third
in a steady effort. ICE AXE dropped back early, rallied two-wide into the stretch to off a bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out late. FIRE WIRE
was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. POND settled in the middle of the field while racing
three-wide and weakened during the drive.

Footnotes
MCVICKER saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased his advantage. GRAPHENE CASSOCK prompted the issue while racing two-wide,
could not reach the winner but held on well for the place. CROWN ROYAL KID broke out to bump with MINNESOTA MOON, then saved ground chasing the
pace but lacked a rally. MINNESOTA MOON was bumped from both sides at the start then reserved off the pace, came two-wide into the stretch and went
evenly late. DASTARDLY DEEDS was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and weakened. MASQUERADE BALL was fractious during
the loading then dropped back and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOOD APPLE vied with WILWOOD RUBEN for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off then responded when challenged by CLYDE'S GREEN
GO nearing the eighth pole and proved best under strong handling. CLYDE'S GREEN GO stalked the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter
then continued on to offer a bold bid at the eighth pole but was unable to stay with the winner late in a game effort. WILDWOOD RUBEN broke out then
moved up to vie for the lead while racing two-wide to the stretch and held on fairly well for third. RHODIUMS PRIDE was reserved off the early pace, came
four-wide into the stretch and went evenly. DEMAND RANSOM saved ground while being allowed to settle early but lacked a rally when called upon.
TRUIST was unhurried while racing two-wide and failed to seriously threaten. J J'S SOLUTION dropped back and failed to menace.

stretch and failed to seriously threaten. JET FLIGHT drifted out on the first turn, then was forwardly placed early and weakened. SIMPLE LOGIC was
allowed to settle while saving ground, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then faltered during the drive. ANCIENT MAN saved ground
early, angled out to come five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ICONICUS was prominent early while racing three-wide and tired. MOVE IN
