Footnotes
WORKING HOLIDAY pressed the pace to the head of the stretch, took command in upper stretch and pulled away through the lane. OH ATLANTA
unhurried early to be the tracking trailer, saved ground and rallied willingly up the fence in the stretch to gain the place. SISTER CODE stalked the pace
from three wide early, took the lead midway on the turn, surrendered the lead in upper stretch and tired through the drive. LUNA PRIMAVERA flashed early
speed to be on the early lead in a three way duel, lost position on the turn dropping back, drifted wide turning for home and surged late to be re-rallying in
the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS FUSSY PANTS well rated on a comfortable lead, responded when called upon turning for home to widen the advantage and held well under mild late
urging. MAMBO KITTEN reserved off the pace in the early going, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the lane while steadily advancing to be
second best. SKY stalked the pace from between rivals to the turn, dropped back on the bend losing position and showed late interest to be along for the
show. CAGUA pressed the pace from two wide between rivals to the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. CHARGINA tracked the pace from four wide
into the turn, mounted a rally to threaten at the quarter pole and flattened out coming home. DIVINE MARTHA reared at the start giving the field six lengths,
rushed up to contention down the backside and tired tuning for home having lost all chance at the start. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO
THE START AND UPON REVIEW DECLARED THAT DIVINE MARTHA HAD A FAIR START.

Footnotes
SURF AND TURF hustled early to gain position, settled in hand down the backside, made up ground steadily to mid-stretch and surged nearing the wire
finding best stride late to prevail. AMIGO'S AFFAIR pressed the pace from two wide into the turn, took command midway on the bend, opened a clear
advantage in upper stretch and weakened late in the lane. SUDDENLY SEDUCTIVE reserved off the pace to be near the rear of the field turning for home
while mounting a six wide rally and was gaining late in the stretch. UNCLE EARL set a pressured pace to midway on the turn, was overtaken on the bend
and kept on willingly. LOCK ON went evenly without posing a threat. PARKER broke inward from the gate to be a step slow and was never a factor from
there. UHAVETOBEKITTENME stalked the pace to the turn, mounted a three wide rally to be prominent and flattened out in the stretch.

BLUE NOMORE broke outward leaving the gate, bumping rival, raced forward to prompt the early pace through the first turn, took command nearing the half
mile pole, opened a clear lead turning for home and widened in the stretch unchallenged as much best. EL SORDO in tight at the start when leaned on by
LIAM'S ROCKET MAN, dropped back to trail for a half, split rivals into the final turn while commencing his rally, saved ground cutting the corner at the top of
the lane and finished willingly to be second best. TEMPERED DREAM bumped at the start when crowded by ATLAS FALLS and BLUE NOMORE, settled
into a stalking trip, was put to an early drive on the far turn and responded mildly. LIAM'S ROCKET MAN broke inward to crowd the field leaving the gate,
took the lead through the first turn from two wide, surrendered the pace to the winner down the backside and continued to fade coming home. ATLAS
FALLS broke inward bumping rival leaving the gate, was further crowded by the outside rivals coming in, chased the leaders down the backstretch and
came up empty. THE RIDER OF TEMPERED DREAM CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE GATE, UPON

SWEEPINJUSTICE slow early to be the trailer, commenced a ground saving rally midway on the turn, cut the corner coming home and finished with a
strong close up the fence to be going away late. OOPSIE DOOPSIE set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, shook off the presser in upper stretch but
could not hold off the winner in the lane while clearly second best in a good effort. ENCHANTED MELODY unhurried early to be near the rear of the field
and rallied belatedly to be up for the show. LORDHEARMYPRAYER reserved off the pace to be mid-pack, rallied six wide at the top of the lane and kept-on
grinding down the stretch. RUN RAEGAN RUN well placed to be tracking the leaders and lacked a closing kick. BIG BANG BLUE pressed the pace from
two wide to upper stretch and weakened in the lane. CURIOSITY KILLS broke off balance to be a bit awkward leaving the gate, rushed up to a stalking
position through the turn and gave way.

HONEY BELLA tracked the leaders into the turn, split rivals rallying from four wide to take the lead turning for home, opened a clear lead mid-stretch and
drifted out from the five path to the ten path against right hand urging to herd the runner-up down the lane. LUCKY COUGAR unhurried for the first
three-eighths, rallied six wide late on the bend, closed well from the six path and was held up off heels of the winner while being carried out five paths down
the stretch. SHEISTHEHERO trailed for the first half mile and rallied belatedly in the lane from nine wide to be along for the show. BOX STEP broke wide
leaving the gate, raced up to a stalking position into the turn, made a five wide bid to loom at the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. TRITONE GAL
pressed the pace from three wide to midway on the turn, assumed command nearing the quarter pole and weakened when challenged in upper stretch.
POETIC VERSE showed speed from the fence to lead for three-eighths and came up empty. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE RIDER
OF THE RUNNER-UP CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH BY THE WINNER, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
THE WINNER AND PLACED HER SECOND.

PLANET FROLIC set a well rated pace in hand to the far turn, dueled with rivals on the bend, shook free turning for home and drew away in the lane as
much the best. MOBIL CHIC stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied to loom boldly at the quarter pole and was out-finished down the stretch while holding
the place. LUCKY PENNY ROSE slow early to trail the field, commenced a rally at the quarter pole and made a belated gain through the stretch to just miss
the place. LINE DANCER prompted the pace down the backstretch, made a threatening bid from between horses on the turn and flattened out in the
stretch. WILDCAT DREAM broke wide from the gate, continued to be wide throughout while maiking a mild bid on the far turn and dropped back without
impact.

HOT PRINCESS prompted the early pace from the rail, took control on the turn, opened a clear lead turning for home and drew off in the lane. PRIDE AND
ATTITUDE trailed to the turn while unhurried, saved ground while making a steady advance on the bend and finished well to be second best. SPUNKY ONE
stalked the pace from four wide throughout and failed to gain ground finishing evenly. WILD MARIAH dueled on the pace early and steadily faded coming
home. MOST ADORABLE went evenly without impact. VAMONOS PIACENTE contended for the first three-eighths and dropped back as a non-factor.
