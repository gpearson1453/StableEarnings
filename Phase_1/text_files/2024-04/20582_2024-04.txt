Footnotes
HARD SPUN FANTASY in the second flight up the backstretch while between horses, asked along into the lane when moving slightly closer, continued up
steady handling past the furlong, willingly to the end, narrowly best between horses. SAFE BET bumped just after the start, in the second group outside the
winner, came four wide for the drive to lose some ground, rallied while reaming widest to the wire, too late. KEENEYES bumped at the start, recovered to
narrowly set the early pace, fell back in upper stretch, moved out, coming again late. SKY MASTER vied up front in the run up the backstretch between
foes, dueled out of the turn, clear approaching the furlong grounds, moved to the rail, faltered late. TAKE MY ALLOWANCE in the second flight inside, faded
down the stretch. TRABR'S CREED moved up to vie outside, four wide when contesting the pace through the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
EXPRESS CRUISER with the pace from the start, slightly larger advantage into the turn, headed entering the stretch, regained, kicked clear, enough left to
last. MR. BUTCH back off the pace, floated out five wide exiting the turn when beginning to advance, lugged in then steadied a bit in some traffic a furlong
out, was righted, rallied, split foes then was getting to the winner late. HONEST OPINION bobbled at the start to be off slowly, raced back, steered out three
wide late in the turn, also was going well late with a rally. CHROME CANDY broke on top, vied up front three wide then began to gradually weaken entering
the stretch. LEAD FOOT back off the lead pack while out in the strip, three to four wide turning into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. DANCIN ROCKET
with the pace while between rivals early, dueled outside the winner through the turn, put a head in front between calls in upper stretch, gave way the final
furlong. BLESSED VISION closest to the first flight for a half along the inside, had little left for the stretch run. COACH SAM P fell back after the start, void of
speed for a half, dropped inside late turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals up the rail. GOD'S GIFT TO US in mid pack for a half along the inside, tired.
COAL STONE made little impact while off the inside, faded. PAINTED SUNDAY remained always back, stopped, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
BACKYARD MONEY with the early pace outside, vied four wide turn, shook clear nearing the furlong grounds, held the runner up comfortably safe under
steady handling. I'M THE BOSS OF ME vied up front for a half between horses and inside the winner, fell back off that one through upper stretch, trying to
get back to that same rival late. LOVER GIRL off a step slow, three to four wide into the lane, roused, rallied down the middle of the strip to be well clear of
the others and closing the gap on the top two late. BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO broke on top, set the pace for a half in the two path, weakened in the drive.
OFF RAMP went one paced while racing of the inside. CHANDANA lacked speed while racing outside, four to five wide turning for home, lacked a closing
kick. LET'S BE CLEAR failed to menace while racing inside.

Footnotes
AIR COMBAT moved closer in the two path late in the backstretch, dropped to the rail while moving to take command early turn under clever handling, drew
out through the lane under steady handling. THREEFIFTYSEVEN in mid pack early while along the inside, followed the winner into the stretch while
reaming inside, shifted out a bit, no match, held sway for the place. AFTER FIVE back off the early pace toward the inside, angled out to be four wide for the
drive, staged a mild rally to be slowly getting to the runner up, also not a threat to the winner. SANTA CRUISER broke back, raced three to five wide through
the turn, staged a modest, belated rally down the middle of the strip. LIGHTNING STRUCK back off the pace toward the rail, improved position slightly
without posing a serious threat. DRIFTER last away, continued to lack speed for a half, picked off a few tiring rivals while never a threat. IAN GLASS floated
out just after the start by the early leader, prompted the issue four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, tired through the stretch. GOLDEN LUNA bobbled
then broke out, set or forced the pace toward but not on the inside, gave way. GOOD SCOUT briefly forward in the run up the backstretch while widest,
began to back up before a half.

Footnotes
PREDICTING behind the pace along the inside in the run up the backstretch, in some traffic early turn, moved out for room late in the bend, came in the two
path for the drive, challenged inside the leader with less than a furlong remaining, edged clear late under steady handling. BENT HALO broke forwardly,
angled in a bit to bother a couple of inner rivals, advanced and took over three wide turning for home, drifted slightly, briefly responded and raced on equal
terms with the winner outside that one then could not match strides. SKY RAVEN prompted the issue up front in the two, remained forward into the lane,
chased the top two past the furlong marker, saved the show. SHEZA SHENANIGAN in mid pack off the inside, three to four wide turn, displayed a mild
amount of late interest to better her position. COSMIC CHIC turned in an even effort while racing toward the inside. CHUCK WILLS WIDOW broke back,
three wide into and through the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. BRIEF NOTE in mid pack and well out in the strip, four to five wide
out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. AMOUREUX last to leave then was bothered with some outside pressure, made little impact. KOKOMO STARLET
moved up after the start to show the way up the backstretch and through the turn, gave way when headed by the runner up into the stretch. MAREBELL
raced in mid pack after the start, was finished before a half. I BE GONE bothered just after the start, raced near the back, got out early turn, remained back
to be always outrun. SOUTHERN SPEIGHT also remained always back.

Footnotes
TANYA SHOWERS outrun early, began to advance midway on the turn while steering outside, engaged the lead pack four wide turning for home, gained
the advantage and drove clear. OUR KEEPSAKE behind the pace inside, in a bit tight along the rail late in the turn, slipped through into the lane, exchanged
bumps with the early leader when straightened for home, clearly second best, no match for the winner. BEST CUPCAKE in mid pack off the inside, three
wide through most of the turn, tipped out a bit for the drive, along for the show, no threat to the top pair. SPIN THE BREEZE fell back to trail after the start,
came three wide for three wide, displayed some mild late interest to improve position. BELLA HAZE chased the early leader three wide, closer between foes
late turn, brief bit, weakened. MOTOWN DYNAMIC broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch off the inside, continued to set the pace turn, was
beginning to tire when she exchanged bumps with the runner up, continued to weaken. HAPPY N SMILING off a step slow, remained always back.

Footnotes
TWITTY CITY never far back off the inside, stalked in the run up the backstretch while remaining in the three path, moved to challenge second turn, dueled
into the lane, steadily drew clear under pressure. EGO lacked any early foot after moved out three wide first turn, continued back, steered four wide out of
the final turn, rallied willingly to be up for the place,. CHELSEA DAGGER settled off the pace and the inside, came three wide for the drive when advancing,
continued to close the gap on the winner nearing the furlong marker, stalled soon after, caught for the runner up spot. ABSOLUTE COURAGE pressed the
early leader from the inside, dueled up the backstretch, put that rival away as the winner came calling second turn, dueled inside that one into the stretch,
proved no match to the wire, weakened to lose a couple of spots late. CALIFORNIA SWING off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack and along the
inside, swung four wide turning for home, lacked a closing punch. DEEP STATE four wide into the first turn, angled in to save ground, two path through the
second bend, improved position while never really dangerous. CHISHOLM TRAIL raced one pace in the two path, had little for the drive. GEORGIA
DEPUTY in the main body in the first turn, shuffled back a bit from between foes late in that bend, remained back. JIM AND JIM broke in the air, trailed
much of the way before picking off a couple of faltering foes. VIOLENT GIGI forwardly placed in the early going, backed up through the stretch. ROSIE'S
BOY in mid pack off the inside, four wide through the final turn, gave way. DEVOTED TO YOU set or forced the pace off the inside for five furlongs, stopped
suddenly far turn, distanced after losing contact with the field stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
BLUELIGHTSPECIAL moved off the inside first turn when forwardly placed, pressed the leader up the backstretch in the three path, moved to challenge in
the two path second bend, briefly dueled into the stretch then kicked clear under pressed. FROSTY O TOOLE last to leave, void of speed off rail, behind
traffic late backstretch into the far turn, steered out five wide turning for home, rallied late to be in time for the place. INTO DISCO settled off the pace in the
two path, improved into the lane, outfinished for the place while between horses at the wire. STELLAR LILY away best of all, set the pace just off the inside,
firmly restrained while a bit keen up the backstretch, responded briefly to race on equal terms with the winner into the stretch then began to weaken.
CORNINGSTONE within striking distance, four wide when still in a position to challenge far turn, had little left for the drive. BOW DRAW back off the pace,
five wide far turn, four wide into the lane, tired through the stretch. WINDY BAY saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BLUE EMBER took command in the two path while setting a lively opening quarter, slowed things down up front under restraint the middle half mile, well
clear into the stretch, kept to task until geared down late. MELANIA T in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the final bend, rallied to be clearly
second best, not a threat to the winner. PNEUMA four wide into the first turn when off the pace, crept closer after a half, went evenly through the lane to
finish best of the rest. ADAMANTLY off a step slow, raced well back early as a result, moved out in the two path around a tiring rival in the second bend,
continued to improve position with some mild intrerest. ARDEN AR in some traffic into the first turn, moved out, five wide through much of the second turn,
moved a bit closer then flattened out through the lane to finish up evenly. HONDURAS PASSION chased the the winner off the inside, dropped inside
second weakened in the drive. SOPHIE'S STAR void of speed, made little impact off the rail. GRACEFUL MOON behind some traffic into the first turn,
failed to menace while just off the inside. WHO LU forwardly placed for six furlongs, gave way in the drive. JONESBOROHURRICANE steadied into the first
turn when in a bit tight, remained forward then began a steady retreat after a half. TEXAS SEQUOIA five to four wide through both turns, remained back.
DR. WOODS MIRACLE in mid pack outside, stopped far turn, jogged in well beaten.
