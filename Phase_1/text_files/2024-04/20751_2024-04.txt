Footnotes
KEEPYOURPRANCEON broke out at the start, settled three wide in the middle of the back down the backstretch, advanced under a drive into contention
still wide on the turn, bid for the lead four wide at the top of the stretch with two rivals to the inside, took command with a furlong to run and drew off.
SIMPLY GRACIOUS was floated out at the break but still came away well, tracked behind DREWY to the turn, moved to challenge approaching the quarter
pole took a short lead in upper stretch but could not match strides with the winner in the late stages. DREWY broke a step slow but rushed up to clear the
field, came under pressure from KEEPYOURPRANCEON and SIMPLY GRACIOUS near the quarter pole, held to mid-stretch then tired. GALWAY SHAWL
was bothered at the start by LUNA LINDA, outrun early, went into a drive from the three furlong pole, three wide into the stretch and lacked a late response.
LUNA LINDA broke inward at the start and put GALWAY SHAWL in a bit tight, was up close to the leaders to the turn while saving ground, came under a
ride passing the three furlong marker, was still in the mix at the top of the stretch but flattened out. DADDY'S HONEY lacked early speed, trailed the field
early in tandem with GALWAY SHAWL to the outside, was asked to go on from the three furlong marker but had no response.

Footnotes
DEO broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the pace two wide into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, roused
two wide into the far turn and took command at the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead into the stretch, felt a bit of late pressure from the oncoming runner-up
and kept to task into the final sixteenth to hold safely for the win. HYDRO FROST settled just off of the early pace, saved ground into the first turn, was well
placed through the backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the second turn, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed willingly in the final
sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and outfinished ACCLIDER to earn place honors. ACCLIDER tracked the early pace two to three wide
along the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker then was outkicked into the stretch,
chased the winner into the final furlong, was outfinished for second and was well clear in the end for third. MR. FIGHTER was crowded a bit by a
neighboring rival and was a bit keen in the early running, settled into the first turn and maintained a ground saving position into the backstretch run, guided
two wide into the second turn, offered a mild rally in the stretch but could not threaten the leaders in the final sixteenth. LIGHT THE BEAM settled off of the
decent early pace, saved ground into the far turn and did not factor. RIGHT HAND RYDER sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions through the
backstretch run, led into the far turn then was overtaken approaching the quarter marker, took an awkward step nearing the top of the stretch, was not
persevered with through the final furlong and faded.

Footnotes
VANDALIA got away well and took up a stalking position to the outside of LYINATTHEBAR while under a tight hold, kept relentless pressure on that foe to
the far turn, took command when let loose near the quarter pole, opened up in upper stretch still in hand, responded when set down and won well. OAT
MILK LATTE took a light bump from HAPPY IS after the break then got in a little tight going into the first turn as the field bunched up, raced at the back of
the very compact field down the backstretch while stuck behind horses, continued that way through the turn then found a seam in upper stretch, then rallied
under strong handling to gain second. HAPPY IS broke outward at the start and made some contact with OAT MILK LATTE, tracked inside and was pinned
there owing to the slow pace, tipped out to the two path for the stretch run but was outkicked for second. RHONDA'S COOKIN stalked three wide early,
tracked the moderate pace outside of runners nearing the half-mile marker, loomed three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, went widest into the
stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and gave way. LYINATTHEBAR hustled away from the gate at the start and won the race to the turn, then
set a modest pace with VANDALIA stalking to the outside, began to weaken leaving the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
MR. MENDELSSOHN was crowded at the start and broke a step slowly leaving the gate, was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, tracked
the decent pace while saving ground through the backstretch run, angled three wide at the quarter marker and loomed into upper stretch, battled with
ENJOY THE MOMENT heading to the furlong pole, shook free into the final sixteenth and drew clear to prevail at the finish. ENJOY THE MOMENT was
forwardly placed away from the start and went two to three wide into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run and was well placed at the
quarter marker, was roused four then three wide into the far turn and gained command at the quarter pole, met the bid of MR. MENDELSSOHN in upper
stretch and battled that one to the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and just held for second at the finish. SARK
was sent to the early lead, disputed decent fractions with TAVERNELLE heading to the half-mile marker, lost the lead into the second turn and chased to
the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the stretch, weakened in the drive but stayed on into the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while holding
clearly for third. WINGBACK settled just off of the early pace and went two to three wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch
run, was well placed into the second turn and chased two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, shifted four wide into the stretch, was outkicked at the
furlong marker and did not offer a late response. FINCAIRN unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the first turn, improved position along the
backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the second turn, could not muster the needed response in the stretch drive and passed tiring rivals late.
DONTIM rated off of the early pace, was hard to place along the first turn and lugged out approaching the run onto the backstretch, was unhurried heading
to the half-mile marker and did not threaten in the stretch drive. TAVERNELLE hustled to be forwardly placed away from the start, contested the decent
early pace two to three wide into the backstretch run, disputed decent fractions heading to the half-mile marker, vied for the lead two wide into the far turn,
could not keep pace into upper stretch and tired in the drive. DRINKS AT THE CLUB paused at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed and trailed
into the first turn, raced well behind the others heading into the far turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
HALO RANDO forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the solid early pace from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed into the turn
and stalked the leading pair approaching the quarter pole, tipped two wide into upper stretch and was asked for run nearing the furlong marker, vied for the
lead at mid-stretch then took command into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. MELANIE'S
TIGER allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position into the turn and raced two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide into
upper stretch and advanced at the furlong pole, rallied into the final sixteenth and pressured HALO RANDO in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in
the late stages and was clear of the rest for second. VALIANT SON tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, was guided two to three wide into the
turn and chased to the quarter pole, shifted four wide into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and
finished evenly, while getting up in time to secure show honors. AUTISM PUZZLE showed good early speed, assumed command and set solid fractions to
the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn and set a quick pace heading to the quarter pole, dug in into upper stretch and kept foes at bay
approaching the furlong marker, was overtaken past mid-stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third. CLEVER CLOVER prominent
in the early running, stalked the solid pace two to three wide approaching the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and gave way. DRUM BUNNY took
back off of the solid early pace, tracked from the second flight heading to the half-mile marker, raced outside of rivals into the turn and lost position while
four then three wide nearing the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
HATTIE T was allowed to settle from the break and was near the back of the field through the early stages then advanced steadily down the the backstretch,
started a run with three furlongs to run, deftly navigated a clear path through the turn, came into the stretch three wide, engaged TOUR QUEEN in a spirited
battle to deep stretch, took a short lead in the final yards and held off that stubborn opponent to the wire. TOUR QUEEN was hustled for the lead and
outsprinted a pair of challengers to the turn, took the lead and set solid fractions with a trio of pursuers just behind, responded when asked to go on, leaving
the three behind, then took on a challenge from HATTIE T at the top of the stretch and dueled gamely with that foe to the wire while putting distance on the
rest. HOT BETTY broke well but was not interested in getting involved in the developing pace duel early, tracked inside, loomed at the top of the stretch but
could not go on with the top pair into the final furlong and was clear in the end for third. MARS MAGIC had good speed from the break and vied between
horses into the first turn, entered the backstretch racing just off the flank of TOUR QUEEN and shadowed that foe to the far turn, raced on the left lead
through the stretch and weakened late. LISA'S ANGEL broke through the gate before the start, was a bit keyed up going into the first turn then settled at the
back well behind the rest, made an inside run into the stretch but was never a threat. LADY GOOD TROUBLE went three wide contesting the early pace,
stalked the decent pace three wide into the far turn, was well positioned nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
TESORO close up to the decent early pace, was caught four to five wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and was well
placed at the half-mile marker, chased four to five wide into the far turn and took command into upper stretch, kept to task and held foes at bay at the furlong
marker, responded to firm urging into the final sixteenth and kicked clear to prevail at the finish. AMERICAN FARMER allowed to settle while never far back
in the early running, saved all of the ground into the second turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, could not match
strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held for place honors at the finish. UNION EXPRESS unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the
backstretch run, was steered three to four wide into the second turn and trailed approaching the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch and rallied at
the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and was outfinished by the top two, while holding safely in the end for third.
ANITANEWMERCEDES broke alertly, ceded the early lead to SUPERMAZEL and stalked two to three wide into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch
run and prompted the moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, vied for the lead between runners into the far turn, was outkicked into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. MOTHER'S PRAYER forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the pace three to four wide along the first turn, well placed
into the backstretch run, chased three to four wide into the second turn, lost position into the stretch and gave way. SUPERMAZEL hustled to establish the
early lead, assumed command into the first turn and set a moderate pace into the backstretch run, was pressured into the second turn, overtaken into upper
stretch and tired in the drive.

DRIVER'S ED broke alertly and was hustled to the early lead, set fast fractions while well handled heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the
turn and set a decent pace approaching the quarter pole, held foes at bay into the stretch then was confronted nearing the furlong marker, was kept to task
and dug in while leading into the final sixteenth, was fully extended in deep stretch and lasted at the finish for a determined win. ARTEMUS GORDON
bumped at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the fast early pace while not far back, made a mild gain into the turn and went two to three wide
nearing the quarter pole, made a quick move in upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, was gaining in the final sixteenth but could not get by the
determined winner in deep stretch and just held for second at the finish. HE'S INIT TO WINIT tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, raced five
wide into the turn and chased the quick pace approaching the quarter pole, maintained a five wide path into the lane and gained ground at the furlong
marker, finished well into the final sixteenth and just missed for second at the finish, while just holding for third. BLAZE OF DREAMS unhurried in the early
running, was taken outside of rivals entering the turn and raced five to six wide nearing the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch and was full of run
nearing the furlong pole, closed fast into the final sixteenth and came up just short. AMANOFMYSTATURE chased the solid early pace, kept close
attendance to the quick pace entering the turn, battled for the lead into upper stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and was outkicked. EDDIE
CROSSWIRE chased the fast early pace from the outside, lost ground four wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and could not muster
a late response. CONTINENTAL UNION tracked the solid early pace from the inside, was well placed into the turn and chased the leaders approaching the
quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. BIG DON'S SMILING chased the solid early pace from between runners,
lost position into the turn and chased three wide nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way. MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE was
crowded at the start and was away a step slowly, was allowed to settle while never far back in the early going, raced four wide into the turn, ran evenly to
the furlong pole and tired in the late stages. PER RULING ECM2024-156/ECM FROM CALIFORNIA RACING COMMISION, BLAZE OF DREAMS WAS
DQD FROM 4TH TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

GOLDEN RIVER broke a beat slow, then rushed up to join the early pace battle, backed off approaching the half mile marker while looking to get to the
outside but found the path blocked then stayed to the inside, saved ground through the turn, waited for room while full of run from the quarter pole, bulled
through a narrow opening in upper stretch, knocking GATO DE VEGAS into ROLLIN DICE, then made harder contact approaching the eighth pole, knocking
both of those rivals off-stride, split rivals into the final sixteenth, took command and kicked clear in deep stretch to prevail. ROLLIN DICE broke in at the start
and right into the path of HOT GOBLIN, then was hustled to get forward position, tracked three to four wide in the early running, started to run on from the
three furlong marker, bid four wide into the stretch to challenge for the lead, took two bumps of increasing intensity in short succession from GATO DE
VEGAS, recovered nicely and continued to run on to the finish. UPLIFT lacked early speed and raced four to five wide down the backstretch, launched a
rally from the three furlong pole, went seven wide into the stretch and produced a bold rally down the middle of the track. HOT GOBLIN took up at the break
when ROLLIN DICE came over after the break, spotting the field a head start, was last into the turn, saved ground through the stretch and finish up well
along the rail to the wire. HARTMAN was bothered by GATO DE VEGAS at the start and was off slowly, trailed the field in the early stages, then went into
an early drive from the half mile pole, made some forward progress through the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and continued to run on under steady
handling to the wire. STEVE'S BIG TICKET broke a step slow but hustled into contention up the rail, settled mid-pack through the turn, came under a ride
from the three furlong pole, went four wide into the stretch and finished evenly. GATO DE VEGAS broke outward at the start and caused HARTMAN to have
to take up, but came away running and raced between the trio of horses tracking the dueling early leaders, advanced closer through the turn then bid four
wide at the quarter pole to challenge for the lead, took a bump from GOLDEN RIVER approaching the eighth pole then was knocked off-stride and into
ROLLIN DICE with a successive bump, lost momentum and finished evenly. UNCLE JUAN broke well, pressed MONSIEUR through solid fractions, had the
lead briefly in upper stretch then wilted in the last furlong. MONSIEUR broke sharply, was sent to the lead, set fast fractions under pressure from UNCLE
JUAN to the outside, came under a ride passing the five-sixteenths marker hung on to mid-stretch then faded quickly in the final furlong. SLEWSCION was
outrun after the break, made a brief move into the turn then stopped, was taken in hand and galloped out to the finish. THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE BUMPING INCIDENT NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT #2 GOLDEN
RIVER DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE AND INTERFERED WITH #4 GATO DE VEGAS, WHO IN TURN BOTHERED #7 ROLLIN DICE,
COSTING BOTH OF THOSE RUNNERS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. #2 GOLDEN RIVER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND
PLACED SEVENTH.
