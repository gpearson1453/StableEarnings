began a bid coming around the second turn, entered the stretch in the six path and kicked clear. SHE'S SO SEXY raced in the four path early, pressed the
pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend still in the four path and chased on in the lane. BOLD LOOK raced in the five
path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and kept
on to the wire. PRINCESS GLADYS raced in the three path around the first bend, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the
two path and weakened in the stretch. CAPTIVATING SOUND was away from the gate slowly, saved ground early, trailed the field up the backstretch,
continued around the second turn in the three path and showed no kick. PURE MAGIC GIRL raced in the four path around the first bend, settled in the
