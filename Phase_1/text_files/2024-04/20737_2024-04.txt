Footnotes
HUNTER JOE settled off the rail, circled four wide advancing into the stretch, shifted out a bit and closed outside rivals under left handed asks, took over in
deep stretch and prevailed. NOAH CHANCE edged up behind the leaders nearing the turn then steadied, regrouped then angled out advancing near the
quarter pole, worked his way between foes and challenged a sixteenth out, battled gamely and just nabbed the place. DESTIN'S MISSION broke a step
slow, regrouped and moved up past the half, steadied briefly leaving the far turn, dropped back a bit while saving some ground, came back out in upper
stretch, split rivals inside the furlong grounds, altered back inside and finished well. DOCTOR JEFF prompted the pace three wide outside foes, took closer
order four wide into the lane, engaged the leader then was roused clear past the three sixteenths, kept on under a drive a sixteenth more, failed to withstand
threats and weakened through the final seventy yards. UNCLE DAR lagged back early while saving some ground, came out for the drive and finished with
interest. PHANTOM SMOKE pressed the pace outside PSYCHEDELIC SHACK, failed to kick on under pressure soon into the lane and gave way.
PSYCHEDELIC SHACK sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, ceded command in upper stretch then tired through the final furlong. DUNPHY
edged toward the inside, chased around the turn then weakened through the final quarter mile. #9- UNCLE DAR RAN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY.

ALIFEROUS , rated inside horses into the turn, moved out and worked between rivals leaving the bend, angled to the four path in upper stretch, bid for the
lead outside ENTRUST in mid stretch and held sway in an extended drive. ENTRUST chased the pace in the two path for five and a half furlongs, floated
three wide turning for home, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and finished gamely inside the winner. RASCALLY REBEL , never far back, stayed
along the inner rail, down the backstretch, around the turn and in upper stretch, altered course outside NICKEL NICKEL near the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly. BATTLE OF BASTOGNE worked between horses on the turn, was fanned five deep near the quarter pole and weakened. NICKEL NICKEL
sprinted clear leaving the chute, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, lost the lead in upper stretch, gave way and drifted out near the
sixteenth pole. WONDER WATER raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was no factor. BOCA GUY , wide around the turn, drifted out entering the
stretch and gave way. ONLY CHILD chased the pace three wide, gave way on the turn and faltered.

CHIEF RON edged up inside under some coaxing near the half and gained a stalking spot, was urged along to hold position mid turn, eased out three to
four wide into the lane and set his sights on the dueling leaders, closed in under left handed urging to make it three across with a furlong to go, battled
outside NO EASY DAYS heading to the sixteenth marker then edged away late. NO EASY DAYS vied outside KADRI, gained a slim lead nearing the
quarter pole, exchanged a brush soon into the lane, kept on between rivals in mid stretch, fought inside the winner past the sixteenth marker then gave way
grudgingly. KADRI took over soon after the break, drafted in towards the rail into the turn while taking outside pressure, dueled inside NO EASY DAYS past
the five sixteenths, brushed with that one in upper stretch, stayed on past mid stretch then weakened late. LITTLE SKIPPY stalked outside the winner, was
fanned four wide into the lane and weakened.

SPORTS EDITOR assumed the early lead and moved to the inner rail approaching the first turn, set the pace near rail, opened up in mid stretch and was
kept under urging in the drive. FULMINEO lacked speed inside horses for six furlongs, moved off the rail on the far turn, swung to the four path in upper
stretch and rallied outside. ST. JOHN'S , rated along the inner rail to the stretch, eased out in upper stretch and flattened out. NIGHT OUT bumped with
SHARP TONES approaching the first turn, raced four wide on the far turn, floated out in upper stretch and lacked the necessary rally. ST JAMES THE
GREAT lacked speed, worked between horses the far turn, was behind rivals in upper stretch, angled in and failed to menace. SHARP TONES , rank
behind the winner, bumped with NIGHT OUT approaching the first turn, prompted the pace down the backstretch and on the far turn before giving way.
SAGRADA RAY , no factor, circled the far turn and swung wide in upper stretch. GENERAL'S DUTY , unhurried in the back of the pack, swung to the nine
path in upper stretch and was no factor. HOME SCHOOL lost ground on the turns and gave way. MISSION MAN raced near the inner rail while outrun.

Footnotes
SHERIFF RONNIE was nudged up outside rivals and took over into the first turn, dropped in after clearing leaving the seven eighths, was nicely rated
towards the inside, met an outside challenge from CASTLE ISLAND leaving the far turn, maintained a slim advantage while under a strong ride past the five
sixteenths, wandered outward as the battle continued towards mid stretch, kicked clear near the sixteenth marker then held firm. CASTLE ISLAND , away
alertly, rated back off the winner near the seven eighths, tracked inside through the backstretch run, eased out and went up to engage exiting the far turn,
dueled past the five sixteenths, drifted out while still involved past mid stretch, failed to match strides late then gave way grudgingly. COLLECTION DAY
rated off heels while saving ground into the first turn, raced within range while inside past the five eighths, came under a ride leaving the three eighths,
eased out with pursuit into the stretch but went evenly through the final furlong. UNDER THE RADAR stumbled at the break, regrouped and lagged off the
pace, came under a ride nearing the far turn, shifted in some in the lane but could only muster up a mild response. DESVIO settled in the clear early on,
angled out leaving the far turn and was put to a ride, came out to about the five path into to the stretch but failed to kick on. CHELONIAN , three wide early,
failed to respond. PORCH SWING stalked three wide outside a rival, was under pressure nearing the five sixteenths, angled out to about the six path in
upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
THISNAMEISOKAY rated kindly while stalking the clear leader, tugged her way forward leaving the five eighths, moved to engage from the outside near the
five sixteenths, dueled, gained a slim lead while switching over to her left lead in mid stretch, kept on under right handed asks, switched back to her correct
lead inside the sixteenth pole, edged away a bit in deep stretch then held firm. CHARMED WAY settled off the inside while not far back, stalked outside a
rival into the far turn, angled four wide under coaxing into the stretch, made a grinding run through the final sixteenth and got up for the place in the final
jumps. SAL'S BLUE JACKET cleared without much asking through the opening furlong, dropped in and set a rated pace, dug in when joined by the winner
near the five sixteenths, dueled on near even terms from the head of the lane, stayed on after being headed, battled on past the sixteenth marker then gave
way grudgingly. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE settled off the pace while saving some ground, came under pressure around the final turn, swung out and
offered a belated response. TRUE BLUE PEARL , firmly rated back off the lead in the opening furlong, saved ground while remaining well in hand into the
backstretch, gained and took aim into the far turn, was put to a ride to the inside of CHARMED WAY while pursuing past the five sixteenths, lacked a
response in upper stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
LOVING CUP assumed the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, repelled a challenger in upper stretch and dug in stubbornly in the drive.
NORTHERN GLOW stalked the pace racing along the inner rail to the stretch, moved to the three path in upper stretch and rallied between rivals. ATLAS
STRONG , four deep the first turn, prompted the pace in the two path around the far turn and weakened in the drive. BELLA PALOMA lacked speed, circled
the far turn four wide, was fanned five deep turning for home and passed tired rivals. NINJA ABARRIO stalked the pace outside horses, raced three wide
the far turn, was fanned four wide in upper stretch and failed to rally. ROWSIE EXPRESS , rank the first turn, raced between rivals the far turn, angled in
approaching the sixteenth pole and was no threat. GO SHERRY GO raced inside horses most of the trip and was no factor. FLOWERDEW , rank leaving
the first turn, was no factor.

Footnotes
RUN FOR REAGAN vied outside HAVE NO REGRETS through the opening half mile, was roused clear leaving the three sixteenths, denied an outside
threat from SIMON'S CHOICE in mid stretch and edged away under a drive. SIMON'S CHOICE stalked inside, took closer order of the dueling leaders past
the five sixteenths, angled four wide into the lane, ranged up loom in mid stretch, continued willingly but was denied. MY ASIAN LOVER , three deep
prompting the early pace, eased back between runners leaving the far turn, swung out for the drive and kept on with some effort. HAVE NO REGRETS
broke inward, was corrected and nudged up to the inside of rivals, dueled into and around the turn, stayed willingly to the three sixteenths then gave way.
SUPER NEEDY broke alertly then failed to initially go on with the speed while four wide, dropped in a path when taking closer into the turn, was under
pressure mid turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened.
