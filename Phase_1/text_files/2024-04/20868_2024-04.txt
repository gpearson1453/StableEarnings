Footnotes
SHEZMISBEHAVING bobbled leaving the gate, reserved early then started to pull, continued to tug the rider forward on the backstretch and moved out four
wide, continued wide around the far turn, challenged outside a trio of rivals midstretch and edged clear late. ABHITA tucked inside off the pace, trailed into
the stretch, lacked room along the fence and tipped out only to find more traffic, got out into the clear with a sixteenth left to run and finished gamely for
second. ANKYRAH dueled for the lead from outside three wide into the first turn then took a stalking position outside the leader in the two path, moved up to
apply pressure at the half-mile pole, drew on even terms around the far turn, took over midstretch but got outkicked in the final sixteenth. SPRING MAGIC
tracked three wide through both turns, driven along into the stretch, bid three deep in the lane, fought between in the furlong grounds and got outkicked.
FAST GISELLE dueled for the lead from inside then cleared outer rival to take control, pressure again at the midway point, headed around the far turn,
dueled to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. QUARIA THUNDER stalked in the two path then between rivals, roused entering the lane, chased within
striking range but never found room. IN YOUR FACE traveled outside a rival at the back, went three deep and between rivals on the far turn, lacked room in
traffic from upper to midstretch and was ridden out once in the clear. GRAZED MY HEART settled along the rail, stalked in a good position on the far turn
and into the lane, remained on the fence through the lane but weakened when called upon.

R SWIRVIN GIRVIN came out bit early then stalked from outside leader, moved up on the turn, challenged past quarter marker, gained command then
shook free in upper stretch and safely held. YVETT'S SURPRISE tracked the early pace from the outside, continued on three path into and around the turn,
continued on same path into the stretch, drifted out some in deep stretch and proved second best. VIOLET STORM reserved along the rail, continued
inside, tipped out in upper stretch and gained minor award. DE JORIA stalked while outside rival early, chased on same path then between foes, was three
wide leaving the turn, came out further thru the lane and was no late threat. FRAZZLED bobbled slightly leaving the gate, quickly recovered and rushed to
the front, set pace into and on the turn, was overtaken entering the stretch then weakened from the inside.

Footnotes
FINAL STORM reared in the gate and unseated the rider, backed out and reloaded, broke cleanly then dropped back, trailed into the turn, gained along the
the rail through the bend, rallied along the fence and got up in time. KNOWN IDEA raced up close outside the pacesetter, bid two wide late on the turn,
gained command in upper stretch, drifted out while leading into the final sixteenth and was run down by the winner. BEER MONEY stumbled slightly leaving
the gate, settled early on the inside, tipped out into the stretch, put in a late bid but was not enough. IMMELMANN displayed good early speed to show the
way up the backstretch, confronted by KNOWN IDEA past the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. REFOCUS got crowded
between rivals and altered in early, chased two wide around the bend, tipped out at the top of the stretch and weakened. SURROUNDEDBYANGELS
tracked the speed from outside, went three wide into the turn, drifted to the five path around the bend and could not offer a response when asked. WHERE
IT'S AT stalked four deep into the turn, got bumped three deep leaving the bend and weakened. TIGER IN MY TANK forwardly placed three deep, bumped
with outer rival late on the turn and was not persevered with in the stretch run.

Footnotes
VULIN prominent early three deep and four wide on clubhouse turn, stalked the top pair from outside up the backstretch, bid three wide on the far turn,
grabbed the lead past the quarter pole, put away TRUE FRIEND entering the stretch, felt DRAMATIZER approaching to the outside and turned away that
rival in the final sixteenth. DRAMATIZER rated along the rail, shifted to the two path to pass ROMAN EMPRESS on the far turn, moved out and took aim at
the winner with a furlong remaining but could not find the needed late kick. TRUE FRIEND pressed the pace in the three path between rivals around the first
turn, dueled past the halfway mark, inched ahead early on the far turn, relinquished the lead to VULIN past the quarter pole, lost touch with the winner at the
top of the lane, drifted out in the stretch and managed to save third. ROMAN EMPRESS took control early inside a pair of rivals, dueled past the half-mile
pole, lost command early on the far turn, chased after the new leaders while drifting three wide into the stretch and never quit trying in the lane. ZZYZX
stumbled badly in the beginning, took the first turn two then three wide, rounded the far turn in the four path and failed to menace. A BROKEN BREEZE
chased along the rail then moved into the two path on the far turn, lost ground up the backstretch, dropped further back while on the rail through through the
far turn and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
CROSBY BEACH sped clear and crossed over to the rail, set the pace along the inside to the stretch, asked at the top of the lane and responded well by
drawing away. DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) reserved in the two path, split foes past the quarter quarter pole, split foes again at the eighth pole and edged
REIQUIST for second. REIQUIST settled along the rail, moved into range in the middle stages, hugged the rail to the stretch, finished willingly through the
lane and missed second. FLASHIEST broke a step slow, reserved in the three path early, traveled three then four deep on the second bend, finished evenly
in the furlong grounds and got outfinished for the place and show. HULA CANDY stalked on the rail then moved into the two path early, took aim two wide
into the stretch but weakened in the furlong grounds. ALIGATO broke a step slow, steadied briefly off heels prior to the first turn, saved ground on the
second bend, moved off the fence in the lane, had to alter out from behind rivals to find a clear path but was too late. DEAN MARTINI tracked three deep,
remained off the rail and spun three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MOTORCADE set the pace under pressure from outer rivals, held a short lead over CRYPTO CRAZE on the turn before clearing at the quarter pole, give
his cue into the lane and spurted away, kept to task into deep stretch and coasted in late. MAN CHILD chased four wide into the turn, exited the bend three
wide, offered a mild rally and was along for second. CRYPTO CRAZE broke a step slow, chased off the rail then pulled the rider forward between rivals to
press the pace, kept the pressure on to the five-sixteenths pole, failed to kick on with the winner with a quarter mile remaining, churned on down the lane but
could not hold the place. GOOD N THIRSTY stumbled leaving the gate, trailed well off the inside, took the turn four to five wide and passed tired rivals.
KAHUNA MAGIC pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch, chased three then two wide around the turn and came up empty. SANGER raced up
close from inside early, lost ground while still in range on the turn, then faded down the lane.

safely under urging. TWO BY FOUR settled off the pace and moved inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved off the fence past the eighth pole,
rallied between rivals and gained second. SIZE DOES MATTER settled three deep then moved into the two path, gained three then four wide on the second
bend, finished willingly in the furlong grounds but got outfinished for second. TAKES THREE stepped to the front and showed the way early on, challenged
by outer rival at the three-eighths pole, lost command past the quarter pole, fought back to upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the furlong
grounds but kept trying to save a minor award. KEEP MOVIN' ON chased between rivals briefly and became rank before dropping back to last, traveled
outside a rival on the backstretch, came under a ride on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and weakened. MISCHIEFS CAUSEWAY showed speed
three then two wide around the first turn then ceded command and stalked TAKES THREE from outside, chased two wide on the final turn and weakened
down the lane. JUST A GUESS stalked three deep early, moved up from outside in the middle stages, challenged from outside at the three-eighths pole, led
two wide into the lane, overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and weakened. CLEMENTS RIDE pulled briefly along the rail then settled into strides, saved
ground to the stretch and never got involved. STOLEN TREASURE stalked along the rail, roused approaching the five-sixteenths pole, came out a bit at the
top of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
IRISH WAHINE stalked from outside, bid three then two wide on the far turn, cleared upper stretch and held well over the runner-up. TIZZY TWISTER
chased four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, loomed from outside in the lane, could not reach the winner but was clearly
second best. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE took control early and showed the way up the backstretch, led two wide into the turn, challenged from outside while
moving to the rail, yielded in upper stretch and churned on to save third. UNCONTROLLABLE bobbled slightly while breaking in but still came away with the
field, raced in range off the rail then moved inside to save ground, came off the rail midstretch and lacked a rally. SWEET HELLO stalked the pace from
inside into the turn, chased two wide leaving the bend and weakened. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY broke well and raced up close early, dropped back to last
up the backstretch, took the turn three then two wide and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CHARM YOUR WORLD was reluctant to load, settled off the pace, rounded the bend two then three wide, closed in and angled inside the leader at the
sixteenth pole, then drove past in the final fifty yards. NOT A SINNER (GB) stalked three deep, bid two wide on the turn, took over into the stretch, put away
inner rival, led into deep stretch and could not hold off the winner. UPCHARGE traveled near the back off the rail, took the turn two then three wide, angled
out in the stretch and came with a late run to earn the show honors. DISPOSITION coaxed early, chased off the rail and had to alter inward when losing his
path, checked when running up on heels into the turn, angled to the inside, steered back out into the stretch, finished well but was not enough. VIBEZ
stalked inside a pair of rivals, brushed entering the turn, ridden along two wide into the stretch, moved further out in the drive and chased within range in the
furlongs grounds but finished evenly late. WIMBERLY chased off the pace and moved inside, raced a bit cautiously behind DISPOSITION early on the turn,
stayed along the fence to the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, gained an opening and kept on through the final furlong. ZITI (FR) off slow to come away
last, chased from inside near the back, saved ground into the lane and improved position. LOVE ALIVE trailed early off the rail then outside a rival, moved
into the three path early on the turn, spun four wide into the lane, came in upper stretch and failed to menace. HEART OF THE NIGHT showed the way
early from inside, headed by rivals at the quarter pole, yielded in upper stretch and gave way. UR IN TROUBLE away quickly then dropped back off the
pace, chased three wide around the bend, got floated out into the stretch and flattened. CARSON JEN stalked off the rail then between rivals, got put in tight
and brushed with inner rival at the three-eighths pole, dropped back between foes on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
