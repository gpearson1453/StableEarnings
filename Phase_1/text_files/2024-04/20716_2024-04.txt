Footnotes
LOW COUNTRY MAGIC showed the way inside of a pressing foe, shook free of that one inside upper stretch and drove clear. SANCTIFY pressed the
eventual winner from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and remained well clear of the rest. TWO LUCYS broke a beat slow
and was last away, tracked three wide and secured show while not threatening the top pair. HONORS LEGACY stalked along the inside, then steadily gave
way while chasing through the lane and was found to have bled. RAZZLE RED was brushed between horses and put to crowded quarters among them at
the start, raced at the rear in the three path and made little impact. VINO VELOCE was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
THE THUNDERER bumped an outer rival soon after the start, pressed the leader from the three path, led narrowly into and around the far turn, shook free
entering the lane and drove clear. CANDY FOR CARMEL was bumped by an outer rival upon leaving the gates, showed the way inside of an outer
prompter, got headed by that one with a half mile to go, vied around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart while subtly in tight
quarters entering the lane, yet kept on well to repel an outer challenge for place in the final furlong. ALL WEST saved ground off of the pace, advanced
inside of rivals while tipping to the three path entering the lane, sustained progress to bid for place in upper stretch, but was turned away. KAHALA bumped
an inner rival before taking light contact from an outer foe at the start, stalked behind the leading pair and from the two path, chased them under urging
around the far turn, but was floated four wide by an inner rival entering the lane and lacked a bid. TRENDING UP pursued from midpack in the three path
and between horses, chased under urging among foes in the four path around the far turn, steadied when blocked behind rivals entering the lane in the five
path, shifted out in midstretch and moved up. SHORTLIST was off a beat slow and brushed an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path,
inched closer in the five path and outside of rivals around the far turn, but was floated six wide entering the lane, flattened out and came up empty. CODE
RUNNER was bumped by an inner rival soon after the start, tracked the top pair from the four path, came under urging within striking range around the far
turn, but was floated five wide entering the lane and gave way between horses. NICHOLAS JONES trailed throughout, was pulled up entering the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
NEON ICON tracked along the inside, pursued the leading trio around the far turn, bumped her stable-mate while tipping outside of the leading pair in upper
stretch, split foes through a tight seam to bid at the furlong grounds and kicked clear. FORESEEN broke outwardly, tracked three wide, pressed the top pair
while traveling well around the far turn, but was bumped and forced four wide by her inner stablemate in upper stretch, got outkicked by that one at the
furlong grounds and ran on to be second best. DYNAMISM prompted two wide, vied around the far turn as an outer rival applied pressure, but was
outkicked by an outer pair at the furlong grounds and gave way. KARA AND COLLEEN led inside of an outer prompter, vied with that one and a wider
presser around the far turn, clung to an advantage entering the lane, but was headed while inside of a trio of foes in midstretch and faded. A DOLLAR A
DAY raced off of the pace along the inside and was no factor. STREETWHEREYOULIVE broke a beat slow and got floated outwardly at the start, raced off
of the pace in the four path and was done early.

Footnotes
JET SWEEP JOE led from a trio of outer vying rivals around the turn, clung to an advantage from a single duel-sustaining rival into midstretch and held
gamely. FORTHELOVEOFRUN vied three wide and between horses, sparred through upper stretch, but was kept at bay through the final furlong and saved
place. STRUMMIN chased the leading quarter from the four path turning for home, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and offered a belated charge
to miss reaching place at the wire. INTO INSPIRATION prompted four deep while taking the turn in the five path, chased the top pair through upper stretch
but last show to an outer bidder in the final sixteenth. BAYTOWN BOO BOO vied two wide and between horses but gave way hanging on his left lead.
CHARLIE TOLU steadied hard behind rivals entering the turn, chased under urging in the three path and failed to menace. MISTER WOODFORD raced off
of the pace along the inside, shifted to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor. PROBALE TEN broke many lengths slow and showed little.

Footnotes
OUTOFNOTHINGATALL rushed forward inside of rivals to set the pace, built a clear margin into the turn and held sway safely under a drive. BLENHEIM
BABY tracked four wide, gained place turning for home, chased the clear leader while flopping back to her left lead in midstretch and was well clear of the
rest. CRYSTAL SYMPHONY chased forwardly along the inside into the turn, advanced to gain place from outer rivals passing the three furlong pole, but
was outkicked for that position by an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, yielded yet maintained show. I GOTTA BOLT trailed in the three path, swung to
the six path entering the lane and moved up. RUN RUN RABBIT broke outwardly, laid off of the pace five wide, pursued from the three to four path around
the turn, gained fourth entering the lane, but flattened out without reaching contention. FAST GAL pursued two wide and failed to factor. BAYTOWN
LOVELY pressed outside of the top pair for a quarter mile, chased between horses around the turn and faded. DANCING NANCY vied for the lead two
wide, but yielded into the turn and weakened between horses shortly after. RAPPING WISH laid off of the pace along the inside and faded.

POPPERINA was bumped between horses and put to crowded quarters at the start, pursued from off of the pace two wide, encountered traffic in upper
stretch, altered course four wide at the furlong grounds, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. DE' ANS EIGHTY stalked along the inside, took
the turn in the two path before tipping three wide to take dead aim on the leaders entering the lane, slowly closed in leaving midstretch, bid along with an
outer foe at the sixteenth pole and got outkicked. MARMALADE SKYE bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked the leader from the three path, bumped an
inner rival moving forward approaching the half mile pole, pressed and vied into the turn, led turning for home, inched clear in upper stretch, but was bested
by an outer pair entering the final sixteenth and gave way. LITTLE SISTER SUE bumped an outer rival at the start, trailed along the inside, altered out five
wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. MRS. RIP tracked two wide, bumped with an outer rival creeping closer nearing the half mile pole, took the bend
in the three path, floated four wide entering the lane, then six wide in upper stretch and faded. CRACKALACKING led early, vied with an outer bidder around
the turn, got headed turning for home and weakened.

WHAT SAY THEE pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped out to the five path to take aim on the leaders entering the lane, rallied to bid in upper
stretch, sparred with an inner foe through the final furlong and prevailed. PORQUEROLLES tracked two to three wide, pressed the top pair around the far
turn, bid in the four path along with an outer foe in upper stretch, dueled with that one through the final furlong but missed. WEYHILL ROAD was restrained
early on to settle off of the pace, saved ground before shifting to the four path entering the lane, tipped wider in upper stretch and rallied to reach show at
the wire. NOW AND LATER broke a bit outwardly stalked along the inside, awaited racing room around the far turn, offered a rail chase to gain show
passing the furlong grounds, but was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire for that position. ROYAL MENDE showed the way along the inside, but was
headed by outer bidders in midstretch and faded between horses. CAROOM settled well back two to four wide, fanned to the seven path entering the lane
and failed to menace. BOLT FROM ABOVE broke a step slow and steadied back when an inner rival took his path at the start, trailed along the inside,
improved past outer rivals in upper stretch and failed to threaten. PIKE PLACE lacked speed in the two to three path and made little impact. PASSING
JUDGMENT pursued from midpack while tugging keenly three wide around the first turn, chased between horses around the far turn, floated to the five path
entering the lane and gave way. HORACE MANN pressed two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, but weakened between rivals at the three
sixteenths pole. EL AHIJADO pursued four wide, crept closer under urging around the far turn, but entered the lane in the six path and weakened between
horses.

Footnotes
INDY MAGIC laid off of the pace in the four to five path, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole and edged past. TRUMPTASTIC pursued from midpack along the
inside, was roused to the four path turning for home, advanced to bid in upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was caught in the final sixteenth. BERNIN
HOT prompted along the inside before stalking into the turn, offered a rail bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked and yielded late. OLIVIER showed the way
in the two path but faded between horses entering midstretch. PATRIARCHAL trailed and made little impact. KISSTHEMOON chased three wide, but was
outkicked by an outer rival and gave way between horses in upper stretch.
