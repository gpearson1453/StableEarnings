Footnotes
FRONTLINER trailed down the backstretch near the inside, began to close ground along the rail through upper stretch, shifted out a bit and split rivals two
wide inside the furlong marker and proved best under a strong hand ride. UHAVETOBEKITTENME sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace
until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner while hanging on gamely for second. AMIGO'S AFFAIR chased the leader into the stretch, loomed boldly
three wide nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished. APACHE failed to menace.

Footnotes
CROSSED UP trailed along the inside down the backstretch, began to close ground through the turn, shifted two wide near the quarter pole, responded
under right handed urging, split rivals past the furlong marker and proved best under a strong hand ride. JOYA DEL SUR sped to the front soon after the
start, set a pressured pace along the inside until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. MISS SHADY wide early, pressed the pace three wide then
entire trip and was outfinished in a gamed effort. TATTERED HEART pressed the pace two wide into the turn then faded. BISCAYNE BAY was a forward
factor two wide for a half mile then weakened.
