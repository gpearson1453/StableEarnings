BOCA ROYALTY trailed briefly, advanced inside, angled out in the stretch and pulled away under moderate pressure. COLLIN'S GREY LADY hustled to the
front, was collared passing the eighth pole and lasted for the place. MISS CASEY broke slowest, chased wide and finished willingly. SIZZLING ROMA
saved ground, went after the leader on the turn then weakened. PARISIAN VIBE urged between rivals down the backstretch and faltered. SCINTILLATING
STAR dropped back early then raced wide passing rivals. CLASSY SADIE chased along the inside and lacked a rally. RUN LAURA RUN began fading on
the turn and was never a factor. TAKE CHARGE ERICA flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE RED was fractious in the gate, raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced on the turn, swung wide, commenced a late run outside and finished
willingly to get up in time. GO CHLOE GO chased inside, chased on the turn, rallied inside in the stretch run, made a bid nearing the sixteenth marker and
was outkicked by the winner. BE MY QUEEN showed good early speed to set the pace, shifted out a bit passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely between
rivals in the final sixteenth and was outfinished. DREAMINGOFFREEDOM raced three wide off the pace and closed belatedly. XERCES raced off the pace
inside, moved up inside entering the stretch, gained mildly and failed to threaten. STEAL THE DEAL raced off the pace between rivals and failed to
threaten. SAVE THE MISCHIEF chased two wide, chased on the turn and tired.

under urging. REITERATE vied outside for the lead, dueled on the turn, took over at the quarter pole, dug in gamely when challenged in the stretch run and
yielded grudgingly. LUNA T chased between rivals, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. PHANCY PHILLY raced off the pace, chased
four wide on the turn and rallied mildly. LA LUISA vied inside for command, dueled on the turn, chased and weakened. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO chased
three wide on the turn and faded.

CAUSE I SAID pursued the loose pacesetter, bid inside on the turn then edged ahead through the lane in a determined score. DECOUPAGE hustled to
clear lead early, vied midway on the turn to the finish in a game try. IFIHADACHANCE raced off the leaders wide then went evenly through the stretch.
TARA'S TALENT saved ground throughout, lacked speed then passed tiring rivals. JEZEBEL JADE dropped back wide and failed to respond. CANOODLE
was well placed behind the dueling leaders then weakened steadily. JACK'S LILLY angled inside early, moved out on the turn and trailed.
