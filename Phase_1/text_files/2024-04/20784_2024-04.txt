CIVIL NOTION settled inside, angled three wide on the turn, rallied and wore down the leaders through the stretch. ROYAL PARTY far back early inside,
moved out in the stretch and closed well. CELTIC TIGER set pace inside, was collared on the turn then weakened in the final furlong. ARROGANTE lacked
speed inside, raced very wide in the stretch narrowing the gap. BURNING EMBERS prompted her stablemate outside, loomed a threat then proved empty
late. DUST BUNNY trailed to the stretch then offered some late energy. AYEARTOREMEMBER moved close up four wide down the backstretch and lacked
a response. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA dropped back early, was put to urging on the turn and faltered. FILTERED LIGHT chased five wide close up briefly
then gave way.

HORNBEAM settled off the pace, moved up three wide on the backside, chased outside on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, dueled through the
final sixteenth and prevailed. ZIP IT SCOTTY stalked close up two wide, bid two wide, dueled outside a rival on the far turn, gained a short lead, dug in
gamely between horses in the final furlong, battled to the end and got the nod for second. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM tracked on the inside, chased inside
on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch drive, dug in gamely through the final furlong and just missed for the place spot. CORKMAN raced off the
pace inside, angled out at the top of the lane and gained mildly. HURRICANE HIGHWAY was outrun early, saved ground on the far turn and passed tired
rivals on the inside. FINALIST was reluctant loading, raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS set the pace on the
inside, dueled on the far turn and gave way in the lane.

JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT vied outside, took over midway on the turn and pulled away under moderate urging. MOJOVATION broke slowly, advanced in the
two path and closed well while no match for the winner. WE READY dropped back early then rallied wide narrowing the gap. EMPIRE'S SCORE broke
awkwardly and trailed early, swung very wide in the stretch advancing. JACK BEANSTALK broke alertly then lacked speed and failed to menace.
MARTINKELLY raced close up for half a mile and retreated. JEBOLOGIST chased in midpack, faded on the turn and was no menace. CATCH MY VIBE
lacked speed and never in contention. REFUND RIGLER flashed speed to the far turn and stopped. BEE BY THE SEA lacked speed and weakened
steadily.

BOSSYNESS came over a bit on a rival entering the first turn, set the pace, shook free on the backside, responded when roused, drew clear and held well
under urging. MISS CHAMITA raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, angled out then back in at the furlong marker, rallied on the rail and closed
well for second. TARA'S TALENT stalked two wide, chased three wide on the far turn, finished evenly and held for third. SALAGADOOLA broke outward,
raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, gained mildly outside and was up for fourth. BUNNY BONUS stalked close up two wide, chased on
the far turn and weakened. WESTERN DREAM bobbled slightly at the break, checked in tight on the rail entering the first turn, then tracked inside, chased
on the far turn and gave way. COLOR CRUSH raced off the pace, two wide on the far turn and did not factor.

DESIGNATED lacked speed, advanced very wide into the stretch, offered a late surge and rallied clear. ALCALA steadied inside near the three eighths
pole, was blocked on the turn, secured space then rallied well along rail. DIANE'S MERLOT quickly moved clear, drifted out in the stretch and weakened.
BAY BAY BIRDIE went after the pacesetter on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. GRACE REFORMED trailed early, moved very wide on the turn and
failed to menace. NEIGHBELLINE was urged close up between rivals down the backstretch and faded. LAVINIA SPIRIT broke out at the start, raced wide
and weakened. SWANS ISLAND prompted the pace along the inside then began fading on the turn. BOH'S N O'S lacked speed and was never in
contention.

closed steadily, wore down RESPECTFULLY and drew clear late. RESPECTFULLY dueled inside for command, shook free entering the far turn, drew
clear, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and then yielded grudgingly. GOLD MEDAL ANNA was bumped and steadied at the start, raced two wide off the
pace, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out and rallied mildly. MARY Q was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the turn
and lacked a rally. MIA TOSCA raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. TURN ON THE CHARM dueled two wide for the lead, then chased and
tired. PRECIOUS AVARY raced three wide early, stalked the dueling leaders, chased on the far turn and gave way. KNOWING GLANCE raced four wide
early, settled off the rail, off the pace and gave way.

NINETYPRCENTMADDIE advanced five wide on the turn, led into the stretch then weakened slightly. UNCLE ERNIE moved close up inside, continued
willingly but was outfinished. MEET ME AT MUNDIS underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, chased wide and closed gamely. TWISTED RIDE earned a
narrow advantage outside for half a mile, battled to midstretch and tired. BEREN moved just off leaders between foes and faltered in the stretch. YOUNG
SQUIRE broke slowly, rushed up inside and lacked a response. MOVISITOR prompted the pace between rivals then outside and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
BULLET ON TAP stalked the pace outside, bid into the stretch then drew away in the final furlong while inheriting a longer advantage. NOW ACT
SURPRISED dropped back early then finished with some late energy. AZTEC BAY chased inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. WICKED LADY
raced just off the leaders, struck rival and bobbled badly nearing the finish. LADY SICARIA alternated for the lead inside for half a mile and weakened.
THAT'STONY'SSISTER raced off the pace then swung inside to avoid fallen rival late. DUNE JUMPER trailed early and was never in contention. DIVINE
PROMISE chased wide and gave way readily. CLOUDY TIMES dueled outside, moved briefly clear in midstretch then fell heavily near the sixteenth pole,
recovered and ran off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident, the race was declared official.
