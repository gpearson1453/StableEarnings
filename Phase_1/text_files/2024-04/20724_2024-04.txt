Footnotes
ALL ABOUT LUCKY set the pace along the rail, drifted out under left-handed urging late, brushed the runner-up nearing the wire and held. FORT
ATTITUDE prompted the winner two wide, slowly gained through the stretch, was brushed in the final strides and just missed. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU raced
off the pace three wide, had aim outside of the top two in upper stretch but was unable to threaten them while holding the show. EXALTED CHARM
steadied early, saved ground in range and lacked the needed rally. GOLDEN SKULL failed to menace while racing two wide. FEDERAL EXCHANGE broke
in a tangle and was never involved while racing three wide. NATURE BOY had only brief speed four wide. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF FORT ATTITUDE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS
TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SPREZZATURA bobbled at the start, rated in the five path, tipped into the two path and received a right handed cue entering the far turn, angled out to the
five path while between rivals at the top of the stretch, rallied past the inner pacesetter around the sixteenth, and went clear. BOOT'S ON THE MOON
showed the way from the two path turning into the backstretch, received a right handed cue midway around the far turn, kicked on while tipping out to the
three path in upper stretch, but was caught around the sixteenth by an outer foe to place. UNION HARMONY got a bit keen and had to steady midway
around the first turn, tracked in the four path down the backside, came under rousing going into the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the
lane, and finished evenly for show. STREET CHARITY pressed in the five path, bid in the four path midway around the far turn, but faded in the stretch.
CAIRNHILL prompted the pace out in the six path down the backstretch but backed up around the far turn. LUNETTA JAK trailed throughout along the
inside.

Footnotes
LADY CHA CHA trailed in the two path down the backstretch, came under coaxing from the three path going into the far turn, fanned out to the eight path at
the top of the lane, rallied while being herded outwards, and got up on the wire. BUSY MORNING tracked in the two path, received a right handed cue going
into the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, drifted out while running on to take a brief lead inside the final sixteenth, but was nailed, at
the wire by an outer foe to place. CRIMSON PRINCESS laid up close in the two path, bid in the five path turning into the stretch, drifted out thru the final
furlong, but stayed on for show. WHERE'S EMMA rated in the three path, was coaxed along from the rail around the far turn, bid up the rail passing the
eighth pole, but flattened late. MADAKET'S ARROW showed the way along the inside turning into the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn,
dug in from the four path in upper stretch, but yielded around the sixteenth. CHICKEN PARM broke out at the start, stalked in the three path but backed up
around the far turn.

SAND DANCER bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, was cued into the far turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the
lane, and rallied past an inner duo in the final furlong. GRAND DAVID prompted the pace in the four path, took command from the two path going into the
far turn, came under coaxing midway around the far turn, kicked on while hanging on his left lead into the stretch, but was caught in the closing stages by an
outer foe to place. NIGHT JUMPER bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the five path, was roused into the far turn, bid in the four path passing
the quarter, but evened out in the final furlong to show. GLIDING AFLEET chased in the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, but was
one paced from the six path in the stretch. BRINGER OF RAIN trailed in the four path, was ridden in the two path around the far turn, but made no impact.
UNCLE ARMANDO raced off the pace in the five path but never threatened. SWAN LAKE broke out at the start, set the pace inside but gaveway rounding
the far turn.

Footnotes
ACADEMY CHOICE prompted the pace in the four path, bid under coaxing in the three path midway around the turn, floated out to the five path turning into
the lane took a narrow lead passing the eighth pole, and inched clear. IRON MAN JIMMY bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path,
was ridden in the two path around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, and ran on between foes late to get up for place. DROPKICK
MURPHY showed the way in the two path, was roused along the inside midway around the turn, dug in from the three path entering the stretch, lost the lead
passing the eighth pole, but held onto show. LIEUTENANT STAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the five path, came under a ride in the
four path going into the turn, fanned out to the six path entering the stretch, and finished evenly. HARRINGTON trailed in the three path and never
threatened. TIE BREAKER bumped between foes at the start, chased in the four path but was no menace.
