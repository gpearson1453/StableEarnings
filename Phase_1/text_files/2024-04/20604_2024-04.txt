lead, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. SKIPPA an early factor, raced close throughout and was outfinished, while running a
game third. HALF MAGIC raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but lacked a strong rally. GOLDENLUTE
dueled on the front end, weakened and finished evenly. UNCLE BRAD lacked early speed and passed tired ones. SUNSET WAR pressed the early pace
and faded. TRUVY'S BANDIT raced evenly near the back, came around the turn wide and was never a factor. OCEOLA void of early speed and was never

Footnotes
KUPUNA unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out to go around a tiring MACHINE GUN MAN, moved back to the
rail down the lane and was going away at the end. FIVE STAR GENERAL pressed the pace, raced close throughout, took the lead at the 3/4 pole, but
couldn't match strides with the winner deep in the stretch. CHROME BABY raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, lacked a late kick and was
a clear third. DOUBLE CROWN void of early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MONAASIB raced evenly near the back and was never a threat.
WILDATLANTICSTORM raced within striking distance in the early going, had an outside trip and faded. MACHINE GUN MAN went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground and tired. HYPERBOLIST always raced near the back, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire.
