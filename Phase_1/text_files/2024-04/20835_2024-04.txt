Footnotes
SPYCRAFT tracked the early leader two deep from the outside, took command near the quarter pole and drew off to be well clear while being kept to
pressure. LEADER OF MEN rated along under a hold early, made a three wide bid to challenge near the five sixteenths pole but was no match for Spycraft
through the drive. SHORTLIST was off slowly, settled off the early going, advanced through the far turn, loomed five wide into the upper stretch and
flattened out in the drive. READY PURSUIT was unhurried early on, moved up three wide near the five sixteenths pole, raced five deep through the stretch
run and closed in mildly. ONE FOR RICHIE settled early to race mid pack, was three to four wide in the stretch run and lacked a rally. EPIMYTHIUM
dropped back early, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, angled out through the drive and never was a factor. KEEN ON YOU was off slowly, trailed
early on, swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. DREAMING OF SMARTY showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside
and tired readily.

BARNABY was bumped at the start, stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, raced six deep through the stretch
run and edged up late under all out pressure. HASKELLED prompt Beer With Ice two deep from the outside down the backstretch, hard ridden through the
far turn, dug in late and kept on gamely to the wire. BEER WITH ICE quick to begin to set the early pace along the inside, confronted near the three eighths
pole and gave way grudgingly to the top pair. ONEPARTICULRHARBOR settled to raced mid pack early, swung wide into the upper stretch and had not
enough in the drive. STAR NATION was bumped between horses at the start, unhurried early on, angled widest through the stretch run to race from the far
outside and was even with no closing run. MOONLIGHT JOKER bumped at the start, tracked the early pace setters, was near the rail past the five
sixteenths pole, eased out through the stretch run and weakened. BRODY'S FLY dropped back early on, four deep near the three sixteenths pole, angled in
and never threatened. STEP ON IT trailed early and failed to respond.

CENTER STAGE settled off the early pace, moved up strongly three wide from the outside of rivals around the far turn and drew off to be clear racing five
deep in the stretch run under strong handling. CLASSIC PERFORMER sent to narrow early lead, dug in through the stretch run and gave way to the winner
grudgingly. THESTRAL rated along early, ridden four wide through the far turn and closed in mildly raced from the outside. EVIE'S ENCORE dropped back
early on, hard ridden from the inside around the far turn, angled five wide inside the upper stretch, shifted in a bit through the drive and moved up to improve
position. LITTLE BLAZE chased the pace from the inside, shuffled back near the half mile pole and weakened a bit through the drive. PIONEER PARADE
prompt the early pace two deep from the outside of rival and gave way. TRAVAILLE was coaxed along early near the rail and tired in the drive.

OUTADORE dueled two deep from the outside of rival, dug in late and prevailed under strong handling. COUNTERSTRIKE coaxed along from the outside
of rivals, raced three wide around the far turn, made a three to four wide bid through the stretch run, slowly closed in on the winner and missed in a game
effort. ZOOMBIE off a step slow, raced at the back of the pack early, swung seven wide into the lane racing outside of rivals and rallied gamely to the wire.
CAROTARI dueled with an outer rival and gave way grudgingly late. BUSHIDO chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch around the far turn,
eased out three wide in the stretch run and had not enough. GASLIGHT DANCER dropped back early, raced six wide in the stretch run, raced in tight
quarters near the eighth pole and was even with no closing run. KIGALI hustled from the outside, raced four to five wide around the far turn and needed
more in the drive. INTO THE SUNRISE chased the pace down the backstretch through the far turn, eased out near the three sixteenths pole and was even
with no late gain. RETAINED chased the pace from the outside and faded. BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR raced mid pack early, had a four to two wide run in the
lane and weakened.

Footnotes
SPANISH WELLS showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, ridden off the inside in the stretch drive and finished strongly to draw off
under strong left urging. SAINT PETER'S BAY tracked the pace five deep from the outside, took aim into the upper lane but was no match for the winner.
MIDNIGHT STORMY dropped back early, checked near the three eighths pole, raced in tight again near the five sixteenths pole, checked while racing three
wide around the far turn and moved up to improve position. CHRYSO ALOGO settled off the early pace, raced three wide around the far turn and flattened
out in the drive. BETTERING raced at the back of the pack early, was four wide around the far turn and needed more in the drive. BLEDSOE up closed
between, shuffled back between rivals near the three eighths pole, angled wide through the stretch to race from the far outside and never threatened.
NOTORIOUS SIXOHTWO dropped back early and failed to respond. CRAFTED stalked the pace along the inside and faded. THE RIDER OF BETTERING
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MIDNIGHT STORMY, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
TITUBA stalked the top pair around the first turn and through the backstretch, moved up to challenge the leader near the quarter pole, dueled inside of
DREAMING OF MO down the lane, dug in gamely and narrowly prevailed. DREAMING OF MO tracked the early pace, looped up three wide late on the far
turn, challenged TITUBA for the lead, battled on gamely through the lane and just missed. HAY STACK settled near the inside through early stages, angled
out on the far turn, came three paths wide into upper stretch, responded under firm handling and edged closer to the wire. STEPHANIE'S CHARM raced off
the early pace, navigated three wide around the far turn, spun out wider heading into upper stretch and improved position without threatening. LA
PACHANGA rated along the inside through the backstretch, lacked racing room and steadied around the far turn, shifted out two path at the head of the
lane, given cue, showed brief response then flattened out. ROBIN SAGE raced in the back, saved ground around the final turn, tipped two wide and passed
tiring rivals. ENZI raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. HOLA GATA raced just off midpack, was
ridden along three wide around the final turn, came out wider into the lane and gave way. KILLSHAVE BEAUTY angled in from the outside and dueled two
wide around the first turn, continued to match strides through the backstretch, led the way around the far turn, got collared at the head of the lane and faded.
PICTURE OF A LADY dueled for the lead around the first turn and up the backstretch then came up empty on the far turn.
