GREAT RUNNER broke through gate, loose before the start, raced in the back in the beginning, made a steady gain, moved up on the rail around the turn,
angled out, split rivals, collared the leader down the stretch and pulled away before the wire. CAJUN BLAST vied for the early lead, drove clear, dueled with
GREAT RUNNER down the stretch, couldn't match strides, but was best of others. MIDNIGHT AVENGER pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout
and proved no match for the top two. DONEGAL DREAMER lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. STARSTUDDED AFFAIR vied for the
early advantage, faded and was no threat late. SEAVILLE broke poorly and was always near the back. TITANIUM DEAL challenged for the early lead and
made a steady retreat.

SHAWN'S SOLVING sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout, was kept to the task and held on well. HAWAIIAN ARGUMENT lacked early speed,
made a steady gain, finished willingly and proved best of others. CHIEF KIMOSABI raced near the back in the early part, came around the turn four wide,
made an outside gain and was a clear third. SAUCY ARGUMENT void of early speed, came around the turn five wide, showed late interest, but was no real
factor. CABOCHON TREASURE pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and faded. HALF CRAZY raced in the middle of the field, saved ground
and put forth an even effort. VIKING LEGACY raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. MECKES PRIORITY raced within contention, came
around the turn on the outside and faded. COCAL pressed the pace, dropped back and was no threat late. RAZZ void of early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
HAMMERIN AAMER lacked early speed, moved up around the final turn, waited, lacked running room, weaved through traffic, angled inside and proved the
best. IT'S A BIRD raced near the back, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner but held on for 2nd. TAKEN BACK raced in the back of the
pack in the beginning, made a late rally and was outfinished for second. HAPPY BOY ROCKET raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no
real factor. MIDNIGHT CROWN raced evenly near the back, showed late interest, but was no threat. QUARTER RAT challenged for the early lead and
faded. PAYOFF CYCLE pressed the pace, came around the final turn three wide, took the lead and faded down the lane. GUITARTUITION PLZZ raced
within contention, came around the first turn on the outside and was finished early. APPLEWOOD lacked early speed, came around the first turn on the
outside and was never close. GUITARZAN dueled on the front end, drove clear and retreated to the back.
