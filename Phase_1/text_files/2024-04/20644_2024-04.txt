JET SET JULIET set the pace with a short lead, raced off the inside turning for home, responded when roused, dug in gamely and held well under urging for
the win. AUNT BERRA away alertly, stalked outside, chased the leaders on the turn, commenced a late rally outside and was gaining at the end. SANDY Q
stalked close up two wide, chased the winner on the turn, made a bid turning for home, dug in gamely and finished evenly in the final furlong. PRACTICAL
RACHEL was off slowly and steadied, outrun early, moved up entering the stretch, then closed belatedly on the rail. GOLDEN BLOSSOM chased on the
inside, chased on the turn and tired. ONTHISHARVESTMOON raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, then lacked a stretch rally.

SHE'S A LINO set a measured pace, shook loose when ready into the stretch and pulled away under moderate urging. SWEEPING PASSION settled wide
off the leaders, advanced on the turn and was easily second best. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS lacked speed, rallied very wide and was up for the show. FIVE
STAR FRAN pressed the winner inside down the backstretch and faltered. ONLY GIRL was eased back in early stages then always outrun. BLACK
DIAMOND RAIN saved ground under rating early and gave way. SHELBY SHORTSTOP stumbled at the start, quickly recovered then stopped on the turn.

sixteenth marker and edged away, driving. MR SANDMAN raced off the pace, moved up two wide on the turn, rallied between horses and finished well for
second. PROFESSOR KOOL raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and rallied on the rail in the stretch. ZAMBONI WARRIOR steadied after the
start, pulled in the early stages, chased two wide, went four wide past the quarter pole and rallied mildly outside in the lane. DEPOLI rushed up outside in
the early stages, took charge nearing the turn, drew clear, dueled int upper stretch, dug in and weakened in the final sixteenth. JEWELS IN THE BAY raced

THEARCHERORTHEPREY alternated for the advantage inside then pulled away in the stretch and was geared down in the late stages. MERRYCHILL
settled close up inside, angled out on the final turn and closed well for the place. JETS' DREAM dueled the eventual winner while leading at times to the
stretch then weakened. TWO MINUTE LICK dropped back inside, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened out. TEMPEST RISING raced off the
leaders three wide and faltered. VOLATILITY settled just off the pace in the two path and gave way.

back early, swung very wide into the stretch, led but was outfinished. BOOK RUNNER forced the pace outside, moved clear at the quarter pole and gamely
to wire. EGYPT settled off the leaders three wide, was asked on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. MAX BARLEY lagged far behind then offered
some late energy inside. COALVILLE led under pressure inside then was finished after three quarters. BIG ERN MCCRACKEN was well placed outside the

Footnotes
TEN GAUGE tracked on the inside, made a rail bid on the far turn, dueled briefly, took over, drew off and widened under urging. SIMOVITCH set the pace
racing with a short lead, dueled two wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner, then dug in gamely in the lane and saved the place spot. RICH'S
WAY was outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and closed well late for third. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE stalked close up
two wide, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened in the lane. TOUGH TICKETS raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, went two
wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. NEW COMMISSION was off slowly, raced off the pace with an inside trip and had no rally. TIME TO CRUISE stalked
close up three wide, chased four wide on the far turn and tired. JAMIE DREAMS raced three wide earlty, settled off the rail, off the pace and was outrun.
