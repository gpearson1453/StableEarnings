Footnotes
PROMISE CODE tracked the early leader two deep, dug in four wide late and prevailed under strong handling. R D C POSSE was off slowly, raced off the
early pace after the poor start, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. SMACKZILLA
was allowed to settle early, moved up five deep near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. TOUCHDOWN OKLAHOMA showed good
early foot to set the early pace along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DEN'S DYNASTY chased the pace from the inside under steady
urging and weakened. MAJOR PAYNE lost ground to race far back and was eased up on in the stretch run. The five eighths mile fractional time was
unavailable.

HE SAID WAIT pressed the early pace while racing between rivals, dug in late and just got up under all out pressure. RAHM settled off the early going,
moved up near the rail through the stretch run and just missed in a game effort. GOLDEN REBAL vied for the early lead near the rail and gave way
grudgingly late. MISSIN HOLLYWOOD stalked the pace, moved up five wide near the quarter pole from the outside of rivals and flattened out in the drive.
UPTOWN SOCIAL pressed the pace three wide from the outside of foes and faded in the drive. I WISH I COULD dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LINCOLNS BRISKET rushed up from the outside to press early on, took command inside the three sixteenths pole and finished well to draw clear under
strong handling. STORMSACOMIN was off a step slow, hard sent near the rail to set the early pace but was no match for the winner in the drive.
HOLCOMBE dropped back early, had an inside run and moved up to improve position. DIAMONDS R LUCKY pressed the early pace between rivals and
weakened through the drive. BIG BRAVE OKIE dropped back to race mid pack, raced three to four wide and had no final winning bid. DEROY dropped back
near the back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. TAKING ENERGY stalked the pace near the inside and faded. QUIET
JOURNEY lost ground to race far back and never threatened. The five eighths mile fractional time was unavailable.

SLEW'S LIAISON broke awkwardly, stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide around the far turn and finished well to edge clear under strong
handling. SUPPOSE YOU DREAM stalked the pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, shifted out five wide through the stretch run and finished
gamely to the wire. FORTY STRANGERS pressed the early going, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on gamel to the wire. KYEMBEA
set a pressured early pace along the inside and weakened through the drive. MINGUS dropped back to race mid pack early, swung five to six wide into the
upper stretch and had no late rally. GOSPEL DANDY chased the pace from the inside and faded. EASTER JIM raced three to four wide around the far turn
and had no response. LATENT SHADOW failed to menace.

Footnotes
GRACE THE LADY broke through the gate right before the other rivals had a chance to break, stewards ruled that Grace the Lady to be declared a
non-starter for an unfair start. HANGXIETY stalked the pace, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire while racing from the
outside. PEARL'S CODE chased the early pace, raced four wide near the near the three sixteenths pole and moved up late to improve position. DA CANDY
CANE vied for the early lead along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. VA VOOM raced four to five wide around the far turn and had no rally
while racing from the outside. GREEN LIGHT GIRL dropped back to race mid pack early, was five deep into the upper stretch, raced from the outside in the
lane and never was a factor. SERENDIPITY COCO was allowed to settle early, had an inside run and no late response. SAYAAD AIN'T SO pressed two
deep from the outside of rival and gave way. OUTWORKTHEOKIEGIRL was off slowly, angled in soon after the start to saved ground and never threatened.
UNITED SISTER raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. The five eighths fractional time was unavailable.
