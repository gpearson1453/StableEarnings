Footnotes
SATURDAY FLIRT broke half a beat slow, pursued from off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane,
offered a good kick to sweep past the leaders along with an inner rival at the furlong grounds and inched clear. BOIS BLANC tossed her head a bit
awkwardly leaving the gates, brushed an inner rival approaching the nine sixteenths pole before setting in midpack, took the turn in the three path before
shifting to the six path entering the lane, rallied along with an outer foe to bid at the furlong grounds, but failed to keep pace with that one in the late stages
and proved second best. FLIP FLOPS bumped with an inner foe leaving the gates, pressed the embattled leading pair, bid in the four path in upper stretch,
led briefly before being outkicked by an outer bidding pair at the furlong grounds, proved no match for them and safely held show. LOOKATMYBUCKLE was
hustled forward to duel for the lead with an inner rival early on, sustained the battle into the lane, but yielded to an outer trio at the furlong grounds.
COTILLARD broke a bit outwardly to counter inner-drifting foes at the start, stalked four wide into the turn, tucked to creep closer two wide and between
horses turning for home, encountered traffic entering the lane in the three path, tipped to the five path while getting outkicked by an outer pair in upper
stretch, and stayed on mildly. HER HOLY NAME broke outwardly carrying an outer foe with her at the start, tracked two wide and between horses before
moving to the inside into the turn, chased the leaders in upper stretch, but was put to hand behind foes entering the final furlong and lacked a challenge
thereafter. MATCH FIVE bumped with an outer foe at the start, sparred for the lead two wide then faded between horses entering midstretch. RIO DE PAZ
pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted out entering the lane before moving to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. BAYTOWN STORM
hopped and was floated outwardly by an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path and failed to factor. BIV took a light graze from an outer
foe approaching the nine sixteenths pole, steadied and faltered to the rear in the aftermath, took the turn in the four path and got outrun. GOTH broke
multiple lengths slow, then showed little in the two path.

Footnotes
BURNING PINE showed the way in the three path, shook free in upper stretch, cruised clear under no urging through the final furlong and playfully flopped
back to her left lead in the closing stages. LA MARINERA pressed the leader and eventual winner from the four path, chased that one in upper stretch while
hanging on her left lead, lugged inwardly while proving no match in midstretch and remained clear of the rest. SERGEANT CAPPS stumbled leaving the
gates yet broke in midpack, chased close up along the inside and under urging around the turn, proved no match for the top pair before meeting an outer
challenge for show at the sixteenth pole, dug in and saved that position via a head-bob. BAYTOWN BOO BOO brushed with an inner rival before bumping
an outer foe with his hind quarters at the start, was put to subtle crowded quarters between foes leaving the chute, pursued from midpack in the five to six
path, ran on hanging on his left lead to bid for show at the sixteenth pole, vied for that position late but missed the bob at the wire. SPIRIT RAGS broke
slowly, saved ground well back and moved up. MARIPOSA DE PISTA bumped with an inner rival and steadied back at the start, trailed in the three path,
moved out in upper stretch and improved position. SPUN LOVIN brushed an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide and between horses then faded through
the lane. BAYTOWN BULLEIT was urged along off of the pace in the four to five path and tired.

EXCELLENT QUESTION broke half a beat slow, settled off of the pace in the three to four path, shfited out to the six path entering the lane, rallied to bid
outside of rivals leaving the furlong grounds and drove clear. MRS. ASTOR brushed an inner rival at the start, trailed along the inside, tipped out entering
the backstretch, improved before taking the far turn in the three path, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly to reach place at the
wire. PALLOTTA SISTERS stalked behind the leader and just off of the fence, tipped to the three path to take aim outside of that one entering the lane, bid
between horses leaving the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival, then got nailed at the wire for place. SAKE (FR) pursued from midpack
along the inside, searched for racing room off the fence before committing to a rail charge in upper stretch, bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds,
but lacked the needed punch and got outkicked by outer rivals. NEW ROME tugged clear early on, led in hand around the far turn, but met challenges from
rivals on either side passing the furlong grounds and yielded between horses. UNDER ADVISEMENT tracked in the three path, advanced along with an
outer pulling-rival entering the backstretch, stalked closest to the leader approaching the far turn, but chased between horses around that bend, floated to
the four path entering the lane and gave way. SUPER STORMY pulled four wide around the first turn to track the leaders down the backstretch, chased in
the four path around the far turn then faded between horses. RIGHT NOW broke a step slow, got keen among foes early on, settled well back two wide,
trailed around the far turn and made little impact. MALAWNIA took light contact from an outer rival and shfited inwardly at the start, then saved ground off of
the pace to no avail.

Footnotes
BARBARA T prompted two wide, vied into the turn, led turning for home, then drew off under vigorous hand urging through the lane. SATIN BLUE stalked
three deep around the turn, ranged up to gain place entering the lane as the leader kicked clear, proved no match for that one and held place. TIRUPATI got
briefly keen among foes leaving the five furlong pole, pursued from midpack in the three path then moved up between horses at the furlong grounds.
AMERICAN FAIRYTALE tracked two wide and between horses into the turn, backed off and chased from the four to five path turning for home, then kept on
but lacked a bid. BARBTOURAGE broke a touch outwardly, raced forwardly along the inside, chased tipped out behind rivals entering the lane, moved to
the four path in upper stretch and yielded between foes. DEE MINUS led inside of an outer prompter into the turn, got headed by that one nearing the lane,
proved no match and weakened. RISKY SHOT lacked speed in the three path and between horses, then failed to factor. CORRI FELICE made little impact
from the two path. PONTRESINA broke a step slow and shied from an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside and tired. TOURING
WITH NETTA lacked speed in the four path despite rider's urging, trailed in the six path in upper stretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
NOMOS broke outwardly, pressed two wide, bid in the three path entering the lane, gained an advantage in midstretch and drove clear. THOMAS
AQUINAS broke inwardly and bothered a pair of inner rivals at the start, showed the way inside of the eventual winner, got headed by that one in midstretch,
yielded through the final furlong and saved place at the wire. SWISS SLANG pursued from midpack along the inside, took the far turn in the two path,
shifted out five wide in midstretch and rallied to miss place at the wire. TOUGH LITTLE NUT was bumped and bothered by an outer rival at the start, raced
off of the pace four wide into the first turn, advanced position entering the backstretch, pressed the top pair into and around the far turn, vied for show in the
four path in the final furlong but was outkicked by an outer rival. IRIS'S DREAM tugged between horses into the first turn, tracked two wide, then chased
among foes in the final furlong but lacked a bid. UNCLE TRULY stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before yielding. ODE
TO BALIUS pursued from midpack three wide, shfited to the five path entering the lane, but hung on his left lead and gave way. MCAVOY was eased back
while keen between horses early on, steadied in crowded quarters passing the wire for the first time, then saved ground towards the rear to no avail.
QUOKKA laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shfited to the six path into upper stretch and failed to factor. BLUE CREEK was bumped by an
outer rival, put to crowded quarters between horses, and steadied back at the start, trailed two to four wide, fanned to the seven path into upper stretch and
got outrun.

MULLIKIN set the pace in the two path, kicked away from an outer presser entering the lane and drew off under a drive. CHANCE was slow into stride,
trailed in the two to three path, then rallied between horses to edge place from an outer rival in the final sixteenth. TIVY brushed an outer rival at the start,
stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, but faded in upper stretch and lasted for show late. VINCO was brushed
between horses at the start, tracked in the four path, got outkicked for show by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, kept on in hopes of re-achieving that
position from a tiring rival at the wire, but missed. MIRACLE WORKER tracked two wide and between horses, chased along the inside nearing the lane,
then lacked a bid and yielded. ONE GIANT LEAP stumbled at the start, raced forwardly along the inside, chased into the turn, but gave way around the
bend and failed to menace. MOREAU brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four to five path and failed to factor. BALTASAR
lacked speed in the three to four path while between horses and made little impact.

Footnotes
WHERE YA AT VINCE broke outwardly, rushed forward while wide down the backstretch, bid and sparred for the lead two wide around the turn, gained an
advantage in upper stretch, inched clear in the final furlong and held from a pair of fast-closing bidders late. TROUBLE'S ROARING pursued from midpack
in the two to three path, briefly encountered traffic entering the lane in the five path before tipping out to the seven path in upper stretch, then rallied in the
final furlong to attempt a bid in hopes of reeling in the leader on the wire, but missed. WORLD RECORD chased forwardly along the inside, rallied shifting to
the three to four path entering the final sixteenth, bid along with an outer rival approaching the wire but missed between horses. ALCOVE led early on, vied
with an outer bidder around the turn, got headed by that one in upper stretch and yielded in the final furlong. BRODY broke a step slow, tracked in the four
path, floated to the five to six path in upper stretch, got outkicked for minor placings in midstretch and chased thereafter. STINGER BEE stalked in the two
path, chased drifting to the four to five path in upper stretch, got outkicked for minor placings by rivals on either side leaving the furlong grounds and lacked
a bid. SWEET AS SIN laid off of the pace in the four path and failed to factor. BECKSTER made little impact from the two path. FRIO RIVER trailed in the
two path before swinging to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. YO BANANA BOY lacked speed in the three path and never got involved.
LEAN MUSIC MACHINE bobbled at the start, lacked speed along the inside and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
CHOP CHOP tracked along the inside, then two wide and between horses around the second turn, ranged up three deep around the far turn, bid outside of
the leader entering the lane, led in upper stretch, drove clear and held sway. ATOMIC BLONDE (GER) was allowed to settle at the rear along the inside
around the first two turns, tracked two wide and between horses around the far turn, then ran on in the four path to gain place at the furlong grounds, chased
the leader home and proved second best. VERGARA brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked two wide, pressed the leader from the three path
around the second turn, gained an advantage in the two path into the far turn, met an outer challenge turning for home, proved no match for that one in
upper stretch and gave way. TOWER BRIDGE stalked along the inside, got shuffled back behind a faltering foe around the final turn, shifted out entering
upper stretch and moved up. TIC TIC TIC BOOM settled off of the pace two wide, floated three to four wide around the second turn, stayed wide around the
final turn and never got involved. LOVELY PRINCESS brushed with an outer foe at the start, showed the way in the two path, got headed by an outer rival
into the far turn, wknd turning for home, caved and was found to have bled.
