Footnotes
DREAMING OF ABBA led the way up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and drew off in the lane. FLUFFY stalked the leader on the
outside early, navigated the bend from the three path and chased on in the lane but was no match for the winner. DANNEEL chased the leader on the inside
through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the two path and kept on to the wire but was no match for the winner. BAHAMIAN BABY raced off the
pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and showed no kick. COLE'S VALENTINE hopped up and bumped with the horse to
his inside leaving the gate, trailed the field through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. MY JANNET bumped with the horse
to her outside at the break, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and was empty in the lane.
