Footnotes
FASTNFURIOUS was quickly clear of the others, saved ground, drifted out some upper stretch, was corrected, all out the last eighth and kept SOUPER
FORTUNE at bay. SOUPER FORTUNE bumped from both sides at the break, progressed just off the inside, moved to the rail nearing the quarter pole,
closed well deep stretch but came up short. SAND MOUNTAIN jostled between horses at the start, moved to the outside early on, raced widest the rest of
the way and also found best stride too late the final furlong. JACK VAN BERG broke inward, initiating a chain reaction of bumping, raced closest to
FASTNFURIOUS from just outside, also drifted out some upper stretch, was straightened and finished evenly. FEROCITY failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
KEEP ATTACKING shared the lead inside TIZWOW while in hand, moved clear from just off the inside entering the lane, gradually drifted out but held sway
under steady handling. TIZWOW vied for the lead outside KEEP ATTACKING, did not keep up leaving the turn, drifted out under left-handed pressure upper
stretch, was straightened with a furlong to go, lacked the needed late kick but was unchallenged for the place. JUSTICEONEMORETIME in contention
early, did not stay close on the turn, fanned out some for the drive, showed a willingness to run late between rivals and edged ahead for third late.
CHARTED made a large leap into the air when the gate opened, was soon prompting the pacesetters from inside then leveled off for the drive. CHARLIE'S
BEACH forwardly placed from outside, lost ground widest taking the bend, altered in when his path was taken upper stretch and also showed a willingness
to run in the late going. DRAGGING MAIN showed litte.

Footnotes
TU ROYAL shared the lead inside rivals, battled through the stretch, edged ahead inside the last furlong and held sway. GOLD OAK contested the pace
outside from the beginning, was three wide taking the bend, gained a narrow advantage upper stretch, fought gamely to the wire but had to settle for second
best. PADDY GAL well placed from inside, did not keep up after two furlongs, angled out through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, was no match for
the top pair but pulled clear for third late. RAIN ATTACK displayed early speed between rivals, began to yield upper stretch, was steadied briefly behind
GOLD OAK inside the furlong marker, altered out some and continued to flatten. GOT NO MORE TEARS reluctant to load, broke a step slow and inward,
bumping JANIE LEE, progressed from inside on the turn then ran evenly the rest of the way. HARPER BRIANA chased running widest and only passed a
few tired ones in the lane. CUPID'S HOPE hesitated at the start, angled in early on and was never a factor. JANIE LEE was bumped at the break and faded
two wide on the turn. KONA KONNECT chased between rivals then also gave way on the bend.

Footnotes
SPICY DELIGHT stalked the early speed, commenced her bid three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, drew off under urging and proved
much the best ridden out the last eighth. JUST AT MIDNIGHT prominent from outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn, took over second
inside the final furlong and pulled away for the place late. SILVER EYES in contention early, was three wide on the bend, lost ground swinging widest for the
drive and gained third deep stretch. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE pressed AIR GERRI from just outside, began to yield on the turn, came three wide into the
lane, lugged in some inside the final eighth and finished evenly. HER SPEAKER'S ON chased from inside, came off the rail slightly entering the stretch
trying to gain a clear path to attempt a bid in tight quarters, was steadied back nearing the sixteenth marker and altered out. DANCIN' MOLLY void of speed,
stayed off the inside on the turn, floated out into the stretch and made up minor ground without threatening. AIR GERRI was sent to set the pace from inside
but gave way for the drive. WILDISH showed little.

Footnotes
TROY OUNCE shared the lead outside UPBEAT MELODY, edged ahead when urged in the lane, drew clear inside the last furlong, began to drift out in the
waning yards but held on. D' YANK forwardly placed from inside, altered outside TROY OUNCE upper stretch, took over second nearing the sixteenth pole,
came up short for the win but was clearly second best. TAPIT SAM in contention early, failed to keep up while just off the inside through the turn, altered out
five wide for a clear path upper stretch, rallied too late but drew off for third in the waning yards. UPBEAT MELODY broke alertly, was quickly clear of the
others and taken inside, challenged nearing the end of a quarter mile and flattened out the final furlong. IMPERIAL MOMENT was a factor from outside for a
half mile, came four wide into the lane and had no late bid. NOT AGAIN JACKIE jostled with WILDWOOD MINISTRY while in tight quarters midway on the
backstretch, moved clear for third from path three on the turn then also flattened out for the drive. WILDWOOD MINISTRY caught in close quarters early,
jostled with NOT AGAIN JACKIE nearing the end of a furlong and a half then began to yield from between rivals with three furlongs to go. ARGYBARGY
BUCK was away somewhat slowly, stayed unnecessarily wide as he steadily retreated from the rest of the field, was eased through the stretch and walked
off.

MYSWEETANNALYZE prominent between horses, lost her path nearing the turn, was just off the rail on the bend, steadily altered out upper stretch trying to
gain a clear path, got an opening outside BLAME TERI midstretch, was gradually force out to stay clear of the latter, vied for the lead with a sixteenth left
and moved clear nearing the wire. MISS DUTTON well placed from inside, did not stay close through the turn, rallied in the lane, also dueled for the lead the
last sixteenth and did not have enough left the final thirty yards. BLAME TERI pressed LUCKSME from outside, lost ground staying outside the latter taking
the bend, drifted out as she battled on the front end upper stretch, was forced out further by LUCKSME deep stretch and began to wear down the last
seventy yards. LUCKSME was sent to set a pressured pace from just off the inside, floated out some on the turn, gradually drifted out through the lane as
she fought for the lead and also began to yield in the waning yards. TORTUGA ISLAND was away slowly and never a factor. TAPICITA raced in contention
from outside, lost ground five wide through the bend, gradually angled out as those inside her came out upper stretch then gave way the last furlong.

Footnotes
VIVA VIOLENCE without early speed, began to close the gap from along the rail on the turn, gained a clear path two wide at the top of the stretch, took over
inside the final furlong then steadily opened up under confident handling. HELEN MAE'S SONG raced closest to the early leader from just outside, floated
out some into the lane, loomed a threat three wide just inside the furlong marker, was no match for VIVA VIOLENCE, drew clear for second inside the last
sixteenth then could only just hold her position late. TEMPLUNA moved toward the outside midway on the backstretch, was three wide on the turn, swung
out wider into the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressure upper stretch, was straightened and gradually closed the gap the rest of the way. WARM
BEAUTY was a step slow at the break, trailed from inside, picked up her pace in the stretch and altered out some in the waning yards for a clear path
outside SMILE AT THE STORM. The latter sprinted clear of the rest soon after the start, saved ground taking the bend then began to wear down for the
drive. MINI DRESS failed to menace.
