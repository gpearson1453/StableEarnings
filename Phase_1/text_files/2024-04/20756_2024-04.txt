Footnotes
PUT THE CRAZY AWAY broke a touch outwardly at the start, chased closest to the top pair from the two path around the turn, shifted outside of them with
multiple lengths to find entering the lane, sustained slow progress to drive past those rivals entering the final sixteenth, cleared and held sway from an outer
late challenger. SHE'S ALWAYS ROSIE tracked in the three path, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied to reach place in the final sixteenth and was
gaining on the leader late. LADY ABERDEEN vied along the inside, prompted while headed nearing the lane, sustained the battle into the final furlong, but
was outkicked by an outer pair of rivals in the late stages before reclaiming show. GOLDEN DEGREE vied with an inner rival while in the four to three path
into the turn, led narrowly turning for home, clung to an advantage from his inner counterpart through midstretch, but was bested by an outer bidder at the
sixteenth pole, gave in and lost show late. GIFT GORGEOUS brushed with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path, moved down to
the two path entering the lane and failed to factor. WEST COAST HARBOR saved ground off of the pace to no avail. TAN LINES bumped the outer stall
doors while leaving the gates slow, shied from an inner rival in the aftermath, trailed in the three path and was outrun. MS I SPEIGHT brushed with an inner
rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path, weakened nearing the lane and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
WINAKACHING stalked outside of the top pair, loomed a danger around the turn, bid turning for home before taking charge entering the lane and drew off
under vigorous hand urging. PENNY'S SMILE took light contact from an inner foe at the start, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, steadied while
hard to handle entering the turn, settled into stalking stride to pursue from the two path around the bend, tipped out to the four path entering the lane and
ran on to edge place at the sixteenth pole. ZEN MOMENT vied for the lead two wide, then between horses turning for home as an outer bidder joined the
fray, proved no match for that one entering upper stretch, then lost place with a sixteenth to go. UP ON THE EDGE pursued from midpack in the three path,
tipped to the five path entering the lane and pursued while one paced. CLASSY'N CONNECTED lacked speed in the three to four path, fanned out to the
seven path entering the lane and moved up. EVOCATION trailed approaching the turn, advanced four wide around the bend before shifting to the six path
entering the lane, but flattened out between horses. ABOVE ALL ELSE broke a bit outwardly and brushed a foe at the start, raced off of the pace along the
inside, took the turn in the two path, shifted a bit wider in upper stretch and failed to threaten between horses. PRINCESS IS OLIVIA dueled for the lead with
an outer rival, got headed inside of a pair of foes turning for home and gave way entering upper stretch. SAILING broke a step slow while last away, raced
at the rear in the three path, swung out to the eight path entering the lane and lacked a rally. QUEEN ANNA T laid off of the pace in the two path and failed
to factor. AARALYN raced off of the pace three wide, then between horses around the turn and made little impact. ICE WATER tracked along the inside and
faded around the turn.

Footnotes
MR SKYLIGHT vied two wide and between horses, dueled with an outer rival while remaining a path off of the inside around the turn, shifted to the three
path entering the lane, shook free of his outer counterpart in midstretch and held sway. KNICKS STORM tracked three wide, took aim on the top pair from
the five path entering the lane, sustained a gradual grind to edge place in the final sixteenth but needed more to reel in the leader. IRIDESCENT vied three
deep early on, sustained the battle with an inner foe while taking the turn in the three path, failed to maintain even terms in the four path in upper stretch,
slowly yielded in midstretch and lost place to an outer rival in the final sixteenth. ONE RED CENT laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed around the
turn, fanned out to the five path entering the lane and improved position. MOTOR CITY tracked while off of the pace two wide, chased along the rail in upper
stretch, lacked a bid and tired. NAVE prompted inside of the top pair early on, but gave way into the turn and faded.

Footnotes
BARAYE bumped an outer rival at the start, pressed two wide, bid entering the lane, dueled and wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, inched clear
and held sway. TWIRL AROUND stalked along the inside, tipped three wide to take aim on the new leader in midstretch, gained place at the sixteenth pole
while chasing that one and fended off an inner bidder for that position. CLOUDWALKER broke a step slow and took contact from an inner rival at the start,
pursued from midpack along the inside, encountered mild traffic in the two path in upper stretch, ran on in the final furlong to offer an inside bid for place in
the late stages, but was denied. NUMERO SEIS bumped with an inner rival at the start before taking contact from that one again shortly after, stalked three
deep, chased the leading pair while getting floated four wide in midstretch, then lacked a bid and held a minor reward. CANDY BAR bumped with an outer
rival leaving the gates, then was jostled by an inner foe back into his outer counterpart and put to crowded quarters between them shortly after, lacked
speed along the inside, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. WORK OF FICTION pursued from midpack three wide, shfited to the
five path entering the lane and failed to threaten. ROYAL FLOWER showed the way inside of a pressing foe, dueled with that bidder entering the lane, but
got headed in midstretch and weakened. RUTHLESS RUA pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and
failed to factor. BEST KISS YET was jostled by an inner rival into an outer foe and steadied back at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, spun
for home in the four path and subtly yielded. GOLD DEL MAR bumped an outer rival while off a beat slow at the start, pulled keenly behind foes early on,
then made little impact from the two path. WILD IRISH was slow into stride, trailed in the two path, entered the lane in the seven to eight path and was
outrun. CADENCIA pursued from midpack three wide and between horses, checked into the turn, pursued further back from the four to six path and faded.

Footnotes
SYSTEMIC CHANGE laid speed in the two to three path around the first turn, gained ground in the four path around the far turn, bid in the five path entering
the lane, battled with an inner rival before wresting an advantage at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. FROMANOTHAMUTHA stalked the leader from
the three path, bid turning for home before gaining an advantage entering the lane as an outer foe loomed a danger, dueled with that one through upper
stretch, but was bested at the furlong grounds and was well clear of show. DIVINE ARMOR broke a step slow, chased from midpack in the three path, got
outmoved by an outer bidder turning for home, kept on to claim show at the furlong grounds and held that position. BIRD KING trailed in the three to four
path around the first turn, moved out of last around the far turn, then surpassed tired rivals late to reach fourth at the wire. SAQEEL tracked along the inside,
chased around the far turn and lacked a bid. DIRECT LINE showed the way along the inside, but was headed by a pair of outer rivals entering the lane and
weakened. BEYOND BEST broke a step slow, raced off of the pace tucking to the inside around the first turn and was done early.

Footnotes
MISREAD tracked along the inside, offered a bid up a vacated rail in upper stretch, drove clear and held late. OLIVIA MARALDA (IRE) laid off of the pace in
the two path, encountered traffic in the four path leaving upper stretch, tipped inwardly entering the final sixteenth to rally between horses, and reached
place at the wire. SACRED WISH pursued from midpack in the three to four path, shifted to the six path entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge in
take aim on the clear leader late, but needed more and got nailed by an inner foe at the wire for place. ONE SILK STOCKING stuttered a step at the start,
pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room in the tow path around the far turn, paused before tipping inside of rivals in upper stretch then
stayed on willingly and missed place at the wire. QUALITY STAR broke a step slow, trailed along the inside early on, took the far turn four wide, fanned out
to the seven path at the top of the lane and stayed on while shifting a touch inwardly. GLITTERING LIGHTS (GB) broke a step slow, saved ground well back
and moved up. SAMAY (PER) stalked two wide, pursued within striking range turning for home, but entered the lane in the four path before taking contact
from an inner rival in upper stretch, and faded between horses. WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE tracked two wide, pursued in the three path and between horse
around the far turn, but was put to cramped quarters in the five path and among foes in upper stretch, then tired. PLEASANT PASSAGE laid off of the pace
in the four to three path and tired. STORM BAY lacked speed in the two to three path, altered out to the eight path in upper stretch and failed to factor.
MOON RAY (FR) set a clear pace, vacated the inner railing entering the lane, got headed by an inner rival while drifting into an outer foe in upper stretch,
then caved between horses.

Footnotes
SARIR showed the way in the two path, met an outer challenge turning for home, shook free of that bidder in upper stretch, yet dug in to brace for that foe's
re-bid entering the final sixteenth, and gamely clung to an advantage to the wire. SOUNDBITE broke a step slow, then steadied in tight quarters between
horses early on while in the chute, shifted out and gained in hand in the five path and outside of rivals down the backstretch, tracked from the four path into
the turn, bid outside of the leader tucking the three path leaving the five sixteenths pole, but was turned way in upper stretch, kept on into the final furlong to
offer a re-bid at the sixteenth pole, sparred through the late stages but missed. ALICIT INTENTION laid off of the pace three wide, tracked from the four path
around the turn, then sustained grinding progress to take aim on the top pair in the late stages, but needed more. HALSTYN ROSE stalked along the inside,
chased up the rail through the lane, but took an awkward stride traveling over a break in the inner rail's shadow at the sixteenth pole, yielded and saved
fourth. ILLUSION broke a beat slow, tracked two wide and between horses, got shuffled back behind a faltering foe turning for home, moved out to the four
path in upper stretch and came again willingly, but missed reaching fourth. OH MY MIA pressed the leader from the three path then faded between horses
at the five sixteenths pole. JUSTIFY PERFECTION trailed in the five path and made little impact.

Footnotes
SILVER KNOTT (GB) prompted the pace two wide, gained an advantage approaching the five sixteenths pole, kicked away in upper stretch and held well.
MISSED THE CUT pursued from midpack two wide, tugged in the four path and between horses entering the backstretch, prompted briefly before stalking
two wide and between horses around the final bend, inched forward to gain place from an outer rival in upper stretch, then chased the clear leader home
and held place from an outer late bidder. BOLD ACT (IRE) was hustled forward after breaking a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, got rank
around the first turn, remained unsettled around the second bend, pulled off of the inside entering the backstretch, advanced between horses leaving the
five furlong pole, stalked along the inside around the final turn, got shuffled back behind the tiring early leader approaching the lane, shifted out entering it,
split foes in the four path in upper stretch, ran on willingly gradually closing in on the top pair in the final furlong and missed reaching place. KING CURLIN
stalked along the inside, lost position to outer rivals approaching the nine sixteenths pole, pursued from the two path further back around the far turn, then
stayed on to edge show from outer rivals entering the final sixteenth. HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) tracked two wide, tugged under firm restraint around the
second turn, advanced with outer rivals entering the backstretch, prompted the leaders briefly before stalking three wide into and around the far turn, but
lacked a bid and faded between horses. LUCKY CURLIN laid off of the pace in the two path, moved between horses before shifting to the five path entering
the lane, and failed to menace. WENTRU showed the way inside of a prompting foe, got headed by that one around the final turn and caved through the
lane. DYNADRIVE lifted his head as the gates sprung and broke two lengths slow, raced at the rear in the three path, tugged four to five wide around the far
turn to advance outside of rivals entering the backstretch, briefly achieved forward position before backing off with nine sixteenths to go, took the far turn
three wide before being floated to the six path entering the lane, and tired. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) lacked speed along the inside, trailed and was outrun.

Footnotes
KINGSBARNS settled quickly after getting a bit keen between rivals entering the first turn, tracked two to three wide around that bend, pressed the new
leader under coaxing around the far turn, bid entering the lane, forged an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear in the final furlong. WAR CAMPAIGN
stalked two wide, led in hand leaving the three furlong pole as an outer rival pressed, dug in to resist that foe's bid entering the lane, but was headed by that
one in upper stretch, fought on until the furlong grounds and was second best. ARCHIE THE GIZA pursued from midpack three to four wide around the first
turn, chased the turning for home and ran on willingly. TIME FOR TROUBLE laid off of the pace in the two path, pursued in the five path and between
horses turning for home, then stayed on in the six path along with an inner rival for a minor share. DYNAMIC ONE was off a step slow while last away,
trailed along the inside, tipped to the four to five path entering the lane and stayed mildly. SURLY FURIOUS tracked along the inside, chased under urging
in the two path around the far turn and gave way. SMILE HAPPY pursued from midpack along the inside, chased in the four path into the far turn and faded.
LAUGHING BOY set a clear pace, but was headed at the three furlong pole and weakened. HAPPY AMERICAN laid off of the pace in the four to six path,
then tired before being eased through the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
ALL I WANT IS YOU broke slowly, saved ground well back, surged between rivals at the furlong grounds to bid inside of the leader leaving that station, and
kicked clear. PROUD MARY laid off of the pace along the inside, split foes in the four path in upper stretch and ran on to edge place late. PAROLA SICURA
tracked three wide, bid in upper stretch, led into midstretch but was outkicked by an inner bidder leaving the furlong grounds and lost place late. EMPIRES
PRINCESS laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, swung to the seven path entering the lane and rallied. CABERNEIGH chased forwardly along
the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and failed to menace. DEFINITE DIVA leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide
and between horses, tipped to the four path turning for home, floated to the six path in upper stretch and failed to threaten between horses. INTEGRATED
DESIGN stalked in the two path, bid outside of the leader entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and yielded. AGENT laid off
of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and failed to factor. SWEET DUTCHESS lacked speed in the four to eight path and
made little impact. GOLDEN DAGGER broke a step slow and made little impact along the inside. FAST LANI leaned in and brushed a foe at the start,
pursued from midpack in the four to five path and tired between horses in upper stretch. BOBBIE SOX set a clear pace, but was caught in upper stretch and
weakened.
