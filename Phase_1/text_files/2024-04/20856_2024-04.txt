Footnotes
HOBBIE CLASS took control from the onset, was unopposed setting the terms upfront through the turn and was kept to the task in the lane for the
comfortable win in the end. SLOANS SKY stalked near the back on the rail in the beginning, improved position inside going into the turn, was urged at the
quarter pole swinging outside in the four path at the top of the lane and closed resolutely to easily best the rest at the wire. QUEEN SAHARA chased the
leader in the early stages of the race, was in touch with frontrunning winner when they straightened out for home, could not offer a serious rally late and
evened out on the rail holding for third money. KINDOFBLUEKITTEN broke inwards on the start, settled outside foes in midfield along the backside, angled
out widest in the five path turning for home and finished up mildly for a minor role. CLASSIC GLORY was void of speed trailing in the early stages, was in
tight surroundings on the fence just slightly tapping on the brakes at the three eighths marker and was one paced when clear inside during the stretch run.
IRON PRINCESS tracked three wide on the outside down the backside, continued in the three path watching the frontrunner on the turn, was in range of the
pacesetting winner at the top of the lane but could not find more late and emptied out in the final sixteenth. BAMBOO'S BABE was brushed outside on the
break, settled in mid-pack between runners down the back straight, could not make a run when asked around the bend and made little presence in the drive
to the wire.

Footnotes
SUMMER SNOW shook clear from the field at the start, was unchallenged setting the pace on the turn and was never threatened down the lane for an
impressive front end score. MI TORMENTA tracked all alone on the rail in the third flight entering the turn, offered a solid move to get into contention,
loomed the be the only threat to the winner at the top of the stretch but was no match for that one who had plenty left for the drive. MISS BOBBIT stalked
outside in the beginning stages, improved position outside foes going around the turn and gamely fought in the stretch winning the show battle late.
CHARLOTTE'S SILVER travelled near the rear on the rail in the early going, started to pass runners three wide outside with three furlongs to go, had a good
turn of foot running around the bend but lost the contest for show in the last sixteenth. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ settled between foes midfield down the
backside, was checked mildly on the fence around the quarter pole and finished up with some intent passing tired runners down the lane. SWEET FINALE
was chasing the frontrunner three wide at the half, could not maintain position when asked at the three eighths marker between rivals and backed away
through the turn. DEVIL IN HER HEART sat behind the loose frontrunner four wide down the back straight, was urged trying to maintain the place position
outside running around the bend and faltered on the rail in mid-stretch. MORE SAVVY was unhurried trailing on the inside down the back straight, moved
outside three wide off a troubled runner going into the turn but could not offer a rally in the stretch drive. LADY IN RED settled on the rail in the chasing
group in the early going, was erratic losing action on the fence at the seven sixteenths marker losing multiple positions and was not a factor in the drive to
the finish.

Footnotes
BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS broke inwards at the start, emerged with the lead by the half mile marker, opened up under a snug hold going around the bend and
cruised home for the victory. TAPPING OUT A TUNE was brushed outside to begin, travelled outside in mid-pack at the half, offered a good move three
wide getting into contention around the bend but chased the winner in vain down the stretch. CELENTANO was nestled on the rail watching the top duo
down the backstretch, rallied on the fence with a quarter left to run, swung out three wide for the drive and finished up to be a clear but non threatening third
at the wire. LADY XI was allowed to settle seeing the field inside down the backside, started a rail run going by a runner at the quarter pole and finished up
with mild intent to garner a small share in the end. MIAH SAID pressed the issue outside in the early stages, was then scrubbed on with rivals on either side
chasing the loose winner at the quarter pole and gave way at the top of the stretch. FRAC CITY had one rival beaten down the back straight, could not
mount a rally outside horses on the turn, swung out widest in the six path for the drive but could not get involved through the stretch run.

Footnotes
ROCK TO FAME broke on top as soon as the gates opened up, had clear advantage all alone with no pressure at the three furlong marker, extended the
advantage turning for home and was reminded right handed a few times to stay interested for the drive, winning quite comfortably in the end. CRIMINAL
INTENT chased the loose winner going around the bend, gave way for place share inside at the quarter pole and showed some grit to re-rally getting back
up for second money through the stretch. COUNTRY LIVING tracked the winner four deep along the backstretch, improved position outside with three
furlongs to go and battled for the runners up share down the lane but just missed holding on at the wire. FAST AND READY had a rail trip being a part of the
tracking foursome in the beginning, kept pace with rivals travelling on the fence throughout the turn, shifted outside to the four path for the run down the
stretch and finished up evenly for a minor role. FASCINATION STREET tracked the winner three wide with foes on each side at the half, could not keep
pace with rivals making a move at the three eighths marker and was not a presence when running down the lane. PANYARD TAP was in tight quarters
between foes at the break to trail the field in the early going, made little headway saving ground around the turn and had little finish to offer in the lane.
FOREST FLASH was brushed inside on the break to have one rival beaten down the back straight, offered little run three wide outside foes through the turn
and had nothing to give for the drive to the finish line.

Footnotes
ESSEX SERPENT kept a close eye on the frontrunner in the early stages of the race, was roused for more at the top pf the lane, switched leads at the
furlong marker then drew away convincingly in the late stages. HAPPY QUAD took command from the onset, set the pace while being measured by the
winner on the turn, tried to shake clear up front at the top of the lane but was no match in deep stretch. LUCKY ROMANCE trailed the field along the
backstretch, continued to see the pack running on the turn, angled out five wide for the drive and closed smartly to capture the show money in the last jump.
SECRET THREAT broke outwards on the start, travelled three deep outside foes in midfield down the backside, kept pace with others while going four wide
outside horses around the bend, was in with a chance outside straightening for home but lacked a finish in deep stretch. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA had a
good trip settling nicely behind the winner in the early stages, came under a ride on the rail with two furlongs to go, could not quicken with others making a
move and faded inside down the lane. FROST BITTEN travelled down the backstretch in mid-pack between runners, was urged for more with five sixteenths
left to run, had little response and could not offer a rally in the running down the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY ONYX (IRE) was allowed to settle near the rear to start, began to extend her stride splitting foes at the quarter pole, shifted out for clear run in the five
path looming boldly at the top of the lane, drifted inwards under left handed asking in mid stretch but cleared off going away nicely for the win when crossing
the wire. FIRING BULLETS stalked near the back in the early going, improved while saving all the ground throughout the turn and made a good rail run in
the stretch to be a solid runner up in the end. BOLT ENOREE stumbled badly on the break, recovered by the half to force the pace outside running around
the oval and showed some grit still fighting on to the end, fighting back to capture third money with a gutsy performance. MASTER ARAGORN had a slim
advantage outside in the beginning, was then hounded outside by a rival when running throughout the turn, put away that foe entering upper stretch, could
not find more late and tired between horses in the last sixteenth. WILDFIRE was under a snug hold inside behind the pacesetter at the half, had a good spot
on the rail watching the embattled duo around the bend, shifted outside for the drive, was in tight quarters at the furlong pole, could not get a full run and
stalled in deep stretch. ROCKET RILEY could see the field inside going down the backside, was scrubbed on for more on the rail in the turn, could not close
on rivals and passed a weary runner in the stretch. SWEET CHARLIZE tracked the engaged pair outside down the backstretch, was hard ridden mid-turn
but was losing ground and emptied out at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
MISS VYVYANNE emerged with a clear lead putting away an early challenge for the front at the half, cruised around the turn up top with no opposition and
was well rationed setting the pace to have something left, holding off the closer by a diminishing margin in the end. VERDEJO had one beaten down the
backstretch, began to lengthen stride picking up rivals outside at the quarter pole and was full of run late to make it interesting at the wire. IMA BEAST had a
good spot watching the front two at the half, kept an even pace in the middle of the pack running on the bend, angled to the four path at the top of the
stretch and finished with intent to garner the show award. BOTTA SWING travelled in midfield on the outside down the back straight, moved outside dueling
for second around the turn and faded at the eighth pole saving for a minor share in the end. YA MAR was unhurried settling near the rear in the beginning,
closed the gap on runners smartly advancing on the rail through the turn to be in the mix for a share at the top of the lane, lost her path behind horses at the
furlong marker and could not get involved late. FOOLISH GAMES was roused with intent on getting the lead, could not match strides with the winner at the
half, chased the pace inside but to no avail on the turn and folded on the rail in the last furlong. VEERY reared on the brake spotting the field, could no get
involved around the turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive. STEWRADS INQUIRY REGARDING THE START OF #5 VEERY RESULTED IN NO

Footnotes
SABATINI tracked the engaging front two with runners on either side at the half, closed in outside horses at the quarter pole, was gaining steadily in the
three path at the top of the stretch and found another gear when switching leads at the furlong marker to draw away impressively in the late stages of the
race. MYSTIC LAKE had the lead while hounded outside in the early parts of the race, gave way up top while on the rail at the quarter pole and gamely
rebid to garner second money on the fence in deep stretch. DANCING DUCHESS prompted the pace on the outside down the backstretch, poked her head
in front with two furlongs to go, battled between foes in mid -stretch clinging to the lead but weakened in the final sixteenth to be a clear third. ROSA
watched the top two do battle while settled on the rail at the half,, was nudged for more at the five sixteenths marker trying to go with the eventual winner on
her outside, could not keep up but had enough through the lane to hold on to be a fringe player at the wire. C C ROYAL tracked outside three deep in the
second flight along the back straight, could not keep pace three wide by mid-turn and did not offer a rally in the drive to the wire. WINSOME BEAUTY
stalked on the outside near the back in the early stages, could not really get interested even when urged through the turn and made little impact down the
lane. MISS ROBERTS (GB) was squeezed at the start to trail, made little impression when asked around the bend and gave way to a rival in the stretch.

Footnotes
STAR CANDY settled in mid-field inside at the half mile marker, tracked comfortably in no rush outside throughout the turn, began to reel in the front two at
the quarter pole and with a strong late burst under left handed encouragement surged on by in the final furlong. OL' BLONDIE broke through the gate prior
to the start, tracked the lone speed at the half, moved in to seize command outside turning for home but could not hold off the fast closing winner in deep
stretch. AMERICAN STARLET took control from the start, set the pace down the backside, continued on the front end along the bend, was collared outside
at the top of the stretch, offered no resistance to that rival and faded while still hanging on to be a distant third in the end. SACRED DANCER travelled three
deep in mid-pack along the back straight, was shuffled back to last going four wide outside foes at the three furlong marker and found a little more to pass
tired rivals in the stretch run. FOREST DRIFT stalked inside near the rear after the start, had a good tracking position saving ground on the inside into the
turn, could not find more to get into contention at the top of the lane and made little presence in the drive on the rail. JILL missed the break after the delay
spotting the field in the early going, caught up to runners by the half, retreated back to the rear around the turn and could no be a factor in the stretch.

CLARAYOUTHEBEST settled off the leaders, stalked into the turn, moved out seven wide turning for home, surged clear the final seventy yards. I'M
TENACIOUS settled at the rear, began to pick it up leaving the turn, shifted nine wide coming out of that bend, loomed a threat in late stretch but was only
second best. AZIEL stalked mid-division, went three then four wide on the turn, showed good late stride but was simply not enough. OLIVIA'S MELODY
chased from off the inside racing two to three wide, was ridden along past the three-eighths, kept on one-paced. FEATHERWEIGHT stalked then pressed
the pace three deep, weakened. TIME TO WATCH went straight to the lead, set the pace from off the rail in the two path facing outside pressure into the
turn, weakened in late stretch. MO TWILIGHT was well-placed stalking from outside, travelled four to five wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch.
GOLDEN SPRING was strongly urged from the break, chased the pace inside, faded. POWAQA was devoid of early speed and never near enough to
threaten.
