late wide gain and was a clear third at the wire. COZY GEM raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid down the home stretch and hung. MOON TRIP
raced evenly near the back in the early going, improved position, but was no factor. I NITA WARRIOR broke a step slow, rushed up, pressed the pace on
the front and faded. MEASURE OF FAITH showed early speed, saved ground and dropped back. WARRIOR'S FLEET raced evenly near the back and was
never a threat. CLASSIC WARRIOR raced near the middle of the field, moved up at the 1/2 mile pole, retreated and was no threat late. CLEMENT'S NOTE

TARAASHOQ void of early speed, saved ground throughout, rallied down the home stretch and proved the best. BOBBY MERLOT unhurried in the early
part, saved ground around the second turn, angled out entering the home stretch, took the lead, but was caught for the win. HE GOTS TO GO lacked early
speed, had an outside trip, made a late wide gain, but was no real factor. RED IDOL went to the front, saved ground, dueled in the early going and faded
down the home stretch. NEPHI pressed the pace, raced three wide around the final turn and faded. DR. SNYDER challenged on the front end, forwardly
placed until late, when he retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
HOWARD'S GRIT raced within striking distance, saved ground around the second turn, angled out, rallied down the stretch and proved the best late. ONE
MORE SLEEP pressed the pace, saved ground, drove clear down the lane, but couldn't hold off the winner. THREE POINT STRUT lacked early speed,
made a steady gain, finished willingly and was outfinished for second. RED OCTOBER raced near the middle of the field, moved up and finished evenly.
CATCH ME T void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. TAUREAN raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. KEE JEE
raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. DYNAMIC MOON raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning and faded. NOW NOW SAINT raced
within contention, came around the final turn three wide and dropped back. SPIRIT OF DREAMS went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the
final turn, faded, pulled up late and was vanned off.
