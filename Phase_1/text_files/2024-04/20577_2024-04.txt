Footnotes
ANA'S GUN broke very fast, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, took over outside the
quarter-pole, shook clear in upper stretch and held under steady urging. SHIRL'S DELIGHT tracked the pace on the outside, moved in late on the
backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, angled out five wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner in the final furlong, gained on that foe into the
final sixteenth and willingly earned the place. DREAMS SHE DREAMS was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside while
asked on the turn, lost the lead late late on that bend, spun off the rail into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired while well clear for the
show. CELESTIAL EXPRESS was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground under stronger encouragement on the turn and failed to respond.
ADDRESSABLE MARKET (IRE) broke a half-step slow then dropped back, settled under some urging, went around the turn in the three path and also failed
to respond. HIDDEN WAR DANCE settled on the outside under coaxing, dropped well behind late on the backstretch, went five wide early on the turn then
angled in, reached the rail near the three-eighths pole, came three wide into the stretch and faltered then was distanced in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SOLIB established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide, widened away through the turn just off the inside, continued in the two path
into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was ridden out to the finish. MY FIRST LOVE broke out at the start bumping APRIL ANTICS, chased along
the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while keeping on to secure the place honors. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven
wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along for the show honors. DIVA BANKER chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened. APRIL ANTICS got bumped at the start by MY FIRST LOVE, chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide for home and tired. STARRY MIDNIGHT chased four then three wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, tipped six wide into upper stretch, faltered.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TROUBLE dropped in early, was rated off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, drafted in the two path while held up under tight
restraint on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths then paused before finding room outside the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in the four path into
upper stretch, inched clear into the final furlong and held under steady urging. NARCISO DALI was hustled from the gate, contested the pace while well off
the inside, moved in late on the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, led past the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and was
outfinished while able to get the place. HARVARD was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground for most of the turn, angled three then four wide late
on that bend, came five wide into the stretch, chased the top two on the outside in the drive and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show.
PATIENT CAPITAL was carried out early, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased in the five path into upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. SKI COUNTRY settled at the rear, was roused while three wide for most of the turn, shifted four then five
wide late on that bend, spun six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BEST BET drifted out early, contested the pace on the outside
then in the three path on the turn, dropped back near the quarter-pole, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and faltered.

SCREAMING UNCLE chased three wide down the backstretch before advancing inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over the
front just inside that station, took the inside route into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. FLASHY ALEX
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
running on to secure the place honors. BARGAINING POWER chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn
coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. SCOTTO chased four wide under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, made no impact. RUN DIEM Z spurted away on the lead five to six paths off the inside, tucked to the
two path into the turn and came under pressure getting flanked by rivals at the three-eighths, yielded the front and went four wide into upper stretch, then
folded in the drive.

Footnotes
ACCELERINA was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, was driven five wide into the stretch, gained
outside into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and got up to prevail. DOLCE VELOCE was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the
inside of foe, was beaten to the front then dropped back outside the five-eighths pole and switched to the outside, chased outside from that juncture, went
around the turn in the three path, took the lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of ZHEN LOU into the final sixteenth, drifted out near that point, swapped
back to her inside lead late and bested the aforementioned foe for the place but was overtaken by the winner. ZHEN LOU was hustled from the gate,
showed speed on the outside of a rival then went clear outside the five-eighths pole, vied in the two path for most of the turn, was asked just inside the
five-sixteenths pole then dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth
and was outfinished while able to hold the show. MANGIA broke in and was off a half-step slow, was urged early then settled on the outside, raced in the
four path for most of the turn then dropped to the three path, moved to the two path near the quarter-pole, chased the leaders in the stretch and lacked the
needed kick then missed the show. SARATOGA SMOKESHOW broke a half-step slow then dropped back, settled near the rear, saved ground on the turn
and failed to respond. UNCAPTURED QUEEN broke a bit slow then dropped back in tight quarters, fell well behind the rest of the field, moved from the rail
to the two path on the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
JOEY FRESHWATER broke out then was corrected by the rider, settled just off the pace on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, made a bid near
the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging.
LISTENTOYOURHEART was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path early on the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths pole, shifted
three wide outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and willingly earned the place then injured his right-hind leg on the gallop out and was
vanned off. SPUN AND WON paused when haven his path taken by the leader early, tracked the pace, moved up to make an outside bid near the half-mile
pole, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired while just able to hold the show. STOLEN BASE was urged along at the
rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TWISTED RIDE moved in while hustled to the
front, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead nearing the quarter-pole and gave way. DISARMED was hustled from
the gate, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, was urged along against the rail on the turn, steadied while put in tight quarters in upper stretch, altered
out outside the furlong marker and capitulated.

FREEDSDALE coaxed from the gate, raced three wide off a duel before advancing to vie midway on the turn between foes when joined to the outside by
BOSUN, took over narrow command and swung five to six wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. BOSUN just off the pace five paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide and advanced on the front through the turn stacking outside a trio inside the three-eighths, went seven
wide into upper stretch, ran on under a drive to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. BREAK THE FALL coaxed from the gate,
chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three
wide for home and offered up a mild bid. ROMANTIC CHARMER dueled inside of BOSS TWEED coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, weakened. PRICE IS TRUTH chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, went
seven to eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. IRISH TENOR chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper
stretch, tired. BOSS TWEED dueled from the two path with ROMANTIC CHARMER to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide
into upper stretch, tired.
