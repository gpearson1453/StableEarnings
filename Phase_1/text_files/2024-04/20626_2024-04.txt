Footnotes
HOT DAME saved ground setting the pace under pressure from APRIL'S GEM, shook that one off leaving the quarter pole and then was all out to resist
IZZY'S MONSTER late. IZZY'S MONSTER was prominently placed while racing three-wide, responded when asked and finished fast. BLESSED ANNA was
unhurried early while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and rallied late. SUM KINDA PRETTY was forwardly placed racing along the inside,
came two-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through entering the stretch to
offer a bid and then went evenly late. DIALED INNA settle in the middle of the field and then weakened during the drive. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN was
close up early while racing four-wide and tired. APRIL'S GEM prompted the pace from along the outside to near the stretch and gave way.

ALIBI IKE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the eighth pole then came in nearing the sixteenth pole and
edged clear late. SPANISH DOUBLOON saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed, altered course to the outside nearing the sixteenth pole
when the winner came in and held on gamely for second. SHARP STICK was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
DEFIANT MALICE steadied in tight along the inside entering the turn, then dropped back slightly, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly
late. NAGY AND DA BEARS promoted SPANISH DOUBLOON while racing two-wide to the stretch and weakened. THE RIDGE was off a step slow, then
was in tight between horses nearing the half mile pole, settled in the middle of the field and tired late. IRISH COAST dropped back early and failed to
threaten.THE JOCKED OF SPANISH DOUBLOON LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAIN ALIBI IKE FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE SIXTEENTH
POLE BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WAS INSUFFICENT EVIDENCE TO WARRANT A DISQULIFCATION.

Footnotes
PINK LADY LU SHA was forwardly placed from the start, came four-wide into the stretch, caught COCKTAIL CUTIE in deep stretch and proved best in a
stiff drive. COCKTAIL CUTIE prompted the pace while racing three-wide, took the lead nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, responded when asked and just
failed to last in a game try. COWGIRL FRANKIE was off a step slow then dropped well back, came six-wide into the stretch then angled in during the drive
and rallied late. POSITIONDUMONI was up close early, came five-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. HEAVENLY SCENT broke through the gate
prior to the start but was retained by the assistant start and reloaded then vied for the early lead from along the inside and weakened. HOP AWAY HOTTIE
saved ground while being unhurried and failed to seriously threaten. JERSEY JET vied for the early lead from between horses and tired.

Footnotes
GO STORMIN GIRL was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to be up in the final strides. PALAGO was
unhurried after breaking a step slow, rallied two-wide into the stretch then angled further out during the drive and finished fast. PLAY TWENTY saved
ground setting the pace, opened a long lead nearing the stretch and then just failed last. WITCHING was prominent from the start, came three-wide into the
stretch and finished in a mild rally. MY LADY SLEW was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SHEZ
RECKLESS settled in the middle of the field early, steadied in tight along the inside nearing the three-eighths pole, dropped back slightly then came
three-wide into the stretch and went evenly. MISS WINDY SLEW dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a threat. LADY
ATLANTIC prompted the pace while racing two-wide and tired.

OPALINE saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged and proved best under strong handling. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS was allowed to settle,
moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bid at the eighth pole but was unable to stay with the winner late. ONACOUNTA was prominently
placed early while saving ground, dropped back slightly on the turn then finished in a mild rally. HEART OF HANISCH settled in the middle of the field while
racing three-wide and lacked a rally. HOLY IMAGE was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and improved his position. SUNDAY SPEIGHT was
forwardly placed early racing three-wide and weakened. GABRIELLA ATTACK prompted the pace while two-wide and tired. SEQUAYA dropped back early
then came seven-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. EVIE JEAN settled in the middle of the field, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to
menace.
