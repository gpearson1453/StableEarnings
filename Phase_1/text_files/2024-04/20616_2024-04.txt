the end. PINK SOLITAIRE was allowed to settle while two wide, then came out four wide leaving the turn to rally in the stretch, angled inward then kept on
to no avail. LET FREEDOM BLING dueled with an inner rival into the turn, then took command briefly mid stretch then was out finished in the end. MARKET

TRAVELER was allowed to settle along the inside and was no threat. GRAY ZONE was unhurried early, bid three wide leaving the turn, then stumbled

gamely and drew clear in the late stretch to prevail in the end. TOP COP was bumped on both sides, conserved energy in the early furlongs, then rallied
leaving the far turn from the three path and closed willingly down the lane. MAN IN THE MIDDLE tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch,
then split rivals to gain command on the far turn, maintained the lead in the early stretch then was over taken in the end and held the show prize. HUMOR
ME PLEASE broke inwardly and bumped rival then tracked the pace from the two path, rallied gamely leaving the far turn from the four path but did not have
enough in the stretch. NORTHWIND drifted out at the start and bumped rival, led the way into the first turn before dueling with an outer rival down the
backstretch and into the far turn then gave way in the home stretch. PRINCE SIMBA was bumped on both sides, then dueled with inner rival down the

an inner rival on the turn and into the stretch then was out kicked and was second best. DELTA FRONT stalked the pace from the inside, then came out
three wide leaving the bend, brushed rival and kept on for the show prize. ALL JACKED UP raced while four wide towards the back, was in a steady drive
on the turn, angled in towards the rail to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. FEEL IT stalked the pace while two wide, then was brushed by an
inner foe leaving the bend then continued to bid mildly in the stretch coming up empty in the end. EL QUESO GRANDE was allowed to settle while two
wide, then urged steadily on the turn and lacked bidding in the stretch. DARK RUM trailed behind the field early and was no threat. ROMAN GENERAL

Footnotes
TEXAS STAR prompted while two wide, remained well rated on the turn and while in second position then dug in gamely in the early stretch to edge past
the pace setter and was up late to prevail. AVALING raced along inside towards the back, was charging up on the turn, came out four wide and closed
willingly down the lane. FLYING FIRST CLASS led the way from the inside to set the pace down the backstretch and into the far turn, then was out finished
in the late stretch. HIGHLANDER HONEY chased the pace while two wide, then bid on the turn to rally in the stretch, and kept on down the lane to no avail
in the end. GOD KNOWS WHY raced at the back in a trio of rivals, then rallied leaving the turn but it was too little too late. RUBY CANTU settled back along
the rail, then rallied mildly leaving the turn and came up empty. NICEPROBLEMTOHAVE settled along the inside and was no threat. BALI GIRLEE chased
the pace from the inside into the turn, then flattened out and lacked bidding in the stretch. MISS ROSE raced four to five wide towards the back and was no
menace. TWILIGHT STORM was unhurried early and no factor.

SAN MATEO KAT tracked the pace from the inside, was in a steady drive leaving the backstretch, then shifted out to the three path in the early stretch, dug
in gamely and edge clear to be up in the final strides. CASHMERE DANCER tracked the pace while three wide and between rivals, inched up to press the
leader while two wide on the far turn, had more to spar with said rival in the early stretch then was surpassed by an outer rival in the final yards and was
second best. MY PATRIOTIC GIRL led the way in the early furlongs to set the pace down the backstretch and into the far turn, was confronted by an outer
rival to duel in the early stretch then gave way. HOURGLASS FIGURE was unhurried early, then saved ground down the backstretch, rallied leaving the far
turn and closed willingly in the end. MIZ CALI brushed foe at the start, then tracked the pace while four wide, moved up to press the leader while three wide,
rallied in the early stretch and came up evenly in the end. LOOKIN AT KISSES broke out and brushed rival, was allowed to settle while two wide towards
the back of the field, raced at an even pace throughout and needed more in the end. THE RAGE OF ART tracked the pace while two wide at a moderate
pace throughout the first half then faded on the far turn. MARQUETTE WARRIOR was allowed to settle while two wide, circled six wide leaving the far turn

WITHOUT A TRACE battled for the lead while three wide and outside of rivals, gained command at the half mile marker, then drew off in the home stretch to
prove best in the end. CORREDOR vied for the lead between rivals, continued to press the pace on the far turn, then rallied gamely in the early stretch,
lacked the winning bid and held onto the place position. MIND HUNTER was unhurried early, saved ground down the backstretch, came out five wide
leaving the far turn then improved position while passing rivals down the lane and was best for the show prize. RINGSIDE stalked the pace while two wide,
then urged steadily on the far turn to rally mildly in the late stretch but it was not enough. NEW BERN vied for the lead with outer rivals down the backstretch
and into the far turn, then gave way in the home stretch. SONNY BOB chased the pace from the inside in the middle pack of rivals, was in a hard drive on
the far turn and came up evenly in the late stretch. F FOURFIFTY stalked the pace from the inside throughout the early furlongs at a moderate pace and
lacked bid in the final furlongs. PEARSE stalked the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive down the backstretch and into the far turn then flattened
out in the stretch. IRON MOON was unhurried early and no threat. UNCLE CHAN tucked along the inside and was no rally. FLYING J RAGNAR chased the
pace while two wide into the backstretch then was thru after the half and had no final bid.

Footnotes
MAZUMA chased the pace in the three path while being well rated down the backstretch, was inching up on the far turn, took command in the upper stretch
under a gamely rally then lasted to the wire to prove best. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT was allowed to settle while three wide, continued to save ground heading
in the far turn, came out five wide and closed belatedly just missing victory. DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL tracked the pace from the inside throughout the first
half, was moving up on the far turn to gain command momentarily at the quarter pole, then was over powered by an outer rival in the upper stretch and was
best for third place. IT MAKES SENSE tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, then menaced from the four path at the top
of the stretch and needed more in the end. RIGHT TONE was allowed to settle while two wide down the backstretch in the back pack, then came out six
wide leaving the far turn rally in the late stretch but it was to no success. TAP THE DOT raced from the inside between the two pack of rivals down the
backstretch, then rallied leaving the far turn and needed more in the end. MANO DURA settled back along the inside and in the back duet and was no
threat. MOR LANA SPIRIT was in tight on the first turn, then settled back behind the field and was no threat in the end. BLAMEITONMIDNIGHT was
allowed to settle along the inside and failed to rally in the end. SIR STERLING maintained the pace from the first turn into the far turn while in a long drive,
then was used up and tired in the home stretch.
