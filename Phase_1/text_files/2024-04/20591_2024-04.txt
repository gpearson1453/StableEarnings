Footnotes
MARS MAGIC prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace two to three wide into the first turn, attended to the moderate pace approaching the
half-mile marker and was asked for run into the far turn, confronted ONE SUMMER DAY nearing the quarter pole and battled that game rival to mid-stretch,
dueled into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and determinedly held at the finish. ONE SUMMER DAY broke alertly and assumed
command of the early going, showed the way into the first turn and was well handled while carving moderate fractions along the backstretch run, led into the
second turn and came under pressure at the quarter marker, met the bid of MARS MAGIC in upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, fought gamely
into the final sixteenth and held a narrow lead into deep stretch, was overtaken in the final strides and held for the place honors in a good effort. CATALINA
COCKTAIL rated just off of the early pace, tracked from an outside position and went three wide into the first turn, well placed along the backstretch run,
chased three to four wide into the second turn, responded into the stretch and closed willingly while widest into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch
and just missed for the win and place, while clear of the rest for the show. OUTRAGEOUS settled off of the early pace, went two wide and between runners
into the first turn, tracked between rivals approaching the half-mile marker, improved position two to three wide into the far turn and continued that bid four
wide at the furlong pole, needed more into the final sixteenth and offered a mild late rally. ANISETTE settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into
the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from an inside position nearing the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground into the second turn, raced a bit in tight
into upper stretch and angled out for the drive, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. MENDEL'S DAUGHTER allowed to settle away
from the start, lost contact along the backstretch run, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
SMILE AND PROFILE away in good order, forwardly placed in the early going and stalked the pace three wide into the first turn, inched closer along the
backstretch run and was well positioned at the half-mile pole, roused three wide into the second turn, took command into upper stretch and drew clear at the
furlong marker, drew off while kept to task into the final sixteenth, was hand urged to the finish and won as much the best. VIOLET THUNDER took back off
of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, maintained an inside path into the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile pole, chased
from the inside into the second turn, encountered a bit of traffic at the quarter marker and angled three wide for the stretch drive, outkicked at mid-stretch,
was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth and ran on to be best of the rest. SILVER FLIRT allowed to settle away from the start, was guided two to
three wide into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run and chased three wide into the second turn, lost ground into the stretch, could not
muster the needed late response but stayed on well into deep stretch and was up in the final strides for third. PARTY TIME GAL hustled away from the start,
vied for the early lead with APRICOT BRANDY and took a narrow advantage into the backstretch run, set decent fractions while prompted to the half-mile
marker, was pressed into the far turn and held a slim lead at the quarter pole, overtaken by SMILE AND PROFILE into the stretch and chased that one to
the furlong marker, gave way into the final sixteenth and was just edged for third at the finish. LITTLE MISCHIEVOUS rated off of the early pace and settled
two wide into the first turn, never far back through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and was outrun to the quarter pole, maintained an
inside path into the lane and did not threaten. APRICOT BRANDY broke alertly and contested the early lead with PARTY TIME GAL, prompted that runner
through decent fractions nearing the half-mile marker, disputed the pace between rivals into the second turn, lost position at the quarter marker, could not
keep pace into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ALONG CAME JOANN hopped at the start but was away in good order, settled outside of rivals into the first turn and raced widest into the backstretch run,
never far back through the backstretch run, was roused four wide into the far turn and loomed into upper stretch, battled with RIDIN'THESTORMOUT
heading to the furlong marker, shook free from that rival into the final sixteenth and drew away under mild urging in deep stretch. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT
hustled leaving the start, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn, controlled the pace through the backstretch run and set moderate
fractions to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the second turn and held a clear lead at the quarter pole, felt pressure into upper stretch and met the bid
of ALONG CAME JOANN to the furlong marker, was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. EXCLUSIVELY NOBLE forwardly
placed away from the start, tracked the early pace three wide along the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run, chased three wide nearing the quarter
pole, shifted two wide into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held safely for third.
GEEJAYTEE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the pace into the first turn, maintained a two wide path into the backstretch and raced close up
to the moderate pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the second turn, shifted to the rail into upper stretch and ran evenly to the
furlong marker, could not muster a response into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. SOUTHERN BLESSING had her head turned prior to the
start, broke in leaving the gate and was away slowly, recovered and settled two wide and between runners into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace
between rivals along the backstretch run, lost ground into the far turn and gave way in the stretch. WHY LOOKY HERE crowded a bit by a neighboring rival
at the start, settled just off the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, maintained an inside position into the backstretch run and was well placed at
the half-mile marker, outrun into the second turn, could not find a response in the stretch drive and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LAMMAS (GB) settled in the second flank to the outside of I'MGONNABESOMEBODY and tracked the pace to the far turn, launched the bid from the three
furlong marker when STAR RACER quickened away, went three wide into the stretch as part of four horses fanned across the track at the head of the lane,
gained the advantage mid-stretch under a stiff hand ride and pulled clear in the final furlong. FREEPORT JOE was allowed to settle at the rear of the field
well behind the pace, bided time to the far turn then responded when set down with three furlongs to run, swept to to engage the leaders four wide into the
stretch, bid on the outside of the quartet to the finish, alternated leads during the stretch run and drifted in late, could not keep pace with the winner into the
final sixteenth and just held for second. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY bobbled slightly at the start but was able to get a good tracking position behind the two
leaders, raced in tandem with LAMMAS (GB) through the first half, on the inside of that rival two off the rail, started a rally from the three furlong pole, came
into the stretch on the inside as four horses contested the matter down the stretch, finished willingly under strong handling but was out bobbed for the place.
STAR RACER broke sharply and was first to the turn, was taken in hand, floated out to the three path and remained out there for the run down the
backstretch, got some light pressure from CUT ACROSS SHORTY from the six furlong marker then sped away from that foe passing the half-mile marker
opened a clear lead through the far turn, was still going strong when beset by challengers on all sides at the head of the stretch, fought back gamely to the
wire despite being leaned on by FREEPORT JOE in the final yards and just missed a minor award in a three way blanket finish for second. CUT ACROSS
SHORTY was pushed to the front and attempted to press STAR RACER on the front end, was unable to get even with that one but was prominent to the
nine-sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
BACALAR broke alertly and established the early lead, drew to a clear advantage and set moderate fractions into the turn, was well handled along the bend
and controlled the pace approaching the quarter pole, set down into the stretch and extended the lead at the furlong pole, kept to task into the final
sixteenth, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive to prevail. MISTICAL SURPRISE hustled to be forwardly placed away from the start,
chased the moderate early pace and went two wide into the turn, stalked BACALAR to the quarter pole then ran in pursuit of that rival into the stretch,
responded to urging past the furlong marker and closed into the final sixteenth, was gaining in deep stretch but could not catch BACALAR in time and held
safely for second at the finish. WEGOTTODRINKING took back off of the moderate early pace, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the
quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch and continued her advance at the furlong marker, finished well into the final sixteenth, could not reel
in the leading pair in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for third. DADDYS NINA forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the moderate pace to the
half-mile marker and was well placed into the turn, went three to four wide to the quarter marker and ran evenly to mid-stretch, chased the leaders into the
final sixteenth and could not muster a late rally. AMANDA ROSE tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, raced widest into the turn then
shifted to the three path midway through the bend, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, was asked for run two wide into the lane, finished evenly and did
not threaten in the stretch. SMOOVE AS SILK chased the moderate early pace from between rivals, ran in pursuit four to five wide nearing the quarter
marker, lost ground into the stretch and weakened. RIVIERA SUNRISE rated off of the moderate early pace, trailed into the turn and saved ground to the
quarter marker, angled out into upper stretch and did not have a response in the final furlong.

REV REE prominent away from the start, ceded the early lead then got caught a bit in tight along the first turn and was shuffled back into the backstretch
run, recovered and tracked the modest pace while saving ground approaching the half-mile marker, maintained an inside path into the second turn, angled
three wide into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, responded to urging and closed fast into the final sixteenth, overtook TURIAF in deep
stretch and held for the win in the final strides. TURIAF broke alertly and assumed early command, set moderate fractions while well handled through the
backstretch run, showed the way into the far turn and drew to a clear lead into the stretch, dug in while under pressure nearing the sixteenth-marker, was
caught and overtaken by REV REE in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for second. KITTEN'S KID was forwardly placed away from the gate, stalked
the early pace from a three wide path along the first turn, attended to the moderate pace along the backstretch run, chased TURIAF into the second turn
and went two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch, could not keep pace with the top pair into the final sixteenth and was
well clear for third. A CROWN FOR KITTEN allowed to settle, saved ground along the first turn, never far back through the backstretch run, guided outside
of runners into the second turn and chased three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, was outrun to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

HARBOR DEAREST broke outward at the start and made light contact with NICE ENCOUNTER, moved over the rail when clear and tucked in behind the
leaders, saved ground through the turn, swung out five wide into the clear for the stretch run, finished strongly under steady handling and intermittent urging
and got up in the last jump. JIM'S JET raced close up early, shifted out near the three-eighths pole causing a minor chain reaction to the outside then went
three wide to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled with FLY SOUTH from the top of the stretch, got a head in front in the before mid-stretch,
bested that foe by deep stretch only to be caught at the wire by the winner. FLY SOUTH got squeezed at start but recovered and rushed up to join the
leaders, slipped inside of VALERIE at the quarter pole, had a brief lead then was taken on by JIM'S JET to the outside, held on well to mid-stretch then was
outkicked in the last sixteenth. VALERIE was quick into stride and won the race to the turn, left the rail open through the turn and that allowed FLY SOUTH
to slip through and take the lead at the quarter pole, kept on through the stretch under steady handling but was outfinished. TAMARANDO COAST bobbled
slightly at the start then veered inward making contact with SMILINGATHEMOON, was caught five wide down the backstretch and into the turn, had to
check at the three-eighths pole when SMILINGATTHEMOON came out then bothered NICE ENCOUNTER in turn, continued wide through the turn, swung
six wide into the stretch and finished with some interest but could not improve. NICE ENCOUNTER was bumped at the break by HARBOR DEAREST then
had to check a few strides later when SMILINGATTHEMOON took the path, trailed the field early then tried to launch a rally heading towards the three
furlong marker, had to check when TAMARANDO COAST altered path, lost momentum, re-rallied, came seven wide into the stretch and was gaining late
but unable to make up the lost ground. SMILINGATTHEMOON was close up racing four wide in the early going, shifted out near the three-eighths pole to
avoid clipping heels with JIM'S JET but causing trouble for two foes behind, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole but quickly flattened out and was
no factor in the stretch.
