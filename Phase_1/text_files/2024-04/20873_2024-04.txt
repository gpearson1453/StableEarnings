Footnotes
BULLET BUTCH settled inside, angled wide rallying into the stretch and wore down the leaders through the final furlong. HIDDEN PROMISE led in the two
path then dueled inside, remained ahead in midstretch and finished gamely. HURRICANE HIGHWAY broke alertly then dropped back, advanced wide but
was outfinished. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE prompted the pace along the inside then flattened out in the stretch. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY forced the pace
outside, led on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. THE ANGRY MAN dropped back at the start, angled inside and was never a factor. JEBOLOGIST
prompted the pace between rivals down the backstretch and gave way. THAT'S MY BUSINESS raced outside off the leaders and weakened steadily.

PARTY AT SAM'S set the pace on the inside, dueled with SO CLOSE SO FAR passing the quarter pole, drifted out entering the stretch, drifted out slightly
passing the furlong marker, dug in gamely and drew clear late, driving. SO CLOSE SO FAR stalked close up two wide, commenced his bid nearing the
quarter pole, was carried out a bit wide turning for home, dueled with the winner, dug in gamely outside that rival and proved second best. I FEELUCKY
TONITE tracked inside, chased inside on the turn, lacked a rally and finished evenly. ZONA DE AMIGOS raced off the pace, chased on the turn and failed
to threaten. CHECKING BOXES bobbled at the break, stalked two wide, chased on the turn and faded. WILD ALEX was outrun. A Jockey Objection by the
rider of the runner up against the winner was dismissed.

JUST STAY HOME raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied inside entering the stretch, took over, edged away, then dug in gamely late
and held on. PEACH PERFECT raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the turn, came wide into the stretch, rallied outside, was gaining late and just
missed. WESTERN DREAM raced off the pace inside, rallied mildly inside in the stretch and earned the show spot. PRINCESS SOPHIE dueled inside for
the lead, battled it out with ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM on the backside, shook free on the far turn, drifted out turning for home and weakened in the lane.
BEYOND A MILLION raced three wide off the pace and closed belatedly outside. CAGED PIXIE raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. ERIN'S
ENTHUSIASM dueled two wide for command, battled on the backside and gave way on the far turn.
