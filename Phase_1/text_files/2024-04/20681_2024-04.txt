Footnotes
PHILIPSBURG (IRE) vied with MAD DRAGON for the lead from along the outside, shook that one off leaving the quarter pole and gradually increased his
advantage. NEON DEION was reserved off the early pace while racing two-wide angled to the inside entering the stretch and finished well for second in a
steady effort. LIBERTY'S HAULER settled in the middle of the field racing along the inside, steadied slightly and angled out nearing the three-eighths pole,
angled out coming three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. ANCIENT MAN was unhurried early then came five-wide into the stretch and was
gaining slightly late. GETTIN PAID saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride but lacked a rally. MR. CHIVAS dropped back early and failed to
seriously threaten. MAD DRAGON vied for the early lead from along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
NO NANNETTE NO saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, moved out to be three-wide leaving the quarter pole and was up in the final
sixteenth to win drawing clear. TIMELESS GLORY was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to gain a slight lead nearing the quarter pole
then came four-wide into the stretch but was unable to resist the winner late in a good effort. EMITYAAZ set the pace racing slightly removed from the rail,
responded when headed and held on fairly well for third. LOONA LUV saved ground while racing close-up but lacked a rally when asked. CAIRO SUMMER
was five wide on the first turn then continued to be four-wide the rest of the trip and tired. ZENCHUA SKY saved ground while being unhurried and failed to
menace. STACK SHACK prompted the issue for six furlongs while racing along the outside and tired.

Footnotes
MILLARD'S SMILE was unhurried early, launched a bid racing five-wide nearing the quarter pole and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away.
BABA'S BOY saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole, responded when headed and continued on gamely for
the place. WHERE'D THE DAY GO prompted the issue from along the outside, came four-wide into the stretch and held on well for third in a steady effort.
CHRISTMAS PRESENT saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through during the drive but lacked the needed late response. FLASHY RICHIE was
close-up while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. SIERRA HOTEL saved ground racing in the middle of the field but was not a factor. GEORGE'S VISION
was allowed to settle early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. PISTOL BOX dropped back early and failed to threaten. KRAMDEN
raced in the middle of the field early and gave way.

Footnotes
MADELYN BELLE dueled for the lead from along the inside with LILY'S WOOFY and FIRST KITTEN, shook clear entering the stretch and gradually
increased her advantage. GIRL PRO was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch then angled to the inside nearing the eighth pole and closed
strongly for the place. AWESOME SUNDAY was allowed to settle early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. FIRST KITTEN disputed
the pace while racing three-wide and weakened during the drive. STYLE dropped back early, came two-wide into the stretch and improved her position.
MAYSTART was allowed to settle, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. SMOOTH JUSTICE was forwardly place while saving
ground but lacked a rally. PALACE MAGIC settled in the middle of the field, moved out to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole and was not a factor. LILY'S
WOOFY dueled for the lead from between horses to the start, angled out nearing the eighth pole and tired.
