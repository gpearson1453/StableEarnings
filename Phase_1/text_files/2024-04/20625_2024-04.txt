Footnotes
HIDDEN VASE kicked well away early to set a clear pace in the two path, was roused from the three path at the top of the lane, and kicked on to hold sway.
QUEEN VALENTINA tracked in the three path, was driven in the two path around the turn, and chased on for place. SPECTACULAR FORCE rated in the
two path, was roused from the three path midway around the turn, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. ALBRIGHT raced off
the pace in the two path but made no impact. OOLONG HAI (IRE) chased in the two path, was ridden along the rail around the turn, floated out to the six
path turning into the lane, and flattened. MISS UPROAR raced wellback in the four path, floated out to the five path midway around the turn, and never
threatened. FIORENZA trailed throughout.

MAJESTIC VENEZUELA set the pace in the two path, was roused into the far turn, kicked away from the two path in upper stretch, and held sway.
MIDSUMMER MO rated in the three path, was cued passing the quarter, got floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place.
DAY AWAY stalked in the four path, loomed confidently outside of a pair midway around the far turn, came under a ride passing the quarter, evened out
down the lane, but held show. MISSION OF HOPE had a slow start, trailed in the three path, was coaxed from the five path into the far turn, fanned out to
the eight path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. TAPE RUNNER raced off the pace in the two path and finished evenly between foes from the
six path down the lane. MY BLESSING broke out at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, was ridden between foes around the far turn, but faded in
the stretch. LUNA LOVE tracked in the two path but weakened along the inside in the stretch.

DARLING DARLEY saved ground in range, swung out and bumped STARLIT SOFI in upper stretch, kicked in once clear and was up late. DIALITHIC set
the pace along the rail, drifted out late and bumped DARLING LUNA and held well for the place. DARLING LUNA stalked the pace two wide, slowly gained
through the lane, was bumped late and was outfinished. STARLIT SOFI tracked the pace three wide, was bumped nearing the eighth pole and was
one-paced from there. CERCHI chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. SPIRIT OF VICTORY failed to menace while racing two
wide. JESS'S MOMENT was outrun inside. NAA DUDETTE played no factor while racing three wide. STARSHIP DYNASTY was outrun while racing four
wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF STARLIT SOFI AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH
WAS NOT ALLOWED.

SONICUS tracked in the two path, was roused from the three path midway around the turn, swung from the four path into the lane, and kicked past the inner
pacesetter around the sixteenth. NEXT EPISODE showed the way in the two path, was cued along the inside midway around the turn, stayed on from the
three path entering the stretch, but was caught around the sixteenth to place. CYMBAL COURT chased in the four path, came under a ride midway around
the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. IMPERIOUSLY prompted the pace in the three path, floated out to
the five path turning into the lane, but flattened on her left lead. PEACH COBBLER rated in the three path, had to steady between foes going into the far
turn, was driven in the five path around the far turn, but could not threaten in the seven path down the lane. VALIANT VICTORIA stalked inside but
weakened entering the stretch.

a drive. PRAISEWORTHY trailed inside, made progress in upper stretch, angled out near the sixteenth pole and was clearly second best. ROCKY CHITU
chased the pace four wide, was floated further out turning for home and kept on outside to gain the show. GIURO pressed the pace in the three path, was
floated further out turning for home, continued on the left lead and weakened. GUAICAIPURO set the pace in the two path and tired in the drive. EL
TEKILERO chased the pace two wide and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
JAMES GANG got bumped by an outer foe at the start, stalked in the five path, bid in the three path passing the quarter, swung out to the five path while
taking the lead at the top of the lane, drifted in while hanging on his left lead, but held on. SOUPER SUNSHINE set the pace in the two path, was ridden
along the inside around the turn, floated out to the three path at the top of the stretch, lost the lead while tipping back to the rail in upper stretch, dug in. but
could not get back up to settle with place. GRAND BEY chased inside, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. RAKA RAKA
CRUZ broke in and bumped an inner foe, tracked in the four path, swung out to the six path under a ride at the top of the stretch, but flattened on his left
lead. GABAGOOL prompted the pace in the four path but faded on his left lead in the stretch. MIDNIGHT CHAOS threw his head as the gates opened,
raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden from the rail around the turn, but was no menace. LUNA WARRIOR hesitated at the start and trailed
throughout.
