CANARY NATION settled back early four wide, reeled in the dueling leaders through the far turn to bid into the lane and moved off under steady handling.
REBA dueled out from the rail while inside COAST TO GLORY then could not go with the winner in the lane. COAST TO GLORY dueled on the pace
outside REBA to upper stretch and came up empty. RUN FOR JOY had no rally from three to four wide. DONNA LIRICA failed to threaten. KONA KINLEY
was always back three or four wide.

good early speed out from the rail but could not contain the winner's late rally. LODE OF BLARNEY followed the pace three or four wide and gained the
place while no match for the top pair. ELIOT NESS chased the leaders three wide and went evenly in the lane to lose position late. FAR FROM FINAL was
not a threat four wide. WELDON G was always back along the inside.
