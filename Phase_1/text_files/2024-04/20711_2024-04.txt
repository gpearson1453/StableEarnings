Footnotes
ROMAN EMPIRE stumbled at the start and bumped a rival, tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, angled out, rallied outside of MAJOR CAM and
wore down that rival to prevail. MAJOR CAM set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run, then
yielded grudgingly and held for second. IMAGINE THIS was bumped at the start, trailed the field, moved up two wide on the far turn and rallied mildly inside
in the final furlong. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT pulled and was steadied entering the first turn, raced three wide, stalked outside, lacked a bid and finished
evenly. DISTURBED stalked outside, chased three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and tired. ESOR stalked between rivals and gave way.

ONE OF THE ONES quickly sprinted clear then widened through the stretch while kept to her task. WARRIOR ON THE RUN prompted the pace outside,
went after the winner in the stretch and was easily second best. MUMMALICIOUS made a menacing wide move on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE had her heels clipped in the opening quarter, forced the pace and faded. XERCES clipped heels and bobbled in the opening
quarter and was always far back. INTUITIONISTCLAIRE clipped heels and bobbled in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly. An objection by the
seventh finisher against the sixth finisher for early interference was dismissed. A stewards inquiry into the incidents on the backstretch did not change the
order of finish.

POWWA OF LOVE stalked the pacesetter three wide, vied through the turn; led at the quarter pole and held off late outside challenge. CAUSE I SAID
settled off the leaders, bid four wide on the turn, loomed a threat and made a gradual late gain. BUSTIN DOWN DOORS hustled to a clear advantage down
the backstretch, was collared midway on the turn and tired. BROAD JUMPER lagged far behind inside then offered some late energy. DECOUPAGE
prompted the pace two wide, moved inside on the turn and faltered. PEACELOVENKARMA trailed far behind then caught a stopping opponent. CATALON
was urged close up three wide down the backstretch then gave way.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME TIME stalked close up two wide, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied outside of DESANTIS at the quarter pole, took over and drew clear
under urging. DESANTIS vied inside for the lead, shook free on the far turn, dueled with the winner entering the stretch, was no match for that rival and
remained clear for the place spot. HEY PORTER raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, advanced between rivals on the far turn, rallied
mildly outside and got up for third. BATON tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. DREAM BIG DREAMS raced off the pace inside,
chased on the turn and lacked a stretch rally. PREDOMINATE was outrun early and passed tired rivals. WYNN GIANT raced off the pace inside and failed
to respond. MEGA CHARLIE vied two wide for the lead, chased and gave way. SAL N LOUIE raced off the rail, off the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
FATIH raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, hooked leader at the top of the lane then edged off driving. PARDSY dropped back in the initial quarter
mile, angled inside then out in the stretch and closed well to gain place. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF moved clear down the backstretch, was collared at the top
of the stretch, resisted the winner then weakened. CAPT. CANDY prompted the pace three wide then proved empty in the stretch. WOOD BE WILD lacked
speed, moved very wide trying to bear out on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM cleared the field entering the first turn to set the pace, opened up a comfortable margin on the backside, responded when roused
entering the stretch and was kept to the task. CLASSY MISS raced three wide early, settled off the pace, chased on the far turn, rallied outside into the
stretch, closed well and dug in late to earn the place spot. CANOOCHEE raced off the pace, steadied on the first turn, moved up on the far turn and rallied
mildly on the rail in the lane. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE stalked the pacesetter, chased inside on the far turn, weakened in the lane and held for fourth.
MELODIA was outrun early, advanced three wide on the far turn and rallied mildly outside. LONDONDERRY raced four wide early, stalked three wide,
chased two wide on the far turn and faded. MISS LOYALTY raced off the pace and failed to threaten. CARLY HUSTLE chased inside and faded. BRODY
SLAM raced off the pace, off the inside and did not factor. SHE'S GOT GAME raced three wide early, chased and gave way.
