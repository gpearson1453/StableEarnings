approaching the head of the lane and was steadily handled to widen. LIFE AT BOTH ENDS stalked two deep the first turn, closed to the front approaching
the three eighths pole but was met nearing the head of the lane and had to settle for second best. STATELY APRIL saved ground on the first turn, picked
up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and came along for third mid-stretch. KAP HOORN took the early lead
inside, was met nearing the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane.

weakened leaving the turn. HEY MACARENA steadied at the break and raced two deep the first turn, eased out with a bid into the backstretch and raced in

Footnotes
RIA FORMOSA settled inside on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and closed to even terms in the three path on the far
turn, dug in leaving the turn and drew clear the final yards. SELES tapered in and took the lead leaving the three quarter pole, came under pressure
approaching the seven sixteenths, was met at even terms nearest the rail on the far turn, remained a factor through the upper stretch but reluctantly ceded
the final yards. WICKED KITTEN exchanged contact with REZQUIA leaving the gate and raced in the five path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened stride the final sixteenth. The latter exchanged contact with Wicked Kitten leaving the gate,
gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. CALIFORNIA CODE bobbled leaving the gate, rounded the first turn about
the six path, left the turn outside and picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and showed little in the lane.
SUPER SNEAKY settled close in the four path the opening turn then faded through the backstretch. PATARA stalked the early pace about the three path
then faded past the seven sixteenths pole.

in the lane. SCHMEAR rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far
turn, drifted nearing the head of the lane and settled for second best. LET FREEDOM SPRING rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and came along to take third mid-stretch. BON BUENO was pinched back at the start, raced in the
three path the first turn then eased to the outside past the half mile pole, gave chase toward the three eighths, rounded the far turn near the rail then
steadied at the rail mid-stretch and flattened stride. AKINGISALWAYSKING stalked the early pace about the three path, gave chase past the half mile pole
but weakened in the five path on the far turn. MILLBANK MAN ducked sharply outward leaving the gate and dropped well back while plodding along, raced
at the rail on the far turn then closed the gap outside through the lane. SIR SMOAK saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, lugged in nearing mid-stretch and was eased.

WINDSOR'S TRACKER saved ground on the first turn, eased out and gave chase into the backstretch, took the lead three wide toward the head of the
lane, drifted leaving the far turn but dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well under steady handling. MASTER THIS settled off the rail the opening turn then
eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, entered the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and dug in to
take second the final stride. MACHEN'S RIDGE rated close in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at
even terms between horses midway on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and was nipped from second under the wire. SARGENT KOBE raced in the four
path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. MISSIONSNINETYNINE
angled to the inside and rated a slim lead, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, was met at the
rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. NEVER COMPROMISE rated close inside the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. REY O REYES angled in and raced with the pace two deep, challenged into the backstretch
and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, but dropped back past the quarter pole and faded through the far turn.
