ENDLESS GRACE set his own uncontested early pace and held safe to be clear under steady handling. SHEZONEZESTREET tracked the early leader two
deep, ridden along near the three eighths pole but was no match for the winner in the drive. ALMA'S PRINCESS was allowed to settle early, raced two to
three wide in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. SCRAPPY PATCH stalked the pace along the inside and faded.

JACKIE FLASH was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. SCARLET
POSITION pressed the early pace, vied three wide between near the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire. SARA'S SAPPHIRE settled off the early
pace, swung five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. SUPERBLEA was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack early, raced two to three wide
in the lane and never was a factor. IRON LOTUS set a pressured early pace along the inside and faded. The five eighths internal fractional time was
unavailable.

MAGIC CASTLE vied two deep, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. BOX SEAT settled off the early going, moved up four to five wide around
the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. HEROIC SONG stalked the pace, made a three to four wide bid through the lane and finished willingly to the
wire. MISTER WAYSIDE pressed the early leader near the rail and weakened a bit in the drive. FOOLISH STEVE settled off the early going, swung five
wide into the upper stretch but had no late rally.

GP'S AMAZING GRACE rated along the inside under a hold, confidently handled through the far turn, angled out into the upper stretch and surged up late
under strong handling. KIMBELL'S STRATEGY showed good early foot to take over and set the pace down the backstretch, angled just off the lane to race
three deep, led near the sixteenth pole and missed in a game effort. MUMBLEBEE tracked the early pace two deep and kept on willingly to the wire. SHE'S
GONE D'WILD settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. FIGHTINGTEMPTATION dropped back early and failed to
