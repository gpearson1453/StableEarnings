Footnotes
ROCKY BAY RAE , jostled on both sides soon after the break, was always inside horses, took a short lead in mid stretch then drove clear. ZORINA ,
unhurried down the backstretch ,began to advance outside horses on the turn, was fanned to the eighth path entering the stretch, rallied nicely and drifted in
near the sixteenth pole. MUSICAL DIVA chased the pace between horses, was fanned to the six path entering the stretch, angled in approaching the eighth
pole and faded. AVOIR showed speed inside horses, drifted to the five path at the head of the stretch and gave way. CALEBS LADY advanced outside
horses to gain a short lead leaving the turn, was fanned seven wide at the top of the lane and weakened. CAN'T WANT THAT raced well off the inner rail
and gave way.

Footnotes
CAUTION CARDINAL lacked speed, stayed very wide around the turn, advanced outside horses at the head of the stretch, brushed with MOON SHINE
TIME in upper stretch, secured command in mid stretch and drew out. MOON SHINE TIME gained a short lead between horses leaving the turn, brushed
with the winner in upper stretch then drifted in and bumped DON JUAN BUBBA soon after that. DON JUAN BUBBA , a forward factor between horses down
the backstretch, moved up inside the top pair to bid for the lead entering the stretch, was bumped and weakened. ARIZONA DAVIN saved ground around
the turn, remained near the inner rail in upper stretch, altered course near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. MARVELOUS MARK , between horses
on the turn, was no factor. PARETO'S PRINCIPLE broke slowly, raced wide around the turn and was outrun. GONZAGA BAY showed speed inside horses
and gave way leaving the turn. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of DON JUAN BUBBA, MOONSHINE TIME was disqualified and
placed third. An objection by the rider of DON JUAN BUBBA against CAUTION CARDINAL for alleged interference in upper stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
KO OLINA showed speed inside horses, was well off the inner rail around the turn, was hooked on her inside by CHARMANT E leaving the turn, dueled with
that one and narrowly prevailed in an extended drive. CHARMANT E advanced along the inner rail to gain a short lead leaving the turn, battled inside the
winner and just missed in a game effort. WORK N FLIRT , five wide leaving the backstretch, remained wide on the turn, had aim on the lead in upper
stretch, raced on her left lead and flattened out. KIRA FEVER , six deep leaving the backstretch, stayed very wide around the turn and rallied outside.
SUPER ANNIE , always well off the inner rail, passed tired rivals. SPRINKLES raced near the inner rail on the turn and was no factor. OLIVIA'S CHOICE
(IRE) chased the pace racing in the three path and retreated through the stretch. LADY OF THE RIVER , in the four path chasing the pace into the turn,
faltered.

eighth pole and rallied. VINNIEBOB , never far back, was four wide turning for home and rallied between horses. ADMIRALTY PLACE (GB) stalked the
pace, was well placed leaving the far turn, angled out for the drive and weakened. EARTHLY TIGER saved ground on the turn, eased out for the drive, was
in range four wide turning for home and came up empty. PURE CANE SUGAR was no factor. GOLDEN AFFAIR was outrun. R BARRACUDA , wide on the
turns, chased the pace and gave way. EXTRA BEAT was outrun.
