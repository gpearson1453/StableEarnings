ITSONLYMONEYHONEY rated along under a hold early, pressed into the far turn racing two to three wide and finished well to edge clear under steady
handling. CAT TALE SKY settled off the early going, made a three wide bid in the stretch run and rallied for the place position. WITSEC pressed the early
leader two deep early down the backstretch, took command briefly into the turn, confronted by the winner and gave way grudgingly. SODDY DAISY was
allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. COMMUNICATIONISKEY set the pace, pressured early down the
backstretch from the outside and faded.

MAYFIELD STRONG tracked the early leader two deep, asked through the far turn and finished well to prevail under strong handling. LEA ME BE stalked
the pace, made a two to three wide bid in the drive and finished gamely to the wire. COMMANDER REX was away alertly, set an uncontested early pace,
met bid near the three eighths pole, slight steady near the eighth pole and weakened. Jockey of Commander Rex claimed objection against the winner for
interference nearing the eighth pole and stewards ruled no change. EARS TO ME settled off the early pace along the inside and had no late rally.
