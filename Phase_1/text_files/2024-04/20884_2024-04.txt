Footnotes
MUNI MUNI SLEW never far back, rallied three wide through the turn then five wide in upper stretch under right handed urging to make the lead inside the
furlong marker and proved best under strong handling. K P SILVER BULLET waited inside, dug in determinedly along the rail and got up for second. THE
RED MAN pressed the pace four then two wide into the turn, made the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished.
CRIMSON ROCKET stalked the pace between horses into the stretch and faded late. ENZOEXPRESS set a pressured pace along the inside for nearly a
half, had speed past the furlong marker then gave way readily..

NO MAS CERVEZA broke inward bumping AGNELLO CITY into CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS at the start, stalked the pace three wide into the turn, was put
to left handed urging before the quarter pole, dug in two wide under a strong hand ride late and got up in the final strides. REDDEN broke in front and was
headed briefly soon after the start, set the balance of the pace, edged clear on the turn then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. AGNELLO CITY
was bumped at the start, moved up three wide through the turn then leveled off. CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS also bumped at the start, had speed along the
inside into the turn, gave way and pulled up bleeding from the nostrils after completing the course. PLAYING BALL was hustled from the gate to gain a brief
lead soon after the start, prompted the pace along the rail into the turn then dropped back and trailed.

DANZA MAGIC with the second flight three, responded under left handed urging four wide to make the lead nearing the furlong marker, drifted to the middle
of the racetrack and drew off under strong handling. CUE THE BAND stalked the pace along the inside for a half, slipped through to make the lead past the
three sixteenths pole then was no match for the winner. CAUSE OF LOVE never far back, swung wide, and passed tiring rivals mid track. SOLE FACTOR
failed to menace. RAINBOW SHIP chased the pace two wide into the stretch and was through after a half. HITCH CITY away alertly, set the pace to the top
of the stretch then stopped.
