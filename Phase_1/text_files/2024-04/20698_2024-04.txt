Footnotes
COOKIN ROSES broke out, went to the front to set the pace, drifted out in the drive, was under pressure late and held on gamely. THINK BLUE stalked the
pace, closed steadily, was gaining late and just missed. JOLIE RULER got away well, showed good early speed inside, fell back, angled out on the turn and
closed well. SWEET NELLIE stalked the pace, bid inside to loom a threat, hung late and lost position. MISS WINDY SLEW broke out, trailed the field while
saving ground, shifted out to be widest in the drive and offered a mild bid to improve position. HELEN MAE'S SONG was crowded and steadied at the start,
advanced to the turn, bid off the rail and had nothing left. TAP N TWINE was outrun in an even effort.

Footnotes
R KATIEBUG pressed the pace three wide, closed steadily, wore down REBA ATTACK to get up late while fully extended. REBA ATTACK stalked the pace,
rallied four wide on the turn, assumed command with a short lead past the sixteenth pole, led late and was outfinished in a game effort. MISS RIVER RAT
was in tight at the start, trailed the field, closed with a rush and was gaining fast late. BAR MONEY raced between horses, vied past the sixteenth pole and
was unable to sustain her bid. WILDWOOD TRIPLE bumped at the start, was boxed in while close to the pace and didn't have enough late. RUMBRANDT
bumped at the start, was never far off the pace, bid five wide and needed more. FREEDOM ATTACK vied inside to mid stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
GITA'S LAD got away well, set the pace, responded when challenged to duel through the stretch and prevailed in a long drive. DOUBLE THUNDER
pressed the pace, challenged for the lead leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. DANVILLE settled off the pace,
advanced inside to the turn, shifted out, bid and hung. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS was fanned five wide on the first turn, moved up to stalk the pace while racing
in hand, was roused on the turn and lacked the needed late response. ROCKET HOTSHOT broke in, was slow early and improved position in a steady
effort. CHICKS FOR FREE broke slowly, was crowded and steadied at the start, raced evenly and failed to threaten. FLYING SAMURAI veered out start,
saved ground, bid inside and had nothing left. ROGUE ELEMENT showed little.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE got away well, set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and held on gamely. UNIFIED WEEKEND raced close to the
pace towards the outside, rallied into the turn, bid willingly and couldn't get by the winner. MISTER CHARMING was steadied along the backstretch, saved
ground, got through along the rail leaving the turn, bid and hung. ONE WAY HOME broke in the air to be off slowly, was never far back in an outside trip and
had nothing left for the drive. FUTURE VISION raced in hand around the first turn, showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. STORM BORN was
slow early and improved position in an even effort. KEEN RESPONSE broke slowly and was not a threat. SCAT SHACK moved up along the backstretch to
press the pace three wide, challenged on the turn, tired and gave way. SPEEDY G pressed the pace, tired into the second turn and gave way. Pick 8
numbers were 5/6-1/2/5-3/4-2/6-6/7-3/5-1/2-3/9/10.
