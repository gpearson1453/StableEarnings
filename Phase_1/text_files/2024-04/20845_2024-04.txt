Footnotes
ROCKET HOTSHOT saved ground while being reserved off the dueling leaders, angled for for room nearing the eighth pole and was up in the final
sixteenth to win going away. UNIFIED WEEKEND disputed the issue from the outset while racing three-wide and held on well for second in a game effort.
TONALTALITARIAN vied for the lead into the stretch from along the inside and held on fairly well during the drive for third. CHICKS FOR FREE saved
ground while being allowed to settle in stride but lacked a rally when asked. FLYING SAMURAI vied for the lead from between horses to near the quarter
pole then drifted out and tired. KRAMDEN dropped back early and trailed.

handling. AUTOPILOT was allowed to settle early, angled out to be three-wide nearing the quarter pole and closed strongly. TONYS MORNING LINE was
reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. MALIGATOR was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into
the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. LUCKY SHOT dueled for the lead to the stretch from along the outside and tired.

Footnotes
BREAKING NEWS prompted WINGING WAYS while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead from that one nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew
clear. CHRISTMAS PRESENT was allowed to settle early, rallied four-wide the final quarter and finished strongly for the place. WINGING WAYS saved
ground setting the pace, responded when head nearing the quarter pole and held on fairly well during the drive for third. IRISH VALOR saved ground while
being reserved off the early pace and went evenly late. UNCAPTURED PULSE showed brief early speed racing along the inside and weakened.
WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a threat. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER saved ground while being
unhurried and failed to menace.

SHARP STICK broke out to bump with ALVIN then stalked THE RIDGE while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead entering the stretch then quickly
opened a clear lead and maintained a safe advantage to the wire. ICE AXE broke in to bump with ALVIN, then saved ground while being allowed to settle,
angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and finished fast. PERFORMANCE PLUS was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and was
gaining late. COWBOY CAUSE bobbled slightly at the start then was forwardly placed while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. THE RIDGE saved ground
setting the pace to the stretch and tired when headed. ALVIN was bumped from both sides at the start then settled in the middle of the pack while racing
three-wide and gave way nearing the stretch. LAUREATE dropped well back early and trailed.

MAD DRAGON saved ground setting the pace and gradually drew clear. GETTIN PAID was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a
bid nearing the quarter pole but was unable to match strides with the winner during the drive. GRAPHENE CASSOCK was allowed to settle early while
racing three-wide on the turn and closed strongly. JUST BECAUSE was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. STOLICH
saved ground while being reserved off the early pace but lacked a rally. MASQUERADE BALL dropped back early and failed to seriously threaten.
OVERDUE HONOR prompted the early pace while racing two-wide, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole in tight and gave way thereafter.

Footnotes
FRANKEL BABY set the pace while racing slightly off the rail, responded when challenged by MUSED nearing the eighth pole and prevailed under strong
handling. DESSERT FIRST was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch and finished fast. MUSED (GB) prompted the pace from along
the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole but wasn't quite good enough in a steady effort. RUNNERS HEAT settled in the middle of the field
early, was five-wide the final quarter and finished in a mild rally. PALACE MAGIC saved ground while being allowed to settle but lacked a rally when called
upon. SIGNATURE STREET dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position late. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC was unhurried
early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. BALI BABY hopped slightly at the start then was unhurried, came six-wide into the stretch and
failed to menace. SHORT STRAW prompted the early pace while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and tired. THE PLACE PICK 8
NUMBERS WERE 1/6-2/3-1/3-3/5-5/7-2/3/4/6-2/4/7-4/7.
