then gave way. SILK PRINCE , outrun, swung four wide turning for home and dropped back. PAYNTED THUNDER stayed along the inner rail around the
turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
TRASH TALKIN LARRY prompted the pace three wide outside KEANU, was aggressively ridden to bid then take over around the far turn, moved clear past
the three eighths, opened up under solid asking in upper stretch then continued to widen while hand urged the final furlong. KEANU , eager to the lead, set
a rated pace two wide while being shadowed by the winner, ceded command into the far turn, stayed on to prompt past the three eighths, shifted out under
pressure past the five sixteenths, wandered outward a bit entering the lane, straightened away soon after, faded through the final furlong but had enough
left to save the place. ONLY CHILD , three wide and in the clear, was under a hustling ride around the final turn but lacked a serious finish. HACHURE
settled off the pace, saved ground under asking into the stretch but failed to generate a rally. BUSHWICK BRUISER , well placed early on while saving
ground, angled around the final turn, circled five wide into the stretch and faded. WONDER WATER , off the pace, was urged off the inside around the final
turn but lacked a kick. FOOD FOODIE was outrun.

BESTSUGARDADDYEVER bumped with FLAT OUT FLYING entering the first turn, was wrangled back off the leaders while saving some ground into the
backstretch, eased out and settled in stalking spot, edged up into the far turn then bid four deep past the three eighths, vied outside a pair nearing the lane
then took over when asked, spurted away leaving the three sixteenths, eagerly opened up under firm left handed asks and was kept alert to the wire.
SPEARGUN , quickly to the front, set the pace towards the inner rail, was joined by a trio to his outside leaving the far turn, sparred under strong urging past
the five sixteenths, kept on gamely through the final furlong and battled back to outdo FLAT OUT FLYING for the place. FLAT OUT FLYING , bumped with
the winner then steadied in clear near the seven and half furlong marker, shifted in some and tracked behind the leaders, was sent up two wide between
runners to threaten into the far turn, dueled on a slim lead past the five sixteenths, failed to contain the winner to his outside soon into the lane, gave hard
chase from there while outside SPEARGUN but hung late and lost the place. UNCLE IRISH stalked three wide outside SPEARGUN, afforded a seam to an
inner rival into the far turn then dueled three wide between foes, failed to go on with the embattled leaders into the stretch and weakened. AMERICAN
D'ORO settled off the pace while saving ground, edged up some around the far turn, chased the leading quartet as they battled near the five sixteenths,
swung out wide in the drive and tired.

Footnotes
TRUE SUNSHINE stumbled at the break, recovered and edged up about four wide outside rivals heading to the turn, took closer order past the five
sixteenths then bid three deep into the lane, emerged in a duel outside REE NEE'S SIX leaving the three sixteenths, came in a touch and brushed with that
one soon after, dueled on a slim lead and under some right handed asking past the sixteenth marker and held sway. REE NEE'S SIX rated back after an
alert start, moved up to the inside of a rival past the five sixteenths, eased out then bid between runners in upper stretch, brushed with the winner while
battling on near even terms past the furlong grounds, kept on valiantly but just wasn't good enough. MUCHO TIGGER broke a step slow, raced well off the
early pace, moved up two wide into the stretch, continued progression past mid stretch, angled out and found her best stride too late. BLUE TRILLION was
nudged from the gate then cleared under some rating past the five eighths, set the pace two wide into the lane, dug in when confronted by the top pair,
fought on past the eighth pole then weakened late. SWEETERTHANWHISKEY , off slowly, lagged off the early pace, angled out, circled six wide into the
lane then offered a mild kick on her left lead. LISA'S PALACE , off the pace, raced five wide in upper stretch but lacked a serious run. DIANE'S MERLOT
edged up nearing the half and stalked three wide, remained a presence to upper stretch, lacked a punch in mid stretch and gave way. LADY CHARLOTTE
had speed to the inside of BLUE TRILLION, rated back off that one past the five eighths then saved ground, failed to go on leaving the three eighths and
faded. BUNNY HOP popped the gate open pre race but did not get away, flashed speed inside then steadied leaving the five eighths, dropped back leaving
the far turn, angled out and came up empty.

Footnotes
QUINT'S BREW drifted out some when advancing inside rivals soon after the start, set a rated pace in about the two path, handled outside pressure around
the turn, responded to a couple of right handed asks in upper stretch and spurted away from WORKISLIFE, swerved inward and switched over to his left
lead when being flashed the crop a furlong out, corrected and switched back to his right lead leaving the sixteenth pole then widened under a steady hand
ride. WORKISLIFE , three to four wide stalking outside rivals, ranged up to loom a serious threat soon into the lane, could not quite quicken with the winner
in mid stretch but stayed on with good energy to be well clear of the rest. MASAKADO prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, failed to go on
under pressure near mid stretch and faded. GOODBYE NOTE broke outward, regrouped and edged up in hand and between runners, stalked between foes
leaving the far turn, was under a ride pursuing the leaders into the stretch, lacked a kick and weakened in the drive. AMERICAN WAR HERO settled behind
foes early, angled out around the turn, was under a ride pursuing five to six wide in upper stretch and gave way. FORMAL AFFAIR steadied off the heels of
the winner heading to the end of the chute, stalked inside, failed to go on under asking around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
LA SIERVA C lacked speed, circled the turn four deep, took command under brisk urging in mid stretch and eagerly drew off. JUST THE THING made the
early lead, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead in mid stretch, weakened and held the place. CUNDI , a forward factor along the inner rail, waited for
room approaching the stretch and lacked the needed rally. LORRAINE'S WAY stalked the pace, raced in the three path around the turn and retreated
through the stretch. MAXIMUM EMILY chased the pace in the two path to the stretch then faltered. TOHONORSTELLE swung to the five path turning for
home then dropped back. BACALL trailed.
