Footnotes
LUCKIES JOY set the pace from the two path into the far turn, continued with a short lead into the lane, was challenged by another into the lane, asked for
more near the eighth pole and drew away. GOOD FOREVER raced in the three or four path through the turn and into the lane, continued on methodically
and just got up for the place spot. BINGE saved ground through the turn and into the lane, waited while entering the lane, bid and looked to be a serious
threat, could not keep up with the top one and lost the place spot late. CRINGE raced in the three path through the turn, was asked for more in late turn and
lacked the closing response. KILLER HOTROD never a threat while along the inside. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE was in the two or three path through the turn,
swung into the lane from the six path and never factored. MARIACHI JUSTICE never a menace along the inside. SPOTONJUSTICE prompted the pace two
wide through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
MR CHAOS chased the dueling leaders through the turn while along the inside, tipped into the three path for the drive then stayed on determinedly to just
get up late. CLASSIC MAX set the pace while under pressure from another from the outside, shook that one off after straightening in the lane, cleared and
was just caught late. ZAPPINIT raced near the rail through the turn, angled into the four path for the drive and found best stride late. C. J'S STORM raced
along the inside through the turn while in the back, cut the corner into the lane and was gaining to the end. RUN AWAY ROJO chased the pace from the
three path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing bid. FOLLOW THE MONEY was near the back through mid-turn, angled into the six path
for the drive and never factored. MANUELITO never a factor while in the two or three path through the turn and into the lane. EASY OPERATOR prompted
the pace through the turn and into the lane then was suddenly empty just inside the eighth pole. D'ORO'S WISH raced in the three path through the turn and
made little impact.
