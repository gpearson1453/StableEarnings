OKIE TROUBLE set a pressured early pace along the inside, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. OKIE CODE chased the top pair early, raced
three wide near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire. RAINBOW SMILES settled off the early pace, made a good rail bid through the drive and
moved up to improve position. GOSPEL FAITH pressed the early leader from the outside two deep and weakened through the drive. LAMENTABLE JARIN
dropped back early, angled in early, had an inside run and lacked a bid. SULPHUR SUE raced mid pack early, swung five wide into the upper stretch and
had no late rally. FLY FENIX FLY stalked the pace, raced four wide around the far turn and weakened. RAINING broke awkwardly, lost a considerable
amount of ground at the start, raced far back and trailed.

Footnotes
DERBY DAY LASSIE was coaxed along from the outside of rivals to press early, had a long drive with Stormy Bisonette and just got up in a determined
effort under strong handling. STORMY BISONETTE vied for the early lead between rivals down the backstretch, dug in late and missed in a game effort.
PEARLY chased the early pace, swung five wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. COZZOLANI chased the early pace setters, was
near the inside past the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch run and closed in mildly. FACESTER pressed the early pace between rivals and
weakened in the drive. STRONG WOMAN hard sent to vie near the rail and faded. APRETTYLULABY raced two wide near the quarter pole, angled out in
the stretch run and never threatened. BEBOP BABY dropped back early and failed to respond. EXCETERA raced four to five wide around the far turn and
had no response.

Footnotes
SLICK COUNTRY BOY tracked the early leader, dueled through the far turn and held well to prevail late under strong handling. WESTCOAST BREEZE
settled to race mid pack early, ridden along near the five sixteenths pole, was near the rail through the stretch run and closed in gamely to narrowly edge up
for the place position. DRAG MALIBU chased the early pace, raced three wide between near the quarter pole, eased out through the stretch run and
finished gamely to the wire. PRINCE OF EARL raced near the back of the pack early on, moved up four to five between rivals through the stretch run and
closed in too late. AMMENTHEDESTROYER swung six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive while racing from the far
outside. MONEY EXPRESS broke though the gate pre-race, sent to a clear early lead and faded. CAPTAIN DOZER chased the early going, raced four wide
near the three sixteenths pole and faded. HELLO MR COPELAND dropped back early on, raced near the rail into the upper stretch and had no response.
BABY LIAISON was hustled along early, raced five wide around the far turn and gave way. The five eighths fractional time was unavailable.

CHUY GARZA Y. G. prompt the early leader two wide from the outside, had full command near the quarter pole and drew off to be clear under a strong
hand ride. AWESOME OUTLAW rated along early, took aim four wide near the three sixteenths pole but was no match late to clearly be second best.
HERO TIME dropped back early on, made a two to three wide bid and moved up late to improve position. OKIE CHROME settled off the early going, swung
six wide in the lane and made a late gain to improve position. BLAKE FROM TISH void of early speed, was near the inside past the quarter pole, angled out
through the stretch run to race from the far outside and never threatened. EL CHIHUAS raced three wide around the far turn and had no response. MISTER
TYRO set a pressured early pace along the inside and faded. IRA CHAMP stalked the pace from the outside, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole
and weakened through the drive. WOODS OF CONGAREE dropped back early and failed to respond. C B'S FLAT OUT tracked the pace from the inside
and gave way. The five eighths internal fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
GIRLS A LEGACY dueled for the early lead near the inside, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. AUNT KENDRA dueled for the early lead three
deep between rivals, dug in and finished gamely to the wire to just miss. UNBRIDLED KISSES stalked the pace, raced four to five wide in the lane and
finished gamely to the wire. GRAY PEARL settled off the early going, was near the inside around the far turn, angled through the stretch run to race from the
outside and moved up to improve position. GOOD LIQUOR stalked the pace two deep between rivals and weakened a bit through the drive. OPELUCY was
off slowly, had an inside run around the far turn into the lane and never threatened. DA LAST TEQUILA dueled for the early lead three wide and weakened
through the drive. O S U BUDKE dropped back with the second flight early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had no late response. LIL TIZZY was
off slowly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, swung five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. LITTLE MO BROWN dropped
back and failed to respond. The five eighths internal fractional time was unavailable.
