Footnotes
VERITAS AEQUITAS stayed in the clear two to three wide, tracked the leading pair from close range always traveling well, was sent after the lead from the
five-sixteenths pole, took command, drew off to open lengths in the stretch and won clear. BROTHER O' BRIEN broke out at the start and made light
contact with MISCHIEF'S KING, saved ground, settled behind and raced close up to the leading pair to the far turn, became stuck behind horses
approaching the stretch allowing the eventual winner to get first run, then swung out to the three path, finished well while racing on the left lead, was gaining
once straightened but was too late. GRAND SLAM KID restless in the gate, was sent from the break for the early lead then set about to temper the early
pace racing along the rail under a snug hold while pressed by MISCHIEF'S KING, then went together with that foe through very moderate fractions to the far
turn, had no response when the eventual winner mounted a challenge from the quarter pole and finished even paced to the wire. MISCHIEF'S KING broke
well and pressed GRAND SLAM KID on the lead racing in the two path, came under pressure from the quarter pole, did not go on and was outrun the rest of
the way.

DADS DREAM sent to establish the early lead, set a modest pace into the backstretch run and drew clear at the half-mile marker, controlled the pace into
the far turn and extended the lead into the stretch under steady urging, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, felt mild pressure from oncoming
rivals in deep stretch and held safely for the win at the finish. SUNRISE MISCHIEF attended to the early pace, lost a bit of ground to DADS DREAM along
the backstretch run and stalked the modest pace to the half-mile marker, chased into the far turn and was outkicked into upper stretch, was gaining on
DADS DREAM into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held well for second in the final strides. IT AINT OVER unhurried in
the early running, saved ground into the backstretch run and was content to trail to the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn, swung
three wide for the drive, rallied into the final sixteenth and just missed for place honors at the finish.

Footnotes
NAFTIS showed good speed away from the start, engaged with BEGIN AGAIN and contested a solid early pace with that rival, dueled into the turn and
pressed the pace two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, battled BEGIN AGAIN into upper stretch then shook free of that one at the furlong marker,
switched leads and kicked clear into the final sixteenth, was kept to task into deep stretch and maintained a clear lead to the finish to hold sway. I AM
AMADEO broke alertly, took back and tracked the solid early pace, stalked the leading pair two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased three wide into the
stretch, could not make headway on the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. DELIAN LEAGUE a step slow away from the start, settled off of
the solid early pace and saved ground into the turn, tipped two wide into upper stretch, closed into the final sixteenth, could not impact the top two in deep
stretch and was up in time to secure third. KAMAINA CRUISER a step slow leaving the start, settled off of the early pace while never far back, saved ground
into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch, did not offer a late response and was outfinished for third. BEGIN AGAIN hustled leaving the start,
engaged with NAFTIS in the early going and disputed a solid pace inside of that runner heading to the half-mile marker, dueled through quick fractions into
the turn and battled NAFTIS into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch.

Footnotes
WESTWARD BREEZE was sent for the lead and joined by BOBBY'S GENIE then left alone when that rival lugged out going into the first turn, relaxed nicely
down the backstretch while setting solid fractions, turned back all challengers when set down in the stretch, dug in, finished strong under steady handing
and won well. TIZ MY PRINCESS was allowed to settle into stride from the break and content to race mid-pack for the first half mile, made steady forward
progress down the backstretch while racing three wide, rallied under a drive from the three furlong pole and sustained the run in the stretch to get up for
second. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) was hustled out of the gate and seized the rail, allowing the pace scenario to play out in front, raced mid-pack to the far
turn then was set down from the three furlong marker, had to wait for room from the quarter pole to the top of the stretch, got clear in upper stretch and
finished well under steady handling while no threat to the winner. SUPER CARO lacked speed from the gate and settled near the back of the field and two
to three wide through the first half mile, started to run on with about three furlongs to run, hit a roadblock at the furlong marker, swung to the four path for
clear run and was gaining some at the wire. A CROWN FOR KITTEN took a couple of light bumps from KITTEN'S KID and shuffled back after the second
bump, was last into the first turn, got over to the rail and trailed the field down the backstretch, started a nice run on the inside through the turn then was
boxed in at the top of the stretch, had to steady before the eighth pole and again in deep stretch when unable to find racing room. KITTEN'S KID broke well
and tracked behind WESTWARD BREEZE under a stout hold, was let loose passing the five furlong pole and asked a bit going into the far turn but was not
cutting into the margin of the leader, was put into a drive with about three furlongs to go, made a run at that rival but was turned back at the top of the
stretch, kept to task but was outkicked in deep stretch. BOBBY'S GENIE broke well and was up on the pace going into the first turn, then lugged out and
went very wide, recovered and moved to a tracking position down the backstretch, remained a presence to the three furlong marker then stopped and was
eased to the finish and walked off.

Footnotes
TAMARA MINE away in good order, ceded the early lead and settled off of the fast pace heading to the half-mile marker, tracked two wide to the quarter
pole, was roused three to four wide into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, was full of run past mid-stretch and overtook BABY KRISTEN
into the final sixteenth, drew clear in deep stretch and was hand urged to the finish. BABY KRISTEN showed good speed leaving the start, engaged with
QUEEN MOLOTOV in the early running and disputed a fast pace with that rival heading to the half-mile marker, shook free into the turn and set quick
fractions approaching the quarter pole, drew off into the stretch, was overhauled by TAMARA MINE at the sixteenth-marker, could match strides with the
winner into deep stretch and held safely in the end for second. DRAW ME threw her head at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early
going and saved ground into the turn, was content to trail to the quarter pole, tipped two wide into the stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and was up
in time to secure third. QUEEN MOLOTOV prominent away from the start, engaged with BABY KRISTEN in the early going and disputed a quick pace with
that rival heading to the half-mile marker, lost ground into the turn and chased BABY KRISTEN nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace
approaching the furlong pole and gave way in the final sixteenth. HONORABLE GAL took back off of the fast early pace, tracked the leading pair to the
half-mile marker and saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole and could not muster a late
response.

Footnotes
KIKI KRAZY assumed command away from the start, cleared the field in the early stages and showed the way into the first turn, set decent fractions while
well handled through the backstretch run, set a prompted pace into the second turn then shook free into upper stretch, drew clear at the furlong marker and
was kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from the oncoming runner-up into deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. MAGIC
CHROME hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, was a bit rank while forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the pace two wide along the first
turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the second turn and
came three to four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held
well for second at the finish. SELSAE allowed to settle away from the start, raced three wide along the first turn, gained ground into the backstretch run,
chased two wide and between runners into the far turn, made a sustained rally into the stretch, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for
second, while well clear of the rest for third. POKER ALICE allowed to settle while never far back in the early running, went two wide along the first turn and
was well placed through the backstretch run, guided four then three wide along the far turn, lost ground into the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final
sixteenth. ACCLAIMED PREACHER broke through the gate prior to the start, was forwardly placed away from the start and stalked the early pace while
saving ground along the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, chased KIKI KRAZY into the second turn and ran in pursuit of
that rival into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch. ALONG CAME JOANN rank and hard to place in the early
going, saved ground and tracked the pace along the first turn, settled along the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile marker, saved all of the
ground into the far turn, ran evenly into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. CANDY ON TOP allowed to settle in the early stages, raced four wide into
the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, guided two to three wide into the far turn, trailed into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
MY BUCKET LIST was held up near the rear of the field through the early going, saved ground through the turn still in hand and full of run, found a clear
path to angle out to the four path for the stretch run and produced a strong rally to get up in time. TIMELY COMFORT tracked mid-pack and four wide down
the backstretch under some restraint, moved into contention four to five wide around the turn, came into the stretch in the five path opened up on the field in
the stretch, drifting in towards the rail under right handed urging and just failed to last. COUNT ASHER lacked early speed and raced four to five wide with
the tracking group, went into stiff drive with three furlongs to run, came five wide into the stretch and kept on under strong handling to gain the third spot.
RUNNING ON FIRE tracked close up behind the runaway leader, bid between horses for the lead a the quarter pole then could not find another gear when
needed, finishing evenly down the stretch. MANY SILVER BELLS raced close up and three wide to the turn, moved up to challenge for the lead at the
quarter pole and was three wide of four horses fanned across the track at the top of the stretch, remained in contention to mid-stretch then weakened in the
late stages. CATCHME AT THELAKE broke a bit inwards at the start and was slow to get going, was put into a mild drive from the half-mile pole but was
unable to improve. DRUMADOON broke sharply and opened up a clear lead early with the rider attempting in vain to temper the pace, held sway to the
quarter pole, battled for the lead approaching mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way.
