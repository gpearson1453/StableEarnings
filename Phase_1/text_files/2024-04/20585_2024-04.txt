Footnotes
AWESOME WALKER set a pressured early pace, raced four wide into the turn, drew off and was an easy winner. HEAR ME ROAR tracked the early pace,
raced five wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. QUITE LOVELY forced the early pace, raced three wide into the turn, drifted out
and gave way. PEGGY B FAST was allowed to settle early, raced six wide through the turn, shifted in mid stretch and passed tired rivals. SHAME ON
CHARLOTTE was up close early, went four wide into the turn and weakened. INDIAN EXCELLENCE was void of any early speed, raced seven wide and
offered no late rally. RUN LIKE KATE hopped at the start, lost the rider and walked off.
