K O AMERICAN PIE rated along the inside, made a three to two wide bid in the stretch drive and drew off under a strong hand ride. OPTIMISTIC WOMAN
settled off the early going, moved up from the far outside and rallied well for the place position. REBELENA was off slowly, advanced through the far turn,
fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and flattened out in the drive. GOSPEL BLOSSOM pressed the early leader from the inside and weakened.
CHEEKY KISS stalked the pace and weakened in the drive racing two to three wide. GOSPEL COZY veered out at the break, showed good early speed
from the outside and faded. HOLY AMA saved ground and never threatened.
