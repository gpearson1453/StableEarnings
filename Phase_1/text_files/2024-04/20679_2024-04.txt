Footnotes
PORT ELLEN (IRE) was hustled from the break and got good position into the first bend, ceded the early lead to RADIANT QUEEN while pressing the issue
to the far turn, took over near the quarter pole when that rival weakened, came into the stretch with a short lead, was confronted by ORDERLY
TRANSITION nearing the furlong marker, held on gamely under steady handling and dug in in deep stretch to prevail. ORDERLY TRANSITION (GB) was
one of four contesting the early pace into the first turn then backed off to a tracking position under a hold, was let go from the half-mile pole and pulled the
rider up to the leaders racing three wide through the far turn, chased PORT ELLEN (IRE) for the length of the stretch but could not get past that one,
finishing well clear of the next horse. GOLDEN SKYLINE squeezed at the start and was away slowly, unhurried in the early going, trailed far behind the field
to the far turn, went into drive from the nine-sixteenths pole, maintained a two wide path into the stretch and got up for third in the final strides. MATTERS
was outrun from the break but made up ground on the inside through the first turn to be up with the leading group for the run down the backstretch,
struggled to keep up passing the three furlong pole, weakened in the drive but stayed on into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish.
SMOOTH AS BUTTER went four wide into the first turn, continued to race on the outside of the field down the backstretch, tried to rally briefly with
ORDERLY TRANSITION (GB) when that one went to challenge the leaders, but could not sustain the bid and came up empty in the stretch. RADIANT
QUEEN broke well, secured the rail and was inside of four horses contesting the early pace into the clubhouse turn, took the leading heading into the
backstretch under some restraint while being pressed to the outside PORT ELLEN (IRE) through solid fractions, gave way passing the quarter pole and was
not persevered with down the stretch.

Footnotes
LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF settled behind the leading trio and let the pace scenario play out, saved all the ground through the turn, eased out in the four
path for clear run at mid-stretch, responded to a furious hand ride with a bold rally to get up for a share of the top prize. YOU GO GIRL broke sharply then
opted to sit just behind BABY KRISTEN, was a constant shadow to the turn the bid in earnest approaching the quarter pole, was turned back at the top of
the stretch but came back on, battled between horses the length of the stretch, got a head in front in the final yards held strong to the wire only to have to
share the win. ZAZEN broke well and was briefly up on the early pace, was taken back to a tracking position, went three to four wide into the turn and
launched a bid with three furlongs to run, closed relentlessly on the outside, had the rider lose the crop while changing hands at the sixteenth pole and just
missed in a blanket finish. BABY KRISTEN hustled to the front and dueled with YOU GO GIRL and ZAZEN for the early lead the was taken in hand and able
to temper the pace a bit when those two both backed off the pace, responded when roused at the quarter pole and shook free at the top of the stretch, was
all out to hold on in deep stretch and weakened in the final yards.

Footnotes
LAW ABIDING broke well and sprinted clear of the field, opened up a long lead down the backstretch, came into the stretch still in front by open lengths,
kept on under strong handling down the stretch, was fully extended in deep stretch and just lasted for the win at the wire. MR. T'S THIRSTY broke well then
was taken in hand and let LAW ABIDING run off to a long lead, was asked to go on from the half-mile pole and cut into the margin through the turn, came
under pressure passing the three-sixteenths pole, continued to gain under strong handling into the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while just
holding for the place. KINGMEISTER was allowed to settle from the break raced three wide in the tracking group, launched a bid from the nine-sixteenths
pole, closed stoutly on the top pair, surged in the final yards and just missed for the win and place, while clear of the rest for show honors. HAPPY DOES
void of early speed, saved ground into the backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground into the far turn, tipped two wide
into the stretch, found his best stride late but could not impact the leaders at the finish. MOHAWK KING (IRE) got squeezed a bit at the start but was away
in good order, raced in the middle of the tracking group struggled to keep up from the three furlong pole and came up empty in the stretch.

CARSON'S LEGACY allowed to settle leaving the start, saved ground into the first turn, advanced into contention down the backstretch then waited
patiently as the pace picked up near the three furlong pole, angled out four wide into the stretch then was set down after SUNNY SPOT, chased that
stubborn rival for the whole of the stretch, drew to even terms into the final sixteenth, wore down the game runner-up in the final strides and got up at the
wire to determinedly prevail. SUNNY SPOT broke well and settled just behind the pacesetters, moved up to challenge for the lead with three furlongs to go
as the pace picked up, took a slight lead at the quarter pole then shook free into the stretch, met the bid of CARSON'S LEGACY past the furlong marker,
battled gamely into deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding for the place honors. LOOKOUT POINT got away well but was caught three wide
into the first turn, was unhurried down the backstretch then put into a drive just past the nine-sixteenths pole, tipped out three wide into the stretch, closed
willingly under strong handling but ran out of time and was well clear of the rest for third. WALKING BOSS got pinched at the start and then was a bit slow
into stride, steadied slightly going into the clubhouse turn then settled at the rear of the field, saved ground into the backstretch run, was roused three wide
into the stretch, could not impact the leaders in the late stages and offered a mild late rally. LYING GHOST was sent from the break, was able to seize the
rail and proceeded to slow down the pace with LOLO PANIOLO alongside, set pedestrian fractions to the far turn, was overtaken at the quarter marker,
battled into the stretch and remained prominent at the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and tired in deep stretch. LOLO PANIOLO
broke out into WALKING BOSS but was hustled forward, took up a stalking position under a snug hold just to the outside of LYING GHOST, prompted the
modest pace to the half-mile marker, vied between rivals as the pace quickened with three furlongs to run, gave way at the top of the stretch and was outrun
from there.

MOGOLLON RIM unhurried from the break, settled well behind the pace while saving ground through the far turn, responded when set down with three
furlongs to run, swung four wide into the stretch and produced a bold rally to win clear despite having some trouble changing leads. UNION WAVE broke
best and went for the early lead, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, was pressed by COUSIN RICHIE to the far turn, shook
off that rival near the quarter pole then came into the stretch with something in reserve, began to shorten strides with a furlong to go, was overtaken into the
final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch for place honors. DOO WOP DON three wide into the first turn, tracked well behind the pacesetters for the first
half mile, went three wide to bid for the lead from the quarter pole, ran on well under steady handling but was outfinished. COUSIN RICHIE prompted
UNION WAVE under an early hold, made a brief bid on the far turn but struggled to keep pace heading into the stretch and tired in the drive. PER THE
HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, COUSIN RICHIE HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

YES HE CAN broke sharply but ceded the early lead to COWBOY CHARLIE, never let that one get too far away while always traveling well, took command
at the top of the stretch and drew clear the furlong marker, felt a bit of pressure from oncoming rivals and kept to task in deep stretch, while holding safely in
a drive at the finish. THUNDER OF ZION raced mid-pack on the inside to the turn, made some forward progress while still on the rail through the turn,
tipped out three wide for the stretch run, rallied under strong handling into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and just held in the
end for second. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM last through the early stages, advanced three to four wide through the turn, came into the stretch with good
momentum but running on the wrong lead, finished well into the final sixteenth and just missed for the place. COWBOY CHARLIE pushed to the front and
gained the early lead, tried to slip away from the field with three furlongs to go but was challenged and overtaken by YES HE CAN at the head of the stretch,
chased that rival to the furlong grounds, could not muster a final response and weakened in deep stretch. WINTER FALCON was asked to rate leaving the
start, pulled on the rider approaching the half-mile marker and chased the fast pace three to four wide into the turn, was well placed nearing the quarter
pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. REFI NOW unhurried from the break, lost ground two to three wide approaching
the quarter pole, trailed into the stretch and did not threaten.

LORD SHELDON allowed to settle while never far back, saved ground into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker,
waited patiently for room until well into the stretch, split rivals at the furlong marker, slipped to the inside and closed fast into deep stretch, surged in the final
strides and was up in time for a determined win. EGOMANIA broke out and made slight contact with SECRET CLUB, then was held up near the rear of the
field racing between horses, was let loose from the half mile marker then idled through the far turn waiting for running room, angled out four wide into the
stretch, responded to strong handling, dueled with ROBIE down the stretch and traded bumps with that rival past mid-stretch, held a narrow lead into the
final sixteenth, was overtaken by LORD SHELDON in the final strides and held well at the finish for second. ROBIE broke well then went with the leaders
three wide into the first bend, backed off the pace the pulled back towards the leaders passing the six furlong marker, settled into a close up tracking
position for the middle of the contest then started a forward move from the three furlong pole three wide, went head-to-head with EGOMANIA down the
stretch, exchanged bumps with that rival along the way, fought gamely to deep stretch and was outfinished for the win and place, while just holding for the
show honors. TALBOT BAY was off a bit slow then came under a snug early hold, was pulling hard on the rider down the backstretch as the field bunched
up, checked slightly approaching the five-sixteenths pole, tried to rally but was blocked behind a wall of horses in the stretch, tipped out and finally got clear
near the sixteenth pole, closed willingly in deep stretch and missed for third. DRUIDIC hustled from the gate and vied with AZURE STAR (IRE) for the early
lead into the first turn, backed off into a staking position while under a strong hold, launched a bid from the three eighths marker but was already under
heavy pressure passing the quarter pole, vied for the lead at mid-stretch, soldiered on with good courage but was outkicked in the late stages. SECRET
CLUB was crowded by a neighboring rival at the start and was away a bit slowly, was floated four wide through the clubhouse turn the pulled into contention
down the backstretch, was pushed to stay with the pace near the nine-sixteenths pole, went four wide through the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch
and could not muster a late response. AZURE STAR (IRE) was hustled from the gate to get forward position, dueled briefly with DRUDIC through the first
turn the pulled clear under some restraint, tried to slow down the pace then quickened again when beset by a host of challengers, committed to the lead
down the backstretch, led the field to the top of the stretch then weakened in the drive. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN
INVOLVING ROBIE AND EGOMANIA. THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WAS MUTUAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE TWO IN THE STRETCH DRIVE
AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
PROOF HE RIDES tracked the early pace from close range on the inside, was roused three wide into the stretch, rallied strongly under steady handling and
vied for the lead at the furlong pole, took command into the final sixteenth and drew clear in deep stretch. COASTAL JAZZ broke well and pressed WAR
GAMES through very quick early fractions, move up to bid for the lead at the quarter pole but had trouble getting by that stubborn rival, battled into the
stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, could not match strides with PROOF HE RIDES into the final sixteenth and bested WAR GAMES for
place honors. WAR GAMES sent from the break, led the field through quick fractions with several challengers in close attendance, held sway to mid-stretch,
could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second in the final strides. ARMA D'ORO settled off of the fast early
pace, saved ground into the turn, advanced at mid-stretch, could not sustain that rally into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. HONEYMOONZ OVER
raced up close while three to four wide, went into a drive with three furlongs to go, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
ELEVADO was pushed for speed from the break but could not keep up, dropped back to last before the turn, swung widest into the stretch and did not
factor.
