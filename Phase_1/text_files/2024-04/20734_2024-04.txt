Footnotes
DUBSTEP trailed in the two path early, moved three wide around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch and inched ahead of a stubborn foe. NO
WASABI FOR ME pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, fought on inside of that foe to
the wire then was vanned off. LADY AZTECA saved ground off the pace, waited for room around the far turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole and
had a mild rally. MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) raced off the pace two wide, angled in in upper stretch, tipped back out leaving the eighth pole and was
outfinished for the show. ANDIE ONE saved ground in range, tipped two wide near the quarter pole and faded. L. E. GRAY set the pace along the rail, gave
way near the quarter pole and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
TAKING IT ALL showed the way in the two path, waited confidently while just off the rail rounding the turn, was roused along the inside at the top of the
lane, and kicked away. QUEEN HONESTY rated inside, was cued in the two path midway around the turn, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, and
kept on for place. MRS. CASH MAN laid up close in the three path, was coaxed from the two path early around the turn, swung from the four path into the
lane, evened out, but held show. KHOZANKA tracked in the two path, was coaxed along from the four path rounding the turn, floated out to the eight path in
upper stretch, but was one paced. MY SARASOTA QUEEN laid in range in the two path, was nudged along the rail around the turn, but flattened in the two
path down the lane. HARD SPICE raced wellback in the three path, tipped to the two path entering the turn, but made no impact. NIPSEY stalked in the four
path but weakened entering the lane. BULLET ON TARGET chased in the four path but never threatened. ITRIEDSELLINGHER raced off the pace in the
five path but was no menace. DOCTOR DAISY tailed throughout from the five to seven paths.

Footnotes
MY ROYAL VOW stalked in the four path, bid between foes passing the quarter, took the lead in the three path at the top of the lane, and kicked on to hold
off a late charging outer foe. CUMBERLAND FALLS tracked in the two path, had to wait around the far turn, angled out passing the quarter, floated out to
the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. KILKENNY BELLA chased in the four path, loomed in the five path under coaxing midway
around the far turn, and kept on in the four path down the lane for show. MYSTIC SUNRISE had a slow start, trailed inside down the backstretch, was
stymied in the two path passing the quarter, floated out to the six path in upper stretch, but made no impact. FAST KIMMIE led around the first turn, was
overtaken by an outer foe and laid up close along the inside around the backstretch, came under rousing going into the far turn, took the lead again passing
the three-eighths, but faded along the inside in the stretch. GRATIA got rank around the first turn and rushed up four wide to vie for the lead in the three path
down the backside, but yielded entering the stretch. CHILLING FACTOR steadied around the first turn, rated in the two path, was driven in the four path
around the far turn, but failed to menace.

Footnotes
EMPRESS ELLIE set a rated pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and held clear under steady urging. GO BIG GREEN saved ground in range and
ran on for the place. FLYING BLACK chased the winner two wide, could not match strides in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the show. FISH MOONEY
trailed inside for six furlongs and rallied belatedly for a minor slice. SALS DREAM GIRL raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and
was no threat. LOVE HER LOTS settled off the early pace while racing two wide, made a three wide middle move but failed to sustain it. DON'T GET
PICKLED was hard held inside, swung out in upper stretch and made little impact.

QUESTER stalked in the four path, was coaxed from the three path into the far turn, bid in the five path at the top of the lane, drew past the inner pacesetter
around the sixteenth, and went clear. DUNES OF GOLD broke in and bumped an inner foe, showed the way in the two path, was nudged around the far
turn, roused into the stretch, floated out to the four path, and was caught around the sixteenth to place. SWIFT DELIVERY got bumped by an inner foe early
into the first turn, raced off the pace in the five path, was ridden in the four path around the far turn, tipped out to the six path entering the stretch, but drifted
in on his left lead in the final furlong, and evened out for show. GUAIO got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, trailed in the two path early,
was driven in the four path around the far turn, but made no impact. DOCTOR'S ORDERS got bumped at the start by an outer foe, tracked in the two path,
was driven from the rail around the far turn, but flattened down the lane. WHAT PLAN got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, then
bumped an outer foe early into the first turn, raced wellback in the three path and never threatened. MAJOR OFFENSIVE rated in the three path but never
menaced.

Footnotes
SWASHBUCKLE set the pace in the two path and dug in through the lane to just last. LORENZ (BRZ) saved ground in range, tipped two wide near the
quarter pole, rallied between foes and just missed inside of the winner. VALENTINE BUG broke awkwardly, raced off the pace in the two path, advanced
five wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied for the show. CENTRODELANTERO stalked the pace three wide, bid around
the far turn but was one-paced through the lane. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY raced in range two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and was
outkicked in the stretch. YACOWLEF (IRE) steadied along inside for a half, went two wide around the far turn, tipped out midstretch, made progress then
steadied again in deep stretch. JERRY'S TURN prompted the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. YOU TALKIN TO ME failed to menace while racing
three and four wide. DOMINATE THEMOMENT chased the pace three and four wide and faded in the drive.

HOLIDAY PAY prompted the pace in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, bid in the five path while hanging on his left lead in upper
stretch, took the lead before the eighth pole, then switched to his right lead and drew clear through the final sixteenth. SOUND OF THE BEAST showed the
way in the two path, was roused approaching the quarter, lost the lead before the eighth pole, but held place. EKATI KING chased in the four path, was
ridden along the rail around the turn, drifted out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and was along for show. LOUIE THE SUN KING raced off the pace
in the six path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. JIGSAW stalked in the six path but was
empty turning into the lane.

BOUNCER set the pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. SIGILOSO stalked the pace in the four path, steadily gained through the lane and just
missed. RED RIVER REBEL saved ground in midpack, lacked the needed rally but kept on to gain the show. COMEDY TOWN broke awkwardly and was
bumped at the start, rushed up between foes, pressed the winner in the three path and weakened through the final furlong. VOLKERT chased the pace in
the two path, angled out in midstretch and lacked a rally. FREE SMOKE bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. FAIR HAIRED BOY
checked near the seven-sixteenths marker, dropped back inside, angled out in upper stretch and had no further bids.
