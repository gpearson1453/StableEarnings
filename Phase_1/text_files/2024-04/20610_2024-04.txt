Footnotes
ELEPHANTS EAR tracked along the inside, got shuffled back behind a checking rival entering the backstretch, shfited out with five furlongs to go, inched
closer four wide around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, sparred with inner rivals through the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. BOURBON SOCIETY
vied three to two wide around the first turn, moved to the inside straightening into the backstretch, showed the way along the inside around the far turn, dug
in to resist a pair of outer challenges in upper stretch, gamely battled through deep stretch but missed in a tight photo. BATTEN DOWN settled off of the
pace in the three to four path around the first turn, tracked three wide around the far turn, crept closer along with an outer rival while brushing with an inner
foe nearing the lane, bid along with his outer counterpart in upper stretch, dueled between horses in the final furlong but needed more. BANNED FOR LIFE
stalked four to three wide early on, pressed two wide coming under urging around the far turn, but was brushed while outmoved by outer rivals entering the
lane and sustained a chase thereafter. EL MAGNIFICO prompted two wide and between horses into the first turn before backing off to track among foes
around that bend, chased into the far turn and faded nearing the lane. ASK ARTHUR broke a step slow, trailed and made little impact. BOAT HOUSE vied
along the inside, steadied to ease off of the pace nearing the backstretch, then weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
BILLAL vied with an outer rival around the turn, began to inch away from his outer counterpart entering the final furlong and shook free with a sixteenth to
go. SCATIFY vied outside of the eventual winner, but failed to maintain level terms with that one in midstretch, yielded at the sixteenth pole and was clear of
the rest. KNICKS STORM took contact to his hind quarters from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, pursued between horses around the
turn, battled with an outer foe for show through the final furlong and gamely held. PIRATE bobbled and bumped an inner rival at the start, raced off of the
pace in the five path, advanced mildly to bid for show in upper stretch, dueled for that position with an inner foe through the final furlong but was staved off.
GUANARE stalked from the four path, but weakened between horses through the lane. BLEDSOE tracked along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
DISCREET MISCHIEF vied three to two wide, led between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, kicked away entering the lane and drew off under a
drive. TIMEOUT broke a step slow, shifted out to the four path well off of the pace at the three furlong pole, picked up stride moving six wide nearing
midstretch, rallied to gain place in the final sixteenth and held from an outer rival. D'ORO UNBRIDLED trailed in the five path, fanned to the seven path
entering upper stretch and rallied. LIEUTENANT GENERAL vied two wide and between horses, moved to the inside into the turn, got headed by his outer
counterpart nearing the five sixteenths pole, proved no match for that one entering the lane, maintained place into the final sixteenth but weakened late.
CARNITINE was off a beat slow, stalked three wide, pressed the top pair at the three furlong pole, but yielded in upper stretch and gave way hanging on his
left lead. VESTURE was eased back to track from off of the pace three wide entering the backstretch, brushed with an outer foe at the nine sixteenths pole,
then only managed to chase between horses through the lane. BEBEDOURO raced off of the pace five to six wide and lacked a bid hanging on his left lead.
PRINCE OF POWER failed to factor from the three path. AVAILABILITY pursued from midpack four wide and between horses, brushed with rivals on both
sides at the nine sixteenths pole, steadied in crowded quarters among foes in upper stretch, drifted in and faded. BOOKIE BRENT broke a beat slow and
was in a bit tight between horses at the start, rushed forward early on, tracked two wide and between horses around the turn then weakened. THIS TIME
prompted along the inside, stalked from the pocket around the turn, then folded. COUNTER ATTACK tracked five wide, brushed an inner rival with nine
sixteenths to go, but faded four wide and between horses into the turn and was done early.

Footnotes
PREVALENCE prompted two wide, vied into the turn, gained an advantage turning for home, drew off entering the lane and widened under a drive.
SURVEILLANCE was stubbornly reluctant to load, brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked from the two path into the turn, moved forward in the four
path in upper stretch to gain place at the three sixteenths pole, then fended off an outer bidder for that position through the final furlong. NIGHT TIME laid off
of the pace in the four to five path and between horses, bid for place in midstretch but was kept at bay. BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR led inside of an outer vying
rival into the turn, got headed by that one with five sixteenths to go, proved no match entering the lane and faded. MIDNIGHT ESCAPE trailed in the three to
four path, fanned seven wide in upper stretch and surpassed tired rivals. CLASSIER was last away, raced off of the pace while kept in the six path, then
lacked a bid and tired. MILES AHEAD was brushed by an outer rival at the start, chased along the inside, gave way turning for home and lacked a re-rally.

Footnotes
WHITE PALOMINO stalked along the inside rating just behind the leaders, split the leaders at the three sixteenths pole, kicked clear and held sway. EL
REZEEN bumped with an inner foe at the start, settled off of the pace two to three wide and between horse, took the far turn in the four path, split rivals in
upper stretch, stayed on between horses, reached place at the sixteenth pole and held. FORT THOMAS lacked speed along the inside, took the far turn in
the four path before swinging to the eight path in upper stretch, then offered a belated kick to miss reaching place. STOP THE PRESS was bumped and put
to crowded quarters by an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace three to five wide, floated seven wide into the turn, offered slow progress through
midstretch, but was outkicked for show by a wider rival in the final sixteenth. CABERNAYDO was bumped between horses and pinched back at the start,
trailed into the far turn, took that bend in the three path, then moved up between horses. THORNBURY prompted the leader from the three path, but was
outkicked by an inner bidder in upper stretch, lost place at the sixteenth pole and yielded. ARTEMPUS broke out and hampered outer rivals at the start,
pursued along the inside, then in the two to three path around the far turn and lacked a bid chasing along the rail. TELESCOPIC tracked two wide, shifted
out before taking the far turn in the five path, then faded between horses. TAPAKENA took simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at the start, laid
off of the pace three wide, then six wide around the far turn, and tired between horses in midstretch hanging on his left lead. CHASING KITTY showed the
way along the inside, but was no match for an outer bidder in upper stretch and folded. THOUSAND SPRINGS was a bit antsy in the starting gate, stalked
from the four path and weakened between horses. HOLIDAY CHARM broke a beat slow, saved ground off of the pace but to no avail.

BO CRUZ prompted the leader from the three path, vied into the turn, led turning for home, drew off entering the lane and held sway. MINNESOTA READY
stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, claimed place in upper stretch after the eventual winner kicked away and chased that one willingly
thereafter. WICO (IRE) checked among foes leaving the three quarter pole, tracked two wide and between horses, chased through the lane and held show.
CALL ME FAST raced off of the pace in the five path, ran on mildly and missed show. RAISE CAIN laid off of the pace three wide, got outmoved by an outer
rival while lacking racing room turning for home, swung out to the six path in upper stretch but lacked a bid. RICHIESONAROLL showed the way inside of a
vying rival, got headed by that one turning for home and weakened. FRAT PACK chased along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
BUCHU laid off of the pace in the three to four path, fanned five wide into the lane, rallied to drive past the leader at the furlong grounds, drew clear leaving
that station, bobbled mildly entering the final sixteenth and held from an outer pair of late challengers. MO FOX GIVIN settled well back in the three to four
path, shfited six wide entering the lane, rallied and gained place entering the final sixteenth, closed in on the leader along with an outer rival late, but needed
more to reel her in and held place. DANCING N DIXIE was bumped between horses at the start, droppes back and trailed early on, swung from the three
path to the seven entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the top pair in the final sixteenth but miss reaching place. SIMPLY IN FRONT was brushed by an
inner rival at the start and broke towards the rear, settled well back two to three wide, entered the lane in the five path and among foes, then stayed on.
POOLSIDE WITH SLIM (IRE) bumped an outer rival at the start, showed the way along the inside, but was headed by an outer bidder in midstretch and
gave way. AUSTERE saved ground off of the pace, encountered traffic four wide entering the lane, shfited to the six path in upper stretch and stayed on
greenly while lugging inwardly in the final furlong. LIVING MAGIC transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, steadied back from
inside of foes entering the first turn, pursued from midpack along the inside while briefly keen around that bend, moved out nearing the lane but was blocked
and stymied behind rivals entering it, steadied then failed to recover. GRECIAN GODDESS was bumped between horses at the start, saved ground well
back to no avail. KAIRYU (IRE) was brushed by an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased in upper stretch and faded. CROWN IMPERIAL
pursued from the three path, entered the lane in the four path and between horse then faded. POUNCE broke out, stalked in the four path, attempted a bid
nearing the lane and weakened between horses. DOZEN DIAMONDS stalked in the three path and between horses, but caved entering the lane.

Footnotes
ALVA STARR bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked four wide, ranged up in the five path turning for home to bid entering the lane, forged an advantage
hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, changed over and kicked clear at the furlong grounds, then fended off an outer bidder in the closing stages.
VAHVA tracked from midpack in the three path, shfited to the six path turning for home, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, closed in
but was kept at bay. RED CARPET READY vied for the lead along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder leaving the quarter pole, fought on before
yielding entering the final furlong, then lasted for show. STERLING SILVER saved ground off of the pace, but failed to threaten. MARYQUITECONTRARY
trailed in the three path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up between horses. HOT AND SULTRY vied for the lead two wide and
between horses, drifted to the four path while failing to sustain pressure turning for home and faded between horses. BIG POND was bumped and put to
tight quarters between horses at the start, raced off of the pace in the four to seven path, then failed to factor. ICICLES prompted three wide and between
horses, but faded under urging with three furlongs to go.

EAMONN bumped an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, rallied splitting foes two wide in the final furlong, vied for place in the late stages
but got outfinished. OUR SHOT laid off of the pace in the five path, floated out to the seven path in upper stretch, stayed on and missed place between
horses. BAD BEAT BRIAN bobbled a bit leaving the gates, stalked along the inside, chased with aim inside of the leaders in upper stretch but lacked a
punch and yielded. PANTHER ISLAND pursued from midpack in the four path, spun for home in the five path and among rivals, shifted out in the final
sixteenth and moved up. LET MY PEOPLE GO settled well back in the three to four path, fanned to the nine path in upper stretch and moved up late. YES I
AM FREE showed the way in the two path, but was headed by an outer bidder in midstretch and weakened between horses. COPPOLA stalked the leader
from the three path, took aim in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in midstretch and faded between horses. BEER CAN MAN chased from
midpack along the inside, vacated the rail entering the lane, lacked a bid before shifting further out at the sixteenth pole, but bumped and had his hind heels
clipped by a rival while doing so and gave way. SOSUA SUMMER bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and between
horses, lacked a rally among foes before being bumped at the sixteenth pole steadied and got forced out in the incident and was protected thereafter.

Footnotes
SIERRA LEONE was stubbornly reluctant to load, settled well back two wide, quickened picking off rivals shifting from the three to five path turning for
home, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final furlong, shifted inwardly while driving past that one at the
sixteenth pole and drew clear. JUST A TOUCH pressed the leader from the three path, came under coaxing in pursuit around the far turn, ranged up to offer
a bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, led into the final furlong, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole
and was second best. EPIC RIDE stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, ranged up in hopes of bidding entering the lane, but chased the
clearing leader in upper stretch, got outkicked for place in the final furlong and held show. DORNOCH tracked along the inside while keen behind rivals
around the first turn, lacked a repsonse to urging around the far turn, shifted out to the five path entering upper stretch and ran on mildly while lacking a bid.
MUGATU trailed along the inside, advanced inside of horses with a half mile to go, then sustained a chase to reach a minor placing late. TOP CONOR
showed the way just a bit off the inner rail, dug in meeting an outer challenge entering the lane, but was headed in upper stretch and gave way. SEIZE THE
GREY took back from crowded quarters passing the wire for the first time, brushed an outer foe into the first turn, raced off of the pace in the three to five
path around that bend and made little impact. BE YOU bumped an outer rival early on, laid off of the pace along the inside, was roused to the three path
around the far turn before fanning to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. LAT LONG was brushed by an inner foe entering the first turn, got
floated to the five to six path while off of the pace around that bend, took the far turn in the two path and failed to factor. GOOD MONEY was briefly fractious
in the starting gate, pursued from midpack two to four wide and between horses around the first turn,g but was done early and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
RUNNING BEE tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, shifted ground while getting herded outwardly by that one in
the final furlong, yet sustained his charge to drive past approaching the wire. DOMINICAN PIONEER showed the way while pulling in the bit and rank in the
three to two path around the first turn, shook clear of outer chasers entering the lane, shifted out as a pursuing foe took aim at the furlong ground, drifted
again in soon after and was caught the closing stages. MASTER PIECE (CHI) saved ground off of the pace, stayed on to edge show at the sixteenth pole.
INJUNCTION tracked in the five to four path then chased evenly through the lane. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE laid off of the pace three wide, shifted to the five
path nearing the lane and pursued one paced. ACCREDIT stalked in the four to three path around the first turn, then yielded between horses. KITODAN
trailed in the two path and got outrun.
