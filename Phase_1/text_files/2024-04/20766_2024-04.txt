Footnotes
FIRING FAST got bumped at the start by MANGIA, who broke outwards, chased five then four wide down the backstretch advancing inside the half mile
pole to latch on the leader tucked three then two wide at the seven-sixteenths, dueled through the latter portion of the turn with that rival taking narrow
command just outside the quarter pole, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. QUIESCENT broke on top
despite getting away a bit awkward when her legs splayed at the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside
into the turn, came under pressure and dueled with the aforementioned foe from the seven-sixteenths, got displaced from command near the quarter pole
and took the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match through the final furlong and chased the winner home clear of the rest and second best. NAY
SLAYER chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MANGIA broke out at the start bumping FIRING FAST, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then
three wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
QUIET WISDOM was hustled from the gate, moved up to get the lead while drifting out some entering the main-track, shook clear around the
nine-sixteenths pole, was urged along in the two path on the turn, responded well under one light tap of a left-handed crop and strong hand-urging in the
stretch and proved best. LAND D'ORO prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, came under urging near the nine-sixteenths, chased in the three
then four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and just held the place. BRICK AMBUSH settled off the pace, moved in with six
furlongs to run, was well spotted under some restraint, came under urging while two then three wide on the turn, chased the winner on the outside in the
stretch and just missed the place while well clear for the show. BOSS THREE O TWO settled off the pace, dropped back while urged four then five wide on
the turn and failed to respond. BALI AMOUR was hustled to the early lead, lost the advantage entering the main-track then dropped back, moved up under
urging late on the backstretch, chased inside on the turn and tired. MANNY PENNY was restless in the gate, tossed his head at the start and was off slow,
spotted the front a few lengths, moved up on the outside under some urging, dropped back five the six wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
RUN DEVIL three wide in pursuit, advanced on the leader and had her slip away and came under a drive at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into
upper stretch, rallied and shied out under a left handed crop before seizing command inside the eighth pole, then edged away to the finish to prevail. JOLLY
MISS JILL chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid.
SWEET AS SUGAR bobbled at the break, recovered to establish the front shortly after, showed the way in hand along the inside, had the eventual winner
range up to the outside near the seven-sixteenths and got given a notch to work with slipping away through the latter portion of the turn, cut the corner into
upper stretch roused for the stretch drive, dug in and was collared just inside the eighth pole, weakened when growing leg weary through the final sixteenth.
GRINGOTTS chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, tipped four
wide at the head of the stretch, made no impact. JOEY THE FISH devoid of speed when sluggish early on, grew quickly detached at the tail of the field
chasing three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, got ridden along from the seven-sixteenths, went
five to six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PICCOLO DIAVOLO showed early speed then moved up to get the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn,
responded well under threat into upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed crop near the furlong marker and held under strong urging. SHAKIN THE
BELLE chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner while inside of APURO in the stretch and showed good
courage to just get the place. APURO raced just off the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner while outside of the
runner-up in the stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show. CROWN THAT SAINT was urged along off the pace, moved up leaving the
backstretch, gained to make a rail bid near the three-eighths pole, fought inside of the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.
SWEPT raced on the outside under urging, was forced out inside the five-eighths pole, dropped back four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response.
PAPPOU'S LAUGH broke in and bumped with a rival, angled out early then was urged along off the pace, moved to the outside inside the five-eighths pole,
chased five wide on the turn and had nothing left. MITHRIDATES was bumped at the start, pressed the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn and
retreated.

ICY FLAVOR three wide in pursuit from just off the duel, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong out, dug in under a drive drifting out seventy yards from home a path or two safely in front while edging away to the finish. RUSSI
coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside from mid pack, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive rallying, altered inwards seventy yards from the finish as the aforementioned foe drifted out, ran on to secure the place honors. ALLIED
ATTACK coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to
secure the show honors. LI'L LANG dueled inside of SANDRONE from the start, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch, yielded the front nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. BIG PRANKSTER tracked the pace along the inside, got let out taking the
inside route into upper stretch, lacked room along the rail and balked when in behind the former leader a furlong out, went through a tight seam halfway
through the final furlong until the last jumps to the finish when gaining some space down inside but was outfinished in the late going. KREESA chased three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered no response. IMAGE OF QUALITY chased along the inside
and then just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. SLAMMIN GOLD
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch offering up a mild bid, then weakened through to the
finish. SANDRONE coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with LI'L LANG to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just
off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. FINANCIAL DISTRICT chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three
wide into upper stretch, made no impact. PLEASE BE NICE three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, continued three wide into upper
stretch, made no impact. SINFUL DANCER chased five then four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, tipped five to six wide into upper stretch, tired.

FIVE TO TWO stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the two path on the turn, took a short lead in the three path at the quarter-pole,
dueled outside of the runner-up in the stretch and gamely prevailed under strong urging. AUNT YOLA was hustled to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths pole, lost the lead in the two path at the quarter-pole then dueled inside of the
winner, drifted out near the furlong marker, fought on well to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. CALLING AN AUDIBLE was well placed
down the backstretch, came under urging while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the dueling
leaders into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth but missed while clear for the show. PURPOSE bumped lightly with a foe early, tracked the pace
on the outside, brushed with a rival near the half-mile pole then jostled with that opponent leaving the backstretch, dropped back in the three path on the
turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. MARGAUX TREASURE made light contact with an opponent early,
settled off the pace, was urged along between foes late on the backstretch, brushed with a rival near the half-mile pole then jostled with that foe into the
turn, dropped back in the four path on that bend, spun five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. EKWANOK settled at the rear, moved from three to six
wide on the turn, remained on her inside lead until near the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and failed to threaten. SHE'S A NATURAL
broke a step slow, was urged along early then taken in hand outside the three-quarter pole, settled outside under some urging, went five wide on the turn,
dropped to the four path into the stretch and failed to respond.
