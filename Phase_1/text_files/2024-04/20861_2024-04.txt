nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. HEART OF HANISCH set the pace racing slightly off the rail, responded when headed and held on well for

WHERE'D THE DAY GO saved ground stalking the early pace, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole for room, took the lead entering the stretch
and gradually drew clear. MILLARD'S SMILE was unhurried early, rallied five-wide the final quarter and finished strongly. STORM BORN saved ground
while being allowed to settle early and finished in a mild rally. BLURT saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly nearing the quarter pole and
weakened. PISTOL BOX dropped back while saved ground and went evenly. BLOOMING GARDEN prompted the pace from along the outside and tired.
BABA'S BOY was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide but lacked a response when asked.

Footnotes
SECESSION saved ground while being close-up early, slipped through to take the lead entering the stretch and quickly drew off to win with something left.
IRISH COAST prompted SENDEMDOWNTHEROAD while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch to off a bid but was no match for the winner.
RAISERICHIESRANSOM was allowed to settle early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SENDEMDOWNTHEROAD set the early
pace racing slightly removed from the rail and weakened during the drive. GRAND FESTIVAL was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a
rally when asked. SMACKOVER LIME raced in the middle of the field while four-wide and went evenly. LARRY'S LUNCHBOX broke out and steadied
shortly after the start, then dropped back, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. BLACK RUSSIAN saved ground while being unhurried and
failed to seriously threaten. SAN RONIN was allowed to settle early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. CHERRY ORCHARD steadied in
traffic nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and was unable to recover. GUYDON steadied from between horses in traffic nearing the seven-sixteenths pole
and gave way. THE WINNING NUMBERS FOR THE PLACE PICK 8WERE 1/3/4-1/3/7-1/2/6-1/4-2/4-6/8-2/3-5/6.
