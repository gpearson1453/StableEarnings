three path on the far turn, was carried out leaving the turn but dueled through the stretch for second. AGAIN WE MEET was shuffled back leaving the gate
then saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and steadily progressed, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out leaving the
turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. TREJO settled in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and rounded the far turn about the four path, ran evenly to late stretch then flattened nearing the wire. DIVINAS CONNECTION saved ground on the first
turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. MY SLICK NICK raced off the rail

Footnotes
DIVA ROSE stalked the early pace inside, eased out with a bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path on the far turn, dug in for the
lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. BUCKFAST ABBEY was crowded leaving the gate then took over at the three quarter pole, moved to the
inside and rated the pace, came under pressure and dueled nearing the three eighths pole, steadied at the rail past the quarter, angled out leaving the far
turn and came again to take second the final yards. GLOBAL EMPRESS came in at the break and stalked from the three path, challenged approaching the
three eighths pole, dueled at even terms and took the nod two deep past the quarter, dug in leaving the far turn but flattened stride the final sixteenth. VAN
HOOK came away awkwardly and was crowded early, raced in the four path on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail and finished evenly. APPEALING ROAD settled in the three path the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but
flattened in the three path on the far turn. MADY ROSE came outward at the break then saved ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in
the three path on the far turn and weakened. BRIGHT MOON raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened in the five
path on the far turn. HANNAHS RED RUBY rounded the first turn about the five path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded in the

Footnotes
CUT FROM CLASS took a quick lead and rated the pace, came under moderate pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the
far turn and finished of her own initiative. SOMEBODY LOVES ME was pinched back at the break then saved ground racing well back, bid past the seven
sixteenths pole and steadily improved, raced at the rail into the far turn, angled to the five path approaching the eighth pole and came along to take second
later yards. QUEEN JELLY BEAN stalked off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little
more. BAHITI veered sharply outward leaving the gate then saved ground close to the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on
the far turn and weakened. OREO ANGEL dwelled at the start then raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. LADY BOO raced wide early and showed little response.

HESSICA stalked inside on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and moved alongside BARBERS POINT in the three path approaching the
head of the lane, took over from that one mid-stretch and edged clear late yards. The latter rated a slim lead inside, was met and dueled at even terms
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was met mid-stretch and relented late yards. LUCKY BLONDE
settled just off the early pace about the three path, raced outside leaving the first turn and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn about the four path and finished well to clear third late. NO DENYING DENIS saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out entering the stretch but flattened stride. JUBASLILBALLERINA stalked the early pace two
deep, dueled at even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn, then weakened in the lane. JUBA
BABY settled back about the three path on the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

GOLDEN G pressured the pace and contested even terms at the rail on the turn, took the nod past the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to keep
DUNCAN IDAHO at bay through the lane. The latter broke inward and made contact with Where Is Mike then took over approaching the seven sixteenths
pole and set a pressured pace, contested even terms two deep on the turn, was met passing the eighth pole and reluctantly ceded in the duel through the
stretch. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET pressured the early pace inside but steadied from tight quarters at the rail approaching the quarter pole, recovered stride on
the turn then dueled through the stretch for third. TORONTOTORO came away sharply then pressured the pace, raced close in the four path on the turn but
was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. HEY BOOTS gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little more. WHERE IS MIKE was

Footnotes
THETA veered out then ran clear while tapering in and rated the pace, came through the turn near the rail and was steadily handled to hold on well.
BLUSHING BIP BOP came away awkwardly and was bumped at the break, gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and had to
settle for second best. LIZZY LOU gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little more. OUR BREW broke inward and made contact with
Blushing Bip Bop then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted leaving the turn and showed little in the lane. SWISS HORIZON gave chase
and rounded the turn off the rail. ONE LAST DRINK was forced in at the break then angled out to give chase and rounded the turn about the six path.
JUNIPER GRACE gave chase and drifted on the turn.
