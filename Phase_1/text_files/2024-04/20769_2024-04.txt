Footnotes
GRUBAUER prominent in the early stages, settled just off of the moderate pace and saved ground into the turn, was well placed approaching the quarter
pole, was asked for run two wide into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, overtook PARTY WITH PADDY past mid-stretch and drew away under
hand-urging in the late stages as much the best. PARTY WITH PADDY broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, drew to a clear lead
nearing the half-mile marker and set moderate fractions into the turn, well handled while carving the pace approaching the quarter pole, was confronted into
upper stretch and met the bid of GRUBAUER heading to the furlong pole, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best.
DUNGARVAN OAK rated off of the decent early pace while not far back, saved ground into the turn, angled four wide for the drive and ran evenly to
mid-stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and was up in time to secure show honors. UNBRIDLED RHYTHM close up to the decent early pace, was
bothered a bit by the loose horse nearing the half-mile marker, chased two to three wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, was outkicked
into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third. CATCH A BREEZE was bothered a bit by the loose horse in the early stages
but was allowed to settle in the opening furlong, trailed into the turn, lost contact with the rest nearing the quarter pole and did not factor in the stretch.
NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK stumbled at the start and lost the rider, was caught following the race and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK STUMBLING AT THE START. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK CAUSED
HIS OWN ISSUES AT THE START AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ROSE OF JERICHO away in good order, rated nicely off of the moderate early pace and tracked from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, saved
ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole, tipped two wide into the stretch and chased UNION COACH approaching the furlong pole, responded
to urging past mid-stretch and drew to even terms with UNION COACH into the final sixteenth, wore down the stubborn runner-up and edged away in deep
stretch to prevail. UNION COACH sent to establish the early lead, set a moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn and
was well handled approaching the quarter pole, extended the lead into the stretch, met the bid of ROSE OF JERICHO into the final sixteenth, grudgingly
gave way in deep stretch and held clearly at the finish for second. HOT AND SPICY broke in at the start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the
early running and saved ground into the turn, angled out in upper stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and was
well clear in the end for third. EYELIGHT stalked the moderate early pace three deep, advanced into the turn and chased the pace three wide approaching
the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. SANGER STYLE asked to rate in the early stages while never far back,
raced two to three wide along the turn, was outrun into the stretch and did not offer a late response. MIRAGE CODE attended to the early pace while on a
snug hold, pressed two wide into the turn and lost position at the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SWEET LAKER was allowed to settle into stride from the break then tracked inside, advanced into contention on the turn then tipped out three wide in the
clear at the head of the lane, chased PURPLE MOUNTAIN down the length of the stretch, ran on well under steady handling and intermittent urging, got a
head in front in the final sixteenth and prevailed. PURPLE MOUNTAIN raced on the outside of the tracking group down the backstretch, three or four wide,
launched an early challenge from the three furlong pole, had a short lead in upper stretch, dueled with SWEET LAKER to the wire but came up short.
BULLETPROOF TOO tracked close up between horses in the early going, went three to four wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker,
could not keep pace with the top pair into deep stretch and held safely in the end for third. STREET TIGER took the early lead when no one else seemed to
want it, was nursed along through moderate fractions, was challenged by PURPLE MOUNTAIN near the quarter pole and was overtaken into upper stretch,
chased to the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. ROSE OF MOONCOIN was not asked for speed from the break and raced last of the very
compact field, made a three wide move on the turn from the five-sixteenths pole, swung five wide into the stretch then flattened out and was unable to
improve.

WE CAN showed good speed after breaking alertly and vied for the early lead with HELEN'S SUN, contested decent fractions with that rival through the
backstretch run, dueled into the far turn and took a narrow lead nearing the top of the stretch, shook free into the lane and led to the furlong marker, drew to
a clear lead into the final sixteenth, felt mild late pressure from oncoming rivals and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. MASTERY KAT settled while
never far back in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn,
encountered traffic and was boxed in approaching the quarter pole, found room into upper stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, rallied into
the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held safely for second. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) settled off of the early pace and went
two wide into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile pole, continued his gain while four wide into the far
turn, advanced into the stretch and raced within aim of the lead at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the top pair in
deep stretch and held well in the final strides for third. ACERO settled off of the early pace while not far back, tracked two wide into the first turn, was well
placed through the backstretch run then mounted a three wide bid into second turn, raced within aim of the lead into upper stretch, was outkicked into the
final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE was allowed to settle early on and saved ground into the first turn, gained
ground approaching the half-mile marker, raced two to three wide into the second turn and continued his run heading to the quarter pole, encountered a bit
of traffic at mid-stretch and offered a mild late rally in deep stretch. HOT JOURNEY unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run,
was content to trail nearing the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive, offered a mild late rally but needed
more in the final stages. FAYRUZ TRIBUTE fractious prior to the start, was squeezed leaving the break and was away a bit slowly, settled into the first turn
and saved ground into the backstretch run, was guided two to three wide along the second turn and did not factor in the stretch. HELEN'S SUN away in
good order, vied for the early lead with WE CAN and contested the pace with that runner into the backstretch, disputed the decent pace to the half-mile
marker, dueled with WE CAN into the second turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MS FLASHY HARBOR tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, was guided two to three wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole,
roused three wide into the stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, responded to firm urging and took command into the final sixteenth, dug in
while under pressure in deep stretch and lasted at the finish for a determined win. LITTLE LILIANA rated off of the decent early pace, raced outside of rivals
heading to the half-mile marker, gained ground four to five wide at the quarter pole, widest into the stretch and continued her advance at the furlong marker,
rallied into the final sixteenth, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. BLURSDAY
prominent away from the start, engaged with LA PRIMER ESTRELLA in the early stages and pressed that runner through decent fractions heading to the
half-mile marker, prompted the pace two wide into the turn and was repelled into upper stretch, chased LA PRIMER ESTRELLA to the furlong marker,
stayed on into the final sixteenth but was outkicked in deep stretch and just held for third at the finish. CRY ME A RUNNER bobbled leaving the start but
was away in good order, ceded the early lead and tracked the decent early pace from between rivals, chased three to four wide into the turn and gained
ground at the quarter marker, ran in pursuit four wide into the stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and just missed for third. LA PRIMER ESTRELLA
hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set a decent pace while pressured to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the turn and carved
out moderate fractions nearing the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was overtaken into the final
sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. ROSES R BLUE allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into the turn and trailed to the quarter pole,
rallied into the stretch and came within range of the lead at the furlong marker, was blocked behind rivals past mid-stretch, continued to race in traffic into
the final sixteenth and could not recover.

ORIGINAL reserved early, dropped down to the rail when clear on the first turn, settled mid-pack in a strung out field, bided time for a half-mile, advanced
into contention with an inside run through the far turn, angled out to the three path for clear run at the top of the stretch, finished well under steady handling
and intermittent urging, proved best. IMPLICITLY settled mid-pack, went into a drive with three furlongs to run, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied
strongly under steady handling and was up for the place. AMERICA GREAT broke well and was up on the pace through the first turn, dropped back into a
stalking position, ceding the lead to QUE SERA SIR RALPH, started a gradual forward move through the turn from the three furlong marker still chasing that
rival, pulled even in the stretch, was kept to task but could not hold off the top pair in the final yards. ITS THIEVERY was forwardly placed in the early going,
tracked three wide through the first turn then settled three wide in the clear down the backstretch under some restraint, was let loose near the three-eighths
pole, angled out to the three or four path for the stretch run and finished willingly under steady handling but was outkicked to the wire. J T'S WATCH got
pinballed a bit at the start then settled near the back of the spread out field, then responded when asked to pick up the pace with a half-mile to run, came
into the stretch with some momentum, but could not find another gear when needed and finished evenly. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) lagged behind the field
from the start, and was unhurried for the first half-mile, then began a sustained run two wide through the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, made a
mild late run but was never a serious threat. QUE SERA SIR RALPH came away well and was able to secure the lead and dictate the pace, led the field
through moderate fractions rating kindly on the front end, had something left when set down for the stretch run but began to weaken approaching the eighth
pole and was outfinished. QUALITY CAT was unhurried near the rear of the field through the early stages, dropped back to last on the turn, maintained an
inside path into the stretch, was gaining in the final sixteenth but could not threaten the leaders at the finish.

GREATFUL ATTITUDE took back off of the decent early pace, was guided three wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole, loomed three wide into
the stretch, took command approaching the furlong pole and kicked clear into the final sixteenth, was kept to moderate urging into deep stretch and drew
away in the late stages as much the best. SUPER ELLIE allowed to settle in the early running, raced a bit in tight while between runners and checked inside
of the five furlong marker, trailed into the turn and was guided three to four wide approaching the quarter pole, responded to urging into the stretch and
advanced at the furlong marker, was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth and was clear of the rest for place honors. IRISH PRANCER hustled
leaving the start, was prominent in the early running and pressed the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, kept close attendance to the modest
pace while two wide into the turn, raced a bit erratically into upper stretch and chased GREATFUL ATTITUDE nearing the furlong marker, gave way into the
final sixteenth and held for third at the finish. DESERT RUMBLE forwardly placed away from the start, raced close up to the decent early pace and went four
to five wide into the turn, gained ground along the bend and came within aim of the lead nearing the quarter pole, chased five wide into the stretch, lost
ground at the furlong marker and weakened in the final sixteenth. RIVER OF AMBITION tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, chased two
wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole, could not sustain that bid into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. OUTER SUNSET settled off of
the decent early pace while not far back, saved ground into the turn, was outrun into the stretch and did not offer a late response. BRONZE GIRL broke
alertly and was hard sent for the early lead, showed good speed and set the pace to the half-mile marker, was pressured into the turn and set modest
fractions heading to the quarter pole, lost the lead into upper stretch and chased GREATFUL ATTITUDE to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the
final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch.

wide nearing the quarter pole, shifted four wide into the stretch and was asked for run approaching the furlong marker, made a quick move past mid-stretch
and took command into the final sixteenth, kicked clear in deep stretch and was hand urged to the finish for a convincing win. HIGHLAND GHOST showed
good early speed and vied for the lead leaving the start, contested fast fractions with EVENEREVENWORSE heading to the half-mile marker, dueled with
that rival into the turn and carved out a quick pace approaching the quarter pole, battled with EVENEREVENWORSE into the stretch, was overtaken by
TOWN PERFORMER entering the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner into deep stretch and held well in the end for place honors.
SHARONA'S WILD BOY chased the solid early pace from between rivals, went two to three wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, angled
four to five wide into the stretch and re-rallied into the final sixteenth, finished well in deep stretch and got up for third in the final strides. DEBS TIZ hustled
away from the start, chased the solid early pace from the second flight, got put a bit in tight approaching the turn and checked at the three furlong pole, ran
in pursuit while saving ground nearing the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, could not muster a late
rally and just missed for third at the finish. EVENEREVENWORSE showed good early speed and was prominent leaving the start, engaged with HIGHLAND
GHOST and disputed fast fractions with that rival heading to the half-mile marker, dueled into the turn and contested the quick pace nearing the quarter
pole, battled into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch. GRAZEN SUN allowed to settle in the early running,

Footnotes
SOO BROOKLYN broke outward and made light contact with TIGERIZE, tucked in behind the pace, saved ground through the turn, responded when set
down near the quarter pole, split horses in mid stretch and finished well to prevail despite lugging out in the final furlong. LILLY'S JOURNEY was a little hard
to place on the run down the backstretch, switched to the outside at the half-mile pole then made an nice three wide forward move through the turn, ran on
well through the stretch under strong handling and got the nod for second in the last jump. A PERFECT PATH broke well and vied for the early lead with
TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS, pressed the pace to the outside of that foe and dueled to the stretch, was gaining the advantage at the furlong pole but was
passed to the inside by SOO BROOKLYN, soldiered on gamely only to lose the place in the last jump. HARBOR DEAREST came away well but took up
slightly about a furlong out when put in tight, dropped to the rail when clear and settled near the back of the pack, saved ground through the turn then swung
six wide into the stretch and finished with some interest to improve position. TIGERIZE took a light bump at the start from SOO BROOKLYN, was close up
for the initial quarter mile then dropped to last on the turn, came under heavy pressure from the three eighths pole, kept to task and finished well enough to
pick off a few stragglers before the wire. GENTLE JULIA broke sharply but did not engage the early pace battle, struggled to keep up on the turn and had
little to offer in the stretch. SILENT BEAUTY broke well and was up with the dueling leaders in the initial stages, dropped off the pace near the
nine-sixteenths pole, did not respond when asked to go on, came into the stretch racing on the wrong lead and lacked a finish. TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS set
a pressured pace with A PERFECT PATH pressing the issue to the outside, held that foe at bay into the stretch the weakened approaching the furlong
marker, tired and was passed by the field in the last sixteenth.
