Footnotes
EVERYONELOVESLINDA came away in good order then moved in while hustled, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn,
was asked at the five-sixteenths pole, inched clear under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop inside the
sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. PROUD FOOT moved up after the start to contest the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while under
extra left-rein pressure on the turn, was given her cue outside the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back a bit under a drive in upper stretch, kept on well in the
final furlong, gained on the winner late but missed while clear for the place. I'M BUZZY settled on the outside then was given cover behind horses, brushed
with an opponent late on the backstretch, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn while roused, was driven four wide into the stretch,
remained on her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed kick while able to secure the show. SWEETEST PRINCESS settled at the rear, brushed with
rivals on both sides late on the backstretch then dropped back into the turn, moved from the two path to the four while roused on that bend, came six wide
into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ICY REPLY stumbled at the start but broke with the rest of the field, was well placed just off the pace,
saved ground while asked on the turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
FIRST CLASS CAT chased four then three wide patiently handled until set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong
out, edged away to the finish to prevail. LADY BANKER four then three wide in aim of the top pair down the backstretch, prompted the leader from the two
path through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors on the wire. KAREN'S HONOR broke out a step at the
start awkwardly and was corrected, then was devoid of speed conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside at the
tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, raced on her wrong lead early in the stretch before
switching leads near the sixteenth pole, then kicked on belatedly to the finish to just miss for the place honors. FRANNIE LEW stumbled at the start and
recovered quickly to only concede about a length to the front, established the lead and showed the way in hand three then two wide knocking heads early
with LEADERSHIP ABILITY before shaking that rival off half a mile from home, tucked directly in front of that foe forcing that one to be lightly steadied off
her heels at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front near the eighth pole
and weakened in the late stages. MOONLIT WEEKEND chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and stayed on one paced to the end. LEADERSHIP ABILITY coaxed from the gate, showed brief speed from the two path and then inside before
being shaken off near the half mile pole, got lightly taken in hand as FRANNIE LEW crossed in front with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ROCKET AND ROLL moved in while going to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far
turn, responded well when roused outside the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. DIGITAL saved
ground while well placed just off the pace, was roused near the quarter-pole, came three wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner to the finish and
earned the place. LIFE AND LIGHT was rated under a tight hold in the two path on the first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch, was roused in the
two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved for the show. CO CONSPIRATOR dropped from the four path to the three
path early on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn, came under the crop before the five-sixteenths pole,
spun four wide into the stretch and tired. CANDY TYCOON broke out then was hustled before being taken in hand, went three then four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. HIGHER QUALITY
dropped back early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, came six wide into upper
stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LAVON bobbled at the break, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took over narrow
command swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. ECHO IN ETERNITY established the front and showed the
way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under pressure from the aforementioned foe to
the outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from the front, proved no match for the top one, kept on to secure the place honors.
SCORING CHANCE chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, kicked on belatedly to procure the show honors. SMOKIE EYES stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground and conceding three lengths to the
front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the late stages. SHIGEKO chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. REIGNING CHICK chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch and tired.

LAKE ABANAKEE broke in at the start bumping GEORGE'S VICE, showed the way in hand four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking
inside into the turn, came under pressure from EASY PLAY to the outside, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and gamely fended
off the challenge to prevail at the end. EASY PLAY five wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path into the turn and advanced to press the
pace midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the end. GEORGE'S
VICE got bumped at the start by LAKE ABANAKEE, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung
three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. WEEKEND RAGS chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BIG HAZEL stumbled at the start, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. PHOTO FINISH chased six paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. CITY BLOCKS chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch,
offered no response. HIGHWAY HARMONY chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along
from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
KANT CALL IT darted in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when
asked for her best in upper stretch and held under strong urging. AUTUMN was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path then moved out, rallied in the final furlong and finished well to just miss while up for the place. CERRETTA broke out
and was off a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy
to get the show. CAPITAL SPENDING was taken in hand early then well placed just off the pace, jostled with a foe at the nine-sixteenths, raced inside on
the turn, chased the leaders under a drive into the final sixteenth, steadied in traffic late and missed the trifecta while just able to get fourth position.
TURRIGA was reluctant to load, jostled with a foe near the nine-sixteenths then steadied, went around the turn in the two path, hesitated off heels coming to
the quarter-pole, shifted four wide into the stretch and gained late but just missed the superfecta. HEAVENLY GIRL chased the pace, rounded the turn in
the two path, raced between horses under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. TONGUE TWISTER was coaxed along on the outside, chased in the
three path on the turn, raced between foes under a drive in upper stretch and tired. FIT AS A FIDDLE settled towards the rear, was roused four wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SPIRANAC was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, dropped well behind the rest of the field,
saved ground on the turn and was no factor. ROOKIE LEAGUE raced near the back, went two then three wide early on the turn, leapt in the air near the
five-sixteenths then was taken up, floated out near the outside fence into the stretch and was pulled up then vanned off.
