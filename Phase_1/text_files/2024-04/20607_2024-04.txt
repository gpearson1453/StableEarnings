Footnotes
SLENDER SLIPPER chased in the two path, was driven around the turn, stayed on under right handed encouragement along the inside down the lane, and
got up in the final strides. WEST BANK got bumped by an inner foe at the start, stalked in the three path, was ridden into the turn, floated out to the six path
in upper stretch, and kept on to be up for place late. BROWN EYED BEAUTY got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, showed the way in
the four path before tipping to the two path going into the turn, was roused midway around the turn, opened up from the three path in upper stretch, but
evened out in the final furlong, and was caught on both sides to show. DID I DAZZLE YOU had an awkward slow start and trailed inside early, floated out to
the four path early around the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kicked on but was out of time. FLUFFY prompted the pace in the
six path, was driven in the three path around the turn, but weakened in the stretch. EXOTIC DANCER broke out and bumped an outer foe, rated in the five
path but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT MELODY raced in range two wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up late. BREEZING ALONG saved ground off
the early pace, advanced four wide around the far turn, steadily gained through the lane but was outkicked. BRITISH EMPRESS steadied entering the first
turn, raced off the pace three wide, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled to the rail in midstretch and rallied inside. SUDOKU TERRY steadied
nearing the first turn, was bumped between foes early on the turn, stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the
sixteenth pole, was bumped soon after and was outfinished from there. FACTOR THAT set the pace in the two path, was collared near the sixteenth pole,
bumped with SODOKU TERRY leaving that marker and faded. MY HAPPY HOLIDAY became rank nearing the first turn, came out and bumped SODUKU
TERRY into STAR PERFORMANCE early on that bend, chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. TAKE YOUR POINT broke slowly, saved
ground and never threatened. STAR PERFORMANCE was bumped early on the first turn, chased the pace four wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

MACLIN stalked in the five path, bid in the three path midway around the turn, took the lead while being roused passing the quarter, and kicked away in the
five path down the lane. AWESOME FOR SURE rated in the six path, was cued in the four path early around the turn, angled out to the seven path at the
top of the stretch, hung on his left lead, and chased on for place. ONE FAST DREAM pressed in the four path, took command while shifting inside going into
the turn, but lost the lead passing the quarter, and evened out in the four path down the lane for show. ANTILLEAN trailed inside and never threatened.
DON'T ANSWER had a slow start, chased in the four path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, but weakened from the seven path in the stretch.
BALTIC MULE set the pace in the two path but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
CURLIN'S KITTEN was off slowly, trailed inside early, angled four wide leaving the five-sixteenths marker, closed outside and edged ahead late. ZOZAN
settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole and led to the sixteenth marker.
LAST RUN raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and was along for the show. PHOBIA prompted the pace two wide, drew well clear
under a hold down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around most of the far turn and weakened in the drive. CHEYENNE BRAVE set the pace
along the rail for three furlongs, was content to settle back down the backstretch, re-bid two wide nearing the quarter pole but had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
HARTSBEATLIKTHUNDR showed the way from the two path turning into the backstretch, was cued along the inside early into the far turn, tipped out to the
two path at the top of the lane, and drew clear passing the eighth pole. CANDY STREET was held up in range from the two path, steadied while angling out
to the four path early around the turn, swung from the six path into the stretch and ran on for place. BOLD ADVANCE stalked inside, was roused from the
rail into the far turn, and kept on along the inside in the stretch for show. SHAKE YOUR BONES chased in the four path but finished evenly from the five
path down the lane. BANDERO trailed inside, had to steady midway down the backstretch, was driven in the three path around the far turn, and made no
impact from the seven path in the stretch. I AM THE GAME tracked in the five path, bid under a ride in the three path rounding the far turn, but flattened on
his left lead in the four path in the stretch. MACUTO raced off the pace in the four path but never threatened. NOBLE WAVE rated in the three path, but
steadied early down the backstretch, and never menaced along the inside in the stretch. HARI prompted the pace in the three path but weakened entering
the stretch.

UBIQUITOUS tracked in the four path, was ridden into the turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, and drew past an inner pair around the
sixteenth. THENORTHREMEMBERS chased in the four path, was coaxed along in the five path around the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the
stretch, and ran on for place. NEOPHYTE set the pace in the two path, was roused midway around the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch, but dug in for
show. TIZ A TALE bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path, bid midway around the turn, took the lead while in the three path just
before the eighth pole, but hung and evened out in the final furlong. JUPITER BLUES raced off the pace in the two path and made no impact from the five
path down the lane. RESIST THE DEVIL trailed inside and never threatened from the seven path in the stretch. TIZ A PRINCE bumped with an outer foe at
the start, raced wellback in the three path and never menaced.

Footnotes
DE REGRESO pressed the pace two wide, took the lead between foes midway around the far turn, kicked clear in midstretch, dug in between foes late and
just lasted. WATCHTOWER settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch, closed
outside, reached even terms late, battled to the wire and earned a share of the win. MADAME MISCHIEF saved ground in range, tipped two wide near the
quarter pole, angled back to the rail in upper stretch and rallied inside. LADY MADONNA raced off the early pace three wide, advanced four wide around the
far turn but flattened out in the lane. GILD THE LILY broke slowly, raced well back three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and improved position. TOP
BLUE saved ground and failed to menace. NORMANJITO (FR) stumbled after the start, chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. HOCKEY set the
pace along the rail, was collared midway around the turn, checked nearing the eighth pole and retreated. ROSCOE VILLAGE stumbled at the start,
prompted the pace three wide, bid three wide near the five-sixteenths marker but retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
HECHICERO showed the way in the two path, was roused when challenged early around the far turn, dug in from the four path into the stretch, and gamely
held off an outer foe. BUILDER JAK laid up close in the three path down the backstretch, bid early into the far turn, was roused in the five path turning into
the stretch, ran on while dueling with the inner pacesetter into the final furlong, but hung for place. CRYPTONYM stalked in the four path, was ridden into
the far turn, and was one paced around the five path down the lane for show. MACASSAR raced off the pace inside, was driven into the far turn, but
flattened in the stretch. BAILAMOS tracked in the two path but never threatened. PASSAGE rated in the three path but was no menace. ZAINO had a slow
start, trailed in the five path and could never get involved.
