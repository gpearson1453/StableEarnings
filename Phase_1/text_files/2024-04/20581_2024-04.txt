NOSEY POWER reserved off the dueling pacesetters through the turn, made a steady advance leaving the quarter pole while angled five wide and
prevailed in a drive through the lane. LITTLE RONS ROCKET dueled from the inside in a three way pace battle, responded when called upon turning for
home, kept on gamely in the stretch but failed to hold off the closing winner. I STRONG pressed the pace from between rivals to the top of the lane, gave
ground in upper stretch, came again midway down the lane but could not regain on the top pair. STARS N SPACE battled three wide in the pace duel, took
a brief lead into upper stretch and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SMALL SAILOR stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied three wide to engage the leaders in upper stretch, wore the pacesetters down through the lane and
edged clear late. DOMI raced wide into the first turn, rallied early straightening out down the backside to press the pace from four wide, continued to duel on
the lead to midway down the lane and kept-on gamely to hold the place. NAUGHTY STREAK set a pressured pace from the inside throughout, dueled on
the lead to deep stretch and was outkicked late in the lane in a good effort. RAMBLIN CHROME prominently palced to be on the pace through the first turn,
dropped back losing position down the backside and rallied belatedly in the lane to be gaining late. AMAZING JUSTICE went evenly never posing a threat.
THE GOSPEL OF MARK raced five wide on the first turn, rushed up between horses on the backside to press the pace briefly and came up empty.
INSACIABLE PRINCE was outrun.

Footnotes
SCARLETT'S AWISH set the pace under early pressure, cleared the field turning for home and finished willingly while unchallenged in the lane as a
convincing winner. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE rated in mid-pack in striking distance theough the turn and angled six wide under a steady advance to be second
best. WILLIAMSBEACHBABE reserved off the leaders to the top of the lane, circled six wide and finihsed well to be gaining late. HERE COMES JIGS saved
ground through the turn and cut the corner to make a mild rally up the fence in the stretch. SARAH JANE tracked the leader while well palced and failed to
mount a closing rally. CHECK OUT LINE leapt at the start causing the rider to lose the irons, raced up on the outside while the rider regained the stirrups
and mounted a late rally having lost all chance at the start. ARTIES CRYPTONITE unhurried in the early going to be near the back of the field and showed
some late interest in the stretch. I GOT HOPE slow early to trail the pack and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SWEET EMPIRE chased the pace from the
inside to be prominent and gave way late in the drive. BAY MAGIC stalked the pace to the top of the stretch and flattened out. CONGRATS JENSEN raced
in contention through the turn and faded.

Footnotes
FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP set a well rated pace on a clear controlling lead, responded when threatened turning for home and kicked away down the lane.
CONFESSOR reserved off the pace while tracking the leaders, saved ground through the final bend while closing ground and continued on to be along for
the place. COME SEE ABOUT IT prompted the pace into the turn, tipped out three wide to loom at the top of the lane and finished evenly. ONE TEN
unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, chased along the rail while put to an early drive and made a mild non-threatening bid in the stretch. R
CARDINAL PRINCE was not a factor. RAVEN MOON tracked the leaders from three wide and flattened out.

THAT'S THE WAY reserved off the pace to midway on the turn, commenced a steady rally on the bend to engage the leaders in mid-stretch and was going
away at the wire in a drive. REINVESTEDINTEREST prompted the early pace, took a short lead on the turn from two wide, battled through the lane and was
outkicked late in the drive. MUTINY stalked the pacesetters from three wide through the turn to loom at the quarter pole and was outkicked down the lane.
PECKS NOT BAD dueled on the pace from the inside to the head of the stretch and weakened coming home. BISCUITS AND GRITS went evenly failing to
threaten. MISTER MOBIL slow early to be the trailer and failed to mount a bid. SHOW SLIDING HOME chased the pace from four wide and faded on the
turn. DUE TO A TOTE SYSTEM MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS DECLARED A NON-WAGERING EVENT.

RYLAN JAYNE stalked the pace to the top of the lane and rallied up the fence in a determined drive to prevail nearing the wire. DAISY JONES set the pace
on a well measured clear lead, responded when engaged midway down the lane and failed to hold off the winner. XHILARATINGPURPOSE reserved off the
pace through the turn and mounted a belated rally to be along for the show. ELKO trailed to the head of the stretch and showed some late interest.
FAITHFUL STEPS prompted the pace to the quarter pole and weakened coming home. QADIRA tracked the leaders through the turn and lacked a closing
rally. NOT OVER YET failed to menace.
