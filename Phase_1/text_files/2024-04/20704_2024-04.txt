AWESOME BID was close up early on the inside, made a bid on the turn and drew clear to prove best under a drive. RAPPERS THIEF was settled early on
the inside, eased out on the turn, made a five wide bid off the turn but could not get to the winner, second best. HOT CHARLIE chased the pace three wide,
moved out to avoid horse in distress on the turn, came six wide off the turn and bested the rest. BUMBLEBEE was reserved early, three wide on the turn
and had no rally. GUSHER set a pressured pace on the outside and then weakened on the turn while three wide. DIABOLICAL RULER pressed the pace
from between rivals, th en went bad entering th e turn and was vanned off.
