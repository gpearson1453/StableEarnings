Footnotes
HOT CAKE broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, sped to a clear early lead and set the pace to the half-mile marker, controlled the
pace into the turn and set decent fractions heading to the quarter pole, drew off into the stretch, kept to task into the final sixteenth, was ridden out to the
wire and was much the best. GALLOPING MAJOR forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and
maintained an inside path into upper stretch, closed well into the final sixteenth, was no match for the winner in deep stretch and was second best. THE
FUSS was a step slow away from the start, rushed up in the early going and stalked the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased HOT CAKE
from a two wide path along the turn, could not keep pace with that rival into the stretch, drifted while weakening inside of the furlong marker and held for
third at the finish. WHAT A RELIEF prominent away from the start, chased the decent early pace approaching the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit two to
three wide into the turn and lost position nearing the quarter pole, ran evenly into the lane and did not offer a late response. UPDRAFT settled off of the
decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and was outrun into the stretch, showed good late interest but could not threaten the leaders in deep stretch.
DOMINITE DOMINIC was squeezed at the start and away a bit slowly, settled off of the decent early pace, went two to three wide along the turn and did not
factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
SKY MAKER allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the first turn and was never far back through the backstretch run, saved all of the
ground into the far turn and maintained an inside path into the lane, advanced at the furlong pole, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth,
sustained her rally into deep stretch, surged in the final strides and was up in time for a determined win. SAREEHA (IRE) assumed command leaving the
start, showed the way into the first turn and set modest fractions into the backstretch run, was well handled into the far turn and was confronted by REV
REE nearing the quarter pole, battled with that rival into the stretch, shook free then was confronted by SKY MAKER into the final sixteenth, met that rival's
bid in deep stretch but could not hold that one off in the final strides and was tagged for the win, while clear of the rest for second. REV REE was a bit rank
in the early stages, tracked the pace two wide into the first turn, settled into the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile marker, chased two
wide into the second turn and continued to advance at the quarter pole, shifted three wide into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, was
outkicked into the final sixteenth and held safely at the finish for third. GEA was squeezed leaving the start and broke a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early
stages and raced two wide into the first turn, settled while not far back through the backstretch run, improved position two wide into the far turn and chased
between rivals nearing the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch and could not muster a late response. TURIAF forwardly placed leaving the start, took
back and tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace approaching the
half-mile marker, chased three wide into the second turn, raced widest into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, shifted to the left lead into the
final sixteenth and did not offer a late rally. THE GREAT HAYNES prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, attended
to the modest pace through the backstretch run, chased three wide into the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lost ground at the eighth pole, could
not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened.

Footnotes
BOURBON GLAZE tracked behind the pace down the backstretch loomed inside through the turn but had to wait for room to the stretch, found a seam in
upper stretch, surged through and gradually wore down MAJESTIC GIG under steady handling. MAJESTIC GIG was hustled away from the gate and seized
the early lead with the rider attempting to temper the pace, responded to some early pressure from HOLLYWOOD RUMOR by quickening away at the
half-mile pole, held the field at bay through the turn then finished strong under steady handling but was overtaken in the shadow of the wire by the winner.
HOLLYWOOD RUMOR broke well, put some early pressure on MAJESTIC GIG then was content to stalk through the turn, went into a drive from the
five-sixteenths and made a run at that rival but was rebuffed, continued to chase down the stretch with good courage and just barely hung on for third.
POINT AND SHOOT was a bit slow into stride and raced on the inside at the back of the field though not far from the leaders, went into an early drive from
the nine-sixteenths pole, angled out to the three path for the stretch run was slowly gaining while still in a drive but came up short for a minor award. ROSES
R BLUE was reluctant to load, broke a step slowly, then raced at the rear of the compact field, started a bid from about the nine-sixteenths pole and went
four wide through the turn then six wide into the stretch finished with some interest but came up short in the blanket finish for third. TIZ A TIGER broke a
step slow but rushed up and was placed forwardly but four wide, continued wide through the turn and launched a bid from the three furlong pole that
seemed to stall out in the stretch and was outfinished.

Footnotes
CARDIFF CRACK prominent in the early running, stalked the pace from a two to three wide position along the first turn, attended to the modest pace
through the backstretch run, pressed OH GREAT into the far turn and battled that rival into upper stretch, took a narrow lead at the furlong marker and dug
in into the final sixteenth, met the bid of UPSTART YANKEE in deep stretch and lasted for a determined win at the finish. UPSTART YANKEE forwardly
placed in the early running, was guided two to three wide along the first turn, stalked the modest pace through the backstretch run, advanced into the
second turn and chased two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, continued his bid into the stretch and shifted four to five wide at the furlong marker,
rallied into the final sixteenth, pressured CARDIFF CRACK in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and just missed for the win, while
clear of the rest for place honors. BIG SPIN a bit slow into stride away from the start, was allowed to settle in the early stages and raced two wide into the
first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, trailed into the second turn and saved ground nearing the quarter marker, roused into the stretch, split rivals
and advanced at the furlong pole, jumped a shadow into the final sixteenth, continued to gain into deep stretch but could not impact the top pair in the final
stages and just held for third at the finish. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN allowed to settle in the early going, raced three wide along the first turn, advanced into
the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the second turn, swung five wide for the
drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed willingly while widest into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. OH GREAT (IRE) hustled to
establish the early lead, assumed command and showed the way into the first turn, set modest fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure
into the far turn and was hounded by CARDIFF CRACK nearing the quarter pole, battled that rival into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final
sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF allowed to settle while never far back, saved ground into the first turn, tracked the modest
pace from an inside path through the backstretch run, advanced into the far turn, saved all of the ground into the stretch and continued his steady bid at the
furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and weakened late.

SING A HAPPY SONG broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set a solid early pace and dictated terms approaching the half-mile
marker, was asked to rate into the turn and set decent fractions approaching the quarter pole while off of the rail, held a safe lead into the lane and was kept
to task at mid-stretch, dug in while holding GIANT KID at bay into the final sixteenth and proved best at the finish. GIANT KID tracked the solid early pace
from the second flight, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole, maintained an inside path into the stretch and continued to gain ground
at the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth and pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not reel that one and was clear of the rest for
second. SUNGLASSES (GB) rated off of the solid early pace, was guided two to three wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, chased
four wide into the stretch and continued her bid at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and finished evenly, while clear of the
rest for third. BOB'S VAI prominent away from the start, stalked the solid early pace and was well placed heading into the turn, chased SING A HAPPY
SONG while two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch, lacked a response into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep
stretch. CEE'S THE IMAGE tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, saved ground into the turn and chased the pace nearing the quarter pole,
went two wide into the stretch and was outrun approaching the furlong marker, could not find the needed response in deep stretch and did not factor in the
late stages. YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS allowed to settle away from the start, raced two wide into the turn and was outrun to the quarter marker, trailed into
the stretch and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) had to take up sharply before the first bend when PROOF OF JAZZ dropped into the path from the outside, tracked three wide
behind the fast pace while rating kindly, moved to challenge for the lead from the quarter pole, took command at the top of the stretch, opened up and held
off the fast closing MY YAMMY LADY under a brisk hand ride to prevail at the finish. MY YAMMY LADY was not asked for speed from the break and was
racing far behind before the first turn, settled well behind the field to the half mile marker, started to advance forwardly from that point then made an eye
catching move through the far turn that ended up in the three to four path entering the stretch, produced a bold rally down the lane but was unable to run
down the winner while well clear of the next horse. PROOF OF JAZZ went hard for the lead, cut over in front of NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) before the turn,
secured the rail and proceeded to set solid fractions to the far turn, could not match strides when challenged by that rival at the top of the stretch, kept on
under intermittent urging and was able to hold third. WORK TO LIVE lunged at the start then rushed up very keen into traffic going into the first turn and
steadied hard off heels, tipped out to the two path in the clear and settled down, stalked PROOF OF JAZZ to the far turn, tried to go with that one when the
pace quickened near the three furlong pole but was unable to do so, began to back up and was outrun the rest of the way. STRANGE ADDICTION allowed
to settle in the early running, was carried out four to five wide into the first turn, settled mid-pack through the first half racing out in the three path, tried to
mount a rally on the far turn but was unable to quicken with the rest and never made an impact. READY TO GIG bore out going into the first turn trying to
avoid some trouble inside and forced STRANGE ADDICTION out wider still, then settled mid-pack down the backstretch racing in about the two path,
struggled to keep up when the pace of the race quickened on the far turn, came under a ride then was not persevered with in the later stages.

IMPERIAL HORNET broke well but ceded the lead to HAY JUAN, let that one set the pace to the turn, moved to challenge from the quarter pole, had to be
set down to finally put that foe away at the furlong pole then drew away under steady drive to win clear. MAJOR TOM tracked the early pace inside in
tandem with GRIT AND CURIOSITY who shadowed to the outside, moved together with that one on the turn and into the stretch and staged a spirited battle
down the lane for the second spot and won the bob at the line. GRIT AND CURIOSITY was allowed to settle into stride, tracked the leaders two wide to the
turn along with MAJOR TOM to the inside, started to run on from the three furlong pole, hooked up with that same foe down the lane and lost the head bob
for the place. HAY JUAN was allowed to dictate the pace with IMPERIAL HORNET always close behind, dug in to to mid-stretch, gave way at the furlong
marker and was passed late for second. WELLSWORT (IRE) was outrun from the break and was never a factor.
