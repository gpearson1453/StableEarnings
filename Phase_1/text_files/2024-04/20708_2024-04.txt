Footnotes
HEADEDTOTHESTARS stalked the early duel, moved up four wide around the far turn, raced six deep in the stretch run and finished well to edge up under
strong pressure. WHIP dueled two deep from the outside of foe and kept on gamely to the wire. CINCO STEVE dueled near the rail, dug in through the
stretch drive and gave way grudgingly late. EURO SUPRISE settled off the early pace, made a good rail bid just past the five sixteenths pole and flattened
out while continuing an inside run. SWEET BAKER dropped back to race mid pack early on, was six deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally.
CANONIZE lost ground to race far back and never threatened. The five eighths internal fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
READY set a pressured early pace along the inside and drew off to be well clear in the drive while being kept to strong pressure. MYSTICAL CODE rated
along the inside, continued an inside run in the stretch but was no match for the winner. MIZ RITHYM stalked the pace, raced four deep around both turns
and had not enough for the top pair. RED ROSE CAFE dropped back to race mid pack, was six wide into the upper stretch and was even no closing run.
HOORAY FOR CREDIT prompt the early leader two deep from the outside of rival and gave way in the drive. SLICK CITY GIRL was unhurried early and
failed to respond. FLAT OUT FANCY was slow early on, had an inside run and no late response. GOSPEL EXPRESSION raced four wide near the seven
eighths pole, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and never threatened. HOLY AMA raced far back and never threatened.
