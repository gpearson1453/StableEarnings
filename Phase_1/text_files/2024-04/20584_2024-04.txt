Footnotes
PARADISE LAKE tracked leading pair while two then three wide into the stretch, closed steadily under right handed urging in final sixteenth and got the best
of the bobs on the wire. NOT A SINNER (GB) pressured the pacesetter while outside that rival, bid nearing the quarter marker, gained front in upper stretch,
inched away later in the drive but was nailed on the wire. DASHINGLY sped to the front, set pressured pace from the inside, was collared past the quarter
marker, fought back from along the rail, could not match top pair late and gamely held third. ASHLEY tracked leaders while inside winner, remained along
the fence into the stretch, came out slightly in the drive, closed on third place finisher in final yards but just missed the show. CRITICISM between foes early
then chased two wide on the turn and into the stretch, came out slightly in the drive and closed late on inside rivals. HANNAH BUCKLE (IRE) chased pace
from the inside, came out slightly departing the bend and found her best stride late. SABRES chased from off the rail, continued on three wide path into and
around the turn and weakened some in the drive. NOTIME FOR SQUALLS raced along the rail early, remained inside to the stretch and lacked the needed
response. HYMNAL settled off the pace and off the rail, raced three wide then three deep early on the turn, came out further entering the stretch and failed
to menace. MOTET got crowded between rivals early, chased outside rival to the turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked any late impact.

Footnotes
SORRENTO SKY (IRE) got impeded crossing the dirt, chased inside into the turn, angled out and tracked leaders on the turn, tipped out four wide into the
stretch, moved past BARTHOLDFY in deep stretch, inched away and just lasted. HURRICANE WAY unhurried from the inside, ran a bit awkwardly over the
crossing, continued along the rail into and around the turn, shifted out passing eighth marker, surged from the outside and just ran out of ground from
catching the winner. BARTHOLDY broke on top then lugged in over the dirt portion, attended the pace three wide, bid three deep, led into the stretch, edged
away then was caught inside sixteenth marker and later lost the place. SERIES brushed by rival at the start, chased from the inside, came two wide into the
stretch, encountered traffic in upper stretch, got clear later in the lane and went willingly to the wire. OMEY ISLAND close up early from the outside, stalked
three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, remained widest of all in the stretch and finished evenly. WINSITWELL broke in and brushed rival,
chased two then three wide, remained bit wide to the stretch, checked off heels of runner-up passing eighth marker and kept on to the finish. MR
FABRICATOR got put in tight and bumped early, pressed the early pace, bid between rivals on the turn, continued two wide into the lane and weakened.
LEGITIFY (IRE) bumped early, was sent up inside to grab the early lead, set the pace from the inside, ceded the front past the quarter marker and also
weakened from along the rail.

around the turn, then was overturned for second a sixteenth out.. DEVIL D' ORO was off bit slow, chased four then five wide into the stretch and improved
placing late. SPICY SPOUSE was off step slow, raced inside early, tipped out three wide leaving the turn and failed to threaten. DANDY DAY chased early
from the inside, dropped back around the turn and weakened in the stretch. BABY BLISS prominently placed early from off the rail, remained three wide to

Footnotes
DELITEFULL HART settled off the pace and well off the rail, roused early on the turn, moved up three wide, continued on same path into and through the
stretch, reeled in inside rivals in deep stretch and proved best in well-timed trip. VITALERA (CHI) came off the rail early and forced the early pace, bid past
quarter marker and gained lead into the stretch, edged away but could not hold the winner nearing the wire. FAYETTE FOX stalked the leaders early on
three wide path, moved up on same path nearing quarter marker, loomed into the stretch, continued on gamely thru the drive but could not match top pair
late. BANGS settled well off the rail, chased five wide then four wide into the stretch and weakened in the drive. MISS IVES broke alertly and sped to the
front, angled over the set the pace into the turn, was overtaken past quarter marker then faded in the stretch. WORTHY OF MAGIC reserved from the
inside, hugged the rail into and through the stretch while retreating.

Footnotes
JOHANNES content to settle off pace from the inside, chased from along the rail to second turn, moved up around that bend then angled out three wide
departing that bend, surged to the front inside eighth marker and pulled clear in late stages. WAR AT SEA chased from the inside, hugged the rail into the
lane, tipped out in upper stretch, was between rivals later in the drive and gamely held for second. SUMTER forwardly placed while bit off the rail, continued
two wide then outside eventual winner to the final bend, angled four wide into the stretch and was turned back in the drive for the place. AIR FORCE RED
stepped to the front and dictated the pace from the inside, resisted when challenged then was overtaken inside eighth marker and weakened late from the
inside. PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) settled bit off the rail, continued on same two wide path to the final turn, tipped out three wide into the stretch and finished
with interest. FUERTEVENTURA chased from along the rail early and into the backstretch, came out slightly around the second turn and improved placing
through the lane. IRIDEO (ARG) reserved early while crossing over, saved ground chasing the pace, came back out three wide on the second turn, tipped
out further in upper stretch and was no late threat. PARNELLI also chased from the inside early, remained just off the rail to the second turn, continued on
same path around that bend and lacked needed late punch. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) unhurried into first turn while securing the inside, saved ground while
trailing the field to second turn, came out some in upper stretch and lacked any late response. GENIUS JIMMY forced the early pace from along the rail,
stalked the leader through the backstretch, came off the inside to engage rival on the second bend, dropped back from between rivals in upper stretch and
faded from the inside.
