Footnotes
VINOBELLO away best of all, set a pressured pace along the inside, shook clear turning for home, drew out steadily under a firm hand ride to prove clearly
best. BABY AVERY pressured the winner from the outside for six furlongs, could not keep up in the drive, remained clear for the place. LOUPIT off a step
slow, lacked speed inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, steered out three wide midway on that bend, staged a mild rally to be clear of the
others, no threat to the top pair. XENA four wide in the first turn when off the pace, continued outside, moved a bit closer three wide far turn, lacked a further
advance to go flat through the strech. QUEEN CLANCY within striking distance in the two path, had little left for the drive. AVA MOON PIE settled off the
pace, weakened after a half. MONEY IS TIME off a step slow, trailed well back to be outrun. PER ECM2024-160 FROM HIWU, BABY AVERY WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
WITHOUT OBJECTION away in good order, spirited duel throughout in the three path, alternated up front through the lane, dug in late to narrowly prevail.
MUSEUM QUALITY broke on top, alternated up front throughout just off the inside, allowed a rival up inside late in the turn, continued to duel with the
winner inside that one through the lane, outkicked in the final stages. KEENEYES off a step slow, was used to move up and become a forward factor before
a quarter, crept closer still far turn, brief bid along the rail late in the bend, could not keep up through upper stretch, altered course to the outside and
finished up evenly to be clear of the others. I GOT A GUY lacked speed inside, continued to save ground through the turn, improved position, gaining for
show. THANKS FRANK in the second flight while off the inside, went one paced through the stretch. BARREL THIEF in mid pack while outside, five wide
into the turn, remained on the outside in the second flight into the lane, came up empty for the drive. PEACEAFTERTHUNDER broke back, trailed,
remained back. NICK JAGGER in the second flight for a half while between horses, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
TIFF WITH JIMMY closest to the leader in hand, continued to prompt that one through the turn, moved to engage that rival in upper stretch, put a head in
front nearing the furlong marker, edged clear then head the runner up safe late under steady handling. WEATHER MAP broke out, was straightened to race
in mid pack while three wide into the turn, angled in a bit to be in the two path entering the stretch, shifted out nearing the furlong grounds and finished
willingly to be getting to the winner late. TIZ SWEET CANDY broke on top, set the pace in the two path, relented to the winner in upper stretch, could not
contain the runner up, saved the show. STEALTHESPOTLIGHT off the pace while along the inside early, steered three wide late in the turn, improved
position late while not a serious threat. CHOCTAW BLESSINGS raced in mid pack well out in the strip, four to five wide late in the turn, also displayed some
mild late interest to better position slightly, no real threat. GATA RUNZ broke back, void of early speed, four to six wide through the turn, widest in the drive,
found best stride too late. ACCELERATING BABE forwardly placed while three to four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. HAYEK in the second flight
for a half along the inside, weakened. BODI ODI lacked early foot, never a threat off rail. RYE MUNNY off a step slow, remained always back while racing
four wide. LOFTY HEIGHTS in between horses in traffic into the turn, fell back to trail, remained well back.

Footnotes
BLAME J D in mid pack early while well wide, five to four wide through the turn when beginning to advance, lodged a bid on the outside in upper stretch,
wore down inside rival under firm handling to prove best. MIRI A COINCIDENCE prompted the leader from the outside for a half, took over three wide into
the stretch, showed the way past the furlong marker as the winner came calling, gave ground grudgingly to that one in the run to the wire, clearly second
best. BRAHMS IMAGE broke alertly, set the pace in the two path for a half, headed into the stretch, proved no match for the top two the final furlong,
remained clear of the others. CHOCTAW ZIP broke back, lacked speed out in the strip, four to five wide turn, staged a mild rally to improve position through
the lane. HIGHTAIL COWBOY forwardly placed early off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn, weakened in the drive. CAMPISI in the
second flight along the inside, steadily faded. MACHO ROCCO broke in mid pack, remained in the main body off the rail, one paced through the lane.
MACHO RONNIE off step slow, raced back and outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a rally. COLONEL BARTON void of speed, in the two path
behind horses through the turn, remained back. SHAKE UP fell back to trail, outrun. REUP mid pack and three wide, was finished before a half before a
half.

OPPOSITE THE CROWD in the second flight outside backstretch, bothered slightly into the turn, four wide through the bend, took over upper stretch, clear,
drifted out late. LOVELAND behind the pace inside, angled out to be four wide into the stretch, closed willingly while being floated out a bit by the winner in
the waning strides. MIESHA in mid pack and outside, three then four wide through the turn, staged a mild rally late to be in time for the show. TAKER BACK
broke on top, raced in the second flight off the inside the winner, was rank then checked up into the turn, came five wide for the drive, went evenly through
the lane. GRAND PRAIRIE GAL slammed both sides at the break, moved up to race in mid pack along the inside, two path into the stretch, went evenly to
the wire in lacking a closing kick. HONORABLE MISCHIEF pressed the leader for a half while off the inside, weakened. PEPPERS GIRLFRIEND lacked
speed, improved position toward the inside without posing a serious threat. MISS RUTH moved up to take control after the start, showed the way for a half
along the inside and gave way. NO PAY NO HAY broke in to bump GRAND PRAIRIE GAL soundly, remained back while racing three wide. WORM
BURNER broke out to also bump GRAND PRAIRIE GAL with force, remained back while three to four wide. RUBY QUEEN failed to menace while off the
inside. LIL KNOCKOUT off slowly, fell far back, distanced after losing contact with the field in the turn, distanced, jogged in.

LANDLORD with the pace while along the inside, dueled late turn, shook off that rival into the lane, held that rival safe to the wire under steady handling.
SWEET SODDY J with the pace three wide, angled in and dueled with the winner late in the turn, fell back off that one into the stretch, chased past the
furlong marker then was slowly getting back to that one late. BOURBON AFICIONADO off a step slow, raced back, angled out to be four wide onto the lane,
lodged a belated rally to finish willingly between rivals to earn part of the show. KONTEEKEE back off the leaders, steered five wide into the lane, set down,
also closed with some late energy well out in the strip to finish on even terms for the show. POWER SLAM in the second flight while four wide into the turn,
continued in the four path, lacked a closing punch to finish up evenly while losing a couple of positions in the final strides. FASTENED void of speed outside,
swung six wide exiting the turn, found best stride too late while widest in the drive. ANDY'S CANDY off a step slow, raced back and inside, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals late while never a threat. COPPER ECHO vied up front while between horses for three furlongs and began to give way. PATTON'S
TIZZY in the second flight, began a steady retreat before a half.

PROMISES TO DANCE with the pace while between foes, raced in the three path out of the turn when dueling, kicked well clear late under steady handling.
SUMMER SHOES lacked early speed outside, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting, rallied down the middle of the strip to be up in time for the place.
CONNIE K set a pressured pace while closest to but not on the inside, continued in the two path through the turn, dueled inside the winner upper stretch
then could not keep up, caught late for the place. LOVER GIRL off step slow, moved up to be one paced while racing just off the inside, continued in even
fashion in the stretch, picked off a couple of foes late while not a serious threat to the top three. OFF RAMP back off the early pace off the inside, three to
four wide when improving through the turn, in some traffic inside the furlong grounds when flattening out. SILVIA forwardly placed while four wide up the
backstretch, continued in the four path turn, had little left in weakening the final furlong. LETS DECLARE PEACE void of speed, four wide into the lane,
passed a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. H. T. XENA broke out and back, failed to menace while three wide. MAIRSILS FIRST was
never involved. RONNIE'S DEAL forwardly placed early along the inside, steadily faded while continuing to save ground. FASHION RAGE in the second
group early while inside, backed up past the furlong marker, gave way and was eased late.

Footnotes
NYQUICK away in good order, showed the way into and through the first turn inside, continued to set the pace in hand, shook off nearest pursuer entering
the stretch to be clear, extended that advantage to the wire under steady handling. SHATTUCK last away, lacked speed, swung out five wide when
advancing out of the final turn, lugged in past the furlong marker, was righted and was up late to gain the nod for the second spot. MEDIA MOGUL raced
back for six furlongs, asked along while three to four wide out of the final turn, drifted in upper stretch when on equal terms with the runner up while inside
that one, remained hooked up with that rival to the wire, missed the place. SILVER HEIST four wide into the first turn when back off the pace, angled in a bit,
two path up the backstretch and into the far turn, dropped ins while in some traffic soon after, continued inside, not enough late for the place. KING
RUSSELL within striking distance off the inside, traffic, shuffled back into the far turn, raced in the two path into the lane, improved slightly late while not a
serious threat. GAME KEEPER forwardly placed early off the inside, remained in contention while in the two path through much of the second turn, was
going evenly when in tight a furlong out, lacked a closing punch. UNLOAD prompted the winner from the outside, tried that one with a brief bid late in the
final bend, began to falter soon after. MACKMAN settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide trip, traffic, in tight a furlong out, lacked a bit thereafter.
IMPECCABILITY was finished after a half. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
STREET PAINTER close from the start outside the pace setter, carried out a bit into the lane, took over, drew well clear under steady handling. MELANIA T
back off the pace toward the inside early, steered out four wide into the stretch, rallied late on the outside to be up for the place, no threat to the winner.
ZONGS IRISH FROST broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner entering the stretch
then could not keep up, caught late for the runner up position. SNOW FLURRY moved closer while four wide through the turn, gradually weakened through
the stretch. KANTIRUN went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. SOPHIE'S STAR off slowly, made little impact while racing off the inside.
MOENCHANTED forwardly placed early along the inside, retreated. SKY RAVEN was not a threat while racing toward the inside. HOT SHOT SHOPPER off
slowly, remained back. FIRST CLASS GIRL broke back, fell further back to trail, was always outrun.
