CAPTIVATING CARA settled off the pace, split foes rallying into the stretch, continued his advance and was up in the late stages. OUR UPTOWN GIRL
raced just off leaders between rivals, bid into the stretch and finished gamely. BUCKS SOME advanced three wide on the turn, led narrowly in the stretch
but was outfinished. QUEEN CADENCE lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn and stretch rallying. MORE RANSOM saved ground trailing early,
angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. AFLEET DIVA flashed speed along the inside then proved empty in the stretch. GREEN GABLES rushed clear in
the opening quarter, led for half a mile and stopped.

FAYTASTIC tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied outside of OVE TO EAT in the stretch run, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth and
wore down that rival in the final yards to prevail. LOVE TO EAT set the pace on the inside, shook free for a clear lead on the backside, showed the way into
the stretch, dug in gamely when asked and then yielded grugdingly late. BAILINTIN raced off the pace inside, went three wide on the far turn and lacked a
rally. CORONA CAMPIONE raced four wide early, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and faded. BREEZY DANCE pressed the pace in the early
stages, then stalked between rivals, chased and gave way.

Footnotes
FENWICK JACK dropped back at the start, angled inside, was in tight and steadied into the far turn, reached the front and lasted. WHOOSH outrun early,
advanced wide and finished with good energy. TWENTYEIGHTTOTHREE chased off the pace outside, moved extremely wide into the stretch rallying.
JAKNAVA settled off the pace, split foes advancing then weakened late. GOLD BLING saved ground close up then began fading on the turn. BIJAH AGAIN
trailed early and was never in contention. LANIE'S FIRST DUDE earned a narrow lead off the inside, bore out on the turn and faded. WARRIOR'S SPECIAL
flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly losing contact.

CREATIVE COPY forced the pace outside, took over midway on the turn then held rival safe. MRS BELL stalked the pacesetters inside, bid into the stretch
but could not get by the winner. PACHELBEL chased off the pace in the two path, angled out in the lane and closed well. LARAMORE set pressured pace
inside, lost advantage on the turn and faltered. SO SWELL lacked speed outside and failed to respond. CICI UNIFIED was urged close up down backstretch
and weakened steadily. BELLA MARIA dropped far behind and was always outrun. SWEET LILLY FACTUM was very rank just after the start, was taken up
sharply inside into the far turn. The stewards posted the inquiry sign into the running of the race with no change in the order of finish.

Footnotes
DIVINE GRACE raced three wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, chased inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, took over past the
eighth pole and drew clear under urging. GAMESTONKS raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn and rallied outside for second.
AEGEAN SEA showed good early speed to set the pace, showed the way on the far turn, drifted out a bit entering the stretch, tired in the final furlong and
held on for third. IRIE EMPRESS hopped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and closed belatedly on the rail.
DISTORTED VIEW tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and gave way. LAMASCO stalked between rivals, began to drop back nearing the far turn
and gave way.

Footnotes
SPIKEZONE quickly moved clear, widened in hand on the turn and was never menaced under moderate urging. BOURBON MUSIC awaited room behind
rivals early, split foes into the stretch and made a gradual gain inside the winner. FIVE DREAMS broke alertly and chased four wide then lasted for the
show. DIDINGER was outrun early along the inside and lacked a solid rally. PERFECT DAY raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter for half a mile and
faded. SMOOTH B dropped well behind wide and was never in contention. MEMORY BOUQUET urged close up in the opening quarter then began fading
on the turn. PER RULING ECM2024-114 FROM HIWU, PERFECT DAY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5TH TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HE'S INCREDIBLE stalked close up two wide, bid on the turn, dueled with SHADOW BOX, battled heads apart with that rival passing the eighth pole,
gained a short lead, then dug in gamely to the end and prevailed. SHADOW BOX bumped at the start, showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled
with the winner turning for home, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and battled willingly to the finish. SEA TRIDENT tracked on the inside, chased
inside on the turn, angled out, finished evenly and held on for third. MY DEVILS CHILD raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, rallied mildly inside
in the stretch and just missed for the show spot. MUNDO MIX bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, moved up three wide on the turn, made a mild bid,
then weakened. YO NESSROUNDONKERN bumped at the start, outrun early, came five wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY
raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SMART AND FAST raced off the pace, inside on the turn and did not
factor. GABE chased outside and faded.
