JOLLY JUMPER stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid off the turn to kick clear, then remained clear to the wire to prove best under a
drive. CHUY GARZA Y. G. prompted the early pace from the inside while in a bit tight, shuffled back on the turn while saving ground, angled out when
straightened and finished well to be second best. SUNSHINE CHARLIE tracked the early pace four wide and made a four wide bid on the turn, could not
sustain that bid while keeping on for the show award. WIN FOR FUN chased the pace and was four wide on the turn, came five wide off the turn and had a
mild late kick to just miss the show award. MISTER WAYSIDE set a pressured pace two wide early, then was on the inside leaving the turn and faded late.
TAP THE BRAKES was fractious in the gate, settled back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STORMY BISONETTE vied for the lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn and drew off to prove much the best under a mild drive. HANGXIETY
prompted the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out while gaining the place award. ALL AFLUTTER pressed the pace and made a
three wide bid to gain a short lead leaving the quarter pole but came up empty in the lane, lasted for the show award. STRONG WOMAN vied for the lead in
between rivals and weakened in the drive. MAGGIE D'CAUSE prompted the pace five wide and weakened. SMOKING GUITAR was off slowly spotting the
field two lengths, saved ground throughout and never threatened. POLLY TIZ chased the pace and was two wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BRIGGSEY set a slow pressured pace on the inside under a good hold, then was asked leaving the turn and kicked clear to prove best under left handed
crop urging. GOSPEL MUSKETEER was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace three to four wide, came four wide off the turn and finished willingly to
be clearly second best. RUNHAPPY D'ORO pressed the pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out. ASSET BASIS was off
a step slow, made a middle move up the inside to be right behind the front runners but weakened in the lane. MY CALANTE was settled three wide and in
contention on the turn but tired in the lane. MULBERRY STREET was well placed early two wide but tired. NORDIC QUEEN was reserved early, four wide
by the quarter pole but was not a threat.

SAM SEZ was well rated three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn and was up in time to win the bob under a drive. UPTOWN SOCIAL set a pressured
pace on the inside, then was challenged on the turn but turned back that bid and shook clear off the turn but was denied on the wire to just miss. SPOTTED
BULL was off a step slow and bumped at the start, then was reserved early two wide, angled out in the lane and closed well on the far outside. HEROIC
SONG was settled back early, three wide on the turn and had a late rally. KICK IT AGAIN BOB was settled early and saved ground on the turn and had a
belated rally but needed more. MIRANDEN pressed the early pace three wide, then made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command but came up
empty in the lane. PHILO BEDDOE chased the pace four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BROWN TOWN was well placed early on the inside, eased out on the far turn and made a three wide bid off the turn, led by the sixteenth marker and then
jumped the tracks late but then held on to prevail under a drive. EXCAPING THE BLUES set the pace while in the two path and shook clear by the quarter
pole, then was confronted and dug in gamely in the drive but was out-kicked by the winner. EARS TO ME was allowed to settle early on the inside,
advanced two wide on the far turn, made a inside bid off the turn and kept on willingly but needed more late. RACHEL'S CAPER was four wide into the first
turn, chased the pace three to four wide and came four wide off the turn but had no kick. MR PELOTON stalked the early pace three wide, then chased the
pace in between rivals on the far turn and faded. GIST was off a step slow and was far back early and never factored. GRANDSONSAM chased the pace
on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
PAT'S RIDE was off slowly, then moved up on the inside, eased out on the turn and made a three wide bid off the turn, drew out smartly to prove much the
best under mild urging. SANGRIA SUNSET dueled for the early lead, made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead, but proved to be no match for the
winner while clearly second best. PAULA M dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive, held show award. REBELENA broke outwardly at
the start, tracked the pace four wide and faded in the drive, missed show award. LADY RASHEN chased the pace and was three wide on the turn and
weakened. OPTIMISTIC WOMAN was outrun early, saved ground on the turn and failed to menace. RUN DOTTIE RUN was off a step slow, chased the
pace from the inside and weakened. FLATOUTSASSYOK was bumped soundly at the start then was not a factor.
