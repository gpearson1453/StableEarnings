Footnotes
LICHITA was sent to get the early lead, relaxed while saving ground through the bend then steadily opened up under a drive in the lane. NOT TO BE
DENIED without early speed, also saved ground taking the turn, lodged a mild bid in the stretch and caught DOROTA for second. DOROTA broke well, was
soon chasing LICHITA from just outside, was no match for that one when set down for the drive and gradually drifted out the last eighth. BETHY was away
slowly and never a factor. PALAGO stayed outside rivals most of the way and showed little. I LUV THIS BAR began to retreat after a quarter mile, angled
out on the bend, her rider lost his whip upper stretch and she continued to yield.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH TUESDAY was hustled along to stalk the early speed and rallied in time under urging in the stretch to catch NAPABIT. The latter soon had the
lead, saved ground then began to drift out some and wear down inside the last furlong. AIR GERRI was squeezed back at the break, angled out early, three
wide through the bend then ran evenly for the drive. HANABI was a brief factor but faded from inside on the turn. HER SPEAKER'S ON began to yield two
wide on the bend. WILDISH showed little in a ground-saving trip. TOUR DE' PORT chased from outside and was never a factor.

XPRESSIR shared the lead outside KEEP ATTACKING, moved clear with three furlongs to go, took the rail and held well under urging in the stretch. KEEP
ATTACKING disputed the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, moved out some, lacked the extra needed for the drive but was
clearly second best. CHARLIE'S BEACH angled to the inside on the turn, moved clear for third upper stretch and proved easily best of the others.
IMMORAL was a brief contender between rivals, three wide taking the turn then flattened out for the stretch run. DRAGGING MAIN chased from inside,
angled out leaving the bend and was empty for the drive. ACCELERITAS faded from inside on the turn, pulled up upper stretch and walked off.

GHAALEB'S HONOR pressed from outside, four wide on the bend as she commenced her bend, angled in as she engaged BIG SALLY at the top of the
lane and edged ahead in the waning yards. BIG SALLY was sent to dispute the early pace from inside, moved clear on the turn, was challenged again in the
stretch, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. JULYNNE prominent from the beginning, saved ground taking the bend, angled outside
GHAALEB'S HONOR upper stretch, moved clear for third then could only just hold her position late. CANDY LOOKER chased from outside, floated out to
path five for the stretch run then gradually lugged in the final sixteenth. SHINE DOWN displayed early speed between rivals but flattened out for the drive.
LUTION chased from outside and failed to menace. MISS MIA was away slowly and showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY was sent to the lead between rivals early, moved clear and stayed just off the inside through the turn then gradually opened up
under a drive in the lane. UPBEAT MELODY pressed SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY from just outside, did not keep up leaving the bend then fought to keep
second through the stretch. TROY OUNCE prominent from inside, angled outside SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY entering the stretch, battled for the place but
did not have enough left. TAPIT SAM chased from inside, lodged a mild bid into the stretch, improved his position, angled out for a clear path with a
sixteenth to go and only made up minor ground. IMPERIAL MOMENT advanced four wide on the bend, was bumped leaving the quarter pole and leveled off
for the drive. D' YANK chased from just off the inside, swung out five wide for the stretch run and lacked a serious bid. KING DOODLE four to six wide
taking the turn, could only make up minor ground late. REAL NEWS was an early factor from the outside, three wide on the turn, appeared to float out some
leaving the bend, bumped with IMPERIAL MOMENT then steadily faded. NOT AGAIN JACKIE showed little running widest most of the way.

Footnotes
COMISKEY PARK stalked FAST JACK from outside, went for the lead leaving the bend then drew off the final furlong. W W CANDY without early speed,
progressed two wide between rivals on the turn, angled outside COMISKEY PARK upper stretch, could not close the gap on the leader the last eighth but
proved easily second best. FAST JACK was quickly clear, challenged from outside leaving the turn and wore down the final furlong. WILDWOOD SICILIAN
raced in contention in close quarters between horses on the backstretch but faded three wide on the bend. STALLONE advanced along the rail on the bend
but gave way for the drive. LAND MARK DEAL chased from outside, began to yield four wide on the turn, continued fading in the lane and his rider lost his
crop inside the last eighth.

Footnotes
LIFE OF SATURDAYS broke well, steadily angled in, was just off the inside taking the turn, engaged SMILE AT THE STORM nearing the final sixteenth and
edged ahead in the waning yards. SMILE AT THE STORM took a clear lead from inside after a furlong, was challenged inside the last eighth, fought gamely
but did not have enough left in the late going. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE chased from midpack, was three wide through the turn then rallied belatedly in the
lane. WITCHING was a bit rank, throwing her head, just after the break, forced inward by LIFE OF SATURDAYS soon after that, was two to four wide taking
the bend and also found best stride too late deep stretch. VIVA VIOLENCE chased from outside, lost ground four then five wide through the turn and rallied
belatedly, as well, inside the last furlong. MINI DRESS saved ground and failed to menace. WARM BEAUTY well back from the early going, angled in on the
turn and had no stretch bid. NEXT TIME YOU WIN four to six wide through the turn, was empty for the drive. WEEKEND PASS showed little.
