UNEEDTOCOMEHOME was bumped hard at the start, made the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace into the stretch, edged clear under left handed
urging before the furlong marker and lasted under a strong hand ride. IT'SGOODTOBESEEN stalked the pace three then four wide and was steadily cutting
into the winners' advantage late. OVERLOAD never far back, was hard used and went evenly. WATCHOUTFORWEAVER pressured the winner two then
three wide into the stretch and faded late. BUCKEYE RED bore in at the start bumping hard with the winner, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch
then leveled off. MONSTER HUNTER failed to menace. CLEVELAND POWER was no factor. DASH OF FIRE had brief speed. RED COMET was outrun.

the start, had good early speed after settling four wide, dropped back after a half, swung wide entering the stretch then came on again late five wide.
