Footnotes
DOVE IN CHARGE tracked in the four path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and
rallied past an inner trio in the final furlong. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL stalked in the three path, was roused into the turn, floated out to the seven path turning into
the stretch, and ran on for place. FAST KIMMIE raced off the pace inside, was coaxed along from the rail around the turn, angled out to the four path in
upper stretch, and kept on for show. SPLURGE prompted the pace in the three path, bid two wide while in hand rounding the turn, swung out to the five path
while being roused at the top of the stretch, inched to the lead just after the eighth pole, but flattened in the final sixteenth. NIGHTSABER (GB) steadied at
the start, rated in the four path, was coaxed in the five path midway around the turn, but made no impact. TEARDUC showed the way along the inside, was
roused into the turn, dug in along the inside in upper stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL trailed inside early and never threatened.
STARSHIP LEGEND raced wellback in the two path and never menaced.

Footnotes
UNEQUIVOCALLY pressed the pace two wide between foes, took a narrow lead near the seven-sixteenths marker, vied between around the turn and drew
off under a drive in the lane. ASHER'S EDGE set the pace along the rail, could not keep pace with the winner from the quarter pole, angled out in upper
stretch and held second. DAVID'S SONGS hit the starting gate, made progress outside down the backstretch, bid three deep midway around the turn but
weakened through the stretch. ANCHISES chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. FATTOUSH broke a step slowly, raced four
wide and never threatened. SAMMY'S SAMARITAN exchanged several bumps with FRANKS MIMI through the opening sixteenth, saved ground and made
little impact. FRANKS MIMI exchanged several bumps early, steadied entering the turn, raced two wide around the bend and was never involved.

FREE SOUL prompted the pace in the five path, bid in the four path passing the three-eighths, led under a ride passing the quarter, and dug in down the
lane to hold off an outer pair. CROSS HASTE stalked in the three path, was cued midway around the turn, floated out to the eight path in upper stretch, and
ran on for place. SESAME SEED BAGEL bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the six path, ranged up to bid in the five path midway around the
turn, was coaxed passing the quarter, swung from the six path into the lane, and kept on, but hung for show. ENGLISH BOB trailed in the four path, came
under coaxing in the two path passing the three-eighths, cut the corner turning into the stretch, but made no impact. CATTIN raced off the pace in the six
path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, but did not factor from the eight path in the stretch. CAJUN BROTHER pressed in the four path,
was ridden in the two path around the turn, but weakened in the stretch. BIRD WILDCAT bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the two path but
never threatened from the eight path in the stretch. NEOPHYTE set the pace in the two path but yielded along the inside midway around the turn.

Footnotes
FLY THE W tracked in the three path, received a right handed cue in the two path midway around the far turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the
lane, and rallied past an inner foe around the sixteenth. TIZ ROMANTIC laid up close inside of the pacesetter from the two path, vied for the lead passing
the half, tipped to the rail under a nudge while taking command entering the far turn, opened up under coaxing from the three path turning into the stretch,
but was caught by an outer foe around the sixteenth to place. TAP GOLD set the pace in the four path early, was overtaken by an inner foe passing the half
and came under a ride in the three path entering the far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane, and was one paced for show. URANIUM trailed
in the four path, was driven in the two path around the far turn, and made no impact. POUND GREEN stalked in the five path, was driven in the four path
around the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. THE BEST DISTANCE rated in the six path but never menaced.

Footnotes
STAT tracked the pace three wide, steadily gained through the lane, was brushed and switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole, took the lead
late and just lasted between foes. CLEAR DESTINATION saved ground off the pace, made good progress at the rail in upper stretch, waited for room in
midstretch, swung four wide nearing the sixteenth pole, surged outside and ran out of ground. J P HELLISH pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near
the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging leaving the sixteenth pole, brushed the winner and switched back to the left lead and led until the final
strides. HE'SPUREGOLD saved ground up close and was one-paced through the lane. BURNIN TURF set the pace along the rail to midstretch and
weakened. DETERMINEDLY saved ground off the pace, swung seven wide in upper stretch and made a mild late gain. LIKE THE KING went evenly inside.
AMERICAN SPEED failed to menace while racing two and three wide. HE'S A MESS trailed inside, angled four wide nearing the far turn and was no threat.
OMAHA CITY steadied early and played no factor while racing two and three wide.

BETH'S DREAM stalked in the two path, waited confidently rounding the turn, roused to bid while angling out to the five path at the top of the lane, and
kicked away handily while hanging on her left lead. ABUNDANCIA bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the four path, was coaxed from
the five path into the turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the stretch, and kept on for place. DREAM CONCERT bumped with an inner foe at the
start, laid up close in the four path, bid midway around the turn, was ridden between foes into the stretch, and flattened, but held show. LIBBAN rated inside,
angled out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, but made no impact. POIEMA showed the way in the two path, but lost the lead nearing the
quarter, and faded. ATOMICALLY chased in the six path but never threatened. YUKI (CHI) prompted the early pace in the five path but was done after a
half.

Footnotes
KID CAIRO showed the way along the inside, was cued from the rail midway around the far turn, kicked away from the two path in upper stretch, and held
sway. PET MAT rated inside, was roused from the three path into the far turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, lost the whip around the
sixteenth, but rallied to get up for place late. HANGIN IN THERE tracked in the three path, was roused between foes while two wide midway around the far
turn, and kept on for show. TYPHOON FURY got floated out to the six path early into the first turn, laid in midpack from the five path down the backstretch,
ranged up passing the quarter, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, drifted into the five path and bumped an inner foe around the sixteenth,
and stayed on. ITS BOURBON THIRTY prompted the pace in the two path, bid around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, got bumped by
an outer foe around the sixteenth, and finished evenly. IDONEO stalked in the four path, came under a ride midway around the far turn, but flattened in the
stretch. BELL MOUNTAIN raced off the pace in the four path but made no impact. CPTBOBSBTWENTYNINE raced wellback in the three path but was no
factor from the seven path in the stretch. DERBY STREET trailed in the two path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, but failed to bid.
JUVENTUS was unhurried along the inside early but never threatened. I SEE YOU LOOKIN laid up close inside, but steadied passing the quarter, and
weakened. QUISTMER floated out to the five path around the first turn, chased in the two path down the backside, but steadied going into the far turn, and
came up empty.
