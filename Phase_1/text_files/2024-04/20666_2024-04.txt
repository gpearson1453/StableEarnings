MIDSUMMER SOIREE dueled on the early lead outside FAULOSITY and slowly edged clear in the lane under confident handling. FABULOSITY dueled
from inside the winner and could not go with that one late. MUSTANGMAGNA angled three wide into the lane but could not produce the needed late run.
RETRO RITA bumped with a rival in the opening sixteenth and lacked a rally three or four wide. PIECE OF ME bumped with a rival and was shuffled back
racing onto the main track then had no rally three wide. FEELSSOGOODINLOVE was not a factor. DIXIE TRIXIE was not a factor.

at the start, contested the early lead outside a rival and came up empty in the lane. JAMAICA MISTAICA moved up five wide in the far turn while not a

the left side of the bridle and weakened into the second turn. FRUIT CUP moved inside and failed to threaten. CAN DANZER weakened from along the
inside. DADSAMUMBLER failed to mount a bid three and four wide. BENZ LAKE THUNDER was always back. DOING DAYS was finished early.

LONG MONDAY stalked the early leaders four wide, bid into the far turn and wore down AUNT NADINE through the drive. AUNT NADINE was on the pace
three wide, dug in through the far turn but could not hold the winner safe. STOLEN HALO moved up four and five wide then could not get to the top pair in
the lane. QUALITY BOW dropped back in traffic into the first turn and moved outside, rallied four wide in the far turn then could not produce the needed late
effort. JJ'S AMERICAN DIVA was last away and failed to rally three wide. THE GREY BEAUTY showed early speed along the inside and weakened. AKASI
weakened from along the inside. UNPLUCKED GEM trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HIGHLANDER'S EDGE showed the most early speed to gain inside position and make the pace, repelled a challenge in the far turn then kept safe late as
FULL SPIRIT closed. FULL SPIRIT was along the inside, angled out into the lane while moving up and rallied but could not down the winner. KINGMAKING
(GB) tracked the winner from three wide to bid into the far turn and could not sustain the effort in the lane. EXTRA INDY stalked the pace three and four
wide, moved five wide into the lane but lacked a final closing run. MINNIE'S READY rallied inside through the far turn, angled four wide into the lane but
could not threaten late. EASY ACT moved up four wide while not a threat. HIT'EM UP saved ground and was not a factor. LITTLE MORE LOVE was five
and six wide through the first turn and weakened. NOBLE PRESENT was always back.
