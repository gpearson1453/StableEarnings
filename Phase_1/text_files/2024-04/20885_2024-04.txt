CURLY ESA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the six path coming around the turn and kicked clear on
the far outside in late stretch. CORN POP pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three path and chased
on to the wire. HANDR'SDREAM led the way on the inside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and was caught late. LUCKY SMILE
was reluctant to load and then fractious in the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the turn
in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. VROYSKY chased the leader on the outside early, swung out to the five path coming around the bend
and was outfinished. FABSTRACTION raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and showed no kick. HEAD FOR BUSINESS
dueled between horses through the early going, came around the bend in the four path and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
MOR TEQUILA led the way on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and dueled to the wire, drifting out late and holding the
win. GOLDEN ALE chased the leader between horses early, swung out to the five path coming around the bend and gained ground late, racing in traffic
when MOR TEQUILA drifted into his lane late. HEY NOW raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and
improved position in the stretch. POVERTY BAY stalked the leader on the outside through the opening stages, angled in to save ground around the bend
and chased on from there. GOOD BYE CHARLIE hopped up leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the rail early, continued around the turn in
the three path and showed no kick. MR. STANG trailed the field up the backstretch, swung out to the six path coming around the bend and never
threatened. SEA TO SUCCESS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the seven path and
faded in the stretch. THIEF IN THE NIGHT raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path
and was empty in the lane. MINISTERSDON'TLIE pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the two path and
tired in the stretch. THE RIDER OF HORSE TWO, GOLDEN ALE, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE NINE, MOR TEQUILA, CITING INTERFERENCE IN
LATE STRETCH. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE SAME INCIDENT. UPON REVIEW, HORSE NINE, MOR TEQUILA, WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.
