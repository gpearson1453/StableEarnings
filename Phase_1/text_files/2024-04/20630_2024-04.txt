Footnotes
FLOATING with the pace from the start, vied up front up the backstretch and through the turn, kicked clear down the lane under steady handling. MOLLY
OF STRATFORD behind the pace while saving ground, was covered up along the rail for much of the turn, roused when clear for the drive off the inside,
late run to grab the place late, not a threat to the winner. PLEASINGLY with the pace while three wide, remained on equal terms with the winner into the
lane, proved no match the final furlong, nipped late for the second spot. CUPID'S MUSIC last to leave, trailed early, angled out four wide turning into the
stretch, improved position with some belated interest. TIFF WITH JIMMY went one paced behind the the vying leaders while 2-3w, lacked a closing kick. I'M
SO FUNNY behind the pace, floated out five wide turning for home, failed to rally. ACCELERATING BABE vied up front along the inside, backed up through
the lane.

Footnotes
MISS ANALYZED away well, within striking distance while saving ground, moved closer backstretch, slipped thru to challenge into the far turn, put a head in
front early in that bend, drew out steadily through the lane. ARIEL M D prompted the pace while racing three wide, briefly raced on equal terms with the
winner into the stretch then could not keep up, clearly second best. DOMINA in mid pack while racing off the inside, in the second flight while saving ground
second turn, finished up best of the rest. PERCEPTIVE lacked speed while racing three wide, improved position a bit into the lane, no real threat.
RESOLUTION fell back to trail while racing three wide through the final turn, also improved position with some belated interest. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN
sprinted clear to set the pace toward the inside, allowed the winner the inside late backstretch, began to weaken when headed by that one while between
horses, continued to falter through the lane. GLOBAL RISK in the second flight early just off the inside, tracked up the backstretch, came three wide for the
drive, had little left for the stretch run. KAVA saved ground to no avail to be always outrun. PADDY GAL four wide through the first turn, four wide much of
the second turn, gave way.

Footnotes
CHUPAPI MUNYAYO off a step slow, moved up closer in the run up the backstretch, patiently handled while still saving ground turn, tipped out three wide
for the drive, bid, took over past the sixteenth pole then held the runner up safe late. PEPPERONIKID back off the pace, raced in traffic early in the turn,
continued to be surrounded late in the turn and into the stretch, roused when clear, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. DICEY WAGER broke
alertly, dueled up front off the inside, cleared and dropped to the inside for the turn, continued to hold the advantage into the stretch, weakened gradually
the final furlong. STREET COMMANDER hesitated to be off slowly, remained back while saving ground turn, improved position toward the inside, narrowly
missed the show. RUDIANO dueled early, chased the leader through the turn, rebid inside that one upper stretch, held a narrow advantage past the furlong
marker and faltered. WATER TO WINE in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. SECRET TAVERN forwardly placed
while three wide for a half, backed up through the lane. I'M AN OAK fell back to trail after the start, never a factor.

CHASING SHADOWS broke in mid pack, raced under firm restraint while in traffic 1st turn, advanced second turn, four to five wide into the lane, bid, dug in
late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME void of early foot, three wide into the lane while between horses, bid a furlong out,
outkicked. ALSANAH moved off the rail first turn, continued in the two path through the second bend, split foes and proved determined for the show.
LANTERN'S CANDY four wide in the first turn, continued outside, four wide again second turn, displayed a modest amount of interest in upper stretch then
flattened out to be outfinished for the show. SHE BE SHEEHAN broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, allowed the leader to go onto the
backstretch, chased that one into the far turn, had little left for the drive. HONEY RUN five wide into the first turn, used to clear onto the backstretch, larger
lead, faltered late. INDY AGAIN vied early, in the second flight the middle half, weakened. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL off a step slow, never menaced.
TRIPLE L'S CUTTER in mid pack while three wide, moved inside for the run through the second bend, failed to rally. MY MY off a step slow, trailed most of
the way to be always outrun. JERI DAWN pulled in the first turn, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
CHIRINGO off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, closer in traffic late turn, waited, steered out four wide into the lane, bid past the furlong marker, drew
clear under steady handling. GOLD LUCK lacked speed, asked along while angling out to be three wide late in the turn, in some traffic, set down drive,
finished willingly to annex the place, not a threat to the winner. KOMOREBINO OMOIDE (JPN) off a step slow, raced back toward the inside, split foes
approaching the furlong marker, improved position. BACKSIDE BUZZ in the second flight while in the two path, boxed late in the turn, displayed some mild
interest when clear for the drive. MASTER OF ARMS in the group while three wide midway on the turn, floated out four wide into the lane when moving
closer, flattened out the final furlong. SINNER'S SIN moved up to press the issue up front for a half in the two path, weakened in the drive. COLD AS HELL
mid pack off the inside, three wide in the turn when moving a bit closer between horses, went evenly through the lane. OWN THE FIELD fell back to trail
after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. TIM TAL remained back in failing to threaten. ROCKING ROCKET used a bit early up
the inside to take control, set the pace for a half and gave way.

EDGE TO EDGE away in good order, pressed the leader from the outside, challenged that one then took over into the stretch, shook clear by the furlong
marker then held the runner up safe late. GUN PILOT in the second flight three wide and between foes, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the winner.
TAPATIO LEO broke well, set the pace in the two path, could not match the winner in upper stretch, gradually weakened, saved the show. CHASING TIME
in the second flight while along the inside, came up empty for the drive. TUT'S REVENGE back off the pace off the inside, three wide and behind horses into
the stretch, split rivals and improved position. MISTER ICEMAN in mid pack while outside, five wide through the bend, lacked a closing kick. SIR
WELLINGTON off a step slow, raced back in the two path, dropped to the inside late in the turn, improved upper stretch then flattened out a bit. KAVOD in
the second flight while between horses for a half, faded through the stretch. MORELLO forwardly placed, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. ALTO
ROAD broke back, trailed throughout, not a factor.

Footnotes
SHACKS WAY broke well, set the pace toward the inside, shook clear turning for home and maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady
handling. TRUCULENT settled behind the pace along the inside, patiently handled while continuing to save ground into and through the second turn, clear
for the drive, shifted out a bit, little late gain. COACH ADAMS four wide into the first turn, remained outside in mid pack, four wide again second turn, went
evenly through the stretch. MYSTERY MO broke back, lacked speed just off the inside, moved to the inside for the drive, improved a bit in upper stretch, no
real threat. T BONES TRICK fell back to trail after the start, three wide through the second turn, bettered position through the lane with some belated
interest. CITY LEGEND five wide into the first turn in the second flight, four wide through much of the second turn when prominent, weakened the final
furlong. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE prompted the pace for six furlongs in the two path, gave way in the drive. BIZZY LEGS pressed the winner early from the
three path, began a steady retreat after a half. R DOC remained back to be always outrun.
