after the start, brushed with an outer foe soon after, tracked the embattled pair from the two path, yielded hanging on her left lead through the lane and lost
show late. WHATINTHELITERAL lacked speed along the inside, shfited out in midstretch and stayed on mildly. LOOKATMYBUCKLE chased from midpack
from the two path and failed to menace. POUNDS IN TOWN dropped back to race well back two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted out to
the six path in upper stretch and improved position. BAYTOWN CLEOPATRA brushed an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and
between horses, bumped an outer rival tipping to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, then failed to factor. RUN CAMILA RUN transferred contact from

Footnotes
BARKSDALE showed the way just a bit off the inside, drew clear nearing the lane and held sway under a drive. GREAT RICHIE M tracked along the inside,
smartly moved forward to secure inside stalking position approaching the turn, came under a drive in pursuit as the leader kicked away nearing the lane,
then kept on well to be second best. NORTHERN CHILL pressed the leader from the three path, but yielded in the four path entering the lane, yet safely
maintained show. TIZZY INDY lacked speed in the three to two path then advanced between rivals in upper stretch. PRETTY FAST chased two wide into
the turn, moved out to the five path at the quarter pole and lacked a bid. NEWHART fidgeted subtly then hesitated at the start, trailed in the three path and
improved position. ILLINI chased from midpack in the four path, floated to the six path entering the lane and tired. NOBLE GENTLEMAN pursued from the
four path and gave way. MIDNIGHT STORMY brushed the starting gate and broke slow, then saved ground well back to no avail. FEAR AND LOATHING
pursued from midpack in the three path but faltered between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
LANDED set the pace two wide before moving to the inside down the backstretch, inched clear of an outer presser entering the lane and held sway.
BEFRIENDED was bumped between horses at the start, tugged while off of the pace in the four to five path early on, tracked four wide into the far turn,
stalked taking aim on the leader three wide entering the lane, chased that one dueling for place with an inner foe in the final sixteenth and narrowly
prevailed. LITTLE JAMIE bumped an inner foe at the start, prompted along the inside, stalked around the turn, dueled for place while chasing the clear
leader in the late stages, but missed. YES INDEED was brushed and forced inwardly by an outer rival at the start, contacted an inner foe soon after,
pursued from midpack along the inside, but steadied sternly when running up on rivals entering the backstretch, was hard held in pursuit two wide down the
backstretch, then lacked a bid. PRETTY ANA tracked from the three to four path early on, stalked three wide before chasing between horses into the far
turn, but yeilded turning for home. TWIRLING GOOD TIME took contact to her hind end from an outer rival shortly after the start, tracked in the two to three
path around the first turn, moved to press two wide and between horses with five furlongs to, but faded through the lane. FOURFIFTYSEVEN bumped an
outer rival at the start before bumping an inner foe soon after, then made little impact from the two path. SING A LITTLE SONG trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RUN FOR THE HILLS vied three deep, cleared inner rivals in upper stretch and held sway from a pair of pursuers. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES was brushed
by an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack four wide, tipped to the six path entering the lane, rallied to duel for place with an inner rival through the
final sixteenth and prevailed. PEACOCK LASS tracked three wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the lane, rallied between horses to
duel for place with an outer foe entering the final sixteenth, but got outfinished. HURRICANE DEBBIE pressed four wide, chased entering upper stretch, got
outkicked while attempting a bid for place at the sixteenth pole then lasted for fourth. HIDEKI saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on up the fence to
miss reaching fourth. UP AND DOWN dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, proved no match for his widest counterpart in upper stretch and gave
way. ADMISSIBLE leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, laid off of the pace four to five wide, shifted to the seven path entering the lane and moved up
to miss reaching fourth. PAMMY'S READY pursued two wide and between horses, shifted to the five path entering the lane and failed to menace between
horses. FRANGO ELECTRICO tracked along the inside then tired between horses. AMERICAN ROCKETTE leaned out and brushed a foe at the start,
trailed along the inside then failed to factor. DRIANA was brushed by an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace five to six wide and faded. BOUDOIR
BURLESQUE sparred for the lead two wide and between horses, but faded entering the lane before being put to tight quarters in midstretch.

Footnotes
SIDAMARA took back between horses approaching the first turn, laid towards the rear two wide around that bend, shifted out to the six path with five
furlongs to go, advanced six wide turning for home to offer a menacing bid outside of the top pair entering the lane, cleared in upper stretch and held as a
pair of rivals closed in late. JUST BASKING trailed along the inside, pursued in the three path and between horses around the far turn, picked up stride
sfifting five wide entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the clear leader late but ran out of ground. CHILLED bobbled at the start, pursued from midpack in
the three path and between horses, chased among foes around the far turn, got outmoved by a wide bidder nearing the lane, shifted four wide to rally along
with an outer foe in upper stretch, vied for place with that rival but was bested. MYSTICAL CHANT stalked three wide, bid outside of the leader at the three
furlong pole, vied entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and gave way. LETSTALKABOUTME laid off of the pace two
wide, retreated to trail the field into the far turn, yet advanced being floated four to six wide entering the lane, but leveled off. CLAIRE'S JETE showed the
way along the inside but faded inside of pair of rivals entering the lane. ENCOURAGEACHOTHER bobbled and bumped an outer rival at the start, raced off
of the pace in the five to four path around the first turn, chased five wide around the far turn and failed to factor. RESTLESS DREAMER tugged forwardly in
the five path around the first turn to track four deep down the backstretch, sustained pursuit around the far turn but faded between horses entering the lane.
SICILIAN PRINCESS pursued from midpack in the two path, chased along the inside around the far turn and faded. AVA MOON PIE took contact from an
inner rival at the start, lacked speed hung in the six to five path around the first turn and failed to factor. YAY HOORAY prompted two wide but weakened
between horses around the far turn. JESSAMINE HILL hesitated at the start, lacked speed along the inside, took closer order with a half mile to go, but tired
turning for home.

Footnotes
DENIM AND PEARLS tracked the top pair from the four path, ranged up to bid well in hand nearing the lane, gained an advantage entering it, kicked away
in upper stretch and drew off under strong hand urging. HARBOR SPRINGS bobbled outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from the four path,
shfited to the five path entering the lane and stayed on to edge place at the sixteenth pole. YOUALMOSTHADME stalked the leader from the three path,
forged an advantage as her outer stable-mate loomed a danger at the five sixteenths pole, offered little resistance to that one's challenge and proved no
match entering the lane, then faded and lost place with a sixteenth to go. CHI CHI bobbled at the start, lacked speed along the inside, trailed into the turn,
took the bend in the three path before shifting to the six path in upper stretch, then surpassed tired rivals and failed to threaten. TIPSY TAMMY was bumped
by an inner rival, put to crowded quarters and steadied back at the start, pursued from the two path and tired. VICOUNTESS showed the way into the turn,
but was headed turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
JUSTIFIABLE BELLE tracked in the three path, bid outside of the leader in the final furlong and edged clear. TITUBA bumped an outer rival early on, led
two wide before moving inside around the first turn, dueled with an outer rival around the far turn and through upper stretch, shook free of that one at the
furlong grounds, but was caught by a wider bidder at the sixteenth pole and saved place. SAKE (FR) pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted off the
fence around the far turn, tipped four wide entering upper stretch, rallied aiming outside of the leaders late but was denied place. BAG LADY was bumped
between horses soon after the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three path in upper stretch and ran on. HOLY FOLEY rated well back
in the two path, swung out to the six path entering the lane and moved up. CONDONE broke outwardly, saved ground towards the rear and improved inside
of rivals. CADENCIA prompted three to two wide around the first turn, dueled two wide around the far turn but yielded between horses in midstretch.
APROPOS tracked in the two path, chased between horses into the far turn and faded. KING'S SECRET (GB) stalked along the inside and faded. SQUASH
BLOSSOM bumped an inner rival early on, was keen into the first turn, raced off of the pace in the three to four paths and failed to factor. CANT KEEP ME
DOWN pursued from the three to four path and tired. LADAN broke outwardly, trailed in the three to five path and got outrun.
