JEEPER well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid on the final turn and pulled away through the stretch. RUSH CENTER broke alertly and vied inside, lost
the lead then continued gamely to hold the place. MAJESTIC LION trailed early, advanced strongly inside with good late energy. LEVEL UP dueled in the
two path to the stretch and faltered. KING SWANSBORO dropped far behind then passed rivals along the inside. MIDNIGHT AWARD lacked speed outside
and failed to respond. SCAMP WALKER chased within range inside then proved empty in the stretch. DUDLEY DICKERSON raced off the leaders for half a
mile and gave way. BOOSTER SHOT raced wide and far back throughout. WHISKEY PRIZE was fractious in the gate prior to the start then stopped. BEAR

T'WAS THE NIGHT outrun early along the rail, angled out in the stretch and closed strongly to just get up in time. BROKENHEARTED stalked the
pacesetter three wide, bid into the lane, lugged in at the eighth pole, was quickly straightened and just missed. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN raced in closest
pursuit of the pacesetter, was in tight between rivals near the eighth pole and yielded. BRASI sprinted clear inside in the opening quarter, was collared into
the stretch and faltered. WRIGLEY RESERVE saved ground behind the leaders and proved empty in the stretch. RUBIDOR raced wide down the
backstretch and weakened steadily. The stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run and the third finisher claimed foul against the second finisher for
interference in the stretch but the result was allowed to stand.

Footnotes
FINALIST was reluctant to load, came over a bit nearing the first turn, then vied outside for the lead, took over on the backside, drew clear, responded when
roused and was kept to the task. TEXTPECTATION raced three wide early, settled off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn and rallied inside for
second. SOCIAL GROUP vied inside for the early lead, then tracked the winner, chased on the far turn and was outfinished for the place spot. LONG GRAY
LINE was in tight nearing the first turn and steadied, then raced off the pace, failed to threaten and improved his position in the stretch. ICY STORM raced
two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and faded. MERU raced off the pace inside and did not factor. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of
LONG GRAY LINE against TEXTPECTATION was dismissed.

Footnotes
BOOK MARKER settled off the dueling leaders, advanced inside, came in at the top of the stretch, was straightened and was up in time. FULL CONTACT
dueled along the rail on the backstretch, shook loose on the turn, extended lead then was nailed nearing the wire. BLUEY outrun early inside, split rivals in
the stretch and finished well too late. GAMERUN raced wide within striking range and finished willingly. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE saved ground,
steadied in tight at the top of the stretch then went evenly. MILAGROSO chased outside and lacked a rally. BADBADBOBBY dropped far behind and was
never in contention. SKYHOOK forced the pace to midway on the turn and stopped abruptly. CONNECTING raced wide in midpack early then weakened
steadily. STEVIE T lagged far behind and trailed throughout. A claim of foul by the fifth finisher against the winner for interference at the top of the stretch
was dismissed.

Footnotes
MAKABIM settled well behind, advanced strongly inside then surged away in the stretch while ridden out. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) prompted the pace, led
narrowly at the quarter pole then proved no match for the winner. CITY RAGE saved ground close up, angled out in the stretch and came again for the
show. AWESOME LAUNCH hustled to the front inside, lost the lead at the quarter pole and came up empty in the lane. HENRYTHETHIRD reserved off the
pace outside, bid on the final turn then faltered. WIZARD SERRAT broke out at the start, fanned very wide on the first turn and was outrun. MOLIERE trailed
to the stretch then passed fading rivals. THE TWINS SNEAKERS chased off the pace and gave way readily. CARTIER CAT raced off the leaders in the two
path and stopped.

OLYMPIC ROMP prompted the pace, collared the pacesetter, vied through the stretch and held on gamely to the wire. VINE JET controlled the pace,
dueled through the stretch and battled to the finish in a determined effort. MIDNIGHT ACT urged close up outside, faded on the final turn then continued
willingly. MY REDEMPTION raced off the pace in the two path then split foes with late energy. KINGSVILLE saved ground close up then flattened out in the
stretch. YES SIR COLONEL lacked speed, angled wide on the final turn but had no kick.

Footnotes
LAYTOWN vied two wide for the early lead, took over to set the pace, dueled with THIRSTY PAPPY passing the quarter pole, responded when asked,
shook clear again and then pulled away under urging. THIRSTY PAPPY vied inside for the early lead, then tracked LAYTOWN, re bid outside of that rival
nearing the quarter pole, dueled into the stretch, dug in, was no match, then stayed on well for the place spot. RERALLY raced four wide early, stalked
outside a rival, chased on the far turn and finished evenly. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, weakened and
held on for fourth. CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED steadied entering the clubhouse turn, settled off the pace, chased on the far turn and gained belatedly inside.
SUPREME BEING broke a step slow, was outrun early, moved up four wide on the far turn and passed tired rivals. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS raced off the
pace inside and failed to threaten. MADISON LUVS DUKE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. BATTER UP BUD raced off the rail, off the pace and
was outrun.
