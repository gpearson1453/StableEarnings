Footnotes
ROAD SLEW settled off the pace about the three path, left the second turn outside and picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the four path, dug in under steady handling for the lead past mid-stretch and drew away later yards. SIMPLY JACK closed to contention about the
five path the first turn and took the nod two deep into the backstretch, dueled clear at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but was
caught inside the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. LEG UP stalked off the rail, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the
far turn then flattened leaving the eighth pole. MOON SIGN settled off the pace about the four path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. MEETMARYSMAN settled back in the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then
flattened off the rail on the far turn. RUSH TO CANDY saved early ground and showed little response through the backstretch. PRINCIPE raced well back.
GREAT KOSTAS rated a slim early lead inside, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, but faded toward the far turn. MY SLICK NICK
was eased after a quarter mile and walked off post race.

Footnotes
ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS chased through the backstretch, came through the turn about the four path, was carried outward into the lane but dueled for the
lead nearing mid-stretch and held on well. TAPPEDWITHSUCCESS ducked in and made contact with BAYTOWN ADMIRAL leaving the gate then gave
chase, rounded the turn about the four path, eased to the outside entering the stretch and dug in to take second at the sixteenth pole. The latter was
bumped leaving the gate then rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, raced off the rail on the turn, drifted entering the
stretch, was met mid-stretch and weakened. SOUTHERN SAINT gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the
stretch. KURUMI GO GO gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. MEXICAN KRYPTONITE bobbled leaving the gate, gave
chase and rounded the turn about the four path. IPNOPS saved ground.

the far turn and held well under steady handling. SUMMERTIME ROSE raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and
rounded the far turn in the five path, cleared second mid-stretch and finished evenly. HONEYCAMP stalked from the four path the opening turn, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to a slim brief lead midway on the far turn then flattened stride nearing mid-stretch. NANA'S BOOPA broke
awkwardly then surged to the front and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far

while between horses early, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
C R'S UNCLE LINO rated just off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started his bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then
angled three wide into the stretch, dueled for the lead at the sixteenth pole and edged clear the final yards. PENGUIN PARADE took over while angling to
the inside and rated the pace, kept the edge over JUBA'S HAT TRICK leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage off the rail on the far turn
but gave up the lead mid-stretch and relented later yards. The latter stalked inside, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested near even
terms at the rail on the far turn, remained a factor through the upper stretch but weakened the final sixteenth. SISYPHUS saved ground, gave chase leaving
the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then eased out leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride mid-stretch. VAGABOND VIRGIN was
jostled leaving the gate and raced off the rail the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path, eased out leaving the turn but weakened in the lane. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY broke in and made contact with Vagabond Virgin then
settled in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. LORD OF CORK veered outward and made
contact with Vagabond Virgin leaving the gate then stalked from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three
path on the far turn and weakened in the lane.
