Footnotes
EAST WING pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and held clear to the wire. MURUMBI raced at the back of
the pack early, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and gained ground steadily to the finish. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH raced in the middle
of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position in the lane. NURSE JUDY dueled on the
outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and weakened in the final furlong. WILD LOOKER raced off the pace early, saved
ground around the bend and passed tiring horses from there. AUBURN raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
two path and never threatened. FAST COREY dueled on the inside through the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path and faded in the lane.
SO MOXIE raced off the pace betweeen horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid. TWIRLING GRACE trailed
the field throughout, came around the turn in the three path and was never a factor.
