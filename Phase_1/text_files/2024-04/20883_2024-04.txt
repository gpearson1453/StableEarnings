early wide and lacked a response. SAPONARA dueled the winner along the rail for half a mile and faltered. MARISA'S MISSION stalked the dueling leaders

Footnotes
EVOLUTIONARY showed good early speed to set the pace, responded when roused, dug in gamely inside of CONFISCATED in the stretch drive and
determinedly held off that rival. CONFISCATED tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, angled out, rallied outside of the winner entering the stretch, dug
in gamely outside in the final furlong and dueled to the finish. PRINCE COLTON raced off the early pace, clipped heels and stumbled at the half mile
marker, the rider lost his balance and quickly recovered, continued two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside for third.
LUCKY LINUS brushed the gate, then stalked outside, came three wide into the lane and was outfinished for third. OMAHA EIGHT was outrun early while
two wide and did not factor. UNIWINNER steadied after the start, raced off the pace with an inside trip and lacked a rally. I NEVER SAY NEVER was outrun
inside. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of PRINCE COLTON against CONFISCATED, the race was declared official.

MISTER B dueled three wide, took over nearing the quarter pole and edged away under steady handling. FUEGO SOS settled behind trio of duelers, moved
wide on the turn then made a gradual late gain. PLEASANT DREAMS lacked speed, swerved in racing greenly in the stretch and finished willingly. THE
GRAYT PUMPKIN hustled up to duel inside to midway on the turn and faltered. UNCLE GEORGY broke slowest and raced far back inside and was no
factor. HERO'S SPIRIT vied between rivals to the quarter pole and stopped.

ANGELIC GAL vied briefly, moved clear before the half, raced well off the inside in the stretch and held rival safe. FAST MULE close up outside, went after
the winner on the final turn and proved second best. SIRENETTA lagged far behind then offered some late energy. LULI'S DANCER broke sluggishly and
trailed early then narrowed the gap late. BULLET ON TAP prompted the pace inside for half a mile and retreated. APPEALINGTOTHE EYE chased within
striking range early then gave way readily. ISTRIA saved ground and began stopping after a quarter mile. CINNAMON DREAM was bumped about at the
start unseating her rider.

Footnotes
COALVILLE stalked the loose pacesetter, collared that foe on the final turn, dueled then edged clear in the final furlong. FREEDOM EAGLE controlled the
pace inside, was challenged by winner on the final turn, resisted and continued gamely. BIG ERN MCCRACKEN prompted the leaders three wide, flattened
out in the stretch but came again for the show. TRICOLOUR saved ground off the pace, angled out in the stretch and went evenly late. SKY'S NO LIMIT
chased in the two path then inside and lacked a rally. HUMBLE JOE stumbled at the start and lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. NEW SPELL
broke sluggishly, made a brief bid after half a mile then faded. FUNSTRUCK dropped back early outside and weakened steadily.

off the inside, moved briefly clear on the turn, was collared then weakened. SNAPPY RIDE dropped back early outside, was urged wide then went evenly
late. WICKED SIGHT lacked speed, saved ground throughout and failed to respond. R FUNNY BIZNESS flashed speed wide down the backstretch and
gave way. DWELLER led narrowly along the inside early then stopped in the stretch. NOISY ON THE BAY injured herself in the starting gate and was
