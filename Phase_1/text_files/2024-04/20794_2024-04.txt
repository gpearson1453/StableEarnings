Footnotes
LAPIS LAZULI was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn, then once clear dropped towards the inside
entering the lane and drew off to prove much the best while being ridden out. WRANGLERED was well placed early on the inside, eased off the inside on
the turn and was two wide by the quarter pole, angled out off the turn and rallied well for the place to be clearly second best. TRAPPE VALLEY chased the
early pace on the inside, shifted out and made a four wide move on the turn but could not sustain that bid while besting the rest. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR was
away alertly to set the early pace on the inside and weakened. FIRE EXTINGUISHER was settled early and four wide on the turn and offered no rally.

OKIE CODE was well rated on the inside, came two wide off the turn and closed well to get up in time to prove best under a drive. STONE COLD LOVER
tracked the early pace from between rivals, swung out five wide leaving the turn, drifted out a bit and then finished well and led late but missed. CHOJO
dueled for the lead two wide, made a bid in hand to shake clear and then drifted out in the lane and faded late. CHROME RACER was off slowly, reserved
on the inside and then had a belated rally. JILL'S LEMON DROP dueled for the lead on the inside then weakened in the lane. PAGEANT PURRFECT
stalked the early pace from the outside and was four wide on the turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
FLAT HANBY was bumped at the start, rated and was four wide on the turn, made a bid leaving the quarter pole and hit the front nearing the furlong marker
and drew clear to prove best under crop urging. PONZA was reserved early, advance four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide off the turn and finished
well. MEGA SHACK pressed the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, gained a short lead leaving the turn but faded in the final furlong,
bested the rest. LIGHT THE CODE chased the early pace, angled out leaving the furlong marker and improved late for the minor rewards. DETERMINED
LOVER pressed the pace on the inside and weakened. ELUSIVE POWER hopped at the start, then rushed up to set a pressured pace two wide and then
weakened the final furlong. HE'S ALL EARS was settled early and dropped back. DAKOTA MARVIN failed to menace.
