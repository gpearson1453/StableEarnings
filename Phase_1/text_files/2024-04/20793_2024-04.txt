CREATIVE BID raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and got
up for the win in late stretch. NOTACRY raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the bend, began a bid entering the stretch and dueled
to the wire to narrowly miss. ROUGE SUNSET chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the two path and kept
on to the finish. MIGHTY TIGER trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane. QUEENS
EFFORT tracked the leader on the outside through the early going, came around the bend in the three path and weakened in the stretch. THIRSTY led the
way up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the turn and faded in the lane.

DIAMOND RIM stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the bend and gained ground late to get up
for the win. MINISTER OF SOUL pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, dueled in the lane and was
caught late. PRAYER OF JABEZ led the way on the inside early, navigated the bend from the three path and dueled in the stretch but was caught late.
WINDRIBBON tracked the leader on the inside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the two path and kept on to the finish. TONY'S
TAPIT raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and showed no kick. TRUTH SEEKER raced off the pace
on the outside through the opening quarter, swung out to the six path coming around the turn and never threatened. RONAMO trailed the field throughout,
raced in the two path around the bend and was never a factor.

drew off in the lane. DON'T TELL HYDEE bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the five path and improved position in the stretch. DODROPIN chased the leader on the inside early, continued around
the turn in the three path and kept on to the wire. MARY WALKER bumped with horse to her inside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly. WORKIN NINETOFIVE raced off the pace early, swung out to the
six path coming around the bend and never threatened. FOLK HERO stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend
and weakened in the lane. MAMALONA tracked the leader on the outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the four path and faded in
