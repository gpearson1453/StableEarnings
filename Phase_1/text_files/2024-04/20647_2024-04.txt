Footnotes
MISSNEVERSATISFIED raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide bid and proved the best late. OUR GAL
LAYLA shot to the front, saved ground around the turn, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. GETOUTOFDAWAY lacked early
speed, gained ground late, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. FITZY broke out, pressed the pace, made a bid and hung down the
stretch. STEPHANIE'S MARIA raced evenly near the middle of the field, finished inside and was no factor. KAT'S PRINCESS vied for the early lead, saved
ground and faded. BROADWAY STAR lacked early speed, entered the home stretch wide and was never a threat. OCEAN JET pressed the early pace,
took the lead around the turn, racing four wide and faded. ROCKER WAY EMPRESS trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
CAJUN CONNECTION pressed the pace, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, rallied down the lane and proved the best. STONE
ALLIANCE raced within striking distance, made a late outside bid and closed well. TOTALLY ADDICTED lacked early speed, made a steady gain, made a
bid, took the lead at the 3/4 pole, couldn't match strides with CAJUN CONNNECTION and was caught late for second. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN lacked
early speed, improved position, but was no factor. MAIN DUDE pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and faded down the lane. JIMMIE'S
HALO void of early speed and was never a threat. THE THREE KS went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and dropped back. SMART ANALYSIS
raced within contention and made a steady retreat.

Footnotes
RAISE THE ALARM went to the front, droved clear, led throughout, pulled away and proved much the best. FAYE L. bothered at the start, getting in tight
quarters, raced in the rear in the beginning, gained ground and was a clear second at the wire. MY IDEA broke out, bumped rival, racing in the back, gained
ground late and was a clear third. LONG LEGGED LADY broke in, bumped rival, pressed the pace and weakened. FIVE LEAF CLOVER showed early
speed and faded. SHEZA HOT STORM lacked early speed and was never a factor. WICKED SAINT early try but was no factor late. TRUTHRDAAR in the
middle early, dropped back and was no threat.

Footnotes
FREEFORM vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drove clear down the lane and was kept to the task. JESS'S RAINBOW lacked early
speed, made a steady gain, couldn't catch the winner, but got up for second. ILIMITADA challenged for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout
and was caught for second. CAT B CAUSE void of early speed, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide gain, but was no factor. KATIES
FACTOR pressed the pace and weakened. BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY broke sharp, faded and was no threat late. CHARMING KAT raced near the middle
of the field and was never a factor. WILLAMINA raced within striking distance, saved ground and faded. TERRI GOT A FRIEND raced evenly near the back
and showed little. BEAT THE DOUBLE always raced near the back and was outrun. SECRET MELODY raced in the middle of the field, came around the
turn on the outside, pulled up down the home stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
JUMPIN JUDY vied for the early lead, followed LOVELYREDSTILETTOS in the early going, moved up around the turn, pulled away under strong urging and
proved the best. NONEYA unhurried in the beginning, made a late rally, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. GRACIE DIAMOND raced
near the back in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN pressed the early
pace, raced outside around the turn and faded. LOVELYREDSTILETTOS sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and tired. ROCKETS SISTER
lacked early speed and was never close.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM MOXIE pressed the pace, took the lead around the turn, drove clear and finished well. TALKABOUT raced near the back in the beginning,
moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide gain and was a clear second at the wire. MADELYN'S HIT raced within contention, came around the
turn four wide, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. MIDNIGHT CIGARETTE broke sharp, saved ground around the turn and faded. OUR
BOSS LADY raced evenly near the middle of the field and lacked a late kick. ARTIE'S DEAL lacked early speed and was never a threat. STRAIGHT
MEADOW showed early speed and made a steady retreat. LIBYA broke poorly and was never close.
