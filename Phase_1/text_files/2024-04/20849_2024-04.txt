QUICK FINISH stalked paced two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid widest into the lane, responded strongly to drive
past rival late. SIR LAUGHALOT chased leader off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, bid three wide in the lane, briefly lead
passing the sixteenth, and outdueled late by outside closing rival. HOT PURSUIT showed brief speed leaving the chute, unable to keep up with determined
rival, stalked pacesetter along the rail, continued saving ground thru the turn and into the lane, asked and made mild late progress while lacking room late.
DIVINELY DIVERSE sent for the lead, got mild pace pressure early but quickly cleared, entered turn clear, drifted towards rail and nearly hitting the rail,
stopped to a crawl and quickly inhaled by rivals. EPIC DRAMA leaned back and came away a length slow, settled off the pace and off the rail on the
backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and into the lane, mild urging in the lane and failed to threaten.
