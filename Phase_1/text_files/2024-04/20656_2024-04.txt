drove clear. CAJUN CYCLONE showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. POUND OUT A
DEAL went to the front, drove clear, came around the turn three wide and lacked a late kick. LEISURELY raced within contention, eased back, showed late
interest, but was no factor. ROCKING TOBE raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and weakened. KNIGHT'S GOLD vied for the
early advantage and faded. MO'Z STAR L RANSOM raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. MY DAD'S GUITAR broke in, void of early speed
and was never close. PUPPETEER lacked early speed, was bumped down the home stretch and showed little. HUDSON'S DAY void of early speed and
was outrun. SO MANY STORIES bumped at the start, racing near the back, moved up, faded down the stretch, lost rider and was vanned off.

Footnotes
MAGIC MONDAY pressed the pace, moved up around the turn, rallied, racing four wide down the lane and was going away at the end. LOVE A FIGHTER
broke a step slow, quickly rushed up, pressed the early pace, eased back, made a late gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. IDE
LIKE HAWAII raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, made an inside bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show.
JOSEPH H vied for the early advantage, took the lead around the turn and lacked a late kick. DOCE DE LA NOCHE lacked early speed, showed late
interest, but was no real factor. PARTY GRAS raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a rally. FIFTYFIVE STRONG void of early
speed and was never a threat. STRAY CAT STRUT raced evenly near the back and showed little. UNBRIDLED PULPIT lacked early speed and was outrun.
ANGOLA VACATION always raced near the back and put forth a dull effort. BUD WON vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, faded, came
in down the stretch and was done. ADMIRAL AFLEET lacked early speed, clipped heels down the home stretch, fell lost rider, walked off.

LAGOON vied for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear and was kept to the task. MISSED THE BOAT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout,
proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. NOT ON HERB dueled on the front end, weakened and proved no match for the top two. SILVER
WINGS lacked early speed, made a mild bid and was outfinished for third. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE raced evenly near the back, entered the stretch six wide
and was never a threat. HIGHLY PERFECT always raced near the back and was outrun. MIDNIGHT FIRE showed early speed and dropped back.

Footnotes
FREE DROP ROB vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took command and held on well for the win. TAYSOM hesitated at the start, racing in
the back, moved up on the inside around the turn, got through on the rail and gained ground. MY UNCLE BILLY raced near the back in the beginning, came
around the turn on the outside, gained ground and was a clear third. BENISSIMO raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, made a
mild bid, but was no real factor. ROCKY BOY raced near the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. ROCKALL pressed the early pace and faded.
CHASING CHAYSE broke through the gates, always raced near the back and showed little. ASTROLOGY WONOWON dueled on the front end, saved
ground and dropped back. VESTMENT pressed the early pace, dropped back and was outrun. YOCKEY DOODLEDANDY raced near the middle of the
field, retreated and trailed late.
