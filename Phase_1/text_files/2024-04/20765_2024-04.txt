PASSAGE OF LINES set his own uncontested early pace along the inside and held well to be clear late under steady handling. STREET GLIDE dropped
back off the early pace advanced into the far turn, raced five deep from the outside of rivals near the quarter pole and rallied well for the place position.
AZURE SKY tracked the early leader two deep from the outside, dug in through the drive to keep on for the show placing. GUILLAUME rated along early,
raced near the rail past the quarter pole, eased out into the upper stretch to race three deep and was even late with no closing run. GREYZER raced four
wide around both the turns and needed more in the drive. SIR LUMPALOT was allowed to settle early, saved ground and had no late rally. SHANE'S
JEWEL rated along three deep from the outside and gave way in the drive. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY raced in tight quarters around the first turn, raced with
the second flight early, was four deep past the quarter pole and never threatened. NO MORE DEBT raced mid pack early, had an inside run and lacked a
bid.

WHISKEY N SODA settled off the early pace to race in hand, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, raced five wide in the stretch and finished well to
edge up under strong handling. ARROW SPEED stalked the pace, challenged the leader two deep from outside near the five sixteenths pole, led narrowly
mid stretch and missed in a game effort. SALACIOUS showed good early foot to set the pace near the inside, challenged for the lead near the five
sixteenths pole and gave way grudgingly late. MAIN BEACH stalked the pace, hard ridden into the far turn, raced two to three wide and weakened through
the drive. ROSSO tracked the early leader from the inside and gave way. WHISKEY OR WINE dropped to the rear early, four deep near the quarter pole
and had no rally while racing from the outside in the stretch.

Footnotes
BASSANIO (GB) rated three wide from the outside of rivals, dug between while exchanging bumps with Swing Low, jockey of Swing Low claimed objection
for interference and stewards ruled no change, Basanio edged up in a determined run. SWING LOW was unhurried early on, advanced into the far turn,
loomed four wide near the quarter pole, bumped soundly in the stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. THE PENINSULA pressed the early leader two deep,
led and gave way to the top pair grudgingly. ARTIE'S ANGEL stalked the pace, raced from the inside around the far turn, shifted three deep in the stretch
and moved up to improve position. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE dropped back off the early pace, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. WAR
BEAT set a pressured early pace near the rail and faded in the drive. ANALOGY settled off the early going, swung five to six wide in the stretch and had no
late rally. WORLDS ON HIGH had an inside run and no late response.

the early pace from the inside, had a clear lead near the eighth pole, dug in late and missed in a game effort. D'LIGHTFUL SUMMER was off slowly, raced
near the back of the pack early, raced five wide in the stretch run and moved up to improve posistion. MAIDEN LANE stalked the pace, raced four wide into

wide near the quarter pole, five deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. ASAMATTEROFFACTIDO was off slowly, saved ground and had no late
