Footnotes
SPECIAL TAP broke a step slow, quickly rushed up, pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, took the advantage around the turn and drove clear
down the lane. MICHAEL'S MOON vied for the early lead, raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but just held on for second. THE
PETITIONER unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, angled inside, made a bid down the lane and missed second.
MALADJUSTED MISFIT went to the front, was forwardly placed throughout and weakened late. ITZCOATL lacked early speed, moved up, but was no
factor. RITE ON SAM raced evenly near the back, came around the turn on the outside, finished wide and was no threat. COUNTRY CHOICE vied for the
early lead, raced outside around the turn and faded. WINONESOON void of early speed and was never close.

DUMBSTRUCK broke out, raced near the back, moved up down the backside on the rail, lacked running room, angled to the outside around the turn, made
a wide rally and pulled away, proving the best. FIRST CLASS HARLOW broke in, raced in the middle of the field, made a bid, took the lead at the 1/2 pole,
proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. DUSTIN THE DIAMOND lacked early speed, made a late gain and got up for third. LITTLE ROCKY
raced within striking distance, made a bid at the 3/4 pole and hung on the inside down the lane. ZIPPY TOGA void of early speed, showed late interest, but
was no factor. SOUTH SIDE bumped and pinched back at the start, racing in the rear and passed tired ones. KING OF CONTRABAND pressed the early
pace and faded. THREE GOLD PIECES raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. SPEIGHTFUL ONE dueled on the front end, saved ground and
dropped back. ELLS challenged for the early lead, racing outside around the first turn and retreated.

FAMILY CREED broke in, bumped, raced in the middle of the field, made a bid around the turn, entered the stretch wide, rallied and drove clear before the
wire. CUSTOM STAR vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. TUCKER THE
GRUMP raced within striking distance, entered the home stretch wide, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. HALF CRAZY broke out,
checked, racing near the back, showed late interest, but was no factor. CLEVER PRINCE raced near the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort.
STORMIN SUNDAY was bumped and bothered at the start and never raced near the front. PAC THE PULPIT bumped and bothered at the break and was
never a threat. WESTERN STAR raced within contention and dropped back. REGINALD AURELIUS dueled on the front in the beginning and was finished
early.
