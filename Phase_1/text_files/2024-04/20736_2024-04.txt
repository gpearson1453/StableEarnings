Footnotes
SHE'S SPLENDID brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked in the three path, pressed before gaining an advantage leaving the three furlong pole, led
into upper stretch, dug in to resist an inner challenge in the final furlong and held firm. GREYHOUND STATION brushed with an inner foe at the start,
prompted along the inside, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, awaited racing room two wide and between horses turning for home, tipped in for clear
rail sailing nearing the lane, bid inside of the leader in the final furlong but was kept at bay. XTRA EXTRAORDINARY trailed in the four path, gained outside
of rivals around the turn to be within striking entering the lane, but leveled off and chased the top pair home. LYNNA broke slowly, yet shifted out and rushed
forward to lead leaving the chute, showed the way two wide before tucking to the inside nearing the turn, but was headed leaving the three furlong pole and
weakened readily.

Footnotes
MONSIEUR CANDY broke sharply, showed the way along the inside, kicked away from chasing rivals in upper stretch and held sway safely. BEER RUN
broke well before rating back to track from midpack in the three path into the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, rallied to reach place leaving the
furlong grounds and slowly closed the gap on the leader late. BOLT ACTION laid off of the pace in the four path, then rallied in the six path while hanging on
his left lead to gain show at the sixteenth pole. COWBOY CACHE laid off of the pace in the five to seven path, shifted in in midstretch before taking light
contact from an inner rival at the sixteenth pole and moved up. ROYAL CAROL brushed with an outer rival approaching the half mile pole, stalked along the
inside, claimed place at the three sixteenths pole, but lost that position to an outer bidder leaving the furlong grounds, leaned out subtly shorty after and
gave wy. DON CORLEONE pressed two wide, but yielded in upper stretch, shied from an inner rival in the final furlong and faded. BALTIMORE HEART
brushed with an inner foe nearing the half mile pole, raced forward two to three wide and between horses, but steadied and altered course when bothered
by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, and lacked a bid. GOLDENTOWN lacked speed in the three path, fanned out to the nine path in upper stretch and
failed to menace. TOO FRACING LUCKY saved ground well back, but to no avail. STEEL LINK stalked in the four path, floated to the six path into upper
stretch and weakened. MAINTAIN broke a step slow, got rank between horses and took back at the start, trailed in the two path and got outrun. KING
HAZELTON was brushed between horses then checked back at the half mile pole, laid off of the pace in the two path and faded.

WUPKAR showed the way a path off of the inside, met an outer challenge turning for home, shook free of that one in upper stretch and lasted late. ABITIBI
bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked thee wide and from the four path, bid turning for home to vie entering the lane, but was turned away in upper
stretch, kept on well through the final furlong to close in on the leader once again, but ran out of ground late. ATLANTIC STRIKE bumped an outer rival at
the start, tracked along the inside, paused waiting for racing room around the turn, tipped to vie for show in the three to four path entering the lane and ran
on evenly. STAND BY YOU laid off of the pace in the three to four path, inched closer around the turn, vied for show in the five path entering the lane and

under a drive through midstretch, then was put to hand to cruise past the leading pair in the closing stages. HOLD MY BOURBON took contact from an
outer rival at the start, stalked the embattled leading pair from the inside around the turn, tipped outside of them at the three sixteenths pole, bid at the
furlong grounds, led narrowly while attempting to lug in entering the final sixteenth but was caught late. RUN JALEN RUN prompted four wide early on,
dueled for the lead two wide around the turn, wrestled a short advantage entering the lane, vied between horses as an outer bidder joined the fray in
midstretch, got headed by that one at the sixteenth pole, fought on but got outkicked late. SIZE LORD dueled inside of a rival around the turn, got headed
entering the lane, fought on through midstretch but gave way with a sixteenth to go. ADRIFT broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two to three path,
shfited five wide entering the lane and stayed on. EL PELIGRO broke inwardly and bobbled at the start, pursued from midpack in the four path and lacked a
bid. RUNAWAY JOKE bumped an inner rival and took contact from an outer foe at the start, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, steadied in tight
at the nine sixteenths pole, chased from midpack along the inside around the turn and failed to threaten. LEBOMBO was outrun along the inside. KNICKS
HERO broke in at the start, prompted three wide and between horses before dropping back nearing the turn, chased two wide and between horses around
the bend then weakened. OUTA JAIL ON BAIL steadied between horses with eleven sixteenths to go, then failed to factor from the three path.

Footnotes
EMERY brushed with an inner rival leaving the five furlong pole, stalked along the inside under a firm grasp around the turn, smoothly tipped outside of the
leader to take aim entering upper stretch, saddled up to that one under confident handling and the furlong grounds and kicked away under mild urging.
RHAPSODY showed the way tucking to the inside into the turn, but was no match for an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and was well clear of show.
SHE'S COOL pressed two wide, but got floated three wide entering upper stretch, yielded yet held show from an inner bidder late. CALLE AMADA broke
slowly, rushed forward before running up on horses' heels at the five furlong pole, brushed with an outer rival and steadied back leaving that station, saved
ground off of the pace around the turn, progressed inside to bid for show in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. THESE APPLES tracked three wide, but
faded four wide and between horses in upper stretch. YUMA'S SHADOW broke slowly and drifted out at the start, raced off of the pace four to five wide and
gave way.

OCEANIC settled off of the pace two wide, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. JUST MIGHT
set a clear pace in the two path, held sway through midstretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth and held place. AXTHELM pursued from midpack in the
two path into the turn, rallied shifting four to six wide while among foes in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed in the photo for show. WINFROMWITHIN
stalked along the inside, chased around the turn, then ran on evenly but missed in the photo for show. AMBIVALENT laid well back in the three path, fanned
out to the eight path in upper stretch and rallied to miss reaching show. CHERUBIC FACTOR tracked two wide and between horses and ran on evenly
among foes in the final furlong. MARK OF THE Z stalked the leader from the three path, chased that one whlie hanging on his left lead and drifting out in
upper stretch, got outkicked for place in the final furlong and yielded between horses. GENTLE SOUL broke slowly, raced at the rear in the four path, floated
out to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to factor. LET MY PEOPLE GO steadied when put to tight quarters between horses at the start, raced off of
the pace three wide, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and faded. OLYMPIC RUNNER trailed along the inside, entered the lane in the five path and got

Footnotes
CAGLIOSTRO prompted the leader from the three path, led into the far turn, tucked to the two path clearing turning for home, was confronted by an outer
challenger in the final sixteenth, dug in gamely and held firm. DREAMLIKE stalked from the two path, tipped three wide to take aim on the leader nearing the
lane, chased that one through midstretch, closed in to bid in the final sixteenth but missed. BRIGADE COMMANDER set the pace inside of the eventual
winner, got headed approaching the far turn, sustained inside pressure until the quarter pole, but gave way and saved show late. HAVILDAR laid off of the
pace in the two path, pursued under urging around the far turn and ran on to miss reaching show. SINGLE DOT YAHT laid off of the pace in the three path,
then along the inside around the far turn and failed to factor. GLEN AIRY tracked in the four path and gave way. GAME WARDEN trailed in the three to two
paths and made little impact. EGON leaned in at the start requiring the rider to take a firm hold of the right rein, tracked in the three path and between
horses before backing out entering the backstretch, pursued from the four path around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
RAGING SEA broke a bit outwardly at the start, tracked from the two path, tipped three wide turning for home to take aim on the new leader, bid outside of
that one entering the lane and drove clear. HIDDEN CONNECTION prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, wrestled a narrow advantage
with five sixteenths to go, inched clear shortly after, but was bested by an outer bold-bidding rival in upper stretch, then kept on well to safely manage place.
SCYLLA pursued from midpack two wide and between horses early on, came under urging while off of the pace in the two path around the far turn,
sustained stride shifting to the three path in upper stretch and stayed on to edge show in the late stages. LOVED hopped slightly at the start, yet recovered
to show the way inside of a prompting rival, got headed by that one with five sixteenths to go, gave way nearing the lane and lost show late. QUEEN OF
MISSOULA broke a beat slow and steadied back when an inner rival took her path at the start, trailed in the three path, swung out to the five to six path
entering upper stretch and moved up. SADDLE UP JESSIE raced off of the pace in the four to five path around the first turn, pursued under urging in the
four path around the far turn before drifting to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. CURL GIRL stalked outside of the top pair and from the four
path, chased in the three path and between horses around the far turn, then faded.

Footnotes
NORTHERN INVADER showed the way in the four to two path around the first turn, led in hand around the far turn and kicked away in upper stretch.
BELOUNI (FR) brushed an outer rival into the first turn before settling off of the pace in the two path, pursued in the four path around the far turn, rallied in
the five path entering the lane, gained place leaving upper stretch and chased the leader home to prove second best. NOISES OFF prompted between
horses before checking back to track three wide around the first turn, pressed turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader before losing place at
the three sixteenths pole, then fended off an inner challenger for show. WONDERFUL JUSTICE (GB) prompted along the inside before switching two wide
to stalk outside of the leader entering the backstretch, failed to sustain pressing position between horses around the far turn, yet kept on to vie for show with
an outer rival in the final furlong, but was denied. SCOOBIE QUANDO took contact from an inner rival and was forced into an outer foe at the start, then was
brushed between horses into the first turn, laid off of the pace in the four to three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane and stayed on. LOYAL
COMPANY was bumped between horses at the start, laid well back in the two path, steadied when an inner rival drifted across his lane in the four path at
the three sixteenths pole, and moved up. WICKED FINN was brushed by an inner rival into the first turn, pursued from the five to four path, within striking
range around the far turn then faded between horses. BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES broke a step slow and brushed with and outer rival before being bumped
by an inner foe and steadying back at the start, trailed along the inside and made little impact. DHABAB (IRE) bumped an outer rival at the start, pulled while
rank and hard to handle among foes approaching the first turn, pursued two to three wide and between horses, then faded. CHIRON pursued from midpack
along the inside, pulled behind rivals entering the backstretch, chased around the far turn and faded.
