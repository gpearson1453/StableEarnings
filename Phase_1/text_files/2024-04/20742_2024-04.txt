Footnotes
BERT'S PROSPECT reserved in the two path at the back, content to trail into the far turn, looked to gain on the far turn but ran into traffic, swung out past
the quarter pole, drifted in while rallying to the front at the sixteenth pole and edged clear. VODKA VODKA stalked inside a pair of rivals to the far turn,
tipped out to the two path around that bend, challenged between foes midstretch but got bothered by the winner drifting over at the sixteenth pole and kept
on for the place. RHINO dueled for the lead from inside early, ceded command to outer rival leaving the clubhouse turn, closest in pursuit leaving the
backstretch, bid two wide and took over at the quarter pole, put away inner rival into the stretch, confronted by a pair of rivals approaching the sixteenth pole
and yielded. DEFENSOR FORTIS dueled from outside then cleared late on the first turn, set the pace to the second bend, challenged by RHINO on the far
turn, relinquished the lead at the quarter pole and retreated. SPECIAL CLUB stalked between rivals in the two path, suffered a minor shuffle RHINO while
boxed in on the backstretch, remained in a bad spot to the far turn, gained a clear path and was roused at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out three wide and
weakened in the stretch run. VOLS stumbled leaving the gate, stalked three deep, got carried wide by the winner past the quarter pole and faded in the
lane.

Footnotes
WHIMSICAL HEIR settled outside rivals, drew closer off the inside through the turn, spun three wide into the lane, swept by the leader at the eight pole and
widened in the final furlong. KEYCHAIN GIRL set the pace under pressure from YO YO MAMA early, cleared that rival early on the turn, confronted by the
winner in upper stretch, offered little resistance and gave up command at the eighth pole, started to shorten in the final sixteenth but managed to hold
second. MACHO QUEEN away well in the beginning then dropped back off the pace, chased three then two wide on the turn, steered out in the lane and
gained third. WARREN'S WILD RIDE chased from inside in mid-pack, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole and kept on for a
minor award. YO YO MAMA prompted the pace from outside early, could not match strides with the leader early on the turn, chased two wide into the lane
and weakened. CROWN OF HOPE was off slow in the beginning, traveled near the back five wide into the turn, quickly moved into the four path and lacked
a rally down the stretch. ZZYZX lacked early speed, trailed along the rail to the stretch, moved out and was never a factor.

Footnotes
THE GIANTS CANDY dueled for the lead off the rail inside a rival then moved inward, cleared outer foe midway around the bend, responded when asked in
the lane and drew off while ridden out to the wire. NAISMITH forwardly placed along the inside, chased on the fence to the stretch, moved out a bit in the
lane, could not make any headway on the winner but was clearly second best. QUAGMIRE MAGIC tracked off the rail then outside a rival into the turn,
rounded the bend two to three wide, steered out in the lane and was along for the show. MOBE TOWN stalked the dueling leaders outside a rival, chased
two wide around the bend, could not produce a bid and got outfinished for third. OUTGUNNED angled in while trailing early then went inside a rival on the
backstretch, saved ground at the back through the turn and failed to menace. DES DOIGTS held a short advantage dueling for the lead from outside,
chased after the winner midway around the bend from the two path and folded in the lane.

Footnotes
JETOVATOR bumped leaving the gate, sped clear to take control then crossed over to the inside, pressured by a pair of rivals around the turn, shook free at
the top of the lane, remained clear under hand urging into deep stretch, given a right handed tap late and held the runner-up at bay. EXULTATION stalked
between rivals up the backstretch, applied pressure still between foes on the turn, lost touch with the leader at the three-sixteenths pole, stayed within range
into deep stretch, came again with a late run but could not get by. DISKO TRIBUTE bumped inner rival at the start, stalked four deep then angled inward,
chased two wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and kept trying to the wire. MYNUMEROUNO (AUS) off alertly then took hold early to settle in
a stalking position three deep, offered a bid three deep on the turn but flattened out in the lane. SEVENTEEN BLACK got crowded and shuffled back at the
start, trailed on the inside into the turn, entered the lane in the two path, tipped out and was not a factor. HOT BOX stalked the leader inside rivals, under a
hold following the pacesetter on the turn before being roused past the quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened.

BIG BUZZ broke a step slow, tucked inside and was content to trail early, inched closer in the middle stages, angled out and advanced outside rivals on the
far turn, spun five wide into the lane, fought three deep into the final furlong and dug in to inched ahead late. ATOMIC DROP away well from inside, rated
along the fence, tipped out into the stretch, challenged MITICO from outside in upper stretch, gained the lead briefly at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked
by the winner in the late stages. MITICO showed the way in the two path into the clubhouse turn then moved inside, pressured from outside into and up the
backstretch, cleared at the five-sixteenths pole, confronted by ATOMIC DROP in upper stretch, relinquished the lead at the sixteenth pole and stayed on for
a game third. ZIMBA WARRIOR settled in the three path, ridden along two wide on the far turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane and improved
position. MIKE OPERATOR raced up close three wide into the first turn, pressed from outside leaving the bend, could not keep up with the leader at the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the stretch run. MASTERMIND chased three wide on both turns and tired when called upon.

Footnotes
POTENTIAL SPAM stalked in the three path then dropped back off the pace, gained around the far turn, spun four wide into the lane, bid three deep at the
eighth pole and proved best late. BIG DRINKER broke a step slow from outside, chased four then three wide on the first turn, moved to mid-pack on the
backstretch, drew closer between rivals, came three wide into the stretch, challenged into the final furlong and got outgamed by the winner. LUTHER PASS
away quickly and went up to duel from outside, inched ahead past the five-sixteenths pole, led clear into the lane, clung to a short lead at the eighth pole
and yielded in deep stretch. SOLDATNA bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, showed early speed and bumped again with AUDIBLE SILENCE early on
the clubhouse turn, dueled inside LUTHER PASS to the second bend, came under a ride to keep up with that rival but lost touch past the quarter pole, then
weakened in the final furlong. TOPPERS WAGER hopped at the start, chased along the rail then two wide early, saved ground through the second bend,
moved off the fence in upper stretch and weakened. CHROME TO RICHES chased four wide through the first turn, came five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. CLASSIC ALPHIE was off slow to begin, went three wide into the first turn then altered in from behind a rival, lagged behind
up the backstretch, trailed three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. TAPIT DOWN coaxed from the gate, climbed two to three wide on the first turn,
drifted into the lane and could not make an impact. AUDIBLE SILENCE bumped leaving the gate, bumped with same foe again and got put in tight along the
rail early on the clubhouse turn, stalked the dueling pair up the backstretch, came three wide into the lane and faded. RUNNING FOR COSI settled inside
well off the pace and failed to get involved.

Footnotes
REBALATION broke a step slow, trailed along the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, swung out at the top of the stretch, flew late from the
middle portion of the track and got up in the shadow of the wire. PHENOM bobbled a bit leaving the gate, went up to duel from inside, cleared outer rival
approaching the five-sixteenths pole, drew away in upper stretch, held a diminished lead still unchallenged with a sixteenth remaining and got nailed in the
closing moments. PALEO'S PRINCESS broke in and bumped, was closest in pursuit of the top pair in the two path, closed in steadily in the final furlong, put
in a late bid and missed second. TEEN DRAMA traveled near the back in the early going, took the turn two wide, steered out at the top of the stretch and
summoned a mild rally. YOLO CALLS got bumped from outside in the beginning, settled outside a rival, took the turn two wide, moved out in upper stretch
and lacked further response. WOODBINE WAY settled along the inside, cornered nicely into the stretch but lacked a rally in the final furlong. UNWRITTEN
CODE sent from the gate and dueled for the lead from outside, failed to keep up with PHENOM around the turn, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and
tired. HAND-TIMED.
