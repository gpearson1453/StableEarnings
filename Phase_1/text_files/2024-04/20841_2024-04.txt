Footnotes
BLACKHALL (IRE) was patiently ridden in fourth place, then third at fence 8, soon second, then passed by WAGNER at fence 16, second again when
WAGNER fell at 17, roused and gave earnest chase after fence 19, drew even with VINTAGE VINNIE at the last fence, driven clear a length mid stretch and
held on by a neck at the wire. SHOOTIST traveled unhurried towards the rear, roused three out, closed, battled through the stretch to gain second.
GOODOLDTIMES (IRE) trailed most of the race, recovered from a poor jump at the 13th fence, roused three fences out, closed and battled through the
stretch. VINTAGE VINNIE (IRE) held a clear lead from start, sometimes by as much as twenty lengths, nearly unseated rider on touch down at fence 10,
recovered, was pursued by closing rivals two fences out, then headed at the final fence and outkicked in the stretch, staying on courageously. ROCKET
STAR RED traveled mid pack, then weakened two fences out. WAGNER (IRE) traveled unhurried in the rear, was ridden to second going to fence 17, then
fell jumping fence 17. ROYAL RUSE traveled in third from the start, then unseated the rider at fence 12. WITHOUTMOREADO (IRE) tracked the pacesetter
in second till unseated the rider at fence nine. MR. FINE THREADS fell at the third fence.
