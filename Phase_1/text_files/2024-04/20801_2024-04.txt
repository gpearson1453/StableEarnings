Footnotes
BONITA DIXIE , urged along well off the inside and chasing the embattled leaders, moved up in the four path and challenged inside foes heading to mid
stretch, took over inside the sixteenth pole and was edging away late under a drive. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES broke sharp and set the pace four to five
wide while taking outside pressure, clung to command while drifting out a bit near mid stretch, straightened away, ceded the lead past the sixteenth marker
but dug in late to save the place. MISS JOANNIE , five to six wide disputing the pace outside CHOCOLATE FRECKLES, could not quite go with that one in
mid stretch but stayed on with effort. X RAY VISION , off the pace, raced in about the four path and to the inside of ROSES FOR SUZZETT into the stretch
but came up empty. ROSES FOR SUZZETT , five wide outside X RAY VISION into the lane, lacked a response.

IL CAPITANO was nudged clear early, set a rated pace off the inside, turned away an outside threat nearing the lane, responded when asked soon after,
opened up while on his left lead and proved best under a drive. DISCRETIONARY DAY stalked the winner four to five wide, ranged up to loom past the
quarter pole, failed to quicken on with the winner past the three sixteenths but kept on with good effort to hold down the place. LAST MARTINI brushed with
an inner rival at the break, lagged far back to the far turn, circled six wide under a ride and closed steadily. SHOT OF A LIFETIME settled off the pace and
outside a rival, angled out leaving the far turn, chased five wide outside runners into the lane but came up empty. TAKE CHARGE CURLY , brushed at the
break, raced four wide into the first turn, gained two wide inside foes past the five sixteenths, chased to mid stretch then flattened out. EL JOY settled
outside a rival, chased four wide between runners nearing the quarter pole, failed to kick on soon into the lane and gave way. A MAN'S MAN stalked inside
a rival early on, chased three wide between runners leaving the five sixteenths then faltered through the drive.

LOCK IT DOWN grabbed command early and set a rated pace towards the inside, responded when set down in upper stretch, wandered outward a bit past
mid stretch, kept on tenaciously after being corrected and denied an inside challenge from HIGHLANDS. HIGHLANDS settled in the clear into the
backstretch while not far back, moved up while saving ground into the far turn, was hemmed in by an outer rival near mid stretch, altered in and finished
gamely. STREET SHADOW , unhurried early, gained four wide outside rivals leaving the half, chased two wide outside HIGHLANDS into the lane, kept that
one pinned in near the eighth pole then was out kicked through the final seventy yards. SINGLE LADY settled off the rail, raced three wide leaving the far
turn, shifted out in mid stretch and churned on. COASTLINE HOTTIE , taken well in hand early while saving ground, bided time to the five sixteenths, swung
well wide for the drive, had its rider lose the whip in upper stretch, moved up some near the sixteenth marker then failed to seriously sustain. UNA
PALABRA , three wide early, moved up some between runners near the half, dropped towards the inner rail with pursuit past the five sixteenths, failed to
kick on in upper stretch and faded. STARLET COLE , four wide outside the winner forcing the early pace, stayed in touch to the far turn, gave futile chase
between runners soon after then tired.

NOW N LATER GATOR , four wide outside TRACK ROBBER vying for command, gained a slim advantage in upper stretch, met an outside challenge from
POWERIZED near the eighth pole, kept on under left handed asks, drifted out late then edged away. POWERIZED stalked the embattled leaders while five
wide, moved up and challenged in mid stretch, fought on past the sixteenth pole then checked sharply when herded out in deep stretch by the drifting
winner. HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE stalked off the rail and to the inside of POWERIZED, shifted out five to six wide while under pressure past the quarter
pole and churned on. A LOT OF VERVE chased off the rail, circled six to seven wide and offered a slight run. TRACK ROBBER moved up to the inside of
horses nearing the half then poked a head in front, battled three wide to the inside of NOW N LATER GATOR around the turn and into the lane, failed to
kick on near the eighth pole and gave way. COY ROY , reluctant to load and unruly behind the gate, gave hard chase while saving ground and weakened
through the drive. CAPALA broke slowly, was urged along off the inside, raced four wide nearing the stretch and came up empty. TWO MORE SHOTS , far
back saving ground, angled three wide for the drive and had belated action. BUDDY'S PAL , inside nearing the lane, was not a factor. DAVID'S FAITH , four
wide, was eased in the drive. There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run involving the top two finishers and an objection by the rider of POWERIZED
against the winner alleging interference in the stretch. No action was taken.

Footnotes
BROOKYS TAPIT , four to five wide stalking the pace, took closer order near the half then bid three deep, vied under rating outside a pair of foes leaving the
three eighths, edged clear after six furlongs, opened up under a drive in mid stretch then was fully extended to prevail. EAST RAND broke slowly then
steadied when put in tight soon after, settled well off the inside then progressed five wide into the far turn, advance five wide with pursuit into the lane, kept
on grinding and just failed to get up between runners. BEL RAGAZZO settled far back and well off the inside, was given the cue nearing the far turn, made a
bold six wide run from the three eighths to the quarter pole, kept on with a steady progression from there and gained outside the top pair. KIRBY DERBY ,
five wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a mild late kick. ITS BIG , off the early pace, moved up to the inside of rivals leaving the far turn, eased out
nearing the lane, shifted back in but lacked the needed finish. MARKSMAN ON TARGET stalked early, raced three to four wide into the lane but came up
empty. AVALON KING bore in at the break, corrected and edged up four wide early to stalk, bid between foes into the far turn, vied briefly, failed to go on
after chasing into the stretch and tired. TIGER BY HIS TAIL cleared early, set the pace off the rail, was joined by a pair of foes nearing the far turn, vied
inside those to about the five sixteenths then tired. MY DAD IS THIRSTY , three wide between horses early, chased to the inside of rivals past the five
eighths then faltered around the final turn.

Footnotes
DEL MAR JERRY moved up two to three wide and joined BUGLER from his inside leaving the five eighths, disputed the pace around the turn, stayed on
near even terms while fighting on past the sixteenth marker then poked a nose in front at the wire. BUGLER cleared early while well off the inside, was
joined by the winner heading to the half mile pole, battled four wide outside that one around the turn and into the lane, maintained a tenuous advantage to
deep stretch but just could not quite hold in a sharp effort. RIVERSIDE chased the dueling leaders, cut the corner making a run into the stretch, had aim
past mid stretch but was out finished. BUCK OWENS lagged off the pace and well off the rail, circled five wide into the stretch, angled wider in the drive and
closed steadily. TEMPTED MISSION chased the leaders five to six wide, raced between runners late but was out kicked. BRADY BOY , urged off the pace,
raced four wide nearing the quarter pole, pursued to the inside of TEMPTED MISSION in mid stretch but came up empty. BUFFETT chased the pace,
shifted in and gave way.

Footnotes
MERINO WOOL hesitated at the break and was away last, regrouped and raced three wide into the first turn, angled towards the rail when moving in hand
nearing the half mile pole, awaited room from the three eighths to the quarter pole and briefly steadied, recovered while staying inside, closed determinedly
under solid handling and to the inside of the dueling leaders, forged to command in deep stretch then prevailed. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE prompted four
then three wide, moved up to bid near the three eighths, forced the issue outside a rival to upper stretch, drew on near even terms while dueling past mid
stretch, appeared to gain a slight advantage past the sixteenth marker then kept on gamely outside the winner. LAKER JET settled off the pace while saving
ground, angled five wide for the drive and rallied. INVINCIBELLA (GB) vied outside a rival and held a slim lead nearing the far turn, maintained the
advantage while dueling inside SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE from the head of the lane, ceded command between horses leaving the sixteenth marker then gave
way grudgingly. GYPSY WIFE , five wide early, moved up four wide outside rivals and stalked into the far turn, had aim while under a ride into the stretch
but came up empty. LADY LANA , forwardly placed around the first turn, was a bit keyed up to the inside of a rival soon into the backstretch, tracked into the
far turn, raced between runners near mid stretch and lacked a solid finish. JACRODRA'S DEVIL vied inside, stayed on willingly to upper stretch then faded.
WARRIOR'S MOON steadied in the opening furlong, raced three wide leaving the far turn and lacked a rally. FLIPLIT , between runners near the three
eighths, lacked a response. PANDEMIC GIRL , off the pace while saving some ground, faded.
