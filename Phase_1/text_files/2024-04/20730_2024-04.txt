Footnotes
ISN'T SHE KHOZY chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to get up in the final jumps to the finish. THAT'STHEFACTJACK broke in at the start bumping LUMENIQUE, dueled briefly with LOOKS FIRST
before taking sole albeit narrow command from the two path, tucked inside into the turn under pressure from her main pace rival throughout, swung four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive, drifted out slightly near the sixteenth marker, then got caught in the final strides to the finish. LOOKS FIRST
broke out at the start, dueled early on with the aforementioned foe before prompting that rival from the outside three then two wide, swung five wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was in the midst of being shaken off when forced to take brief hold near the sixteenth marker as
THAT'STHEFACTJACK drifted out, then weakened in the late stages to the end. LUMENIQUE got bumped at the start by THAT'STHEFACTJACK, chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MAGGIE'S SONG chased along
the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
REMAIN ANONYMOUS settled comfortably on the outside, was roused in the four path on the turn, gained in the five path into upper stretch, took the lead
outside the sixteenth-pole and held off the fast closing runner-up under strong urging. GONE AND FORGOTTEN was urged along well off the pace, shifted
from the rail to the three path on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, rallied outside under the crop into the final furlong and finished fast to just
miss while up for the place. JACKIE THE JOKER was hustled to the front then went clear, extended the advantage late on the backstretch, raced inside to
the two path on the turn, shortened stride into upper stretch, led while tired into the final furlong then was overtaken but held the show. SHESALITTLE
EDGY was hustled from the gate, moved in early then came out outside the three-quarter pole, followed the solo leader, chased that foe in the three path on
the turn, gained four wide into upper stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked. BANK ON
ANNA was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. DOLCE SERA was
slowest into stride then angled in while lacking speed, raced at the rear under urging, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
REMEMBER THE NAME coaxed from the gate, tussled among a quartet early on before emerging under hustling to take sole command, crossed to show
the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and repelled a
challenge a furlong out, inched away briefly and then just held on over his barn mate on the wire. STORMQUIST chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to close in in the final furlong and just missed at the finish. HEARD ON THESTREET away
last despite being coaxed from the start, got coaxed along to advance into striking range into the turn, went three wide through the turn and then four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to issue a bid a furlong out, got rebuffed inside that station and kept on to secure the show honors. DYLAN'S RUBY coaxed from
the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside, came under coaxing near the three-eighths and faded striding a bit green or maybe adverse to facing
some kickback and faded to near the rear when swinging three wide into upper stretch, switched to the correct lead just inside the three-sixteenths, tipped
out a furlong out two path tossing his head and then came again with a mild kick to the finish. RETAIL MAN chased three then two wide until tucked inside
near the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. MAD BANKER coaxed from the
gate, chased along the inside briefly before tipping three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. IN A MINUTE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and weakened.

TETSU broke out and brushed with a foe, settled on the outside under some coaxing, ranged up in the four path on the turn, was roused outside the
quarter-pole, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker, fought on even terms with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under
strong urging. RYAN'S CAT brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled to the front, showed the way while inside of an opponent, vied inside on the
turn, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, led determinedly to near the sixteenth-pole then was caught while well clear
for the place. BEACHWALKER was urged along at the rear, saved ground early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted three wide late on the bend,
came four wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. JAKE ROCKS showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two then
three path on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and came up empty.

PLAY hustled from the gate, cut the pace along the inside through swift splits, had the runner up advance at the three-eighths and dueled with that rival
through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and continued to match strides widening
away to the eighth pole, dug in and gamely prevail by a neck at the end. BETTA GO GO GO broke out at the start trading a bump with POLISH UP, chased
four then three wide down the backstretch before advancing on the leader three furlongs from home, dueled through the latter portion of the turn coaxed
along from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on and fighting on gamely through the stretch to the finish
but was ultimately denied at the end while well clear of the rest and along second best. MR. PAPAGIORGIO struck the near side stall at the start getting
away last and conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors while unable to threaten the top pair. DON VINO VICI chased along the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. MR. GEORGIE coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
GOLD 'N' SCARLET coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off by the top
pair through the latter portion of the turn and swung five wide for home, then tired in the drive. CASTLECOVE SPIRIT chased four paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking to the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
had the rider lose the handle on the crop to the left side near the sixteenth pole and made no impact. POLISH UP broke in at the start trading a bump with
BETTA GO GO GO, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three then two wide through the turn coaxed along from the
seven-sixteenths, cornered five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

PRINCIPE D'ORO was hustled to the front, moved clear outside the five-eighths pole, raced inside on the turn, was asked when challenged with three
furlongs to run, shook off a foe into upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. ICE ROAD was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two
path, moved out in upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. BEARY FUNNY was well spotted in third position, came under
urging late on the backstretch, gained in the two path to make a bid with three furlongs to run, dropped back into upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong
marker and tired but held the show. PETROLO prompted the pace on the inside of the leader then tracked that foe, dropped back under urging leaving the
backstretch, shifted from the rail to the three path outside the three-eighths pole, moved to the four path later on the bend, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, swapped back to his inside lead into the final furlong and came up empty. PHANTOM JEWEL was urged along off the pace, moved from three to five
wide on the turn and failed to threaten. GOLDEN PURCHASE was urged along well off the pace, moved from four to six wide on the turn and was no factor.
I LOVE CARA dropped well behind under urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, drifted out in the stretch and trailed.

FORTUNE'S NEPHEW coaxed from the gate to the front, showed the way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn, remained
patiently handled until set down taking the two path into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive, dug in and held well to prevail drifting out late under a left
handed crop. DR. KRAFT bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then tipped three to four wide at the seven-sixteenths to
move around a steadying WARALO, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly drifting out late
under a left handed crop while along clear for the place honors. PRINCE OF TRUTH hustled from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. MESSI THE MAGICIAN coaxed from the start, chased three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. STARQUIST chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. BOURBON'S HOPE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside,
tipped to the two path near the seven-sixteenths and forced WARALO to steady off his heels inside that station, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung two to three wide for home and tired. WARALO hustled from the gate, got taken in hand briefly along the inside five and a half furlongs from home
when BOURBON'S HOPE crossed directly in front due to pressure outside from MESSI THE MAGICIAN as rivals tucked inside after the start, chased along
the rail before tipping to the two path into the turn, got forced to steady off the heels of BOURBON'S HOPE once more as that rival tipped to the two path at
the seven-sixteenths and lost ground to last, came under coaxing inside the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
I'M JUST settled off the pace, moved in outside the nine-sixteenths then advanced closer, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied to
get the lead inside the furlong marker and drew away while drifting out some under steady urging. JANSSEN bumped with a foe at the start, tracked the
pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, took a short lead in the four path on the turn, moved clear outside the quarter-pole, drifted out in
upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match while clear for the place. ARCO AUGUSTA bumped with a
rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, steadied near the five-eighths pole then dropped back, raced between horses while two then three wide
on the turn, dropped back some late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch then was roused while splitting opponents around the three-sixteenths,
remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed kick while along for the show. WATCH HILL was hustled from the gate then urged along off
the pace, moved up quickly with five furlongs to run, chased while moving from the rail to the four path later on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and tired. SOLO TONIGHT broke in then bumped with an opponent, was coaxed along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. TRIPLE WORD SCORE bumped with a foe at the start, drifted out early on the backstretch, lagged at the rear,
moved from the four path to the two path on the turn and was no factor. IRIE MAN bumped with foes on both sides at the start then was taken up briefly,
settled off the pace, went three then four wide for most on the turn, moved to the five path late on that bend, had the rider lose his crop near the
three-sixteenths and failed to respond. FRANKIE R. tossed his head some when the rider fell back in the saddle at the start, moved up under urging to set
the pace, lost the advantage in the two path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch then had the rider lose is crop and stopped then was eased in the
final furlong but walked off. SPOKEN BLUNTLY prompted the pace on the outside, was urged along between foes in the three path on the turn and
retreated. MORTGAGE RATE was taken in hand early, angled in outside the five-eighths pole, went three then four wide on the turn and faltered then was
also eased in the final furlong but walked off.
