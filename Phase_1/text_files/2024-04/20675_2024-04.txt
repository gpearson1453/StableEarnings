Footnotes
BACKED BY GOLD moved in while showing speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while inside of two foes on the turn, was
asked nearing the quarter-pole, dueled gamely with the runner-up in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. PEACHY WEACHY stalked the
pace on the outside, made a bid while let out leaving the backstretch, vied in the four path on the turn, dueled outside under the crop in the stretch and just
missed while clear for the place. TRADE SECRET settled just off the pace, was asked while in the two path for most of the turn then shifted three wide,
came five wide into the stretch, pursued the top two into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while
clear for the show under a mild hand-ride late. HYDRA showed early speed, disputed the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the three path while
between horses on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back outside the sixteenth-pole and tired. DIVA BANKER was well placed
just off the pace, came under urging while saving ground on the turn, cut the corner against the rail into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
FREDDYMO FACTOR was urged along at the rear, went four wide while hard ridden on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
LAKE ABANAKEE broke in at the start bumping LA FIERE, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, tipped out three to four
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, edged away under a drive to prevail. MULKEY coaxed from the gate, showed
the way in hand along the inside under pressure from EASTERN STAR to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, ran on to secure the place honors. EASTERN STAR stumbled at the start,
prompted the pace of the aforementioned foe to the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MOMMASGOTTAGUN the last to be loaded in the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. LA FIERE got bumped at the
start by LAKE ABANAKEE, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. HIDDEN
WAR DANCE coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, swung three wide
into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ASSUME NOTHING prompted the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths on even
terms for the lead, gained the advantage at the quarter-pole, responded well while fighting with multiple foes into the final sixteenth, battled with the
runner-up while drifting out late and and gamely prevailed. MIGHTY ATLAS broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall,
was urged along on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, fought outside two foes into the final sixteenth,
battled with the winner to the finish and just missed. DEBATE settled towards the rear, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the turn, dropped
back in the process, came six wide into upper stretch and finished with late energy to garner the show. NIGHT EFFECT was hustled from the gate, moved
in while in front near the three-quarter pole, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside under urging on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner at
the quarter-pole, fought on well to the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished and lost the show. CAPITAL CONQUEST was well placed early then came under
urging around the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed
kick. FIGHTING BACK climbed some while settling on the outside, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
BAYOU SPIRIT was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came off the
rail into the stretch, was put to the crop near the three-sixteenths, responded well to the challenge of the runner-up in the final furlong and held gamely.
DEVIL'S CAY settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked while three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner on the
outside into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought to the finish and just missed while clear for the place. TWELTH MAN tracked the
pace, made a bid in the two path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the show.
BLUE PLATE SPECIAL was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, dropped well behind under urging, went around the turn in the three path, gained
five wide into the stretch and finished willingly. ANTHRACITE was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and lacked the needed kick.

Footnotes
FLINT RIDGE coaxed from the gate, ranged up just after the start to duel briefly with MR BOB to his outside before establishing sole command in the two
path, came under increasing pressure into and through the turn vying now inside a pair of rivals, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away
under a drive to prevail. MR BOB coaxed from the start, led early on before briefly dueling from the four path with the aforementioned foe to his inside,
prompted that rival when shaken off a bit before advancing to vie tucked to the two path through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home while just preserving the place honors on the wire. MAJESTIC FRONTIER chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN chased four to five
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, advanced on the front to vie outside the top pair, tipped five wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. LAFITTE'S FLEET chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch,
offered no response. SCILLY CAY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BOB JOHN RAY broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was coaxed along passing the nine-sixteenths, came under strong encouragement while four
then five wide on the turn, dropped back in the process, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid into the final furlong, gained the
advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong handling. PALACE BOSS stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the
turn, gained to make a bid coming to the furlong marker, battled between horses into the final sixteenth, fought with the winner to the finish and missed while
clear for the place. SORORITY PRANK bobbled ever so slightly while breaking clearly in front, drifted out in the early going, left the chute under a snug hold,
showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, led into the the final furlong then was
overtaken while clear for the show. HAGRID'S FLAME settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, traveled around the turn in the
two path, angled five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. METATRON broke out and hit the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in
the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, was crowded between foes while dropping back near the three-sixteenths and came up empty.
AELFGAR was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn, pursued the vanguard under a drive into the final furlong and tired.
VIN SANTO was hustled from the gate, settled towards the rear on the outside, was urged along with five furlongs to turn, went three then four wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. SLOW DOWN BIG ANDY was forced out at the start and slowest into stride, angled in at the rear,
moved from the rail to the two path midway through the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure
from MR PHIL to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and came under prompting from a pair, got placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. HEIR PORT stumbled at the start and was
bumped by HORN OF PLENTY, who broke outwards, but only conceded about a length of ground to the front, chased three then two wide patiently handled
until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, then offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors. MR PHIL coaxed from the start, led briefly
before pressing the pace of COLONEL VARGO from the outside three wide, advanced tucked to the two path through the turn to vie between foes coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. MOTION TO STRIKE
stumbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping ANYTHING PAZIBLE before conceding about a length to the front when settling into stride, chased
just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, took the inside route into upper
stretch and improved position. BREAKING STONES coaxed from the gate, raced four wide in aim of the front before advancing tucked three wide to vie
outside a pair coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. JOKER BOY coaxed from the start,
chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened. F F ROCKET coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. ANYTHING PAZIBLE got bumped at the start by MOTION TO STRIKE, who recovered inwards from a stumble and
conceded five lengths to the front, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact.
HORN OF PLENTY broke out at the start bumping HEIR PORT just after that rival stumbled, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
MERLIN'S MOMENT brushed with a rival at the start, settled under some urging, moved out near the nine-sixteenths pole, came under stronger
encouragement while four wide on the turn, rallied into the final furlong and closed well to get up late. IRON MAN IRA went to the front, moved in outside the
three-quarter pole, lost the lead near the eleven-sixteenths pole, dropped back around the nine-sixteenths pole then moved out, chased in the two path on
the turn, regained the advantage passing the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken
while clear for the place. JUDGE RULES brushed with a foe at the start, was well placed towards the front, dropped back some while taken in hand near the
nine-sixteenths, raced inside to the two path under urging on the turn, dropped back to the rail in upper stretch and improved to get the show. INONIT was
coaxed along just off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, raced between horses in upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and lacked
the needed kick. MUGSY FURY leaned in at the start, was urged along near the back, went three then four wide on the turn and improved position without
threatening. BERNING BEAUTY brushed with an opponent at the start, settled off the pace, was urged inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two
path, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. HE HAS IT ALL broke in and a bit awkwardly then brushed with a foe, moved up on
the outside, took the lead near the eleven-sixteenths, angled in while moving clear around the seven-sixteenths, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead to the
runner-up passing the five-sixteenths pole, came off the rail in upper stretch and tired. UNAFFECTED raced just off the pace between foes, dropped back
under urging while two to three wide for most of the turn then dropped to the rail and came up empty. SIR MAGIC brushed with a rival at the start, was
urged along at the rear, went four wide on the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch and was eased but walked off.
