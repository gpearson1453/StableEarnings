Footnotes
RAM forwardly placed up the backstretch while three wide, moved closer late in the turn, challenged in the two path and between horses into the stretch,
dueled closest to the inside the final furlong, narrowly gained the nod at the wire. PRESSURE behind the first flight outside, advanced and challenged three
wide into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker outside the winner, remained on equal terms with that one to the wire, just missed. LEAGUE OF
LEGENDS back off the pace while along the inside into the turn, angled out and loomed a threat four wide exiting the turn, flattened out a bit in the drive to
finish best of the rest while remaining well out in the strip. SUPER CONSTITUTION back off the pace, two to three wide through the turn, outkicked late for
the show while also not a threat to the top two. COLORFUL NATIVE broke on top, cleared to the inside soon after, set the pace for a half, weakened when
headed by the top two entering the stretch. HOT TICKET last to leave, lagged well back, was never a factor while picking off a single tiring rival late.
CAPTAIN JACK pressed the issue up front for a half in the two path, gave way drive.

Footnotes
DANCE MY WAY moved up to duel off the inside soon after the start, continued to alternate up front through the turn, disposed of the other speed when
straightened for home, drifted in when clear past the furlong marker, steadily increased advantage to the wire. ZONGS IRISH FROST away in good order,
dueled up front inside the winner for just over a half, could not match strides in the drive, held the place late. FROSTY VI in mid pack and along the inside,
rallied for the show late while getting to the runner up in the late going outside that one. MISS MO MESA broke on top, raced forwardly and three wide for a
half, weakened gradually through the lane, caught for the show. SECRET CITY turned in an even effort while racing in the two path. MISS TERRE bothered
and pushed in at the break, raced back, angled 3w into lane, improved position with some belated interest out in the strip. SKY RAVEN came in early,
lagged in trailing for a half while saving ground, improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals through the stretch. LITTLEDABWILLDOO behind the pace
while four wide, worked way down to the two path by late in the turn, failed to muster a closing response. BREATHTAKING FOLLY veered out break, moved
up to race in the main body while widest backstretch, four wide early turn, also retreated through the lane. MITOLEMYBELLE cut off to be away slowly,
raced back, floated out four wide into the lane, lacked rally. ONE CROSS bothered when pushed in at the break, remained back while along the inside.

NULLIFY in the second flight while saving some ground, tipped out to be three wide turning for home, engaged the leader in upper stretch, briefly dueled
with that one then drew clear under steady handling. MAJOR MACK broke alertly, set the pace in the two path through the first turn, continued to set a
pressured pace the middle half toward the rail, offered brief resistance to the winner approaching the furlong marker then proved no match, clearly second
best. ALWAYS BE SMART off a step slow, raced back early as a result, continued to lack speed up the backstretch, angled out when making a mild
advance late in the final turn, proved no threat to the top two, clear of the others. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN void of speed while three wide first turn, saved
ground into the far turn, two path for the drive, improved position without posing a serious threat. MELT WITH YOU off slow, remained back in failing to
threaten inside. PENROD pressed the runner up from the outside for just over six furlongs and gave way. IN FORM in the second flight while outside the
winner, in some traffic as that one move to challenge late in the final bend, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
UNCLE BERLEY broke back, moved up quickly to become a forward factor. in the pocket through the turn, brief wait 1/4, moved out, closed with good
resolve to be up in time. FASTENED away well, vied up front while between horses, continued to battle past the furlong, inside the winner, proved stubborn
to the end,. RED LINE OVERDRIVE moved up inside to contest the pace, raced on equal terms with the runner up into the stretch inside that one, also gave
ground grudgingly to the wire. CRAVENSWORTH broke back, lacked speed well out in the strip, came four wide for the drive, improved position.
AMERICAN ICON in mid pack while racing off the inside, between horses midway on the turn, continued evenly through the stretch. ASYMMETRIC in mid
pack off rail, came three wide for the drive, also went one paced through the stretch. SUPER RENZO bothered slightly at the break, pressed the pace four a
half three wide, had little left in weakening through the lane. BORDINOS void of speed well outside, came five wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick.
IMPRESSOR off a step slow, back off the pace while saving ground, failed to menace. SIR lacked speed, in some traffic then was shuffled a bit into the turn,
remained back to the wire. WORTHTHEMONEY broke out, was straightened to race in the second flight three wide, gave way in the turn, trailed in.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SUNSET broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, continued to show the way final turn, lugged in a bit when straightened for home, held
sway late. LONG CROW off a bit slow, raced back in lacking speed inside, continued to save ground far turn, came in the two path for the drive, finished up
willingly to be in time for the place. BOBWHITE BOBBY pressed the winner from the outside, continued to force the issue into and through upper stretch,
could not match strides late, caught for the place in the final strides. DANCE SOME MO forwardly placed while racing three wide, lacked a closing punch.
LIL SWEET THANG in the second flight while in some traffic onto the backstretch, remained within striking distance into the far turn in the second flight, also
found lacking when the real running began at the head of the lane. SEVEN FLAT prompted the issue early from the three path, fell back the second quarter,
came three wide for the drive, lacked response. HARLEEZY off a step slow, remained always back. RACY BILLE finished after a half, well beaten.

Footnotes
PHANTOM RIDE in the second flight while in the two path, continued to race within striking distance the middle half, in some traffic when creeping closer
late in the second turn, came four wide for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up in time. PERFECT FLIGHT tracked the pace while firmly in hand
along the inside, continued to track inside in hand, advanced and challenged along the rail late in the second turn, shook clear into the lane, nailed in the
final strides. SEARCH ENGINE took over soon after the start, set the pace toward the inside, allowed the runner up the inside second turn, ran on after
headed by that one and the runner up to save the show. THE REDS last away, raced back while toward the inside, two path into the lane, improved position
while not a serious threat to the top three in the final strides. UNINVITED GUEST settled in mid pack, asked for run while four wide and in some traffic
turning for home, lacked a closing response. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK lacked early foot outside, four to five wide through the final turn, lacked rally.
OUTLIER prompted the pace off the inside, faltered while in some traffic turning for home, continued to fade in the run to the wire. ROMAN CENTURIAN
remained always back.

Footnotes
ASPEN CLUB never far back, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, briefly clear past the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up.
COLONEL BARTON within striking distance, three wide and in some traffic turning into the stretch, challenged inside the winner late, not enough.
CHOCTAW ZIP in the second flight outside, came five wide turning for home, slowly closing the gap on the top two late. ALLO ENRY pressed the early
leader from the outside, put a head in front and gained a brief advantage late in the turn, began to weaken when headed by the winner entering the stretch.
FORSAKEN in mid pack while out in the strip, was four wide exiting the turn, lacked a significant closing response. STOMPING HOTROD one paced early
toward the inside, raced three wide for the drive and continued evenly to the finish. CAMPISI off a step slow, trailed early inside, continued to save ground
turn, improved position with some mild late interest. REEF'S DESTINY went one paced while racing three wide, no lack bid. HERITAGE PARK away best of
all, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, began to weaken when headed midway on the bend, continued to falter through the lane.
YOU VEE CEE popped stall doors prior to the start, failed to menace in the two path. IM THE MACHINE was outrun while racing four wide. OBVIOUSLY
TOO was finished early while racing four to five wide through the turn.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD BYE unhurried early off the inside, advanced into a forward position three wide late in the final turn, challenged then put a head in front past
the furlong marker, fully extended to hold the runner up safe late. FLASHY LASS rank while pulling hard along the inside first turn, patiently handled while
saving ground in the second bend, shifted out for room in midstretch, closed well late to be getting to the winner. PARIS STYLE (FR) in mid pack early while
just off the inside, saved ground far turn, came in the two path for the drive, rallied mildly to earn the show, not a serious threat to the top two late.
MAKEMEBELIEVE pressed the leader from the outside for five furlongs, challenged that one in the second turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane
between horses, yielded to the winner past the furlong marker, weakened and lost the show late. MY GOOD FORTUNE last to leave, void of speed, three
wide second turn, improved position with some modest late interest. ROSE PARADE took command into the first turn inside, showed the way up the
backstretch and into the far turn while rating, weakened when headed midway on that bend. BUMP IN THE NIGHT void of early foot, remained back in
failing to muster a rally. PRIDDIS in the second flight off the inside, got out turning for home, trailed home, jogged in.

Footnotes
LADY MOSCATO back off the pace and the inside, made a three wide move into contention through the turn, took over into the lane, drew out through the
lane while being kept to task the final furlong. FREEBURN light bump start, within striking distance behind the leader toward the inside, came in the two path
for the drive, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, edged clear for the second spot. MOONLIT LADY broke on top, cleared toward the inside,
showed the way into and through the turn, surrendered readily to the winner into the stretch, chased that one past the furlong marker, caught late for the
place. GRAZIA off the pace and the inside, two to three wide through the turn, went one paced to the wire. FLOATING BEAUTY lightly bumped with
FREDBURN at the break, void of early foot, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. DIVINE GAL off a step slow, remained back.
AZTEC EMPRESS chased in the two path, stopped in the drive, jogged in.

Footnotes
COMMUNICATION MEMO forwardly placed three wide, chased into the lane, late bid outside the leader, gained nod late. RARE STRIPE dueled up front off
the inside, continued on equal terms with the other speed through the turn, shook clear of that one when straightened for home, 2nd duel late, missed.
LAMUTANAATTY in the second flight while in the two path, continued within striking distance into the lane, lacked a winning response, finished up clear of
the others. CHARTER OAK lacked early foot in the two path, dropped to the rail turning for home, improved position while too late. CREME DE LA
CHROME void of early foot after breaking out and racing in some traffic, swung five wide when beginning to advance late in the turn, continued to improve
with a mild rally down the lane. UNDER THE GUN in the second group while outside in the run up the backstretch, five to four wide through the turn, came
up empty for the drive. CIBOLO in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the turn, also lacked a response in the drive. COLT FICTION away in good
order, dueled up front along the inside for a half, first to blink. DOUBLE TUFF void of early foot, failed to menace while four wide through the turn. SLAM
DUNK SERMON remained back while racing toward the inside. MISTER SHARPIE forwardly placed while four wide, gave way late.
