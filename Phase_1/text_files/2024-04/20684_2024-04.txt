Footnotes
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO prompted the pace outside ROYAL SPY around the turn, was fanned three wide by that one when taking the lead straightening
out for the stretch run, went clear in mid stretch, remained on his left lead and dug in tenaciously to last. HEADS OR TAILS lacked speed, raced in the two
path between horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, took aim on the leader in mid stretch and flattened out. BONNIE BILL circled the
turn three wide, was fanned to the five path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. LIVING WATER stayed along the inner rail most of the trip and failed to rally.
ROYAL SPY set a pressured pace along the inner rail, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way.

DISCREET OPS , under a snug hold saving ground and tracking the leaders, eased out mid turn and brushed with an outer rival when working between
foes, came three wide into the lane, closed in under steady pressure and took over in mid stretch, kicked clear under left handed asks then held firm while
kept alert. GOODNIGHTNGODBLESS , off a tad slow, recovered and moved up off the inside, took closer order two wide and outside a foe into the lane,
came out and brushed with CRUSADER RABBIT when advancing between runners leaving mid stretch, straightened away and finished strong to bridge the
gap. STICKWITHTHECOLORS , quickly to the front, set a rated pace towards the inside, handled outside pressure around the turn, held a clear lead
entering the lane, could not resist the winner in mid stretch, kept on with effort past the sixteenth marker then faded late. CRUSADER RABBIT forced the
pace outside STICKWITHTHECOLORS, was brushed and floated out a bit as the winner moved through mid turn, came four wide into the stretch, brushed
with the runner up near mid stretch, failed to go on from there and gave way. SUPER SIMPLIFY broke outward contacting DETERMINED BLUE, corrected
and saved ground with pursuit, gained under a ride and loomed a presence into the lane, failed to sustain in mid stretch and weakened. DETERMINED
BLUE , brushed and in tight at the break, was taken to rate and raced well off the pace while saving ground, continued towards the inner rail in the lane and
offered a belated response.

INTREPID DREAM prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, was put to the whip leaving the three eighths pole, closed in steadily and drew
alongside heading to mid stretch, secured command soon after and steadily edged away while kept to solid encouragement. DOCTOR ABBIE saved ground
while under a ride leaving the far turn, eased out in upper stretch, made a steady run between rivals in deep stretch and earned the place. CATS INTHE
TIMBER , four wide off the early pace, dropped in a bit nearing the turn and pursued outside DOCTOR ABBIE, shifted out five wide for the drive and
churned on. SWEET SHILD O MINE broke outward but quickly corrected and cleared, set a rated pace in about the two path, came under a ride soon into
the lane, was worn down by the winner leaving mid stretch then weakened through the final seventy yards. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WONDER GIRL hugged the inner rail, took command approaching the stretch then drew away under urging. CONCEPTUALIZE sped to the early lead,
raced outside the winner around the winner around the turn, weakened and held the place. DEAD SEXY , between horses down the backstretch, drifted in
entering the turn, swung out in upper stretch, drifted in a bit near the sixteenth pole and failed to menace. ENKINDLE lacked speed, stayed near the inner
rail through out and passed tired horses. LITTLE LIA bumped ITALIAN WAR CRY when bearing in at the break, chased the pace four deep on the turn and
tired in the drive. COZY NOTION , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. LADY OPHELIA broke slowly, raced four wide turning for home
and was not a factor. ITALIAN WAR CRY , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced in the four path leaving the turn and weakened. NORAH BOO hugged
the inner rail on the backstretch, was checked in tight quarters inside DEAD SEXY entering the turn then dropped back. LADY EDNA trailed.

Footnotes
ANGELOFCANTERBURY took command inside of rivals leaving the chute then cleared, set a rated pace towards the inside, handled some outside
pressure from BAY STREET leaving the far turn, was put a ride and guided two to three wide soon into the stretch, dug in after ceding the lead to GOLDEN
CHARM in mid stretch, came out a bit and switched over to her left lead when bumping with that one a sixteenth out, reclaimed command and dug in
tenaciously under solid handling to prevail. GOLDEN CHARM , taken to rate off the leaders soon after the break, dropped in towards the rail and edged up
in hand heading to the turn, came out leaving the far turn and circled three to four wide with a run into the stretch, gained a slim lead in mid stretch, dueled,
bumped with the winner a sixteenth and kept on gamely. BROOKLYN GIRL stalked four wide early on, dropped back under some asking mid turn, remained
about four wide into the stretch and came back on with a good run through the final seventy yards. MIDSUMMERS EVE , rated off the pace while saving
ground, eased out nearing the lane, shifted back in but lacked a solid run. BAY STREET stumbled at the break, recovered and quickly reached a stalking
spot outside the winner, moved up to threaten leaving the far turn, chased under a ride into the lane then weakened in the final furlong.
THENCOMEMORNING , three to five wide, was not a factor. COVER THE SPREAD , well placed early and under some rating, saved ground and was put
to pressure mid turn, remained inside into the lane and gave way. MY SUGAR BOO failed to menace. RED WINE TIME refused to break. An objection by
the rider of BAY STREET against the winner alleging interference in the stretch was not allowed. There was also a stewards' inquiry into the start of RED
WINE TIME. No action was deemed necessary.

DISCO EBO , away in good order, edged clear leaving the five eighths then dropped in towards the rail to set a rated pace, was joined from her outside by
BENEATH THE STARS leaving the far turn, handled the pressure while remaining under a light hold past the five sixteenths, responded when shoved upon
and spurted clear in upper stretch, kept on under strong left handed asks past mid stretch and held firm. CENTRE COURT CHAMP showed speed then was
rated back off the winner after a furlong, was under a hard ride off the rail mid turn, circled four wide into the stretch, came in a bit near the three sixteenths,
corrected to give game chase through the final furlong and was reported by the stewards to have bled. ANONYMOUSLY had speed to the inside of rivals
then was firmly rated back leaving the five eighths, remained well in hand into the turn, angled three wide into the lane, was forced in a touch by CENTRE
COURT CHAMP heading to mid stretch then failed to muster up the needed finish. BENEATH THE STARS , taken back a bit soon after the break, ranged
up outside and joined the winner into the turn, vied under a ride and on near even terms heading to the quarter pole, stayed on past the three sixteenths
then weakened through the last eighth.

COASTAL MISSION , in hand stalking the pace along the inner rail for a half mile, eased out to the three path entering the stretch, bid for the lead outside
PRINCE OF JERICHO in mid stretch, dueled and narrowly prevailed. PRINCE OF JERICHO prompted the early pace outside SWIFTSURE, gained a two
wide lead near the three eighths pole, maintained the advantage to mid stretch, battled inside the winner and just missed in a sharp effort. UNION FLEET ,
bumped and forced in leaving the starting gate by TWENTY FOUR MAMBA, circled horses on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied.
BRILLIANT ICE lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, floated to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out. DONTMESAWITHME stayed near the
inner rail most of the trip and was no factor. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA bore in leaving the starting gate bumping and forcing in UNION FLEET, chased the
pace three deep for a half mile, drifted four wide leaving the turn and faltered. SWIFTSURE , taken to the inner rail about a furlong after the break, showed
speed to the stretch then faltered. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) , bumped by UNION FLEET at the start, raced forwardly in the two path to mid turn then dropped
back.

AIN'T DA BEER COLD broke a bit outward but quickly corrected and cleared off, dropped in and was nursed along on the lead, had rivals close in entering
the far turn but remained unfazed while nicely handled, responded when shaken up approaching the quarter pole, turned away initial outside threats in mid
stretch, kept on tenaciously under left handed asks and grimly prevailed. MAGIC MICHAEL , off the pace while saving ground, came under a ride around
the final turn, worked outward in the drive, leveled off to a strong stride inside the furlong grounds and just missed. VANCE SCHOLARS , forwardly placed
around the first turn, was surrounded and raced three wide between foes leaving the five eighths, moved with and to the outside of SHAFT'S BULLETT into
the far turn to take aim, loomed three wide past the three sixteenths but hung a bit late. BE BETTER lagged off the pace and outside a rival leaving the far
turn, worked outward to about the six path for the drive and closed belatedly. SHAFT'S BULLET settled early, pulled his way forward two wide and between
runners near the five eighths, secured the inside to advance into the far turn, tracked then angled out chasing pursuing into the stretch, failed to go on
leaving mid stretch and faded. IT'S SIZZLING TIME , four to five wide most of the trip, came up empty. HAY CHIEF , off the pace while saving ground, failed
to menace.

Footnotes
LADRO DI FICHI lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole, was deftly handled to keep from getting in further
was led approaching the finish. A GIRL NAMED JAC , bumped by SWEET HEIDELBERG at the start, was forced in by CALYPSO GHOST soon after the
break, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, gained a short lead near the sixteenth pole then hung inside the winner. FAINOR'S FILETS
prompted the pace two wide on the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and weakened in deep stretch. CALYPSO GHOST bore in leaving the starting
gate, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and weakened. HAPPY TAPPY TIM was no factor. ICE CUBE BABY , three deep chasing the pace
around the turn gave way in upper stretch. SWEET HEIDELBERG bumped A GIRL NAMED JAC when bearing out at the break, was rated back mid way
down the backstretch and swung to the six path in upper stretch. GOLD TIME VIXEN dropped back after she lost her action leaving the backstretch.
