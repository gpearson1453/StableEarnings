Footnotes
UPTOWN WALK THE LINE moved along the inside to exchange the lead with an outer rival into the turn, bore out while under a gamely drive, then kicked
clear in the late stretch and held on well to prevail. WMA BANDANA saved ground early, improved position leaving the bend to rally in the late stretch, could
not catch the leader and was best for the place prize. BASEQ AND BAKE took to the lead early then dueled with an inner rival on the turn while being
floated out wide, then was outkicked in the late stretch and missed the place prize. RB MOTHERLOAD tracked the sparring leaders from the inside, then bid
for the lead while in a hard drive on the turn and lacked rallying in the the late stretch. KD DERBY GIRL was allowed to settle along the inside and was no
threat. WMA NORTH WIND tucked along the inside and failed to rally. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference throughout the turn.
After review, no change was made.

Footnotes
WITT AMERICA was nicely rated along the inside behind the leading pair, shifted to the three path leaving the far turn, dug in gamely in the deep stretch
and was up just in time. CRAZY RIDGE maintained the lead from the inside into the first turn and into the home stretch, was in a long drive then was caught
at the wire and was second best. NIGHTWIND pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch while maintaining second position, reserved
momentum on the far turn, attempted for the lead again in the upper stretch under a gamely rally and missed the place prize in the end. OZZIES WINGS Y
G raced along the inside while saving ground in the early furlongs, then urged on the far turn to rally in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end.
KING ARTHUR RIDGE trailed behind the field early, then rallied leaving the far turn but it was too little too late. DARYLS TRUMP CARD saved ground while
in the two path, then rallied mildly leaving the far turn and into the home stretch but it was to no avail. HYPERION NORTH was allowed to settle between
rivals at the back of the field, then made a mild bid in the late stretch and came up empty. RED DRAW was allowed to settle in the three path at the back
and was no threat. WITT'S JERRY raced in the middle of the pack along the inside then faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
LITTLE AVENGER broke inwardly at the start, then stalked the pace while four wide, dug in gamely leaving the bend to duke it out with an inner rival in the
late stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. SAINT PIO broke outwardly, then stalked the leaders while three wide, moved up to duel with an inner rival on
the turn, gained command momentarily at the three sixteenths marker, then was met with another rival from the outside in the late stretch to go shoulder to
shoulder and just missed at the end. SR. BI BI was impeded at the start, then chased the pace while two wide, rallied leaving the turn and was best for the
show prize in the end. LANGUAGE BARRIER chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, then rallied mildly leaving the bend while four wide and
did not have enough in the end. WAR ROGUE dueled while two wide into the turn, took command momentarily at top of the turn before being met by an
outer rival to spar again heading into the stretch, was used up and gave way in the final yards. MONET'S DEVIL was shuffled back at the start and was no
threat. LET'S GO ALAMO dueled from the inside early, then continued to stalk the pace on the turn in a hard drive before weakening in the stretch.

Footnotes
TUDELA was forwardly placed while two wide into the first turn, then gained command down the backstretch, cleared the far turn of incoming pressers and
was kept to task down the lane to prove best in the end. SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT stalked the pace while two wide, was in a long drive leaving the far bend
and while maintaining second position, lacked the winning bid in the stretch and held on the place prize in the end. OPTIMISTIC COWGIRL broke inwardly
and bumped rival, then pursued from the four path in the early furlongs, rallied leaving the far turn and closed well down the lane and was best for the show
prize. TEMPLAR RED raced in the middle of the field while three wide down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn and into the early stretch but it was
not enough in the end. GASTOWN was bumped at the start, then raced at the back of the field, continued to conserve energy on the far turn before digging
in gamely in the early stretch then split rivals down the lane while closing willingly. PAINTBRUSH was unhurried early, then bid while three wide leaving the
far turn and into the home stretch but it was too little too late. LUNA MOTH raced in the middle the pack from the inside, at a moderate pace throughout and
needed more in the home stretch. MISSION BELLE raced in the middle of the field while four wide down the backstretch, then menaced on the far turn
before giving way in the home stretch. STELLACZAR led the way from the inside into the first turn before settling back and stalking the pace down the
backstretch and into the far turn, re rallied at the top of the stretch then was over powered by rivals on both sides and lost momentum in the end. REBEL
CONSORT tracked the pace while two wide mid pack, then bid on the far turn and lacked rally in the home stretch. STORMIEIS BLUE tucked along the
inside and failed to rally.
