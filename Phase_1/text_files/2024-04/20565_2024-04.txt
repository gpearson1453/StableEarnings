DENALI RAE dueled between rivals for the early lead, continued to duel on the turn, battled heads apart with VALIANT MAJESTY in the stretch run and
maintained the edge to the wire. VALIANT MAJESTY dueled three wide for the early lead, dueled on the turn, battled heads apart with DENALI RAE
passing the furlong marker and dug in gamely outside of that rival to the finish. AYEARTOREMEMBER was reluctant to load, tracked the dueling leaders,
chased on the turn, angled out into the stretch and rallied mildly. ARROGANTE steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside, angled out entering the
stretch and closed belatedly. ARLYNE'S CROWN dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, steadied at the quarter pole and faded. EIGHTY EIGHT
KEYS raced off the rail, off the pace, chased three wide on the turn and had no rally. THAT'STONY'SSISTER raced off the pace inside, between foes at the
quarter pole and did not factor.

DONTPASSTHEPRINCES vied three wide, took over at the three eighths pole and quickly pulled away under moderate urging. UNDICI chased very wide
off the pace and continued willingly for the place. LERETHA dueled between rivals down the backstretch then weakened in the stretch. MIKEY'S SONG
urged early along the inside then passed rivals without menacing. COMBAT HOOFS raced within striking range early then faded on the turn. LITTLE LAMB
CHOP flashed speed along the inside then was finished after half a mile. SUNNY SIDE UP raced just off the leaders three wide and gave way readily. I'M A
LUCKY GIRL broke awkwardly and lagged far behind throughout. GODDESS OF FORTUNE stumbled badly at the break then gave way readily.

BLOME tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch, put a head in front passing the sixteenth marker, then drew clear under
urging. MIDNIGHT WONDER showed good early speed to set the pace, raced well off the inside turning for home, dug in gamely in the lane, then yielded to
the winner. BAHITI stalked two wide, chased three wide on the turn and rallied mildly outside. HOP ON ME raced two wide off the pace and lacked a rally.
TIZ RACE DAY broke a step slow, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. EQUISTAR was steadied at the start, raced three wide off the pace and
was outrun.
