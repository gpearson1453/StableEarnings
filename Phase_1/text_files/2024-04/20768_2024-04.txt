MARY WHO moved clear and angled in about the two or three path, made all the pace and held safe in the lane under steady handling. KATELYN'S MESS
stalked the pace three to four wide to move nearest the winner into the lane then could not close on that one late. WOKE JOKE saved ground back off the
early pace, angled out into the lane and moved up to best the others. GOOD GRACIOUS moved up three and four wide while not a threat. CARBONEL
stalked the pace from along the inside and weakened. TEDDYISTRUCKING broke sharply outward to come away last, rushed up four and five wide to bid in
late backstretch and weakened. SENSE OF HEART was just off the early pace along the inside and weakened.

CELTICS WILDCAT was on a contested pace outside MILLI STARR through the opening half mile, edged clear in the far turn and drew off under steady
handling. SHE'S MY PRIORITY settled off the pace two or three wide, rallied through the lane and gained the place. MILLI STARR forced the pace inside
the winner to the far turn and weakened into the lane. LIL MISS DE BUY improved position three to four wide while not a serious threat. MAGIC IN A HAT
was not a factor. SEGOVIANA tracked the pace from three wide and weakened. BREWSKY was always back.
