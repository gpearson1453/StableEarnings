Footnotes
MUST BE LOVE in the second flight while in the two path, asked along late in the turn, steered out from behind an outside member of the first flight
approaching midstretch, challenged between horses with less than a furlong remaining, dug in late to prove best in determined fashion. FIRE BRYAN lacked
early foot outside, came four to five wide into the stretch, challenged outside the winner inside the furlong marker, dueled to the wire, oufinished in the late
going while edging clear for the place. MISTER MULDOON away in good order, vied up front in the three path through some lively fractions, showed the
way nearing midstretch but could not contain the top two inside that pair, lasted for the show. UNCLE BERLEY in mid pack and inside, improved into the
stretch, moved out a bit, challenged between foes with a sixteenth remaining, hung in the late going. KID SHELLEEN lacked speed, saved ground through
the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position while too late. SPEIGHTSVILLE broke sharp, vied up front between horses through those lively
early fractions, continued to vie in midstretch then faltered late. HOT TICKET hesitated at the break to be off slowly, continued to lag well behind the field for
over a half, improved by passing some tiring rivals with some mild late interest. QUICK BUCK broke with the leaders, narrowly set a hot early pace, first to
blink, gave way at the head of the lane. GOLD BARON in mid pack early in the two path, finished before a half. FORSAKEN main group while off the inside,
three wide through the turn, backed up in the drive to trail home.

Footnotes
PLATINUM GHOST veered in at the break to tighten up and bother a pair of inner rivals, was straightened and dueled in the two path for a half, extended
that advantage a bit in upper stretch, lugged in nearing the furlong grounds causing EXPRESS THUNDER to steady, edged steadily clear the final furlong.
DUTCH MILLS off a step slow, moved out a bit while racing back, advanced four wide through the turn, got closest to the leader with a furlong to run,
managed little late gain thereafter. EXPRESS CRUISER broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, fell back slightly off the other speed when
straightened for home, put in tight by that one approaching midstretch, steadied, fell further back while being steered out a bit, finished up evenly. VIOLENT
RIVER lacked early foot off rail, moved out three wide midway on the turn, angled back to the two path late in the bend putting HOPPIN JOHN in tight,
moved back out, went evenly late. IMPRESSOR broke back, lacked speed inside, continued to save ground turn, improved inside of rivals entering the
stretch, went flat late. HARD SPUN FANTASY bothered at the start, in the second flight outside, three wide through the turn, within striking distance turning
for home, lacked a closing punch. BEAUTIFUL LIFE in the second flight inside, steered to the two path for the drive, also found lacking without a closing
response. HOPPIN JOHN lacked speed, put in tight by VIOLENT RIVER late in the bend, moved out to the three path, lacked a rally. EIGHT STRAIGHT cut
off at the start, quickly recovered to move up into the second flight, came three wide for the drive but was finished, steady fade down the lane. FOLLOWING
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF EXPRESS CRUISER AGAINST PLATINUM
GHOST FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD. AFTER A SECOND INQUIRY
REGARDING THE START, NO ADDITIONAL ACTION WAS TAKEN.

THERESASILVERLININ pressed the issue up front in the run up the backstretch outside the early leader, continued to apply pressure through the turn, took
over when straightened for home, drove strongly clear. LOFTHOUSE off a step slow, raced back off the pace, angled out to be four wide into the stretch,
rallied on the outside to gain the place, no threat to the winner. ROYAL MEGHAN headed up the second flight off the inside, came three wide for the drive,
outkicked for the runner up position. WINGS FROM ABOVE narrowly set the early pace over the winner, offered little resistance to that one into the stretch,
chased that same rival past the furlong marker, weakened to lose a couple of positions late. BERTIE'S CAUSE one paced early three wide, came four wide
for the drive, lacked a significant closing response. KYLE BEAUTY in the second flight for a half toward the inside, weakened in the drive. RUN FEARLESS
failed to menace while racing off the inside. BUG A BOO fell back to trail after the start and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WILL TAKE IT forwardly placed while three wide through the first turn, continued to stalk the pace in the three path, ranged up outside the two leaders to
challenge on the outside turning for home, drove clear then held the runner up safe late. STRONSINO tracked the pace along the inside, continued to save
ground second bend, steered out steadily through upper stretch, chased the winner home the final furlong to be second best. ELKO COUNTY lacked speed
just off the inside, angled out to be three wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to be along for the show, no threat to the top two. RIYADH MOON
pressed the early leader off the inside, challenged between horses and inside the winner exiting the final turn, dueled with that rival through upper stretch
then faltered the final furlong. MAJOR MACK broke on top, set a pressured pace along the inside, briefly responded when the next two came calling late in
the final turn, faltered when headed into the lane. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN broke back, moved out, four wide onto backstretch, continued four wide and
advanced with a middle move to briefly contend midway on the final turn, weakened in the drive. GREERS FERRY raced back and failed to menace.
SECRET SATURDAY off a step slow, moved up to mid pack early, was finished after a half.

ESPIONAGE with the pace from the start, dueled onto and through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the finish under
steady pressure. BANDERA AZTECA in the second flight while in the two path, steered four wide into the stretch, proved no match winner, clearly second
best. SECRET POCKET off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack, came in the two path for the drive, staged a mild rally to be along for the show.
ATTA PARTY forwardly placed early, vied three wide midway on the turn, weakened in the drive. THERIDEOFALIFETIME broke on top, set or forced the
pace along the inside, lost contact with the winner in upper stretch and began to fade. BLOW TORCH turned in an even effort while racing three wide.
PALACE KITTEN void of speed, passed tiring rivals. LIGHTNING STRUCK failed to menace while racing off the inside. SMOKIN' HOT saved ground to no
avail. VERB was finished after a half.

LEGALLY LUCKY void of speed, began to advance while four wide through the final turn, set down for the drive, late surge to be up at the wire. FASHION
IDOL in mid pack and off the inside for five furlongs, asked along three wide into the lane, late bid between foes to miss. BYZANTINE main group while
inside first turn, steady gain middle half, collared leader late in the final turn, well clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the top two late. GI GIS
MAP closest to the pace settler, one paced three wide into the lane, continued evenly to the finish in lacking a closing punch. BLUE EMBER lacked speed
outside, raced four wide through both turns, lacked a closing response. BUMP IN THE NIGHT broke back, lacked speed while inside first turn, in some
traffic into the far bend, improved slightly when clear for the drive. MIRACLE SHOES last to leave, dropped inside, continued to save ground into the final
turn, improved by passing tiring rivals, never a serious threat. OH MY GAWD broke on top, stole out to a long lead through a quick opening quarter, caved
when headed late in the final bend. BUSINESS AS USUAL in the second fight early just off the inside, continued in the two path, began a steady retreat
after a half. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY forwardly placed for a half, stopped, distanced after losing contact with the field through the stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
BIG BAD DIVA unhurried early after break back, moved up steadily the middle half mile while three wide, came four wide into the lane to lose some ground
to the winner, engaged that one a furlong out, drew clear under steady handling well out in the strip. PENS STREET also broke back, lacked speed for six
furlongs, swung out five wide when beginning to advance late in the final turn, finished up willingly to be edging clear for the place. FEARLESS KRISTIE
dueled up front in the two path, put that rival away when straightened for home, responded when the winner came calling past the furlong marker then
proved no match the final sixteenth, not could she contain the runner up. JUST LIKE MAGIC four wide into the first turn, angled a bit to save some ground
soon after, dropped all the way to the rail far turn, lacked clear room in traffic late in that bend, improved when clear for the drive. START SINGING dueled
up front closest to the inside for six furlongs, first to blink entering the stretch. SIMONA'S CHOICE chased the dueling leaders for six furlongs and had little
left. HONEY RUN remained back while racing four wide most of the way. GHAALEB'S RANGER made little impact while lacking speed. DELPHIA steadied
past the wire the first time, settled in the second flight, tired through the stretch. INDY AGAIN finished early, raced three wide, trailed home.

Footnotes
VALENTINE CANDY broke well, allowed the early leader to go, tracked that in the two path into and through the turn, set down when straightened for home
and kicked down that same rival under brisk encouragement to be in time. FROST FREE broke running, asked a bit to clear the opening furlong, was given
a bit breather midway on the turn, continued to hold daylight past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner late, remained clear for the place. CATS
BY FIVE in the second flight while racing off the inside, angled three wide exiting the turn, managed a slow gain on the top two late, well clear of the others.
TIME FOR TRUTH forwardly placed along the inside up the backstretch, covered up by the winner into the turn, continued to save ground into the stretch,
came up empty. BERGEN broke back, lacked speed inside, rode the rail through the turn, failed to fire in the drive. MARKET STREET last to leave, went
one paced in the two path, roused late turn, also lacked a closing response. DREWMANIA was finished after a half while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SHE CALLED in the second flight up the backstretch well out in the strip, advanced to challenge four wide late in the bend, put a head in front then edged
clear upper stretch, held the runner up safe late. MO FOR US also in the second group early, crept closer late in the turn in traffic, waited for room into the
stretch, dropped down to the rail, roused, finished willingly to slowly close the gap on the winner. VINO VERITAS lacked early foot, swept up five wide to
become a forward factor late in the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, outkicked for the second spot late. ANDREA DIANE hesitated to be off
slow, raced well back early, moved closer four wide late in the turn, traffic into stretch, went evenly to the wire, closing for the show. GUN TWIRL in mid
pack while off the inside, also encountered some traffic to lack clear room into the stretch, went evenly when clear for the drive;. CALIFORNIA ROLL
bumped, off slowly, well back, steered out a bit around a logjam of horses turning for home, improved position while never a serious threat. SHE'S NOT A
JOKE away in good order, vied up front while between horses, weakened after a half. MISS MAXIMUS vied up front while racing three wide, gave way from
between horses into the stretch. SMARTY BE GOOD set or forced the pace along the inside, appeared to be tiring a bit when in tight turning for home along
the rail, continued to give way. QUEEN'S LEGACY bumped to be off slow, trailed throughout to remain back.

Footnotes
HOOSIER PHILLY broke with the field, settled in mid pack while along the inside, crept closer along the rail into the far turn, patiently handled while in traffic
late in that bend, moved out a bit in hand, split foes entering the stretch and quickly kicked clear without feeling the crop to win ridden out in a solid effort.
ABSINTHE forwardly placed while off the inside, three wide and outside the winner turning for home, could not match the winner the final furlong, proved
determined for the place. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL prompted the pace from the outside, three wide onto the backstretch, took over in putting a head in front
midway on the final bend, showed the way into the lane, proved no match for the winner in the drive, outkicked for the place while clear for the show.
WILDWOOD BYE fell back to trail after the start, continued unhurried the middle half mile, patiently handled while three wide into the lane, steered out
widest when called on upper stretch, turned in a mild, belated rally. I'M THE BOSS OF ME last to leave, raced back, four to five wide when making a mild
advance second turn, came four wide for the drive, improved a bit past the furlong marker but was not a serious threat. OLIVIA TWIST in mid pack and off
the inside, lost some position before a half, continued off the rail in the second turn, failed to respond in the drive. CRYPTO MO four wide in the first turn
when off the pace, continued outside, three to four wide through much of the second turn, also came up empty for the stretch run. STELLAR LILY clear early
in the two path through the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, moved toward the inside when still in front second turn then gave way when
headed soon after. BOW DRAW failed to seriously menace or make an impact toward the inside.

Footnotes
BOURBON ON FIRE broke back, void of speed while racing four wide, continued in that path through the turn, steered out to be widest for the drive, closed
with a flourish to be up in the final strides. LEAD FOOT back off the pace and the inside, began to advance while three wide midway on the turn, came in the
two path for the drive, rallied through traffic, late bid, no match for the winner in the final strides, second best. MACHO STRIKER broke alertly despite
coming in and brushing an inner rival, dueled up front closest to the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, could not contain the top two. PREACHER'S KID
back off the pace, steered four wide into the lane, traffic inside the furlong marker, came out to bother a pair of rivals and was also going evenly at the end.
DANCIN ROCKET in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground into the lane, chased the leader past the furlong marker, lacked a closing
punch. MY BROTHER MIKE in mid pack and outside, four wide early turn, moved a bit closer with the runner up beside that one into the lane, stalled a
furlong out, bothered late. CHROME CANDY broke out to brush with a slow breaking TOMMY TRI, raced in the main group well wide, four to five wide into
the stretch, one paced with less than a furlong to run when bothered. BERRYVILLE BULLET in a bit tight at the break, back off the pace, two to three path
turn, never dangerous. SCOTT CITY alternated up front off the inside, first to blink turning for home. COACH SAM P within striking distance three wide
early, moved to the inside for the drive and began to fade. TOMMY TRI pinched at the start, remained always back. RUSTIC AFFAIR in tight at the start,
trailed throughout in showing little.
