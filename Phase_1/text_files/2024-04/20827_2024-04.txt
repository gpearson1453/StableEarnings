MS BUNNY DASH exploded, no doubt. MISS TAMBIEN WRANGLE strong rally. SULLYS COUNTRY WAGON strong case, outfinished. JTC DUTCH N
MEXICO void of response. SHES FURREL JESSIE bid, empty. GOODGOLLYMISSMOLLIE weakened. PYC BAC FOR FUN lacked room early. EASY OFF
N ON lot path partway. HEZ A FAMOUS EAGLE steadily faded. PAINTED SPIRITS never found stride.
