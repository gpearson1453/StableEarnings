kick. ON THE ENGINE saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far turn and made no bid. TOMMY BEE bumped with the horses to either side at the break, raced in the four path around the first turn,
trailed the field up the backstretch, pulled up approaching the far turn and was vanned off.
