Footnotes
BEACHGRASS allowed the pace to go early while off the inside, continued to track in the run up the backstretch, swept up four wide to challenge entering
the stretch, put a head in front nearing the furlong marker, fully extended to outkick the runner up late while outside that one. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME closest
to the leader while off the rail, closer between horses late backstretch, bid midway on the final bend, put a head in front soon after while still under a hold,
dueled to the wire inside the winner and proved stubborn to the end. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL in the second flight while saving ground, came out under a
left handed crop with a furlong remaining, finished clear of the others while not a serious threat to the top two. ALSANAH lacked speed while inside early,
angled out and came four wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. UNDECODED prompted the issue up front three wide,
continued in a forward position through the final turn, had little left for the stretch run. SASSY SAGEY cleared to the inside the opening quarter mile, set a
soft pace in hand, briefly responded when confronted in the final turn, gave way when headed entering the stretch. IZEONPOINT off a step slow, continued
to lag in the run up the backstretch, angled five wide into the stretch, came up empty. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER in the second flight while racing three wide,
appeared to be tiring when bothered slightly a furlong out, continued to weaken.

VINCENZINO broke in, brush, took command soon after the start, set the pace early in the two path, continued to show the way up the backstretch and
through the final turn in hand, drifted out in midstretch and then kicked clear while put to pressure. CONTRABANDISTA in tight at the start, void of speed as
a result while inside, continued to save ground second turn, improved into the lane, continued to advance up the rail to be in time for the place late, no threat
to the winner. CAPTIVE AUDIENCE pressed the winner from the outside, continued to apply pressure through the final turn and into the stretch, proved no
match for that one the final furlong, caught late for the runner up spot. MR WORKS broke out to help tighten up the runner up, raced forward early while
along the rail, continued in the second flight through the final bend, came up empty when called on for the stretch run. FETCHS BRAHM unprepared for the

Footnotes
WREAKING HAVOC pressed the pace off the inside, took over early in the turn, clear into the lane, extended that advantage under steady handling through
the lane. FUNTIMEGIRL back off the pace and the inside, raced three wide through the turn, rallied mildly to be clear for the second spot, not a serious
threat to the winner. VOW within striking distance along the inside early, fell back while saving ground turn, along for the show late. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS
back off the pace and the inside, closer in some traffic late in the bend, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. SPANISH DELIGHT off the early
pace outside, moved closer four wide late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance through the lane. WINYAH BAY bothered at the break, raced back,
saved ground through the turn, not dangerous. THE PRINCESS SAYS broke on top, cleared to the inside, set the pace for three furlongs, weakened when
headed the winner midway on the turn. VELIKIY broke out, was straightened to race in mid pack early, improved in the two path turn, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
THORNY forwardly placed while in hand early, continued to track in the run up the backstretch, asked along then lodged a rail bid midway on the final turn,
showed the way into the lane the shook clear under steady handling. MIWOMAN unhurried early while also in hand, followed the winner through along the
rail turning into the stretch, was no match for that one, clearly second best. IN JUST MY HEELS moved up to show the way first turn in the two
path,continued to set the pace off the inside, allowed both the winner and runner up the inside second turn, finished up best of the rest. UNDER THE
PALMS stumbled at the break, settled in the second flight off rail, four wide when turning for home, lacked a closing punch to the wire. FLOATING BEAUTY
within striking distance while racing three wide, had little left for the stretch run. CHEYENNE MOON hesitated at the start, was finished early, trailed well
back.

Footnotes
BENT HALO broke sharp, cleared the opening quarter, was given a breather in hand through the turn, stayed clear down the stretch while being kept to
task. SHE'S TABOO broke out, chased the winner while racing off the inside, crept a bit closer to that one late in the turn, drifted a bit ion midstretch, did not
seriously threaten the winner in the run to the wire the final furlong. BREATHTAKING FOLLY off a step slow, four wide while improving a bit through the
turn, went evenly through the lane to pose no threat to the top pair. MAREBELL fell back to trail after the start, steered out to be four wide midway on the
turn, improved slightly through the lane while also not a serious threat. TIZ A STRATEGY bothered at the break to be last away, saved ground while back off
the inside, improved into the lane then went evenly to the wire. FIRST DIAMOND raced in mid pack while just off the inside, continued in the two path
through the turn and into the lane, also lacked a closing rsponse. HONDURAS PASSION in the second flight while racing three wide, tired down the stretch.
LIL' BIT OF CHROME remained back in failing to threaten. ONE CROSS was finished before a half. ON THE MONEY LUV forwardly placed while racing
toward the inside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
VALE broke midpack, back off the early pace, cut the corner inside of a trio of rivals to improve into the stretch, shifted out a bit, roused, kicked down the
leader under firm handling. CONGRATS ON FIFTY broke sharp to soon be clear, showed the way through the turn inside, continued to hold a daylight
advantage, nailed late. LOOK SHARP raced in the second flight three wide, between foes into the stretch, narrowly gained the nod for the show late, not a
threat to the top pair. BEN DIESEL back off the pace while racing outside, four wide into the stretch, also was not a threat to the top two while just missing
the show. GO OTTO GO chased the winner to that one's outside, continued to chase that one through upper stretch then weakened the final fyurlong. LAST
DIAMOND last to leave, lacked speed for a half, three wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. MAKE IT
SPEND IT fell back to trail after the start, also passed tiring rivals. SOUND DOCTRINE forwardly placed early while racing along the inside, began to retreat
before a half. FOREVER FRIENDS remained back to be always outrun.

WANTS N NEEDS moved up to contest the pace soon after the start, vied between horses early turn, kicked clear nearing the furlong grounds and
continued to steadily increase that advantage to the wire. ZATARA back off the pace and the inside, came in the two path out of the turn, shifted out a bit
and rallied to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. HANDSOME HERB dwelt start, raced well back for a half, rallied through traffic to be in time
for the show. OKIE CLIPPER with the early pace inside, continued to contest the issue up front into the turn, began to weaken late in the bend, caught late
for the show. INCURSION unruly prior to the start, prompted the issue up front in the three path, chased the winner into the stretch, caved the final sixteenth
to lose several positions. AIR FORCE HUMOR in the second group outside, three to four wide turning for home, had nothing left. SUPERHERO fell back to
trail after a quarter, trailed home well beaten.

Footnotes
TRIDENT HIT allowed the pace to go early while saving ground, moved closer while moving off the rail into the far turn, ranged up three wide turning for
home, put a head in front between horses past the furlong marker, dug in late to hold sway over a stubborn runner up. SEARCH ENGINE in the second
flight outside, began to advance on the lead group ear turn, closer four wide into the stretch, outside bid, not enough in the late going. HOME RUN TRICK
broke on top, showed the way inside, set a pressured pace the middle half mile while remaining inside, held a narrow advantage nearing midstretch then
began to weaken when headed by the top two soon after. CATDADDY back off the pace while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide
again through the second bend, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing punch. TAPSASIONAL pressed the pace three wide early, closest to
the leader far turn, weakened from between horses turning for home. MY UNCLE LEON last away, trailed for six furlongs, passed a couple of tiring rivals
while not a factor. SOUL COAXING stumbled at the start, remained back while racing toward but not on the inside. ICARUS broke back and was always
outrun. OUTLIER away in good order, pressed the pace from between horses, stopped far turn.

turn, lacked another advance while finishing up clear of the others. KEY TO SUCCESS last to leave, raced in the second flight outside, four wide early turn,
three wide exiting, no kick. SWEET MOTHER MARY was finished early while racing three. LADY DREAMER within striking distance along the inside, faded.

Footnotes
TWENTY TO PARK with the pace from the start, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, drove steadily clear through the stretch under firm handling.
PEPPERONIKID lacked early foot, angled out four wide when beginning to advance late in the turn, finished willingly to be up in time for the place, not a
threat to the winner. YOU VEE CEE in the second flight while three wide and between horses, crept a bit closer while remaining three wide late in the turn,
could do little more with the winner through the lane, caught late for the runner up position. REEF'S DESTINY lacked early foot, dropped to the inside far
turn, improved position while saving ground to the finish. STREET COMMANDER off a step slow, raced back and three wide, continued in that path through
the turn, went evenly through the stretch to remain one paced. ALLO ENRY in the second group while widest up the backstretch, continued four wide turn,
had little left for the stretch run. HERITAGE PARK in the mid pack and along ,the inside, saved ground to no avail. PARTYINTHESTREETS off a step slow,
trailed well back for a half, angled out sharply to be five wide into the stretch, made little impact through the lane. RUDIANO tired while racing in the two
path. OBVIOUSLY TOO dueled up front in the two path, gave way through the stretch.
