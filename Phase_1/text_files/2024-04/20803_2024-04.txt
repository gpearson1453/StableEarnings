RIVER BOAT dueled in the two path early on, spurted clear to go clear as much the best to the wire. EL GUNNER awkward from the gate, good position to
turn, no match to wire. HEAVY HITTER outside chase to the turn, kept on for the show spot. VINO LUX dueled early with winner, could not keep up and
faded back. OVER MY LIMIT never prominent throughout. MANSION PARTY stumbled badly and went to his nose from the gate and lost all chance and
never menaced.
