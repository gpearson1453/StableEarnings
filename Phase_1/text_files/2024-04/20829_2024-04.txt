Footnotes
ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS took control and set the pace along the inside in hand, dictated the pace to the far turn, challenged by a pair of rivals at the quarter
pole, dueled with WEEMISSGRAMMY in the lane, then battled inside foes in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. WEEMISSGRAMMY stalked in the two
path, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole, fought gamely to the wire and got denied. MARINAS TINA (IRE) settled inside early, raced in range two then
three wide on the far turn, tipped out into the stretch, drifted in while rallying at the sixteenth pole and finished gamely three deep on the line. MOMENT'S
PLEASURE tracked the pace from the rail, waited behind the leader on the far turn, coaxed along into the stretch, angled out to make a run but got hemmed
in and lacked room behind the leaders at the sixteenth pole and ran out of time to regain momentum. ADELIE (IRE) tracked two wide, gained while tipping
three wide on the far turn, challenged three deep with a quarter mile remaining, lost touch with the leaders in upper stretch and churned on within range to
the wire. TRUE PATRIOT broke a step slow, tucked inside at the back, trailed two then three wide on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and needed to
find more late. DISRUPTIVE ARTIST broke out, was a bit rank early chasing outside rivals, remained three wide on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
VEGAS BURNER set the pace with WESTERN POWER to the outside, cleared that rival past the five-sixteenths pole, given his cue entering the lane and
started to widen, asked once right handed with a furlong remaining and was geared down late. MR. LEASURE chased under coaxing up the backstretch,
took the turn two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch and bested the rest. ELIGIO tracked the pacesetter from outside, rounded the bend in the three
path and got outkicked for second. INSTINCT D' ORO stalked the pace from inside, roused into the lane and weakened. WESTERN POWER prompted the
pace from outside to the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the winner nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch run. STREET TALKER
was a bit rank while taking a bump from inside early, gained four deep on the turn but flattened out in the lane. SUPREME COAST came out to bump
STREET TALKER early, climbed a bit up the backstretch, trailed two wide into the turn, moved out and exited the bend four wide and failed to menace.

remaining and weakened late. BELLY UP stalked outside a rival, three then four wide on the turn and needed to find more late. DEVIL AMONG US vied for

MS MOAB chased four deep early, took the turn five then four wide, reached the front approaching the eighth pole and drove clear. DONITA ROSE off
alertly then took a stalking position behind the top pair, traveled a bit off the rail on the turn before tipping three wide, challenged three deep at the top of the
stretch but got outkicked by MS MOAB in the final furlong. BLAZING BARDOT chased outside a rival early, three wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch
and got up for third. NANCI GRIFFITH off slow from inside, saved ground through the turn, kept to task along the fence and got edged for third. HIGH
FLYING GRACIE coaxed from the gate, angled down to the two chasing out of range into the turn, continued a bit off the rail into the stretch, steered out in
the lane and summoned a mild rally. ACE ACE BABY dueled for the lead from inside, carried a short lead into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth. CASTAGNA dueled for the lead outside ACE ACE BABY up the backstretch and around the turn, fought between briefly in
upper stretch and gave way. SPICY SPOUSE off slow in the beginning, raced near the back into the turn, ridden along the inside to the stretch and failed to
menace. DIXIE BLAZE chased three deep up the backstretch, dropped back four then three wide on the turn and had little left for the stretch run. SPICY
RIDE broke slow and stumbled at the start, trailed up the backstretch, took the turn three wide and could not make an impact.

UNCLE REG stalked outside a rival then between foes, had to pause in traffic past the quarter pole and again into the stretch, angled out at the top of the
lane, put in late run but was not enough. ROSTOVSKY was off slow then lost his path, split foes early then chased two wide into the turn, had to pause in
traffic behind rivals around the bend, angled out in upper stretch, surged late and gained third. QUINTECENTS came in leaving the gate, vied between
rivals then dueled from outside up the backstretch, fought two wide around the bend, clung to a narrow lead at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly
after and outfinished in deep stretch. ADEBAYO dueled for the lead from inside, fought on from the fence through the lane but was outkicked in the late
stages. GAELIC NATION (IRE) broke a bit slow and had his path taken at the start, traveled at the back outside rivals, drew closer three then four wide on
the turn, moved out widest in the lane and finished evenly late. BOWTIE BOYS stalked from inside, waited along the rail on the turn, moved off the fence in
the lane and lacked bid when called upon. GOOD AT BEING BAD traveled along the inside at the back, dropped back on the turn and came up empty.

PARENTING vied for the lead three deep between rivals then two wide into the turn, moved over to the rail while dueling on the turn, shook free under hand
urging in upper stretch and was ridden out to the wire. SANTARENA raced in range three wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane, finished willingly
and was clearly second best. FAME bumped with PROSPER at the start, tracked off the rail, three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, angled five wide leaving
the bend and was along for the show. PROSPER bumped leaving the gate, vied four then three deep up the backstretch, dueled from outside around the
bend, yielded in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. FAUSTO broke slow and shifted inward leaving the gate, traveled near the back into
the turn, rounded the bend four wide, produced a mild rally in the lane but could not threaten. FACTORY DRIVE bumped leaving the gate, climbed early and
dropped back to last, saved ground through the turn and showed some late run passing tired rivals. BROADWAY UNIONS settled off the pace, chased out
wide then dove down to the inside approaching the turn, went between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped four wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
FIGHT WITH HONOR vied five then four deep early, could not keep up and chased the top pair three wide on the turn, then weakened in the stretch run.
LEGITIFY (IRE) showed early speed between rivals, chased two to three wide on the then turn and faded. MIDDLEBURG bumped in the beginning,
forwardly placed on the inside, got shuffled back on the turn, tipped out into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and could not threaten after. CORSO'S
PICK vied for the lead inside rivals, steadied a bit at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost ground on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
LUNAR IMPACT (GB) closest in pursuit in the two path, took aim leaving the far turn, surged clear when roused at the top of the lane and held well over the
late run from the runner-up. YERWANTHERE (IRE) settled in the two path off the pace, eased out on the far turn and spun four wide into the lane, closed
well from outside but ran out of time. KITTY KITANA (GB) stalked a bit off the rail then moved inside, shifted to the two path on the far turn, tipped out in the
lane and held third. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) stumbled badly leaving the gate and had the rider lose his irons, managed to regained a footing and traveled two
wide at the back early, saved ground along the inside on the second bend, angled out into the stretch and showed late effort to earn a minor award. THIRTY
CARATS tracked three wide early, navigated the far turn two then three wide and flattened in the stretch run. CUSTOMER LIST (FR) unhurried in the early
going and moved inside, chased along the rail then two wide into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, then chased between and failed to menace.
PARIS SECRET (IRE) reserved early on the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch and failed to respond. SPEED LANE sped clear and crossed over to the
control the pace in hand along the inside, remained unchallenged to the quarter pole, threatened from outside entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch and
faded.

Footnotes
SUGAR FISH tracked four deep into the first turn then moved into the three path, went between rivals in the middle stages, rounded the far turn two then
three wide, challenged three deep past the eighth pole, dueled outside LISA'S NONNO in deep stretch and would not be denied. LISA'S NONNO raced up
close in the two path, flanked the pacesetter up the backstretch, challenged on the far turn, inched ahead in upper stretch, fought between to the sixteenth
pole, then dueled inside SUGAR FISH late and yielded grudgingly. FAYETTE FOX stepped to the front and took control of the rail, showed the way up the
backstretch, met the bid from LISA'S NONNO on the far turn, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, fought to the sixteenth pole and weakened. GILA
stalked three deep early, continued three wide into the second bend, started to weaken and drifted five wide into the lane, drifted back to the inside and
churned on for a minor award. INDY'S STAR raced in range on the inside, continued along the fence on the far turn, chased two wide into the drive and
weakened. ZEYARAAT chased three deep into the first turn then steered down to the rail, moved back off the fence and went three wide into the far turn,
angled back to the rail again around that bend and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
SIX MAGPIES (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, settled outside a rival then moved inside, started to move while shifting to the two path on the far turn, had
pause behind rivals late near the quarter pole, moved back to the inside leaving the bend, steered out in upper stretch, launched a rally from outside,
challenged four deep in the final sixteenth and got up in time. GOODFELLA (IRE) stalked along the fence, saved ground behind the top pair through the far
turn, gained an opening along the rail at the top of the stretch, launched a bid and took over past the sixteenth pole but got nailed by the winner in the final
strides. BALDORO dueled for the lead from inside into the clubhouse turn then took control around the bend, set the pace with PRECISION STRIKE to the
outside up the backstretch, maintained command through the far turn, battled between rivals in the furlong grounds, lost command at the sixteenth pole but
stayed on gamely to the wire. PRECISION STRIKE had good early speed dueling from outside, pressed from outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, kept the heat on the BALDORO through the far turn, drew on even terms in the stretch, took a narrow lead approaching the sixteenth pole and
got outkicked in deep stretch. TRACKER chased in the three path early, coaxed along two to three wide on the far turn, moved inward in the lane and
lacked further response. WRONG DIRECTION coaxed early while angling inward, settled outside a rival in the two path, tipped three wide late on the
second bend and could not threaten. ZAFIRO ANEJO stalked two then three wide early, traveled three deep on the backstretch, came under a ride on the
far turn, chased two wide into the lane and faded. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY got crowded between rivals early then settled along the inside, asked along
the rail on the far turn and was never a factor. ZE'DON brushed the gate to lose a step at the start, reserved early and moved into the two path, quickly
dropped back and lagged behind, saved ground around the far turn and never made an impact.
