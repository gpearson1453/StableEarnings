Footnotes
SHARPENYOURFAITH took command on the first turn, opened a clear, well rated lead through the far turn, responded turning for home to widen the
advantage in upper stretch and finished well without a serious threat. MONEY AGENT stalked the winner throughout, made a bid on the far turn to loom at
the quarter pole, could not get to the leader and kept on well down the lane to hold the place. SOLOMON VANDY tracked the pace in striking position
through the final bend, failed to mount a closing rally and finished well enough to hold the show. MY TENNIS SHOES went evenly lacking a closing kick.
BUBBY BOY was one-paced and had no impact. GRAY MIKE was not a factor. EIGHT MAY lunged at the start to break a bit awkwardly, chased the pack
down the backside and faded coming home.

ALDORA set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, responded when called upon to open a clear advantage in upper stretch and drew off. FLATHEAD
FINALE tracked the leaders from two wide to midway on the turn, commenced a rally nearing the quarter pole , angled out in upper stretch and made a
steady advance to be second best. HATTIE BLOOM stalked the pace from the rail saving ground throughout and finished willingly to be the best of the rest.
TILL pressed the pace to the head of the stretch and flattened out in the lane. COLLIER failed to menace. CITY SHACK was never a threat. SPICY
DELIGHT hustled early to be in contention and tired in the stretch.

SHACKLEFORD STRONG stalked the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to sweep up to engage the leader at the quarter pole, disposed of the pacesetter
midway down the lane and held the closer safe in a determined drive. WENT WEST tracked the leaders early, saved ground cutting the corner coming for
home and closed well up the fence only to be denied at the wire in a game effort. CORTESE unhurried early to trail, found his best stride in upper stretch
and closed belatedly to be gaining late. FAITHFUL RULER sped off to a clear lead down the backside, dug-in when engaged at the quarter pole and
weakened in the final eighth. LOOKIN FOR BALA chased the pacesetter for a half mile and faded coming home. TRY TRY AGAIN was not a threat.

CLYDE'S GREEN GO stalked the leaders to the top of the stretch, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter in uper stretch, dueled through the lane and
prevailed in the final strides. JOE THE TAILOR set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, repelled the presser turning for home, was immediately engaged
by the winner, battled that one through the lane and was just out-finished in a very game effort. RHODIUMS PRIDE tracked the leaders into the turn, lost
position on the bend and kept on willingly to gain the show. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS slow early to trail and showed good late interest in the lane.
WILDWOOD RUBEN pressed the pace to the quarter pole and weakened coming home. DEMAND RANSOM reserved off the pace early, ralliedmildly on
the turn and flattened out. DASTARDLY DEEDS failed to menace.

Footnotes
GUN RUSH was pressured on the lead through the first turn, opened a clear advantage down the backside, responded when called upon turning for home
and drew away in the lane as much best. BEEALEA unhurried for the first half mile, rallied four wide around the turn and closed well to gain the place.
COUSVINNYSACANUCK rated in mid-pack down the backside, was put to an early drive while saving ground on the turn and kept-on as best of the rest.
AVIANO trailed early, remained unhurried down the backside and steadily advancd through the balance of the field without impacting the outcome of the
major placings. HOT DAME hustled away from the gate to press the pace in the first turn, continued to prompt the pace through the far turn and weakened
coming home. GLOBAL EMPIRE stalked the pace for a half mile, lacked aresponse when called upon and gave way. WICKED SUPRISE contended early
and dropped back as a non-factor.

Footnotes
TIME HEIST unhurried for the first three-eighths, circled six wide turning for home and closed wel to be clear late. RISKY BOY tracked the leaders from
mid-pack to the top of the lane, was blocked in the stretch while rallying three wide, was taken up to be angled out to the clear in mid-stretch and finished
willingly to be second best. HINK'S PALADIN stalked the pace through the turn, rallied from three wide in upper stretch to take a brief lead inside the eighth
pole and was outkicked late in the drive. REMEMBER THE MAINE slow early to trail, rallied turning for home while swung out well wide and made a late
gain in deep stretch. GALLANT BUCK chased the leaders and lacked a closing bid. BOURBON TEDDY set a pressured pace from the fence to upper
stretch and weakened down the lane. GREENSFELDER was not a threat. ROBUST leaned in on rival leaving the gate, rushed up to press the pace, took
the lead nearing the quarter pole and gave way in upper stretch.

RICHIESONAROLL rated in mid-pack along the fence through the turn, angled four wide turning for home, was put to a drive and collared the leaders in
deep stretch pulling clear late. VALIANT WEST set a pressured pace throughout, responded when called upon in upper stretch, dug-in gamely through the
lane and was outfinished in deep stretch. BEEASY stalked the pace while saving ground and rallied willingly up the fence in the lane. BALADINE pressed
the pace to midway down the lane and weakened in the final eighth. MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SILENT SUNDAY went
one-paced lacking a closing bid. BASEBALL POLITICS contended for the first half and lacked a response when called upon. TWIRLING ROSES failed to

Footnotes
PATRIOT SPIRIT in tight quarters leaving the gate, was given his head to take command shortly after the break, opened a clear lead in the first turn, set a
comfortable, well rated pace down the backside, responded when called upon leaving the quarter pole and drew away through the lane while kept to task
having never been challenged in a well handled ride. REAL MEN VIOLIN hustled up the fence on the first turn to gain a clear stalking position down the
backside, chased the winner through the turn while under a drive, failed to close ground on that one and kept on willingly to be a clear second best.
WOODCOURT tracked the leaders from three wide down the backside, was called upon midway on the final turn and lacked a closing response while
keeping on evenly to be the best of the rest. LE GRIS slow early to be the trailer and never posed a threat. RAGUEL contended early from between horses,
backed out of that spot nearing the five-eighths pole and was never a factor from there. THE WINNING NUMBERS FOR THE PLACE PICK EIGHT WERE

Footnotes
LARRY THE POET broke outward leaving the gate, rushed up the fence to take the lead, set a pressured paceto upper stretch and kicked away late in the
drive. PURPLE OCTOPUS pressed the pace the entire trip, failed to get passed the winner but kept on well down the lane to be second best. LITTLE
STEVEN reserved off the pace, angled five wide at the head of the lane and closed willingly to gain the show. T LAW rated off the leaders to the quarter
pole, swung out six wide in the stretch and rallied mildly. SILVER CHILLER broke alertly, settle into a position to prompt the pace from between rivals down
the backside, was called upon midway on the bend and lacked a response flatteneing out. JET FLIGHT leaned out at the break while bumped, raced near
the rear of the field throughout and never posed a threat. ALIBI IKE squeezed back at the start from between rivals and lost all chance from there.
