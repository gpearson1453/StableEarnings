Footnotes
WOODEN SHIPS settled in the three path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep midway on the far
turn, drew clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. COLD CASH took a quick lead and angled to the inside to show the way, came under pressure past
the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn, dropped back mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. OWE YOU ONE raced in the
three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and just lasted for third. SWIPE THAT
CANDY settled inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the stretch.
LESLIE'S LAYLA showed little response. LIZZY LOU angled in and stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded at
the rail on the far turn. VIESTE raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG SMILE was reluctant to load then angled in and made light contact with Leavenworth leaving the gate, took the lead into the first turn, was urged clear
toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and held on with steady handling. ASPENDOS's rider lost an iron leaving the gate, rounded
the opening turn about the four path then gave chase into the backstretch, raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and held
on for second. TIZAWINNER raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and
four paths and finished evenly while gaining on the runner-up. SUPER BUSTER settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. LOUIE'S HEAT saved ground racing well back on the first turn, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and passed rivals widest. LEAVENWORTH was bumped inward and into IRISH
KING after the start then rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase into the backstretch but flattened stride in the five path on the far turn. The
latter was bumped after the start and raced with the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths
and weakened leaving the far turn. DOWSING ROD saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. OLUDENIZ saved ground, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Big
Smile for interference leaving the gate, lodged by the rider of Leavenworth.

Footnotes
LATE NITE MISTRESS gave chase through the backstretch, dueled to the lead four wide approaching the head of the lane and dug in determinedly to eke
out the advantage over the game effort of SYBARITE, who gave chase outside and raced five wide on the turn, then dug in gamely to the finish.
CONTINGENCY chased through the backstretch, entered the turn off the rail but angled widest approaching the top of the lane and finished well to take
third under the wire. GOLDEN STAR chased through the backstretch and entered the turn off the rail, was hemmed in midway through the turn, angled to
the six path entering the stretch and dug in from that point, but was nipped from third under the wire. UNCONSCIOUS MIND gave chase, raced at the rail on
the turn, lacked room into the lane but finished well when an opening presented itself. LINDA'S TAJ pressured the pace leaving the three eighths pole,
raced three and four wide on the turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. KAPADOKYA pressured the pace while between horses, dueled to a slim
brief lead nearing the quarter pole but was met midway on the turn and faded through the lane. FIREBALL EXPRESS was hustled to the lead leaving the
three eighths pole, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths but remained a factor at the rail through the turn before weakening.

DORADO saved ground on the first turn, started his bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in from the head
of the lane and got up the final yards. CAFFEINENNICOTINE stalked two deep on the opening turn, gave chase into the backstretch and contested at a
close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, took the nod entering the stretch and was steadily encouraged through the lane, but was caught in the
final yards. SOUL CATCHER was reluctant to load and raced in the three path the first turn, eased out leaving the turn and gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and finished well to take third under the wire. MR. DUMBLEDORE saved ground on the first turn,
picked up the chase into the backstretch and raced in the four path on the far turn, finished well but was nipped from third under the wire. PORK CHOP
PETE stalked the early pace then took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, kept the
edge two deep on the far turn but was met entering the stretch and weakened toward mid-stretch. YOUTHFUL ENERGY saved ground, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch but showed little further. CECIL THE GREAT took a slim
early lead inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and picked up the chase into the backstretch, then faded. LAST PARTY showed little response.

ESPRESSO took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge just off the rail on the far
turn, lugged in under right hand urging and made contact with SOCIAL CHIC inside the sixteenth pole and held on under steady encouragement. The latter
rated close inside on the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn, was bumped while in
tight at the rail just inside the sixteenth pole but never lost stride and finished well. MUAD'DIB raced four wide on the first turn and left the turn outside,
started making up ground leaving the half mile pole and raced in range of the lead in the four path on the far turn, dug in to take third near mid-stretch and
finished well. MACHEN'S RIDGE raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
and dug in leaving the turn but flattened stride later yards. BOSS E BOOGS angled in and stalked the pace two deep, challenged leaving the three eighths
pole, raced close in the three path on the far turn then flattened stride leaving the sixteenth pole. CANDY INVASION saved ground on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole then angled out past the five sixteenths pole to avoid a loose rival. ROYAL PAIN settled off the rail the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole but angled out past the five sixteenths pole to avoid a loose rival and showed little more. NO CHANGE settled off the
pace about the three path on the first turn, started his bid past the seven sixteenths pole, was in tight at the five sixteenths then stumbled and lost his rider
past the pole. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed, a claim of foul against the rider of Espresso for interference in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole,
lodged by the rider of Social Chic.

Footnotes
BETCHA BOOTS BABE took over nearing the half mile pole and rated the early pace, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the
turn and extended her lead under steady stretch handling. NEVER WALK ALONE gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. SERIOUS MOMENT gave chase, raced in the four path on the far turn, took third leaving the three eighths pole and finished evenly. BOBBI
TWO STEPS chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened mid-stretch. S S ITS FUN TO RUN gave chase, raced two deep on the turn and ran
evenly through the lane. STORMIN' ANNA chased, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. WAC IS FAST saved ground. GOLDEN RUN was
never a factor. MISS PEARL HART gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then weakened. VIENNA'S TWIRL became
anxious pre-start, hesitated at the break, hopped from the gate and was distanced.
