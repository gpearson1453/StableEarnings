PRINCE MARCO raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and
kicked clear in the lane. CUPID'S DUDE saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around
the second bend and improved position in the stretch. BIG BUCKSALOT saved ground around the first bend, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from
the two path around the far turn, drifted in in upper stretch and weakened late. TWO BY TWO raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half
mile, came around the far turn in the five path and showed no kick. DEEP FAITH raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and tired from there.

Footnotes
CALENDULA raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and held clear to the wire.
WICCA WISDOM raced in the three path early, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the three path and
gained ground late. DRILL'S VALENTINE saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around
the second turn in the three path and gained ground late. OUR LITTLE TIGER saved ground around the first bend, tracked the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and chased on from there. SEIVER raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half
mile, navigated the far turn from the three path and passed tiring horses in the lane. FOXGLOVE raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the
pack for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the far turn and finished evenly. LYRICAL raced in the four path around the
first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the five path and faded in the lane. TEMPEREYA raced in the
three path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and was never a factor.
