GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD trailed for a half, rallied four then three wide through the far turn to make the lead entering the stretch, drew off under right
handed urging and finished full of run to win as much the best while taken in hand late. TIME THE AVENGER was hung five wide into the clubhouse turn,
advanced steadily, dropped inside the top pair nearing the far turn, made the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner.
POKER PARTNER pressed the pace inside the leader off the rail in the four path, kept on but was outfinished. DESTINO contested the lead along the
inside through the first turn, dropped back a bit then went evenly. DARK BARON set the early pace four then three wide and stopped on the far turn.
