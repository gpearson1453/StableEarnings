Footnotes
MOON CONNECTION was with the pace three or four wide to bid clear in the far turn and held the margin under steady handling. FAYETTE WARRIOR
was on the apce along the inside to the far turn, steadied briefly and was angled out in the turn to come four wide into the lane and gained the place.
VERRAZANO FIRST was with the pace from the start, continued from between rivals then moved in entering the far turn and could not produce the needed
late run. TREASURY angled out into the backstretch to bid three or four wide but could not sustain the run. THUNDERSHOOK was always back three wide.
YAYASGOTMOREGAME tired racing out from the rail.

SABER QUEEN stalked the early leader three wide to bid into the lane, wore that one down and prevailed. SEGOVIANA gained a clear lead about the two
path to make the pace to approaching the lane, resisted the winner well but could not keep that one safe. AMERICAN REALITY was angled four wide early
to stalk in reach of the pace but could not keep pace with the top pair. SHE'S MY PRIORITY followed the pace along the inside and weakened. LIL MISS
DE BUY weakened from three wide. MAGIC IN A HAT saved ground and was not a threat. BREWSKY was always back.

REINA DEL SUR settled back off the pace about the two path, rallied three wide in the far turn, shifted outside the leaders in the lane and quickly drew clear
in the final sixteenth. SHACKED STATESIDE showed the most early speed to gain position about the three path, vied outside PALM COURT throughout
then could not handle the winner's late run. GEORGIANO stalked the pace in good position three wide but lacked a final closing bid. PALM COURT
contested the pace inside SHACKED STATESIDE into the lane and came up empty. DOLLY DIMPLE was in reach three to four wide to the far turn and
weakened. MISS GRAND SLAM was not a threat. T R'S FIRST weakened four wide. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN tired from along the inside.

Footnotes
LITTLE BITOTHUNDER rallied outside to bid four and five wide going to the far turn then edged clear through the lane. INEWAGALLIKETHAT contested
the pace between rivals early then could not go with the winner. NAME THE PRICE bid three and four wide going to the far turn and could not sustain the
run. KENHEDOIT saved ground and moved up in the lane but could not threaten late. PICKELJUICE moved up three wide but lacked a solid closing bid.
JUDGE'S BRIBE saved ground and failed to threaten. B T'S BAD BOY weakened four wide. PICKLES N ME was not a factor. MR. BIG SHOT showed
speed along the inside and weakened.
