AWESOME ADRIAN was settled early, then tracked the pacesetter, made a bid to take over and then drew clear, then remained clear to the wire to prove
best under crop urging. ROAD TO OZ was reserved early, jumped well and made a bid on the far turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while
clearly second best in a good effort. SHOOTIST was settled early and jumped well, lacked a serious rally while besting the rest. GREAT ROAD set the early
pace while clear, then was challenged and then had a slight bobble over fence fourteen and then tired. GOODOLDTIMES (IRE) was settled early, then fell
over fence twelve and lost the rider. WITHOUTMOREADO (IRE) was reserved early, then lost the rider after jumping the eighth fence. RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.
