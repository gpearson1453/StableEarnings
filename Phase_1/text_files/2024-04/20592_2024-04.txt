Footnotes
STARSHIP NEBULA showed the way in the two path, held a firm advantage while under a nudge rounding the turn, was coaxed turning into the lane, and
kicked away. EXPLOSIVE EXCHANGE prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path midway around the turn, received a right handed cue
passing the quarter, could not keep up with the winner entering the stretch, but chased on to hold place. IT'S NORA NOW tracked in the three path, floated
out to the five path and was roused midway around the turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the lane, drifted in and out thru the final furlong, and got
up for show. CAJUN FANTASY chased inside, was coaxed in the two path midway around the turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but
evened out. LOVE PARADOX pressed in the three path, lost ground and tipped inside early around the turn, and flattened in the stretch. ACQUIRED
TASTE raced off the pace in the three path but was no menace.

Footnotes
SLIDE SHOW set the pace in the two path and drew off under mild hand urging. KID CAIRO saved ground off the pace and ran on at the rail to gain the
place late. ANNOINTED raced in range three and four wide, lacked the needed rally and held for the show. TOUR THE CITY saved ground in range, tipped
two wide turning for home and faded. DELETED VIDEO had his head turned at the start then was bumped, raced well back inside, went three wide around
the far turn and never threatened. PASSIONED prompted the winner in the three path and faltered. VINO LUX bumped at the start and played no factor
while racing two and three wide.

DON'T GET PICKLED rated in the three path, tipped to the two path while under a ride midway around the far turn, floated out to the four path at the top of
the lane, bid while back in the two path passing the eighth pole, and drew past the outer pacesetter around the sixteenth. BIG BAND LUZZIANN showed the
way in the three path down the backstretch, waited confidently in the two path rounding the far turn, was cued while floating out to the four path at the top of
the stretch, and stayed on, but was caught around the sixteenth by an inner foe to place. GOODBETTERBEST stalked in the four path, was ridden in the
three path around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane and kept on for show. SHE FLED THE SCENE trailed in the four path and made no
impact from the seven path in the stretch. SANDPIPER MEMORIES tracked in the five path but flattened in the stretch. NO WASABI FOR ME raced off the
pace in the two path and never menaced.

Footnotes
K. C. CHIEF set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. HONESTO prompted the winner in the three path around the first turn, chased in the
two path around the far turn, shifted to the rail in the stretch and was clearly second best. ARTEMUS BRIDGE raced off the pace two wide and was along
for the show. BACKWOODS BOOGIE chased the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. PEOPLE FORCE chased the pace three and four wide and
had no reponse. ENSIGN SKIP was reluctant to load, raced three wide and never factored. OFFICER COUNTRY was outrun inside. COBBLE ROAD failed
to menace while racing three and four wide.

ABOVE PAR pressed in the five path, took command while tipping to the three path early around the turn, was cued turning into the stretch, and stayed on
to hold sway. BARBARA had a slow start, trailed in the three path, fanned out to the seven path under a drive turning into the lane, and rallied on her left
lead for place. SASSY MELISSA bobbled at the start, chased in the two path, was roused while tipping out to the four path at the top of the lane, and kept
on for show. DRINKS ON ME prompted the pace in the three path, was nudged along while two wide between foes around the turn, and finished evenly
along the inside in the stretch. FOXY LADY bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked between foes in the four path, was roused into the turn, bumped
with an outer foe in upper stretch, but was outkicked on both sides. AMERICAN GAMBLE bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the five path, was
coaxed midway around the turn, bumped with an inner foe in upper stretch, and flattened. WAR OF AGES vied for the early lead in the two path but
weakened along the rail around the turn, fell in upper stretch, and was vanned off.

PRIVATE THOUGHTS hopped at the start, pressed the pace two wide, took over turning for home and drove clear. EL MATADOR steadied crossing the
wire the first turn, raced in range three wide and kept on through the lane to gain the place. MONEY IN MOTION saved ground in range, tipped two wide
near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. TEAM CAPTAIN raced off the pace three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied
belatedly. FALFURRIAS set the pace along the rail and weakened in the final furlong. BECAUSE THE NIGHT failed to menace while racing two wide.
SECRET LOVER hesitated a bit at the start then bobbled soon after and trailed inside.

Footnotes
TOP MAVERICK showed the way along the inside, was cued while just off the rail midway around the turn, kicked away in the two path turning into the
stretch, and was driven out. BREEZE THE BAYOU prompted the early pace in the two path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, and chased on
from the three path in the stretch for place. GOLDEN SOMBRERO raced off the pace in the four path, was driven in the five path around the turn, swung
from the six path into the lane, and got up for show. CAJUN'S CHOICE broke in at the start, chased inside, angled out to the five path under a drive in upper
stretch, and made no impact. CAJUN FOOL pressed the winner in the two path but weakened along the inside in the stretch. BILLY'S EMPIRE trailed
throughout.
