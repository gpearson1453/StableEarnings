Footnotes
GALLOP D'HERMES prompted the pace in the four path, bid going into the turn, took the lead under rousing passing the three-eighths, opened up on his
left lead from the three path in upper stretch, and held sway. BIGBOUQUETOFROSES broke out at the start, chased in the six path, ranged up in the five
path midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. DOWN IN THE BAYOU stalked in the five path,
was roused from the four path into the turn, but flattened from out in the eight path down the lane for show. NINA'S LAST GIFT set the early pace in the two
path, but lost the lead while under coaxing along the inside passing the three-eighths, and weakened in the stretch. SAUCY SIX bobbled and bumped with
an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path but never threatened from the four path down the lane. OLIVIA'S SPARKLE bumped with an inner foe at the
start, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RUN CARSON was forced in and bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up and
clear late. LAMCARO bumped at the start, saved ground in range down the backstretch, dueled at the rail around much of the turn after the early leaders
blew the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. VICTORY ACHIEVED was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled
four wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show. ARROGANCY was bumped between foes at the start, chased the early pace, inherited the lead
early on the turn, dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened. DE BOER failed to menace while racing two wide. FREGON pressed the pace three
wide, was carried extremely wide by a bolting foe early on the turn, angled back in nearing the quarter pole but was no threat from there. SOAR RICHARD
broke inwardly, raced four wide and played no factor. FOUR BEACH FRIENDS was pinched back at the start, saved ground and made little impact.
GUAICAIPURO pressed the early pace two wide between foes, was carried extremely wide early on the turn and had no further bids. THE DRUNK
NEIGHBOR set the pace along the rail, bolted on the turn, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
INFAMOUS NONO stalked in the four path, was coaxed into the turn, floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, bid on his left lead passing the
eighth pole, and drew clear of the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. TEJOTA set the pace in the four path, waited confidently in the three path rounding
the turn, was roused approaching the quarter, floated out to the six path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, and was caught around the sixteenth
to place. LOOKINASSAH trailed in the two path, was driven in the three path around the turn, and kept on to get up for show late. I AM THE GAME raced off
the pace in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, but finished evenly on his left lead.
PURECRAZIGROOVE veered in at the start, then rushed up to prompt the outer pacesetter in the two path, but faded on his left lead along the inside down
the lane. DANLEY raced wellback in the four path but never threatened. BIG TOBY chased in the five path but never menaced.

Footnotes
TIMAEUS prompted the pace in the three path, took over turning for home and drew off while drifting out a bit under right-handed urging. JONAS' DREAM
set the pace in the two path, was no match for the winner in the lane but held clear of the rest. GOLDEN SOMBRERO chased the pace four wide, continued
on the left lead in the lane and bested the rest. ADIOS PAPA CHICO came out and bumped KINSMAN REDEEMER at the start, raced four wide and was
no threat. KINSMAN REDEEMER was bumped at the start and checked off heels soon after, raced well back inside and lacked the needed rally. BULLET
BLUES hit the starting gate, had brief speed inside and retreated.

Footnotes
LORD OF WAR went clear around the first turn to set an open pace in the two path down the backstretch, was cued along the inside early around the far
turn, kicked away again in the two path at the top of the lane, and held sway. KURAMATA (IRE) had a slow start, rated in the four path, ranged up four wide
rounding the far turn, was coaxed from the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. OCALA DREAM had a slow start, tracked inside, got shuffled back
going into the far turn, then waited along the rail rounding the far turn, was cued in the two path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. TREASURE
KING laid in range from the two path down the backstretch, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the five path entering the stretch, and finished evenly.
SMART STRIKER trailed in the two path, was coaxed in the three path early around the far turn, but made no impact from the six path down the lane.
ROCK THE STARS bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the five path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the stretch, but did not
threaten. MASTEROFTHESENATE raced off the pace in the two path but never factored in the three path down the lane. SIGRUN FAST BOY stalked in the
three path but weakened from the four path in the stretch.

VINDICATE CHA CHA steadied soon after the start, raced in range four wide, tipped widest in upper stretch, kicked in and was up and clear late. ELLAGIO
stalked the pace inside, came through inside of the pacesetter to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, led to deep stretch but
was no match for the winner late. SMART JENNY raced off the pace three and four wide, was in tight quarters between foes much of the stretch run and
rallied for the show. SWEET JUDY BLUE saved ground off the pace, tipped out in midstretch and had a mild rally. TAKE THE COOKIES pressed the pace
in the four path and weakened in the drive. SPIRIT OF VICTORY saved ground and failed to menace. ROSE DANCER hesitated at the start, trailed inside,
swung five wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. KEEP IN TOUCH set the pace in the three path and faltered in the lane. BANANA SPLIT broke
outwardly, raced two wide and made little impact.

MI AMORE laid up close in the three path, was cued to bid midway around the far turn, took command from the four path at the top of the lane, and drew
clear. SINGING SANDRA showed the way in the two path, was cued when challenged midway around the far turn, but lost the lead at the top of the lane,
floated out to the five path while fading, but clearly held place. GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES broke out and bumped an outer foe, then steadied between foes
midway around the first turn, trailed in the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, and was along for show. A PALACE FOR MOM rated in
the three path but never threatened. PALACE ZIP got pinched at the start, then steadied into the first turn, tracked in the two path but weakened turning into
the lane. HOUSE OF MELODY bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path but backed up after a half, and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
REZASROLEX tracked the pace three and four wide, moved to the front in midstretch, quickly clear under a drive and was geared down late. ADIOS COLE
raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide leaving the quarter pole and ran on for the place. EASTBOSTONBENNY stalked the pace inside, angled three
wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally gaining the show. KORRONGO set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane
and weakened. RACING STAR broke a bit slowly, raced off the pace four wide and had a mild belated rally. JABRAN was outrun inside. PACK PLAYS
failed to menace while racing three wide. VINSANITY threw his head then lunged at the start to break well behind the rest and was never involved while
racing well off the rail. OUR LEGAL TENDER pressed the pace in the three path and retreated through the stretch.
