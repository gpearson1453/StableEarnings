Footnotes
SPIRIT OF AKRON tracked the leaders down the backside, rallied up the rail into the turn with an early bid, dueled with the pacesetter from midway on the
turn to inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed in the drive to the wire. MOR CRAFTY set a pressured pace from four wide down the backside, briefly shook
off the early pressure, was quickly engaged by the winner on the bend and battled with that one through the lane in a long drive to be second best.
RAMBLER stalked the pace throughout, lost ground to the leaders on the turn and rallied with a mild late bid in deep stretch. GO TOTHE PRINCIPAL trailed
to midway on the turn and passed a weakened rival nearing the quarter pole without impact. EQUITY CAT pressed the pace for three-eights and faded on
the turn.

Footnotes
SUPPLY CHAIN unhurried early to trail closed to striking distance down the backside, split rivals on the turn, angled five wide at the head of the lane, closed
well and was just up at the wire. AFJAN set a pressured pace throughout, repelled all challenges to mid-stretch, dug-in gamely when engaged by the closing
winner in mid-stretch and was just out-headed at the wire. CRYPTO COPY broke in bumping rival from the gate, dropped back to trail and closed with mild
late interest to be along for the show. HIDDEN ACCESS prompted the early pace from between rival, dropped back losing position on the far turn and came
on again passing tiring rivals in the stretch. FIRST SONG pressed the pace from three wide to the top of the lane and weakened down the stretch. MY TWO
AUNT JOANS tracked the leaders to the far turn, was called upon in an early drive on the final bend and failed to respond.

three quarters and weakened through the lane. SILVER MATT difficult to load pre-race, stalked the pace for a half mile and faded lacking a response. TUFF

STOMPING MOON stalked the leaders down the backside, made an early bid up the fence into the turn, dueled with the runner-up from midway on the turn
to the wire, exchanged bumps late in the lane and prevailed at the wire. STOP BEING GREEDY prompted the pace to the far turn, rallied to the lead from
three wide entering the final turn, battled with the winner the final five-sixteenths, exchanged bumps nearing the wire and just missed on the line. WILEY T
set a pressured pace down the backside while racing two wide, was challenged from the inside and outside nearing the final bend, was in tight quarters at
the three-eighths pole causing the rider to steady and kept on willingly to be best of the rest. EL BAMBINO had no impact. RAY'S EMPIRE was outrun. THE

AWESOME ENOUGH prompted the pace from four wide through the turn, took command in upper stretch and pulled away in the lane. GOLD HERITAGE
stalked the pace through the turn, cut the corner turning for home and rallied up the fence to be second best. TOYI set a well rated pace to the top of the
stretch and weakened in the drive. UNBRIDLED VICTOR well placed tracking the leaders and lacked a closing bid. NAPA DUDE reserved off the pace,
saved ground on the turn and showed some mild interest down the lane. ON HIS TOES chased the leaders throughout and failed to ever menace. THE
EQUINEST tracked the pace in the turn and flattened out.

JOHN'S ROCK stalked the pace through the first turn, moved up three wide to press the pacesetter to midway down the lane and made a steady advance to
wear the leader down inside the sixteenth pole and pull clear late. GRAN ANDREWS pressed the early pace, assumed command on the backstretch,
responded under constant pressure from the winner and was out-finished late in the lane. LOGICO tracked the leaders from striking distance to upper
stretch and kept on in the lane to be best of the rest while lacking a closing rally. CREDIT RIVER flashed brief speed to be the pacesetter to the five-eighths
pole, dropped back down the backside to be off the pace, mounted a brief bid turning for home and flattened out in the stretch. TANTRUM raced wide
through the first turn chasing the leaders and went evenly without impact. DISCLOSURE was not a factor.

POSEIDON'S SON prompted the early pace, took the lead from the fence nearing the quarter pole, dueled with the runner-up through the stretch,
surrendered the lead inside the sixteenth pole and came again determinedly to prevail. LUCKY STREAK stalked the pace from three wide into the turn,
ralied to engage the leader turning for home, battled through the lane briefly taking the lead late and was out-bobbed on the line. MOESTER unhurried to be
near the rear of the field at the top of the lane and rallied belatedly to be gaining late. OKLAHOMA JOE was well placed tracking the leaders into the turn,
tipped out four wide on the turn to mount a rally and failed to close ground. C J ALL THE WAY set a pressured pace to midway on the turn and flattned out.
BURGEE was never a factor.

JOYA DEL SUR set a well rated pace on a clear lead, widened the advantage in upper stretch and was never challenged in the lane. NEAR PERFECT
tracked the pacesetter down the backside, rallied four wide on the turn and finished willingly to be second best. BIG JAVA stalked the leader from the fence
to be well placed on the final turn, was set to an early drive and failed to gain ground. IRON BERTIE prompted the pace from between rivals through the
final bend a failed to mount a closing rally. SHAOLIN reserved off the pace to the head of the stretch and showed some late interest from the rail. IN
TROUBLED WATERS was one-paced failing to be a threat. GO STELLAIRE was not a factor.
