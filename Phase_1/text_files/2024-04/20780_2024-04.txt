PRAY FOR ME RAY broke in and bumped at the start, was carried wide on the first turn, advanced to the second turn, assumed command and drew off
entering the stretch under mild urging. BLOOMING RESOURCE broke in and was steadied at the start, was in tight early, assumed command on the first
turn, set the pace with a clear lead, was headed on the second turn and no match for the winner. LOVESUNFAIR was unhurried early while racing inside,
bid between horses entering the second turn to loom a threat, fell back and hung in the lane. COMPELLING UNCLE stalked the pace, tired entering the
second turn, fell back and faded. MALIBU SANGRIA bore out and was checked hard on the first turn, raced wide and did not threaten. RED FROST was in
tight after the start, raced close to the pace along the inside and gave way into the second turn. STORMIN ATTILA bumped at the start, led into the first turn,
drifted out, dropped back and was through early.

Footnotes
BRASHANKNOWIT set a pressured pace, swung wide entering the stretch, drew clear and held safely while kept to task. AMERICAN OUTLAW bumped at
the start, pressed the pace, was carried out entering the stretch, fell back and continued willingly to earn place. STABILITY bumped at the start, saved
ground mid pack and lacked a stretch response. PANCHO LEFT ME was a bit fractious in the gate and outrun in an even effort. ROLL PENNY ROLL had
an outside trip and was not a factor. SECRET'S DOUBLE showed little.

MAMIE'S LAST HOPE dueled to mid stretch and drew clear to prove best. SERPICO R S S dueled inside to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and
finished second best. HOT CHARLIE was never far back, put in a steady effort and was along for show. OAKES CROSSING broke slowly, went widest in
the drive and showed some late interest. POOF HE'S GONE pressed the pace towards the outside, challenged three wide on the turn, fell back and gave
way. LEAVE THEM BEHIND pressed the pace between horses, was through early, stopped and not urged late.

LIL MISS CASSIE broke sharply, dueled to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while ridden out. SILVERS LAST DANCE broke out, raced
inside, shifted out and rallied into the turn, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. MAUI SUNRISE vied to the turn, fell back, leveled off and
settled for show. WILEO PROCEED broke slowly and was crowded at the start, raced inside, angled out into the turn and offered a mild bid only. EVIL
TEMPTATION raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a factor. MISS TRICKY INDY vied inside early, dropped back and had no further response.
CRYSTAL WHO showed little.

Footnotes
I'M A COOL CAT was never far back, raced outside, rallied on the turn, closed willingly, drew clear and held well. QUANTUM BULL came out at the start,
raced close to the pace, closed steadily, didn't have enough late and finished second best. TATAS JOE MARK vied to the second turn, fell back, regained
the lead, was outclosed and held for show. DAN WHO raced in the back between horses, advanced around the far turn, finished well and was gaining late.
PINEY BLUFF was crowded at the start, raced outside and closed well late. COMING ABSTRACTION broke in, saved ground and lacked a bid. SHAME ON
ROOSTER vied inside around the first turn, fell back and steadily faded. GAMBLING COWBOY failed to threaten in an even effort. RANGER REX vied to
the second turn, drew clear, bolted at the top of the stretch and lost his rider. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the incident in the upper stretch.
No change was made.
