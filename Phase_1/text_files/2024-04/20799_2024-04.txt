Footnotes
GOLDEN TONE bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the
three path coming around the turn and gained ground late to get up for the win. WANDERING WEST stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
came around the turn in the two path and dueled to the wire but was caught late. WAR NOVEL bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, recovered
to lead the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was caught in late stretch. SHAKEM N BREAKEM tracked the leader between
horses early, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. PRIVATE NETWORK trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the three path and made no bid. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR bobbled leaving the gate, bumping with the horses to both sides in the process, recovered to chase
the leader up the rail through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the two path and faded from there.
