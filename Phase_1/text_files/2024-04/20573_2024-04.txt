CARNIVORE settled off the pace outside, bid wide in the stretch and was up in the final stride in a tight finish. RUNANDSCORE dueled inside, lost the
advantage in midstretch,then battled to the finish just missing. TRAFFIC MASTER well placed outside the dueling pacesetters, led briefly in the stretch and
continued willingly. I DON'T SEE COLORS alternated for the advantage outside then weakened in the final furlong. DANCE A DINI dropped back in the two
path and gave way on the final turn. THE GATEKEEPER trailed racing wide and was never in contention. GUCCI MAN was urged off the leaders inside and
stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
HEY WHAT'S UP was bumped at the start, set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the turn, raced well off the inside, responded when
roused and held well under urging in the final furlong. HARRISON C was reluctant to load, raced five wide early, stalked the pace, chased on the far turn,
rallied near the inside in the stretch run and finished evenly late. UTILITY was reluctant loading, bobbled at the break, pulled early on the inside, raced off
the pace, advanced at the quarter pole and gained mildly for third. MARINE PATROL was pinched back at the break, outrun early and closed belatedly for
fourth. LOVE IS FOREVER broke in bumping a rival at the start, stalked the leader, chased on the far turn and tired in the final furlong. DRY DOCK was off
a bit slow and outrun inside.

Footnotes
MISS CINNAMON raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, drifted out in the stretch and remained clear. MY FOREVER FRIEND settled off the pace, bid
wide on the final turn, altered course near midstretch and was outfinished. INTRO dropped far behind then rallied mildly to be easily third. WARRIOR ON
THE RUN raced within striking range early then faltered. PROBLEMS ABOUND hustled to a clear lead for half a mile, raced a very erratic course in the
stretch while fading. NURSE CARALYN moved closer before half a mile then gave way readily. ME SO LUCKY dropped back early and trailed throughout.
Following an objection by the second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch, MISS CINNAMON was disqualified and placed second.
