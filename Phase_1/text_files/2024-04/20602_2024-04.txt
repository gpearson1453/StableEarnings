Footnotes
LASER SHARP chased along the inside and was very briefly taken in hand lightly when ALEAH ALEAH tucked directly in front five and a half furlongs from
home, tipped to the two path and chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking back inside into the turn, advanced along the inside and
appeared ready to tip out just inside the five-sixteenths but thought the better of it with a rival outside and was forced to steady off the heels of ARTETA
before cutting the corner into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, drifted out safely clear two paths while edging away to the finish kept to
task. ALEAH ALEAH chased just off the inside, briefly tucked inside at the five and a half furlong marker forcing LASER SHARP to very lightly take hold,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole just off the inside and was brushed lightly by LASER SHARP as that foe steadied in behind ARTETA, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. ARTETA bobbled at the break, dueled inside of TWO TONS OF FUN coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out and weakened in the late stages.
TWO TONS OF FUN dueled two to three wide with the aforementioned foe to the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the late going. GUILE got away to an awkward start breaking inwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. SUPREMACY CLAUSE coaxed from the gate, chased four then two wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. PICCATA PRINCE chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs
out, tipped four to five wide into upper stretch, faltered in the drive. There was a claim of foul by the rider of ALEAH ALEAH alleging interference against
LASER SHARP near the quarter pole. After review, the claim of foul was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared
official.

Footnotes
LITTLE LUCA displayed early speed, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when asked near
the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, extended the advantage while off the inside in the final furlong and proved much the best under
strong urging. PERSISTENT DANGER pressed the pace outside of the leader, chased in the two path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the
final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. GRAYWING was taken up when shut-off early, settled on the outside, was urged four then five
wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the top two to the finish and missed the place while clear for the show. LAUREL VALLEY
was taken in hand behind horses near the five-eighths pole then dropped back, came under urging before the nine-sixteenths, raced inside for most of the
turn then moved to the two path and failed to rally. SHARPAZ tracked the pace on the inside of a rival, chased in the three path on the turn and tired.
FORTUNE'S NEPHEW settled at the rear, was taken in hand near the five-eighths pole, went two then three wide for a majority of the turn then shifted four
wide late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KAZMIKE angled in early, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on
the turn, dropped back into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
POST TIME was last of the quartet to commence, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide later on the bend,
rallied outside under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was carried out badly in the final furlong, gained under a right-handed crop to get the lead in the
final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. CASTLE CHAOS settled on the inside of an opponent, came under urging leaving the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner while put to the crop into the stretch, rallied to make a bid in the final furlong, fought with the winner in
the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place. SUPER CHOW moved in while easily going to the front, showed the way in hand through
tepid fractions, vied inside on the turn, shook off a foe when asked near the five-sixteenths, came off the inside into upper stretch, drifted out badly in the
drive and was overtaken while able to get third. WHITTINGTON PARK angled to the far outside in the early going, tracked the pace while well out in the
track, moved in late on the backstretch, made a bid in the three path early on the turn, lost touch with the leader late on that bend, chased that foe under a
drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick.

AL'S RUBY dueled three then two wide with MY KINDA MISCHIEF to her outside, had FOCUS POCUS come up the inside and was displaced in tandem
with her main pace rival five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch shaken off a bit but roused for the drive, rallied to come again and
take back the front just outside the sixteenth pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. FOCUS POCUS broke out at the start bumping PAMPLONA
RED, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the three-eighths and tucked inside advancing at that station to take command near the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch shaking clear, dug in under a drive and was caught just outside the sixteenth marker, ran on to
preserve the place honors on the wire. CALLING AN AUDIBLE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, offered up a bid continuing
just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to procure the show honors. FIVE TO TWO chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MISS LAO broke a beat slow when hesitant at the start, chased three then
two wide, got taken hold of briefly near the five-sixteenths in behind PAMPLONA RED and CALLING AN AUDIBLE, angled out seven wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. DUBAWI WOWIE seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. ADDAGIRL ADDIE broke in at the start, chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. PAMPLONA RED got bumped at the start
by FOCUS POCUS, who broke outwards, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three to two wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. KAATERSKILL chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
five wide for home, tired. MY KINDA MISCHIEF dueled four then three wide with AL'S RUBY to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when
in the midst of being shaken off, swung three to four wide at the top of the stretch and faltered.

SHIDABHUTI tracked the early pace, dropped back under urging near the eleven-sixteenths then moved in, was roused in the two path on the turn, angled
out into upper stretch, reached the five path near the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole
and got up to prevail. AIN'T BROKE was taken up while in tight quarters early then dropped back, settled on the outside, moved closer while in hand near
the nine-sixteenths pole, made a bid around the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the four path on the turn, took the advantage while asked for her best into
upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. FINGAL'S
CAVE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while urged along on the turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong and tired while able to get the show. APPLE PICKER settled towards the back, was roused while moving from the rail to the three path on the
turn and lacked the needed response. HOT FUDGE bobbled at the start then was hustled to the front, showed the way with some company to her outside,

rivals to vie briefly before taking command near the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, shook away to a clear lead a furlong out,
dug in under lone threat and was overthrown just inside the sixteenth pole, kept on clear of the rest to the finish to be along second best. ELIMINATE broke

near the fallen foe inside the three-sixteenths pole and had nothing left. EVENING NEWS was hustled to the front, went around the opening bend in the two

Footnotes
PEONY chased along the inside until tipped to the two path just inside the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
nearing the eighth pole, edged away under a drive getting geared down in the final jumps to the finish. GRANADILLA coaxed from the gate, cut the pace
along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole,
ran on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. BETTER BE SMART lost her rear footing at the start, chased four then three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. ARIANA RYE coaxed from the start, chased three then
two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was outfinished in the late stages. SPIRIT OF
ESTHER chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the
finish. SHEHANAH chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, shied in being shown a right handed crop and brushed the rail at the three-sixteenths, then made no
late headway. MARY UNION AVE chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before darting to the rail near the half mile pole, came under
coaxing midway on the turn, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch and came up empty.
