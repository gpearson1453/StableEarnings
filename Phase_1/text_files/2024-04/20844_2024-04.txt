Footnotes
TEXAS MOONSHINE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the first turn, began to advance midway down the backside, rallied
smartly three wide through the final turn to take a narrow advantage into the lane, and held off an inside rally by DIVAANY to prevail. DIVAANY broke
sharply, but was allowed to settle off the pace entering the first turn while saving ground at the rail, commenced a ground saving rally through the final turn,
and closed willingly from the inside of TEXAS MOONSHINE through the lane to just miss. STANFORD NORTH away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into
the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, clipped heels when EARS TO US drifted leaving the turn, and faded
in the lane. EARS TO US away well and rushed to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside while
racing out from the rail, maintained his advantage into the final turn, began to drift out leaving the turn, and had nothing to offer late.

into a tracking trip two out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in
the drive to prove second best. ISLAND LIVING stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, and closed evenly from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. VALERIE VALESKI broke sharply and tracked the leader into the
first turn while racing one out from the rail, chased the pacesetter to the final turn before weakening.

LUCKY FORCE away well and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, eased off rail to commence his bid entering the
final turn, and prevailed over a very stubborn CEREBRO in the final strides. TIME TICKER unhurried early, and trailed the field into the first turn, bided his
time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, finished with late interest while unable to make
an impact. CEREBRO broke sharply and raced to the lead in the run to the first turn while getting to the rail, controlled the pace in the run down the
backstretch, was collared by LUCKY FORCE entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly in the closing strides to just miss. FLORIDA GATOR away alertly
and tracked the pacesetter into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide into
the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share.

Footnotes
DEPUTY'S DANCER away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of KNOPFLER entering the first turn, continued to battle with that rival in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, and prevailed over that stubborn rival in the final strides to prove best. KNOPFLER away alertly and vied for
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of DEPUTY'S DANCER in the run down the backside and through
the final turn, and just missed following a stretch long battle. FRANKIE MACHINE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, commenced his bid three wide entering the turn, and finished full of run four wide in the lane to
get up for a share. JUVEE TOO unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed with
late interest three wide in the lane to finish on even terms with VALUABLE COWBOY. VALUABLE COWBOY was fractious prior to the start, and hopped
before being squeezed between rivals in the opening strides, settled well off the early pacesetters in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering
the final turn, and closed from along the inside in the drive to finish on even terms with JUVEE TOO. DEALERS HAND broke outwards and bumped with
VALUABLE COWBOY in the opening strides, stalked the leaders one out from the rail entering the backside, saved ground at the rail through the final turn,
and finished two wide from between rivals in deep stretch drive. SOMTHING ELUSIVE broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch
while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, but faded in the lane. MORETHANSOULTITLE stalked the early pace while
racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked he needed closing response when called upon.
RING OF KERRY settled well off the contested early pace, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.
