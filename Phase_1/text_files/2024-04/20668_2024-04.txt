Footnotes
TILTED TOWERS led from an inner vying rival into the turn, opened up turning for home, then held sway through the lane while hanging on his left lead.
FIGURETI (CHI) brushed an outer rival soon after the start, vied inside of the eventual winner early on, failed to match strides approaching the five
sixteenths pole, shifted outside of his clear counterpart entering the lane and was second best. SPYCRAFT chased the embattled leading pair from the four
path, failed to threaten them and proved best of the rest. RIVOLI chased along the inside, swung to the five path entering the lane and moved up. HOLIDAY
HOUSE tracked two wide and between horses, then failed to menace. ONE FOR RICHIE broke a beat slow then steadied when put to cramped quarters
between horses at the start, was urged along off of the pace in the two path into the turn, fanned out to the six path entering the lane and lacked a rally.
COYOTE ROAD brushed with an inner foe shortly after the off, lacked speed in the three path and never got involved. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER trailed in the
four to five path and got outrun.

Footnotes
SHARP SHOT showed the way in the two path, met an outer challenge turning for home, drove clear of that one at the three sixteenths pole and drew off.
MASTER OF THE NITE stalked the leader from the three path, bid outside of that one turning for home, but proved no match in upper stretch, then saved
place from an outer late bidder. QUEBRANCHO was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe and got rank in cramped quarters leaving the chute, tracked
in the four path around the turn, ran on to bid for place in the final sixteenth but hung late. NO BRAKE NEEDED came in at the start and brushed a rival,
saved ground off of the pace and moved up inside of foes. HIGH ALERT tracked along the inside, moved to the three path entering the lane and failed to
menace. BATTLE BORN tracked two wide and between horses, pursued from the three path around the turn before floating to the five path entering the
lane, then failed to threaten. PORT ROYAL steadied between horses leaving the chute, lacked speed in the four path, swung out to the seven path entering
upper stretch and improved. LIQUOR TALK broke a step slow, raced at the rear just off the inside and made little impact. ELM STREET bumped an outer
rival leaving the chute, stalked close up along the inside, chased around the turn then weakened between horses. SHANNONRUN broke a step slow before
being bothered by an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. IF I WERE YOU prompted outside of rivals briefly,
was lightly brushed by an inner foe leaving the chute and steadily faded thereafter. ERASMUS pursued from the five to six path and weakened.

Footnotes
PYRENEES set a pressured pace in the two path, dueled with an outer rival around the far turn, shook free entering upper stretch, drove clear and drifted
out. THE PRINCE'S SPUR tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair and to the four path turning for home, got floated to the five path entering
the lane, yet ran on willingly to gain place at the furlong grounds and was second best. CYCLONE MISCHIEF broke a bit outwardly, pressed the leader from
the three path, dueled with that one around the far turn, but failed to keep pace while drifting to the four path entering the lane and gave way. SPENCER'S
BOY LUNA trailed in the three to two path, then moved up. BABA VOSS laid off of the pace in the two to three path and failed to factor. TALL BOY tracked
in the four path, pressed the top pair entering the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn and was eased through the lane.

JUST BETTER prompted the leader from the three path, vied before clearing into the far turn, then drew off under a drive. PURLOIN tracked along the
inside, saved ground, gained place entering the lane and was second best. BELLA CRUELLA led inside of a prompting rival around the first turn, vied with
that one before proving no match entering the far turn, chased in the four path around that bend and weakened. ENZI raced off of the pace in the four to five
path, then in the two path around the far turn and made little impact. SPICE stalked in the four path, but faded between horses with nine sixteenths to go,
was done early and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HOT BEACH showed the way in the two path, drove clear of an outer rival entering the lane and held sway. ZOE'S PRIME stalked the leader from the three
path, chased that clearing rival in upper stretch and safely held place. KODIAC WINTERGREEN (IRE) broke a beat slow while last away, laid off of the pace
in the three path, split foes entering the lane in the four path and ran on willingly hanging on her left lead. BIG TROUBLE transferred contact from an inner
rival to an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the five to six path and stayed on to narrowly prevail for fourth. ANTIQUE SILVER raced off of the
pace in the four path and between horses, tucking to the inside turning for home, then failed to menace while missing in the photo for fourth. MIDNIGHT
ANGEL chased forwardly in the two path and faded between horses. FOXXY CLEOPATRA took contact to her hind quarters from an inner foe at the start,
tracked in the four path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and tired between horses. GREAVETTE broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start,
trailed in the six path and got outrun.

Footnotes
SUNCROFT rushed forward to show the way in the two path as outer rivals applied pressure down the backstretch, moved to the inside into the turn,
sparred with an outer bidder around the bend, drove clear of that one in upper stretch and held from a late challenger. CLASSIC LEGACY raced at the rear
two wide into the turn, paused nearing the three furlong pole, progressed tipping to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, fanned six wide entering the
lane, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth but needed more to offer a bid. BATTLEOFLEXINGTON lacked speed along the inside,
advanced inside of foes around the turn, then sustained progress to edge show entering the final sixteenth. MAGIC EXPRESS tracked along the inside,
shifted to the four path entering the lane, chased hanging on his left lead before being outkicked and put to tight quarters in midstretch, then kept on mildly.
TUNISIAN SPRING took light contact from an inner foe soon after the start, stalked in the five path, moved forward into the turn to bid and duel for the lead
two wide turning for home, but yielded to the pace setter in upper stretch and tired between horses. BRAMITO pursued from midpack in the three path
around the turn, shifted to the two path entering the lane and lacked a bid. NO NO JOE raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, shfited to the
four path entering the lane and failed to menace. LAVER steadied back from between horses at the three quarter pole, retreated before racing well back five
wide and failed to factor. B SUDD transferred light contact from an inner rival to an outer foe soon after the start, prompted in the four path and between
horses, chased the top pair from the three path turning for home, drifted to the five path entering the lane and weakened between horses. POLSTER
brushed an outer foe soon after the start, raced forward briefly, but gave way after a furlong and a half and steadily faded. PERFECT EDGE prompted in the
three path and between horses, but faltered entering the turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MASTER OF THE SEAS (IRE) stalked along the inside, searched for racing room off of the rail entering the lane, yet tipped at the three sixteenths pole to
commit to a charge inside of the drifting leader, surged and kicked clear approaching midstretch, then inched further away with a strong finish. NAVAL
POWER (GB) was shuffled back as an inner foe took his path at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, crept closer before awaiting racing room behind
rivals nearing the lane, split foes four wide in upper stretch, claimed place at the furlong grounds and chased his stable-mate home to prove second best.
INTEGRATION laid off of the pace three wide, then four wide around the far turn before fanning to the seven path entering upper stretch, but only offered a
mild kick in pursuit and edged show in the final sixteenth. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT tracked two to three wide around the opening bend, pursued between horses
turning for home before floating five wide entering the lane, ran on to gain show in midstretch but was bested by an outer rival for that position in the late
stages. EMMANUEL showed the way remaining a path or two off of the inner rail, shifted further out clinging to an advantage in upper stretch, but offered
little resistance to an inner challenge inside the three sixteenths pole and faded. KUBRICK (IRE) pressed outside of the leader, attempted a bid entering the
lane, but was outkicked by an inner bidder in upper stretch and tired between horses.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RAID stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid and assumed command entering the lane, then drew off
under moderate urging. LAUGHINALLTHEWAY showed the way around both turns, but proved no match for an outer bidder entering the lane, gave way
before being confronted by an inner challenger for place in the final furlong and lasted. TAGLIATELLE was bumped by an inner rival at the start and trailed
early on, rallied splitting foes in the three to four path around the far turn, sustained progress to bid for place along the inside in the final furlong but hung.
GILDED CRAKEN pursued two wide and between horses, got shuffled back approaching the far turn, took that bend in the five path and moved up. MY
FRIEND LOUIE was squeezed between horses and steadied back at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, altered course to the three path
nearing the lane and failed to menace. LONGSHADOW was bumped and put to crowded quarters between horses at the start, settled well back along the
inside, shifted out entering the backstretch, advanced in the five path with nine sixteenths to go, chased in the four path around the far turn and weakened
turning for home. EJTIMAA tracked in the four path, took closer order to press the leader at the nine sixteenths pole, sustained pressure two wide around
the far turn and faded nearing the lane. WASHINGTON'S UNION pursued two wide and between horse, checked back around the first turn and failed to
factor. STOP THE SPREAD pressed three to two wide around the first turn, but faltered between horses approaching the far turn, was pulled up nearing the
lane and walked off.
