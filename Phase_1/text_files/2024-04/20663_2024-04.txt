Footnotes
MAJESTIC ARC showed early speed, angled in quickly near the three-quarter pole, moved clear outside the five-eighths pole, controlled the action in the
two path on the turn, responded well while set down in the four path into upper stretch then drifted further out, came under a right-handed crop near the
furlong marker, remained under the crop until just before the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the finish while best. CREATION OF
ADAM was carried in near the three-quarter pole then settled off the pace, went two then three wide under urging on the turn, was driven five wide into the
stretch then moved further out, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth and willingly earned the place. CITIZEN MACK dropped back early then climbed
some near the three-quarter pole, was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, drifted out late and safely secured the show. MODEL
S angled inward in the vicinity of the three-quarter pole, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the
stretch then moved in and came up empty. KING OF FRANCE chased the pace on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into
the stretch and tired. VIEJO VERDE was off slow then slow into stride while corrected hard by the rider as he veered inward, angled out while climbing
some at the rear, went five wide around the first half of the turn, dropped to the three then two path later on the bend and was no factor.

UNIQUE INSIGHT coaxed from the gate directly to the front, showed the way along the inside through the first turn before taking to the two path down the
backstretch, tucked back inside through the far turn and was let out nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under
a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish, kept to task. CORPORATE POWER broke in at the start and was corrected, raced along the
inside through the first turn before chasing three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. CAPITAL IDEA just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. LIGHTLINE coaxed from the start, raced just off the inside through the opening bend, chased four then
three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered three wide at the head of the stretch, tired. BROWN DON'T STOP coaxed from the gate, raced
three wide through the first turn before chasing five to six paths off the rail down the backstretch, began to lose touch with the field tucked four wide into the
far turn and was briefly coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, got guided six to seven paths off the inside into upper stretch and was eased home to a walk
well behind.

moved in late on the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear under the crop outside the furlong
marker, was given one final light reminded with the crop outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under a hand-ride to the finish while much the best.
CONNIVING was hustled from the gate, moved to the lead with six furlongs to run, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenth pole, was
headed outside the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner outside the furlong marker and tired but just held the place. BOUNTEOUS broke a step slow,
was urged along at the rear, moved in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, angled out in upper stretch and improved to just miss
the place while able to get the show. ALLEGRINI was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the four path, remained
on his inside lead in the stretch and lacked the needed response. STATES UNITED was crowded between horses early, settled well off the pace, was
roused in the two path on the turn and failed to rally.

SANDY SWEET TOOTH coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under pressure
briefly from a pair of rivals, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. Z DANCER brushed the near side stall at the
start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, offered up a bid swinging four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to preserve the place honors over a rival on the wire. CLANCY FANCY lunged at the break, chased four wide under coaxing from the

SUBROGATE moved up under urging on the outside then chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, gained to make an outside bid in upper
stretch, remained on his inside lead while on even terms for the lead into the final furlong then took the advantage, remained on his inside lead to the finish
and held under strong urging. RADIO RED was loaded with the assistance of a blindfold while reluctant to load, raced towards the rear under urging, shifted
from the rail to the three path while under extra left-rein pressure outside the three-eighths pole, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final
furlong and closed fast to just miss while clear for the place. EXCELLENT TIMING broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the
stall, angled in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage through quick fractions, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was
challenged while under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead just inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the show. BE THE BOSS was
ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response then was reported to have bled.
KINGDOM was hustled from the gate, showed speed then chased the pace, climbed some outside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, came out
into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and tired. KOOL KATHMANDU settled off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, moved from
the three path to the two path early on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND raced towards the rear, steadied
briefly off heels near the half-mile pole, was roused three then four wide on the turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE SHAKE five then four wide in aim of the leader, advanced to take narrow command at the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and went six wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. MONTEBELLO hustled from the gate, came under a left handed crop
five furlongs from home while in pursuit four wide down the backstretch, came under a right handed crop nearing the three-eighths and was placed to
coaxing tipped five wide at that station, went nine wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors.
MIDNIGHT WORKER coaxed from the start, dueled from the two path with FACE ABARRIO to his outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths having
shaken off his main pace for and confronted by the top one, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to run, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. NEWPORT BRIDGE coaxed from the gate, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into
upper stretch and tired. FIGHT FIERCELY coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the two path into upper stretch and made no impact. FACE ABARRIO dueled from the
three path with MIDNIGHT WORKER to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded through the latter portion of the turn, swung five wide
into upper stretch and folded.
