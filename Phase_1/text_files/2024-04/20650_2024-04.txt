Footnotes
CIVIL NOTION pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid two wide on the turn, dueled, gained a short lead, edged away, then dueled with LOVELY
CHARM in the final sixteenth and prevailed determinedly. LOVELY CHARM stumbled badly at the start and bumped a rival, chased inside, saved ground on
the turn, waited briefly near the quarter pole, rallied on the rail in the stretch run, dug in gamely and dueled to the wire. DIVINE ROMANCE chased two wide,
chased between rivals on the turn, bid and finished evenly in the lane. FANCY WARRIOR set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn and
weakened in the final furlong. TRUE PHENOMENON was bumped at the start, raced three wide off the pace, went four wide at the quarter pole, rallied
outside, then flattened out. SNOW LAKE bumped after the start, raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and had no rally. MAMMA MIA ESTERINA
was bumped hard and steadied back at the start, outrun early and did not factor. ANGELIC STORM was bumped after the start, raced three wide off the
pace and gave way. SWEETEST MOMENT raced off the pace inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
LAZARETTO vied between rivals early, shook loose inside on the turn, drifted out but stayed safe through the stretch. EMPIRE'S SCORE prompted the
pace three wide then continued well for the place. WE READY far behind early, advanced inside, angled out in the stretch and rallied. REJECTED AGAIN
raced just off the leaders then flattened out in the stretch. NICK THE CARDSHARK trailed for half a mile then offered some late energy. STAR WEAVER
lacked speed racing very wide on the turn and was no factor. JACK BEANSTALK saved ground off the pace and was never in contention. EXTREME
FORCE forced pace along the inside then began tiring on the turn. REFUND RIGLER flashed speed then stopped abruptly.

GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS bobbled at the break, stalked three wide, rallied three wide into the stretch and drew clear under urging. CATCH MY VIBE
stalked between rivals, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside and dug in to earn the place. BAD GUY raced off the pace inside, angled out in upper
stretch, then angled back in and rallied inside. SEVEN IS A BREEZE raced off the pace, off the rail, moved up entering the stretch and gained mildly
outside. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY tracked close up on the inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, then faded. LUCKY AS A SEVEN set the pace,
dueled into the stretch and gave way. STRUM AND PLUCK raced off the pace and did not factor.

CONFIRMED STAR split rivals to the front after quarter mile then quickly drew off under wraps through the final furlong. CHIT CHAT CHUB raced close up
wide down the backstretch, bid on the turn but was no match for the winner. SEEYOUATTHEHOP broke slowly, steadied in tight near the far turn then
rallied very wide. KOKOPELLI GIRL rated close up inside then began faltering on the turn. WARRIOR'S TREASURE earned a narrow advantage early, vied
the winner briefly and gave way. NEVA'S GIRL forced the pace outside in the opening quarter then gave way. CHERISHED WISH lost her action nearing
the far turn losing any chance. MY BROWN EYED GIRL was eased back early then far back throughout.

Footnotes
VITAEMI set the pace on the inside, showed the way on her own past the quarter pole, turned back a bid from the runner up and drew clear under a
confident hand ride throughout. MAZAL EIGHTEEN chased close up two wide, bid on the turn, dug in gamely outside of the winner, but was no match and
remained clear for the place spot. GIA'S FUEGO chased between rivals, chased on the turn, rallied mildly inside in the lane and got third. LEVIOSA chased
inside, chased on the turn, angled out into the lane and rallied mildly outside. STARSHIP ROGUE steadied at the start, was outrun early, advanced inside
on the turn and closed belatedly on the rail. VANISHING FAITH raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the turn and weakened. MISS ALEX was
outrun early and passed tired rivals. PEYTON'S COLLEGE chased three wide and faded. TILSA was off a bit slow, outrun early and did not factor. KNOCK
OUT KID raced off the pace and did not factor. XENATOWN raced off the pace inside and gave way.
