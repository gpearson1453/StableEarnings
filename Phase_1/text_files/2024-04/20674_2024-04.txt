Footnotes
LAST BABY was sent to the front and opened up a clear lead on the field, held into the turn, met a challenge posed by CONEJO MALO from the
three-eights pole, later joined by MR. DUFF, held both at bay the length of the stretch and won driving in a determined effort. CONEJO MALO broke well but
was content to sit just off the pace in the initial furlong, dropped back heading into the turn then started a bid after passing the three furlong pole, came three
wide into the stretch, finished well in the final furlong, challenged the winner in deep stretch but could not get by the determined LAST BABY and held for
second. MR. DUFF under a ride early, stalked behind LAST BABY to the turn, moved to challenge for the lead from the three-eights pole but was rebuffed,
continued to doggedly chase that foe to the wire but came up short and was passed near the wire for second. LISA'S DOCTOR S broke out at the start,
bothered a neighboring rival and raced a bit greenly in the initial stages, saved ground into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and lacked a final kick. LETSGOTOTHEBAR took back off of the moderate early pace, chased between rivals approaching the turn, got caught
in tight nearing the three furlong marker and took up at that station, trailed to the quarter pole and chased three wide into the stretch, could not impact the
leaders into deep stretch but showed good late interest. EL GOLOSO bothered by a neighboring rival at the start and was off a bit slowly, allowed to settle in
the early running, raced between runners nearing the half-mile marker and chased two wide into the turn, was outrun into the stretch and did not threaten in
the final furlong.

Footnotes
RIVER MARKET broke well and seized the early lead without being pushed, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run,
maintained a clear lead to the quarter pole, felt mild pressure from the runner-up into the final sixteenth, was kept to task into deep stretch and held safely
for the win at the finish. OOPS (GB) broke a beat slow and was not asked for speed held up at the rear of the compact field, launched a bid through the turn
and took to the inside when MAMARANDO abandoned the rail, tipped out to the two path for the stretch run, finished up well but was unable to reel in the
winner. HANG ON stalked behind RIVER MARKET to the far turn, went into a stiff drive with three furlongs to go but was unable to cut into the margin of the
leader, weakened in the final furlong and held for the show honors. MISS PERU broke well and was up close going into the first turn but opted to settle near
the rear, just in front of OOPS (GB) and out in the two path, was last going into the turn, came under a ride from the three-eighths pole and finished evenly.
MAMARANDO veered outward at the start but avoided any contact, then hustled but outrun to the first turn, stayed inside and was put under a strong hold
for the run down the backstretch, was let loose passing the half-mile marker, shifted three wide into the far turn, swung four wide for the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS broke well and stalked EFFECTIVE GIG just to the outside, was content with that position until well into the far turn, always
traveling well, bid in earnest from the quarter pole, battled EFFECTIVE GIG to mid-stretch, took command passing the furlong marker and drew clear in the
end under steady handling. WRONG SPOT tracked well behind the leaders in the early running, launched a three wide bid with about three furlongs to run,
came into the stretch three wide, closed well into the final furlong and earned the place honors despite jumping tire tracks in deep stretch. EFFECTIVE GIG
pushed to the front from the break, seized the early lead and set a pedestrian pace, pressed by CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS just off the flank to the outside,
was able to dictate the pace to the far turn, was taken on by that rival nearing the quarter pole, hung in for a bit but proved no match, was passed late for the
second spot and just held for third. PLAYBOY STYLE was bumped off stride by MAGICISTHEMOONLIGHT at the break, was slow into stride then checked
off heels going into the first turn, raced at the rear of the field for a half-mile, stayed to the inside through the turn, came under heavy pressure from the
quarter pole, gained ground while maintaining an inside path into the stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly.
MAGICISTHEMOONLITE broke in and bumped PLAYBOY STYLE hard, then got inside position for the race to the turn, checked hard near the
seven-eighths as the field bunched up, became rank and hard to place, continued to fight the rider down the backstretch, came under a drive passing the
nine-sixteenths pole, did not respond and trailed to the wire.

Footnotes
ACCLIDER unhurried early, raced with the tracking group well behind the trio contesting the early pace, swung four to five wide into the stretch, hooked up
with HOT JOURNEY in a spirited duel to the wire, got a head in front in the final yards and prevailed. HOT JOURNEY settled well behind the leading trio
and at the head of the trailing group, bided time to the far turn then began a three wide move through the turn into contention, took a short lead turning for
home while behind challenged to the outside by ACCLIDER, battled gamely down the stretch but came up short at the wire in a good effort and was well
clear of the rest for second. MACLEAN'S RHYME was allowed to settle near the back after the break, saved all the ground, improved position through the
turn, waited for room approaching the stretch, rallied through narrow opening along the rail at the furlong marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and
held well for third at the finish. LAURA'S KIDOUGH bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, lacked any speed from the break and was last early,
continued to trail the field into the far turn and went three wide to the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and just
missed for third. HALLISAR tracked just behind DANZ TILL TEN and THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) while well clear of the rest, came in tight and checked
nearing the three-furlong pole, chased the leading pair to the quarter marker then encountered traffic into upper stretch, lost position into the drive and
weakened in the final sixteenth. STAY LIT raced in the middle of the trailing group down the backstretch, was making a late run but had to check
mid-stretch, lost momentum and flattened out in the final sixteenth. DANZ TILL TEN broke well and inherited the early lead, was stalked by THANKS
MAGGIO (ARG) and HALLISAR in close order to the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) prompted DANZ TILL
TEN in the two path for three quarters of a mile, bid for the lead approaching the stretch, then gave way and was no factor late.

Footnotes
WODETON (FR) got sandwiched at the start but managed to get away well and win the race to the turn, was able to gain the early lead with JERRY JEFF
WALKER in close pursuit, then was taken under a light hold, able to temper the pace through the first half mile, was let loose with about three furlongs to run
and set down in earnest from the quarter pole, sprinted away at the top of the stretch and won handily. SEA OF LIBERTY tracked two to three wide behind
the early leading pair, was set down from the five-sixteenths pole, swung four wide into the stretch, finished well under strong handling but was no match for
the winner and was best of the rest. POUR ON THE COLE broke in and bumped into WODETON (FR) who in turn made contact with LOAFERS BOY, took
up, lost ground and raced well behind through the first half mile, started an mild rally heading into the far turn, angled out into the clear in mid stretch and
kept on in grinding fashion to gain the third spot. JERRY JEFF WALKER broke awkwardly and made light contact with SEA OF LIBERTY, showed speed
into the first bend but opted to sit just off the flank of WODETON (FR), remained a constant shadow while allowing that foe to set the pace, had to be asked
to keep up approaching he quarter pole, weakened, then came up empty in the stretch. LOAFERS BOY took a bump from WODETON (FR) at the break,
was a bit rank into the first turn, lacked early speed and settled inside at the rear of the field, dropped far behind down the backstretch, saved all the ground,
attempted to rally into the stretch but was unable to improve.

Footnotes
SAREEHA (IRE) came away well from the outside post, tucked in towards before the first turn and tracked the pace from the rail down the backstretch,
bided time in the two path between horses on the far turn, raced in traffic approaching the quarter marker, found room three wide into upper stretch, took
command at the furlong pole and drew away in late stages. SHANGHAI MIST was sent for and gained the early lead with TEN THE SMART WAY and
SARHEEHA (IRE) not far behind, led through reasonable fractions to the far turn, was still going strong at the top of the stretch, responded when set down
but was unable to hold off the winner while easily second best. SUPER CARO broke well then settled mid-pack, racing three wide through the first turn and
down the backstretch, continued to race wide on the second turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held
well for third in deep stretch. LIGHT UP lagged at the rear of the field to the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch then produced a strong rally to finish
just short of a minor award. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS allowed to settle, saved all of the ground into the second turn while not far back, advanced into the
stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. TEN THE SMART WAY was pushed to get forward position early, stalked
SHANGHAI MIST through the early fractions, went three wide through the far turn and into the stretch, was outkicked nearing the furlong marker and gave
way in the final stages. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) was among the last into the first turn but made steady forward progress on the inside to be within striking
distance of the lead going into the far turn, stayed to the inside and loomed into the stretch then weakened and lost position in the final furlong. OAT MILK
LATTE came away in good order, was held up a bit in the early going, settling in mid-pack, moved into contention on the far turn but was boxed to the top of
the stretch, ran evenly while in pursuit heading to the furlong marker then tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
IDAHO ONCE hustled to the front and was left alone on a short lead, maintained the lead through the turn while carving out solid fractions, was set down in
upper stretch, opened up at the furlong pole and was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, was all out in the late stages and held on for the win at
the wire. SATANTA was unhurried from the break, dropped well behind the pace before the turn, was asked for more after passing the half-mile pole, stayed
three wide through the turn then swung four wide into the turn, rallied strongly under steady handling and just missed. DANZING REBEL raced inside of the
quartet chasing the lone pacesetter, stayed inside and remained prominent through the turn, became boxed in from the quarter pole then responded under
strong handling when clear, tipped two wide at mid-stretch, finished well into the final sixteenth and was clear of the rest for third. TRINIDAD lacked early
speed, raced near the rear with SATANTA through the first quarter mile, responded when put into a drive approaching the five-sixteenths marker, became
stuck behind horses from the quarter pole into the stretch, tipped out three wide in mid-stretch and was gaining in the final sixteenth. OUR BOLD PRINCE
raced between the four horses chasing IDAHO ONCE down the backstretch, was the first to mount a challenge from the quarter pole, was outkicked into the
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MAJOR TOM prominent in the early running, chased the solid early pace four wide into the turn, lost position at
the quarter marker, went three wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and tired late. CARDIFF
CRACK raced close up between horses to the three furlong pole, was shuffled back along the turn and chased into upper stretch, lacked a response in the
drive and gave way.
