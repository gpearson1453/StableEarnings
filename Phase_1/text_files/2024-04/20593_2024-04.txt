Footnotes
CANDY MAN CAN settled close inside then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod two deep entering the stretch and dug in determinedly to
edge clear. BRADLEY DO RIGHT rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and held the advantage at the rail on the far
turn, was met entering the stretch and remained a factor to late yards before yielding. RACING HOT LINE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the
chase past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, but showed little in the lane. DANTE'S INFERNO ducked out and made
contact with TOWN HOT leaving the gate then saved ground and passed some rivals in the lane. The latter was jostled leaving the gate and settled back off
the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and weakened. YACHTSMEN was bumped leaving the gate, raced
in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response. GHOSTLY LEO stalked off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole and remained a factor to the head of the lane before weakening.

Footnotes
PRINCESS MARGARET was squeezed leaving the gate then shuffled back early and saved ground, bid from the three eighths pole, steadily improved at
the rail on the far turn, dug in determinedly and held the nod through the final sixteenth. SHEWONTTALKTOME rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole and kept the edge off the rail through the far turn, was met leaving the turn and grudgingly ceded the final sixteenth.
SPARKLEINYOUREYE broke inward and made contact with Princess Margaret, settled in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage four wide on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. HERE'S A QUARTER stalked two
deep, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn then weakened mid-stretch. JUST HAVE FAITH

further. EX RATED saved ground. CASTLE OF CAYLEE settled back off the rail the first turn and showed little response. MAKANI broke outward and made

Footnotes
DREAM STREET ROSE saved ground off the pace then eased out entering the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path, dueled for the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. GRUMPY N U KNOW IT stalked from the four path the first turn, challenged
toward the five sixteenths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dueled to a slim brief lead nearing the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished
for the win while able to clear second late yards. OWE YOU ONE stalked off the rail then took the nod nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from the
five sixteenths and contested even terms at the rail on the far turn, remained a factor through the upper stretch but flattened the final sixteenth. LIME STAR
raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more.
SWIPE THAT CANDY was bumped leaving the gate then saved ground close to the pace, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail
on the far turn and weakened in the lane. LESLIE'S LAYLA became edgy in the gate, saved ground and bid only mildly. COLD CASH came away
awkwardly and made contact with Swipe That Candy, was checked sharply and dropped well back. OUR BREW took the lead at the three quarter pole and
angled in to show the way, was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and weakened past the three eighths. BIT OF BLESSINGS rated close in the
three path the first turn then faded past the three eighths pole.

then dug in under steady handling to hold on. TRAVEL SMART stalked from the four path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close
three wide through the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and finished well at the outside girth of the winner. NANA'S BOOPA took over while tapering to the
inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn
and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SUMMERTIME ROSE steadied into the first turn and settled inside, eased out entering the
backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and flattened stride. HONEYCAMP stalked the early pace
inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. DALLAS settled off the rail the first turn,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and weakened in the lane. THE MONEY MACHINE raced in the three
path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. HIGHWAY QUEEN rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn toward the
outside and showed little response. SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY raced well back off the rail the first turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PENGUIN PARADE rated close inside on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path, dug in for the lead
mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. SISYPHUS settled off the rail the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and finished well to take second later yards. JUBA'S HAT TRICK raced in the five path the first turn,
stalked into the backstretch and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn and remained a
factor to mid stretch before flattening stride. EPIC TIME veered outward and made contact with LORD OF CORK leaving the gate then moved to the inside
and rated the early pace, was met approaching the five sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back at rail at the quarter pole and flattened
in the lane. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then stalked from the two and three paths, dueled to the lead approaching the five sixteenths, contested
the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but was met entering the stretch and flattened toward mid-stretch. MAC DADDY rounded the first turn about the
three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, steadied approaching the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. CASSIUS saved
ground on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. CIDERHOUSE WAY raced well off the pace about the four path the first turn,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn.
