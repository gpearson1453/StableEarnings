Footnotes
ARIZONA REINA prompted the pace four to five wide, bid inside rivals nearing mid stretch, bumped with DESERT GAL near the sixteenth marker, kept on
determinedly under pressure, poked a head in front in deep stretch, drifted out a bit and prevailed. DESERT GAL , nudged to the front, set the pace well off
the inside, took pressure mid turn, clung to a short lead between runners in mid stretch, exchanged a bump with the winner soon after, kept on gamely but
just failed to hold. LOTSA STEEL drifted out at the break, chased well wide, altered in near mid stretch and churned on. EZ ARIZONA prompted the pace
six to seven wide outside the leader, bid to threaten mid turn, forced the issue past mid stretch then faded. EZ ALL THE WAY , carried out some at the
break, chased five to six wide outside a rival and gave way. An objection by the rider of DESERT GAL against the winner alleging interference in the stretch
was not allowed.

CAMERON SLOUGH settled off the pace and off the inside, moved up between rivals and commenced a serious run leaving the far turn, rolled up four wide
into the lane, surged to command nearing mid stretch, kicked away under right handed asks then was geared down through the final yards. MARK OF
VICTORY , well placed stalking inside, moved through along the rail entering the lane and challenged for command, failed to kick on with the winner but
stayed willingly to be clearly second best. SENT BY ANGELS rated in the clear while saving some ground, advanced inside runners nearing mid stretch
then flattened out. PRETTYWITTYANDWISE had speed to the inside of a rival then rated back and angled out into the first turn, bid three wide outside to
press, gave chase as the leader cleared past the five sixteenths, failed to go on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. CY'S SILKSTOCKING vied
outside a rival before clearing into the first turn, set the pace two wide, handled outside pressure into the far turn, spurted back clear, was taken on from
both sides in upper stretch and tired. GALIMINE (FR) lagged off the pace while saving ground and failed to generate a run. STELLAR POINT , four wide into
the first turn, remained four wide stalking through the backstretch run, faltered leaving the far turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HOWBEIT took over leaving the chute then contested the pace three wide and under rating, turned away outside challenges mid turn, responded and kicked
clear into the lane, kept on under a drive and held firm. QUALITY RAGS , away alertly, prompted the pace outside the winner leaving the five eighths, forced
the issue five wide between runners near the five sixteenths, wandered outward a few paths entering the stretch, corrected and came back on in game
fashion to earn the place in the final yards. IN HONOR OF AUTISM bobbled at the break and was away slowly, regrouped and edged up early behind the
leaders, found a seam and bid four wide between foes leaving the three eighths, pressed then chased five to six wide into the stretch, kept on willingly to the
inside of QUALITY RAGS but was edged for second. TENTH STREET DON dropped off the early pace, gained four wide under coaxing near the quarter
pole, failed to sustain past the three sixteenths and faded. XTREME MAYHEM stumbled at the break, quickly recovered to stalk six wide outside rivals,
chased into the stretch but came up empty. TOP OF MY GAME was nudged up early, chased towards the inside, stayed in range to the quarter pole then
gave way.

BURAQ'S REFLECTION , quickly went clear, set the pace off the inside, responded to when put to a serious ride into the lane, spurted away in mid stretch
then held firm while under a drive. WELL IMAGINE THAT angled out for the backstretch run, prompted three wide outside the winner, was under a ride
pursuing into the lane, battled back to the inside of a rival near the sixteenth marker and regained the place. JIMMY'S WILD BOY , in range while outside a
rival, angled out mid way on the final turn then moved up four wide, loomed into the stretch but flattened out through the final furlong and was out kicked for
the place. FREEZE 'EM , three wide, moved up nearing the quarter pole, failed to go on past the eighth pole and faded. LADY MARY LOU secured the
inside around the first turn then settled, gained towards the rail approaching the stretch, lacked a punch in mid stretch and gave way. WITHOUT EQUAL , in
tight after the break, rated back from between foes, raced off the pace then failed to respond.

Footnotes
EL ALTO HOMBRE rated back after an alert start, took closer order of the duelers while three wide and outside a foe nearing the lane, eased out past the
furlong grounds, made a grinding and determined run between foes and just got up in the final jumps. HEY NOW , five wide chasing the three horse scrum,
shifted out wider in the drive, ranged up outside foes in deep stretch to draw on near even terms, finished gamely but was edged by the winner to his inside.
FIRST CALL , three deep vying for command, held a slim lead past mid stretch, battled between foes near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly.
EXXEL saved ground mid turn, eased out, bid between foes near the sixteenth marker but wasn't good enough. RACE HOME , urged along well off the rail,
came about seven wide for the drive and closed steadily. RECKONING DAY edged up between horses early then bid inside foes near the half, battled on to
the inside of runners around the turn and into the lane, failed to kick on past mid stretch and faded. THIEF IN THE NIGHT took a short early lead, was joined
from both sides near the half, was under a hearty ride sparring between runners past the five sixteenths, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way.
STONEVICIOUS drifted out early while falling far off the pace, came very wide for the drive, had a belated response but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
DESPERATE MAN accelerated to a clear lead soon after the break then was guided to about the five path, set a rated pace around the turn, was shaken up
a bit in upper stretch then powered away through the final furlong while under mild hand encouragement. LITE RANCHIN KID chased the winner while
about six wide, came wider into the stretch, drifted in multiple paths after being asked right handed in upper stretch, corrected to chase outside a rival and
dug in to earn the place. FERRARI RED saved ground with pursuit mid turn, eased out to about the three path in upper stretch, churned on and nabbed the
show. FRENCH ONION chased the pace, threatened towards the rail nearing the quarter pole, chased to the inside of a rival past mid stretch then faded.
DEAL EM settled off the inside, made progress five wide nearing the lane then flattened out. DIALED IN TO WIN was rated back from between runners
leaving the gate, was snugly in hand and well of the pace leaving the far turn, came about six wide into the lane, moved up near mid stretch, altered out then
finished strong. LIGHTED VESSEL , fractious behind the gate and reluctant to load, raced four wide, pursued into the stretch then came up empty.
SUDDENLY FAMOUS saved ground and faded.

Footnotes
HOT LAVA CAKE displayed sharp speed and cleared early while taken to the four path, set a rated pace around the turn, responded when shaken up in
upper stretch, switched over to her correct lead leaving mid stretch then held firm while ridden out. RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE forced the pace five to six wide
outside the winner, dropped back a bit soon into the lane, found more inside the furlong grounds and came back on to earn the place and bridge the gap.
SUMMER RUSS chased the leaders, moved up three wide to the inside of RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE in upper stretch, was the closest pursuer in mid stretch
but flattened out late. TEXAS WENDY , between foes nearing the half, dropped in to chase then faded in the final sixteenth. SEAL THE DAY , far back to
the lane, raced two to three wide in upper stretch, swung out for the final furlong and found her best stride too late. GLIMPSE OF GOLD , off slowly when
breaking awkwardly, raced three to four wide mid turn and came up empty. BETTER B WORTH IT , four to five wide chasing the leaders, faded in the lane.
DIVINE GIFT , towards the inside, gave way. SILK PILLOW dropped back.
