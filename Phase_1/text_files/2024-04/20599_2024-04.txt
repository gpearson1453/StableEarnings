Footnotes
NO NO NO NEVER (IRE) settled along the rail off the pace, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, moved out further at the top of the lane, bid three deep
midstretch and proved best in the final sixteenth. BOLT'S BROAD stalked outside a rival, took aim two wide entering the lane, bid between foes in the
furlong grounds but got outkicked by the winner. KELLY'S OUT (IRE) broke a bit slow, tucked inside at the back, shifted to the two path on the far turn,
drifted in a bit a various points in the lane while finishing willingly to gain the show honors. IRISH ROSE grabbed the early lead and controlled the pace from
inside, remained unchallenged to the stretch, confronted by rivals midstretch, clung to narrow lead at the sixteenth pole but yielded in the end. DEN OF
INIQUITY (GB) stalked along the rail inside a rival, came under a ride on the far turn, corned nicely into the lane and could not offer the needed response in
the late stages.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S LAST traveled mid-pack outside a rival early on, took the turn two wide, swung out leaving the bend, closed in and confronted the leader
midstretch, then drove clear in the final sixteeth. HANDSOME TICKET showed earl speed then stalked in-hand outside a rival, bid two wide past the
five-sixteenths pole, took over past the quarter pole before clearing into the lane, challenged by the winner midstretch and yielded with a sixteenth
remaining. BELMONT BILL stalked behind the lead on the inside into the turn, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, chased within striking distance through
the but finished evenly to hold third. PIONEER PRINCE traveled in mid-pack along the inside, drew closer but lacked room behind rival around the bend,
moved out at the top of the lane, got bothered by SANGER midstretch and kept on for a minor award. SANGER tracked out of range in the two path into the
turn, spun three wide into the lane, came out midstretch and could not summon the needed late kick. DR. SOULFIRE trailed early inside a rival, saved
ground around the bend, angled out and bumped a rival in upper stretch, got bothered by inner rival at the sixteenth pole and finished with a mild rally.
VORPAL laid well off the pace, rounded the bend in the three path, got bumped in upper stretch, steadied at the sixteenth pole and lacked further response.
MAN CHILD showed good early speed to establish the front, showed the way along the rail into the turn, challenged by outer rival midway around the bend,
lost the lead past the quarter pole and gave way down the lane. MY RANSOM dropped back early and trailed outside a rival, remained at the back two wide
into the lane and was never a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SANGER FROM FOURTH TO FIFTH FOR SHIFTING
OUT AND INTERFERING WITH PIONEER PRINCE APPROACHING THE SIXTEENTH POLE, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER
PLACING.

DE' MEDICI went up to duel inside a rival, inched ahead around the turn, held a short lead inside a pair of rivals into the lane, cleared past the eighth pole
and edged away. FEEL THE MAGIC bobbled a bit leaving the gate, chased the top pair a bit off the rail into the turn, tipped out and bid three deep leaving
the bend, could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to outfinish VEGAS BURNER for second. VEGAS BURNER dueled for the lead
from outside, vied between rivals leaving the bend, lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong and got edged for second. PALAGIO broke a step slow,
dropped back early, made progress along the rail before tipping out on the turn and flattened out in the lane. EXPLOSIVELY stalked off the rail, asked three
then four wide on the turn and faded out of contention. DEVILNTHEBLUEGRAS broke a step slow, laid well off the pace early, passed a tired rival on the
turn and failed to menace. CHASING RAIN stalked the top pair from outside, dropped back four then three wide on the turn and tired in the lane.

SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid two wide at the quarter pole, gained command entering the lane, kicked clear in upper
stretch and remained strong under urging. SILVER SURFER (GB) chased along the rail into the turn, came off the rail entering the lane and got up for
second. JOHNNY DRAMA took control early from inside, confronted by the winner at the quarter pole, yielded in upper stretch and got outkicked for second.
INTO IT raced off the pace tugging the rider along, ran up on heels the three-eighths pole, rounded the bend two then three wide and could not rally.
KIMMER dropped back early and steered to the inside, hugged the rail through the turn and could not threaten in the final furlong. PAULLIAC (IRE) had to
pause when STOP AND A TRES crossed in front leaving the gate, settled off the rail, went three wide into the turn, spun five wide into the drive and could
not rally. BARSABAS chased between at the back early, took the turn two wide and was never a factor. STOP AND A TRES bobbled for a few strides while
still coming away at the front, chased three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. ZE'BUL traveled three deep at the back,
remained three wide to the stretch and failed to menace.

SKY CLOUD dueled inside ELIGIO up the backstretch and around the turn, inched ahead entering the lane, cleared in upper stretch and drew off under
urging while drifting. ELIGIO dueled outside SKY CLOUD to the top of the stretch, could not kick on with the winner approaching the eight pole and stayed
on to secure second. TAKAMAKAHARA stalked the leaders on the inside entering the turn, spun two wide into the lane, drifted inward in upper stretch and
held the show. T ONE D FLOUR FREE showed early speed then dropped back a bit to chase, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path
around the bend, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response in the lane while earning a minor award. GOSTOSO raced in range two
wide leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail around the bend, altered out from behind TAKAMAKAHARA in upper stretch but could not rally after. UPLIFT
forward placed four deep early, ridden along through the turn spun three wide into the lane and weakened. SCORPION SHOT was off a bit slow to begin,
checked along the inside leaving the backstretch, angled out to the three path only to run into traffic at the quarter pole, went between rivals and improved
position. SPOT D' ORO attended the pace five deep early, chased the leaders wide through the turn and faded in the lane. MONGOLIAN FROST pressed
three deep up the backstretch, dropped back between rivals on the turn and tired in the lane. CENTRIFUGAL FORCE was off slow to begin, coaxed along
racing wide up the backstretch, rounded the bend five then four wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
FLAVIUS bobbled leaving the gate, tracked between rivals in the two path, chased three deep at the quarter pole, tipped out at the top of the stretch, fought
three deep into the final sixteenth and dug in late to best the runner-up. LOW EXPECTATIONS bumped leaving the gate, closest in pursuit from the two
path, drew alongside the leader and took over midway around the far turn, dueled inside a rival leaving the bend, held a short lead inside rivals with a
furlong remaining and got outkicked in deep stretch. MOODY JIM (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, traveled two wide at the back outside a rival, had to wait
behind rivals on the far turn, trailed three wide leaving the far turn, angled out widest in the lane and rallied for the show honors. MAN FRIDAY bumped
outer rival at the start, moved to the inside racing at the back, split foes past the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch, moved out and got
outkicked for third. TIME TO PARTY stalked three deep around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled outside LOW
EXPECTATIONS past the quarter pole, fought between rivals into deep stretch before faltering late. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) brushed with outer rival at
the start but was still away near the front, taken in hand and dropped back off the pace while moving inside, moved into range entering the far turn, tipped
two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, angled inward in upper stretch and flattened out. PERCOLATE (IRE) settled inside, tipped out into the lane and failed to
menace. MASTERMIND sped clear and moved inside, opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch but saw the margin diminish nearing the far turn,
tested by rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, offered no resistance and folded in the lane. COMRADERY (IRE) sat off the pace outside a rival, went three wide
into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
DONT FIGHT THE FED vied inside rivals into the first turn then ceded command around the bend, tugged the rider along early on the backstretch, chased
on heels into the far turn and got shuffled early on the bend, went between foes at the five-sixteenths pole, challenged three deep into the lane, surged clear
in upper stretch and remained well clear to the wire. BRAZENLY chased two wide early, got blocked behind a rival on the first turn, trailed up the
backstretch, went four wide into the far turn, swung six wide into the lane and bested the rest. CALIFORNIA BAY trailed four wide around the first turn, drew
closer widest in the middle stages, spun five wide into the lane and got outfinished for second. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR tracked along the rail then came off
the fence a bit while steadying on the first turn, raced in range three deep on the backstretch, found traffic on the far turn, angled in at the quarter pole,
tipped out around troubled rival into the stretch, moved back inside in the lane and kept on for a minor award. BUCK OWENS chased in the three path off
the pace early, moved closer on the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then four wide, drifted in past the eighth pole and could not rally. NAUVOO vied
three deep into the first turn then pressed from outside, lost positions on the far turn, kept trying but got crowded past the eighth pole and was not
persevered with. SPEED GRAZY tucked inside near the back, advanced up the backstretch, looked to launch a rail bid but got bumped by ANDY CAN U
HEAR ME and had to take up into the stretch, then was lightly coaxed through the stretch. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME vied between rivals then took control
around the clubhouse turn, showed the way under pressure from outer rival in the middle stages, dueled inside ATOMIC DROP on the far turn, lost
command leaving the bend while bumping SPEED GRAZY, then faded out of contention. ATOMIC DROP showed early speed four deep then dropped back
to chase after the leaders on the first turn, bid three then two wide on the second bend, dueled into the lane and weakened in the drive. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ANDY CAN U HEAR ME DID COME OVER AND INTERFERE WITH SPEED GRAZY ENTERING THE
STRETCH BUT SINCE SPEED GRAZY FINISHED AHEAD OF ANDY CAN U HEAR ME NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

Footnotes
ANG N ASH well placed early outside the pacesetter, bid two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, put away inner rival late on the bend, drew away in upper
stretch and remained unchallenged to the wire. DISCREPANCY traveled outside a rival near the back, angled to the rail on the turn and rallied for second.
RESPECT THE CROWN off alertly then tugged along the inside up the backstretch, roused at the quarter pole, tipped two wide leaving the bend, lacked the
needed late punch but managed to hold the show. KETONIA (FR) sat off the pace and moved inside, drew closer leaving the backstretch, raced along the
rail then two wide into the stretch, kept trying in the furlong grounds but got denied for third. MO'S VINO MESA brushed with outer rival in the beginning,
chased outside a rival up the backstretch, took the turn three wide and lacked a bid. TIANMA laid off the pace in the early going, roused two then three wide
on the turn, steered out in the lane and lacked further response. STARLIT HARBOR off slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch, passed a rival two wide on
the turn and failed to menace. LADY CRUISER traveled near the back and steered to the fence, paused briefly at the three-eighths pole, dropped back to
last on the turn, passed a tired rival in the lane and was not a factor. MATINA sped clear and crossed over to the inside, tested by the winner at the
five-sixteenths pole, yielded late on the bend and retreated in the stretch.
