Footnotes
BODI ODI away in good order, dueled up front up the backstretch off the inside, shook clear of the other speed early in the turn, rated into the stretch when
maintaining a comfortable advantage, maintained daylight to the wire under intermittent encouragement. KANTIRUN back off the pace in the second flight,
three wide through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong, trimmed the gap to the wire while not a serious threat, clearly second best. FIRST
DIAMOND chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch in the two path, crept closer through the turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a further
response. READY FOR WINE broke out, bumping J J'S JOY and being away slowly, trailed early, two path through the turn, one paced to the wire. PETIT
JEAN back off the pace inside, altered out three wide into the turn, came four wide for the drive, came up empty in lacking a rally. J J'S JOY bumped at the
start, remained back while three to four wide through the turn, remained back. WILD CHEROKEE dueled up front closest to the inside, gave way after three
furlongs, continued to fade stretch, trailed in.

Footnotes
MARKET STREET took control soon after the start, set the pace up the backstretch and into the turn, extended that advantage a bit while still in hand
entering thge stretch, held HENRO safe late under steady handling. HENRO off a step slow, moved closer up the inside into the turn, checked up in tight
quarters, fell back a bit, shifted out when straightened for home, drifted out under a pair of left handed crop strikes to bother EXCITABLE BOY past the
furlong marker, could not get to the winner late whgile outfinishing RISK IT. RISK IT broke back, moved closer outside of HENRO into the turn, steadied in
traffic, remained covered up late in the turn, moved to the inside, finished up willingly while too late. THIS IS USCAR void of early foot, angled out to be four
wide into the stretch, within striking distance upper stretch, came up empty the final furlong. EXCITABLE BOY forwardly placed three wide, was racing
between horses when bothered by a drifting HENRO with a furlong remaining, fell back to lose all chance. CRAFTED pressed the winner for a half in the
two path, steadily retreated through the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH MIDSTRETCH AND A CLAIM
OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF EXCITABLE BOY AGAINST HENRO FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE FURLONG MARKER, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
ROYAL MEGHAN forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch between horses, fell back through the turn, moved out, came four wide for the drive,
accelerated past the furlong marker and powered by the leader to win going away. KOALA broke sharp from the outside, cleared to the two path the
opening furlong, continued to show the way through the turn, held a daylight advantage in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for
the runner up spot. DIXIE PENNY 2nd flight inside, continued to save ground through the turn, lacked a significant closing response for the runner up the
final furlong, managed to save the show. IZEONPOINT off a step slow, trailed for a half, roused in upper stretch, found best stride too late while steering in
late. HALAGA in the second flight while three wide, chased the runner up through the latter part of the turn and into the stretch, gradually weakened through
the stretch. MIA BABY went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. SPANISH DELIGHT off a step slow, raced back, angled out to be five
wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. WINYAH BAY was finished early while racing outside.

Footnotes
LIL BRO COOP in the second flight early inside, continued to race in the second flight up the backstretch, steered out three wide when moving to challenge
late in the final turn, took over and kicked clear. LIFE ON THE NILE away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, vied between horses into the lane
while inside the winner, could not match that one late, lasted for the place. CONTRABANDISTA settled off the pace while racing three wide through most of
the first turn, made a mild advance in the two path second turn, slowly getting to the runner up late, also not a late threat to the winner. MO MOVES moved
up to duel inside, raced on equal terms with the top two turning for home, first to blink. BRENNAN'S HONOR bumped in a bit tight soon after the start, raced
in mid pack along the inside, continued to save ground second bend, improved position a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. HARD TO COME
BY in the main group while racing off the inside, continued in the two path second bend, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick.
VINCENZINO prompted the pace three wide, gave way. STAR NATION void of early foot, three to four wide second turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. LORD GRANTHAM remained back in failing to menace. EIGHT STRAIGHT in tight and steadied after the start, raced four
wide through both turns, remained back. PREGAME was finished after a half. SERGEANT RECKLESS off a step slow, was always outrun.

Footnotes
HUGE BIGLY stalked the early pace while in hand and off the inside, continued forwardly in the run up the backstretch, ranged up to challenge three wide
turning for home, edged clear under steady handling. POLTERER pressed the leader from along the rail, moved up inside to challenge into the far turn, vied
into the lane while remaining closest to the rail, lost contact with the winner inside the furlong grounds, moved out, stayed clear second. EFFICIENCY
lacked early foot just off the inside, continued in the two path up the backstretch and into the far bend, steered out four wide entering the stretch, along for
the show late, not a serious threat. ZAP MOTION broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn, allowed the runner up the inside with a half
mile remaining, vied between horses into the stretch then faltered between those top two. W W CRAZY settled off the pace and the inside, continued three
wide second bend, lacked a closing kick. NEPAL UP last away, trailed much of the way, failed to make an impact. RACKATAPTAP was finished early.

some mild interest, no real threat. WHAT A COUNTRY devoid of any speed for six furlongs, swung out five wide turning for home, improved position with
some mild late interest midtrack. PRODIGIOUS BAY set or forced the pace, chased, rebid far turn, faltered drive. SEASIDE BOY off a step slow, raced
back, saved some ground into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. COST BASIS vied through the first turn off the inside, clear in the run up the backstretch,

Footnotes
ALMOSTGONE ROCKET broke well, pressed the issue up the backstretch in hand, took over into the lane, drew out as she pleased to win with something
left in a promising debut. DELACINA also away in good order, set a pressured pace along the inside, proved no match for the winner in the drive, just lasted
for the place while off the inside at the end. JOELMA off a step slow, continued to lag well behind for a half, made a late run up the rail to miss the place.
LADY ARIEL went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. HAVAHA within striking distance up the backstretch off the inside, moved closer
three wide midway on the turn then gave way steadily through the stretch. QUEEN'S LEGACY broke out, bumped with the runner up to be away slowly,
advanced inside, left rein broke nearing the half mile marker, got out into the turn, unseated rider.

Footnotes
TRACK MATE off a step slow, moved closer before a quarter, behind traffic into the lane, shifted out, brushed, bid, going away. LARK'S MISCHIEF dueled
up front in the two path, garnered a larger advantage when straightened for home, offered brief resistance to the winner past the furlong marker then proved
no match. ECHO AGAIN moved closer while three wide into the turn, raced in the second flight between foes through the bend, had little for the top two in
the drive, edging clear of the others. OUR LAST CHANCE lacked early foot, remained back while under restraint through the turn, displayed some modest
late interest to improve position a bit in the drive. SECRET POCKET off a step slow, raced back while moving off the inside, improved slightly. SPEND
BENJAMINS lacked speed oft the rail, swung widest exiting the turn, managed little in the way of a response. BOHEMIAN BO dueled up front inside the
runner up, first to blink in giving way turning for home. EASY ACTION in the second flight while four wide through the turn, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA MAE forwardly placed toward the inside, moved to challenge the leader in the two path late in the turn, quickly clear, kept to task to the wire
while staying well clear. PAT'S GAL off a step slow, dropped to the inside early in the turn, waited for room along the the inside late turn, rallied along the rail
to be clear for the place, no threat to the winner. DAT DARES RIGHT lacked speed outside, fanned six wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally down the
middle of the strip to be up for the show. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY void of speed toward the inside, rallied in the two path out of the turn, found best stride too
late while improving position. NATURAL TOUCH in mid pack for a half four wide, five wide into the lane, improved through upper stretch then flattened out
the final furlong. LITTLE BURRITO settled off the pace, went one paced through the turn in the two path, continued evenly through the stretch. KITIARA off
a step slow, pushed into the gap, moved out, three wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. CLASSY EDGE broke back, was used early to quickly move
up the inside to set the early pace, yielded readily to the winner entering the stretch and continued to weaken. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE in the second flight
early, raced three wide through the turn, faded in the drive. SMARTY'S ANGEL within striking distance while five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, tired.
NGALA forwardly placed outside, five to four wide turn, backed up through the stretch. DIXIE GIRL TO was finished early while racing four wide.
