Footnotes
AUSTIN FROM BOSTON chased the pace well off the inner rail, swung to the six path in upper stretch, closed steadily outside horses and was up
approaching the finish. CASINO TRICKS prompted the pace outside THE GREAT GAZOO, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out between
horses. THATAWAY , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out between rivals. THE GREAT
GAZOO set a pressured pace racing near the inner rail, drifted out a bit turning for home and weakened in the drive. TROPHY ROOM raced in the two path
on the turn and failed to rally. RASCALLY REBEL saved ground around the turn, advanced along the inner rail in upper stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
SHEHERHERS , patiently rated three deep and within range, took closer order in hand past the five sixteenths, shifted out a path into the lane, forged clear
in mid stretch, kicked away a bit after being set down left handed then held sway through the final yards. TINA TINA TINA tracked inside while in hand,
awaited room nearing the quarter pole, angled out and around a tiring rivals entering the stretch, worked through between foes and finished well to gain.
KAPATUDE prompted the pace three wide outside NEOLITHICA, took over mid turn then spurted clear, failed to contain the winner heading to mid stretch,
faded but did manage to save the show. SUN STREAMING , four to five wide, advanced under asking in upper stretch, sustained to about the sixteenth
marker then flattened out. G'S FIREBALL , bumped and in a bit tight at the break, secured the rail soon after and settled off the pace, stayed inside for the
drive and churned on. FLOGE rushed up early and chased between runners, was coaxed along between foes mid turn, angled out for the drive, failed to
kick on past mid stretch and faded. KAYMUS , bumped at the start, was shuffled back leaving the five eighths, angled out in upper stretch, shifted back in
some and came up empty under some coaxing. NEOLITHICA was nudged to the front, set the pace two while taking outside pressure, ceded command mid
turn, stayed on to the head of the lane then faltered.

Footnotes
MONCRIEF disputed the pace outside NICO LUCKY, sprinted clear in upper stretch and prevailed under pressure. THE LAST JUMPSTART lacked speed,
circled foes on the turn, was four deep entering the stretch and rallied outside hores. NICO LUCKY saved ground around the turn while disputing the pace,
weakened and drifted out near the eighth pole. WESLEY THOMAS , three wide on the turn, chased the pace, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and gave
way. BOX N BEN , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, weakened through the stretch. CLOSERTOTHEHEART , forced in by EDESTER leaving
the starting gate, was outrun. EDESTER bore in leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BANDITS WARRIOR , quickly to the front, set a rated pace towards the inner rail, handled some outside pressure from LUNITA around the turn, spurted
away after being guided three wide in upper stretch, was kept alert with a couple of right handed asks then widened under a hand ride. LUNITA , away well,
prompted the pace outside the winner, applied a bit more pressure mid turn, failed to kick on with the winner leaving the three sixteenths but stayed willingly
to be well clear of the rest. MATOULA , three deep early, was ridden along pursuing the leaders around the turn, lacked a serious punch past the three
sixteenths, faded and saved the show. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , very rank as the gates opened and was away last, was guided wide into the turn, dropped in
entering the lane and kept on with some effort. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY , between rivals nearing the half, came up empty. EXTRA CRUNCHY , washy pre race,
saved ground with some early pursuit and weakened.

DETERMIND PRINCESS stalked the pace outside DESTINATAION under patient handling, moved up three wide turning for home, gained the lead near the
three sixteenths pole, was put to urging and drew out. AMIE'S SYMPHONY stumbled leaving the starting gate, advanced outside rivals leaving the
backstretch, circled the turn, floated to the four path entering the stretch and flattened out. DESTINATION , clear soon after the break, set the pace near the
inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. REGALED dropped back entering the turn, worked between horses late and passed
tired ones. ENEMYNUMBERNINE , in the two path mid way on the turn, swung to the five path turning for home, had a mild move to the eighth pole and
failed to sustain the run. COQUITO chased the pace while along the inner rail and gave way through the stretch.

bid four wide outside the embattled leaders nearing the lane, responded when set down inside the quarter pole, spurted away in mid stretch then held firm
under a stout drive. UNDER THE OVERPASS , bumped at the break, edged up early then tracked two wide behind the leaders, worked through between
runners in the lane and kept on gamely to earn the place. CORONATION TIME , off last as his head was turning when the gates sprung, regrouped and
moved up off the inside nearing the turn, dropped in and took closer order in hand mid turn, came out five wide into the lane, straightened away with pursuit,
switched over to his left lead inside the furlong grounds and flattened out. THUNDERSLAM , in range three to four wide, edged up three to four wide past
the three eighths, was fanned six wide into the lane, stayed on to chase past mid stretch then went evenly through the final seventy yards. RETURN FIRE
came in at the break and bumped with a foe, straightened and got into an extended battle outside SEEKER, held a short lead into the stretch, ceded past
the three sixteenths then weakened through the last sixteenth. SEEKER drifted out some at the break and made contact with the runner up, corrected and
dueled to the inside of RETURN FIRE, stayed on to upper stretch then faltered and wandered outward. RUDY RUDY RUDY , bumped at the break, made a
mild run three to four wide in upper stretch, failed to go on past mid stretch and weakened. MUCHO LOVE , bumped and in tight at the break, dropped back.
GO TINTIN GO , bumped at the break, dropped back inside and failed to generate a response.

BET THE LINE disputed the pace between horses, drifted out near the quarter pole then drew away under energetic urging. BLUE KINGDOM bobbled
leaving the starting gate, was behind horses on the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch, finished willingly but was no threat to the winner. WORK
HARD advanced inside horses down the backstretch, remained along the rail prompting the pace on the turn and weakened in the stretch. VILALUZ
steadied when shuffled back soon after the start, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and passed tired rivals. NORTHERN
CARDINAL disputed the pace outside the winner for six furlongs, was floated out by that one near the quarter pole and gave way. EFF THIRTY FIVE
stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, was four deep on the turn and faltered in upper stretch. BERMUDA RUN , no factor, was eased.

Footnotes
THREES OVER DEUCES edged up outside rivals early on and tracked a contested pace, ranged up four wide under a ride and challenged into the stretch,
moved to a slim lead a furlong out, drifted in a bit after emerging in scrum with TENEBRIS, kept on under left handed asks and prevailed. TENEBRIS moved
up between rivals heading to the half and gained a slim lead, secured the inside and dueled with NO CENTS around the turn, fought on to the inside of the
winner through the final furlong and just missed in a valiant effort. MURRAY broke a bit slow then was bumped by NO CENTS, regrouped and raced off the
pace, circled four wide under a ride into the lane and rallied. GOLDEN CANDY had speed to the inside of foes, eased back off the leaders into the turn,
stalked mid turn, came out for the drive and churned on between. NO CENTS broke inward and bumped MURRAY, corrected and pulled his way forward
four wide to contention, dropped in some and vied outside TENEBRIS around the turn and into the lane, failed to kick on between runners leaving mid
stretch and faded. KARAN'S NOTION flashed some speed inside but failed to keep pace.

ground around the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and rallied. BROWN SUGA BABE lacked speed, behind horses on the turn, swung to the five
path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. DWELLING LEGACY chased the pace racing in the three path down the backstretch and on the turn,
weakened and drifted in near the eighth pole. I'M A CUTIE PIE prompted the pace racing along the inner rail, angled out in upper stretch and gave way on
her left lead. PHABULOUS PHOEBE lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn and failed to rally. PROGENY , four wide on the turn, chased the pace,
gave way approaching the stretch and was eased.

SMOOTH RICO quickly went clear, set the early pace about three wide, dropped in towards the rail around the turn, widened under a hustling ride while two
wide in upper stretch, drifted in a bit despite left handed asks and prevailed. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO broke a step slow, rushed up four wide nearing the
half to reach a stalking spot, gave hard pursuit into the lane, came back on in game fashion while on his left lead but just could not quite reel in the winner.
SENATE CHAMBER , three wide early on, saw the leaders get away around the turn, came four wide for the drive, churned on and got the bob for the
show. STARSTREET , sluggish from the gate, raced off the pace while saving ground, eased out into the lane, worked between foes past the sixteenth
marker and kept on with effort while losing out on the bob for third. ONE MORE RING saved ground and faded.
