Footnotes
ROSE OF MOONCOIN broke alertly, showed good speed and drew to a clear lead heading into the turn, set decent fractions while well handled and a bit off
of the rail approaching the quarter pole, drew clear while in hand nearing the furlong marker, felt a bit of pressure from the runner-up into the final sixteenth
and kept to task in the late stages. TAMARANDO COAST stalked the solid early pace, gained ground into the turn and chased the pacesetter two to three
wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, was gaining on the winner in deep stretch but could not reel
that one in and was second best. NICE ENCOUNTER raced close up to the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and made a mild gain at the quarter
marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch, could not match strides with the top two heading into the final sixteenth and held for third at the finish.
FLY SOUTH a bit slow away from the start, was allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position three wide along the turn, was outrun into the
stretch, mildly re-rallied in the final sixteenth but needed more. ADJUST THE HEAT allowed to settle in the early running, raced between rivals into the turn,
was guided four to five wide into the stretch and did not threaten. VALERIE chased the solid early pace from the inside, ran in pursuit to the quarter marker,
could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
RIMPROTECTOR broke a step slow then bid for the lead but drifted out a bit away from the gate, exchanged a light bump with PASSARANDO, allowing
ROYAL N RANDO to slip through on the rail and grab the lead, followed that latter foe through the turn then tracked a length or two behind down the
backstretch, went to bid for the lead from the five-sixteenths marker, took a short lead into the stretch with MOBOU making a run on the inside, put that rival
away in deep stretch then just held off a fast closing PASSARANDO to prevail. PASSARANDO took a bump from RIMPROTECTOR before the first turn
when that rival started to drift out going into the turn, then tracked three wide down the backstretch, moved into contention from the three furlong pole but
became boxed in as the field turned into the stretch, altered course out a path in mid-stretch, responded to strong handling and intermittent urging, surged
late and just missed. LOVE CANDY got caught five wide into the first turn then raced at the back of the compact field down the backstretch, circled the field
on the far turn to get into contention, came five wide into the stretch and finished well under a strong hand ride to gain the show. MOBOU was forced out
four wide by RIMPROTECTOR going into the clubhouse turn, was held up under a long hold down the backstretch and tracked mid-pack, was let loose
going into the far turn but lacked room, idled inside to the stretch, squeezed through a narrow opening between horses near the three-sixteenths pole,
battled RIMPROTECTOR to deep stretch then weakened passing the sixteenth pole. ROYAL 'N RANDO broke well and was first to the turn, opened up
through the turn then tried to slow down the pace, was allowed to set a moderate pace with constant pressure from RIMPROTECTOR who was always
close, held the lead to the far turn, then fought back when beset by a host of challengers from the five-sixteenths pole then weakened in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
AURATIUM off a step slowly, was hustled in the early stages and raced close up into the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced to vie
for the lead at the half-mile marker and battled ANN LOVES MARK into the second turn, shook free of that runner nearing the quarter marker and extended
the lead into upper stretch, was kept to task under moderate urging into the final sixteenth, felt a bit of pressure from oncoming rivals in deep stretch and
held safely for the win at the finish. THEA hesitated at the start and was away slowly, was unhurried in the early going and saved ground into the
backstretch run, advanced while saving all of the ground into the second turn, checked while in a bit tight nearing the quarter pole, maintained an inside path
into the stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, was gaining into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held well in
the end for place honors. CATALINA COCKTAIL tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run, was floated four to
five wide entering the far turn and chased while widest nearing the quarter pole, re-rallied in the drive and just missed for second at the finish, while clear of
the rest for third. OUTRAGEOUS forwardly placed away from the start, attended to the early pace two wide along the first turn, stalked the decent pace
between runners into the backstretch, chased three wide into the far turn, shifted to the rail and ran in pursuit of AURATIUM into upper stretch, could not find
a response in the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. CANDY LITZ allowed to settle while never far back early on, raced two to three wide along
the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, lost ground into the far turn and did not factor in the stretch. ANN LOVES MARK stumbled leaving
the start but was away in good order, assumed early command and set decent fractions into the backstretch, was confronted nearing the half-mile marker by
AURATIUM and battled that rival into the second turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker, dropped back into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RESERVE PROOF broke well and was allowed to settle into stride, made a forward move through the clubhouse turn to get into a stalking position behind
CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY, put the pressure on that foe passing the half mile pole and the pace quickened noticeably, dueled through the turn but was
always traveling better than the rival, took command from the quarter pole, opened up in upper stretch and held clear. RICH GOLD checked going into the
first turn then briefly became hard to place, settled at the rear of the pack, started to gain ground on the leaders after passing the half, then made a move
four wide through the far turn, sustained the run into the stretch and made a valiant run gaining on RESERVE PROOF but ran out of time. LAURA'S
KIDOUGH was last away then raced three to four wide in the early going, not far back through the middle of the race, saved ground into the far turn, made a
mild late rally and was clear for third. MOVIETIME tracked three wide on the outside went into a drive from the nine-sixteenths pole came five wide into the
stretch and lacked a rally. LYING GHOST broke best but ceded the early lead to CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY, raced mid-pack then came under a ride with a
half-mile to turn and chased to the finish. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY went two wide into the first turn the cleared off to an open lead, gave way passing the
quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
GEEJAYTEE rated nicely off of the decent early pace, went two wide into the backstretch run and gained ground approaching the half-mile marker, chased
two wide and between runners nearing the quarter pole, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, responded to steady
urging into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and edged away in the final strides to prevail. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT vied for the early lead
with
SMILINGATTHEMOON
then
assumed
command
into
the
first
turn,
set
a
decent
pace
into
the
backstretch
run,
was
confronted
by
SMILINGATTHEMOON nearing the quarter marker, repelled that rival into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, dug in while on the left lead into the
final sixteenth, was overtaken in deep stretch and held well in the final strides for place honors. SMILINGATTHEMOON broke out at the start and bothered
neighboring rivals leaving the gate, recovered and vied for the early lead, ceded the lead to RIDIN'THESTORMOUT and stalked that runner into the first
turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, prompted RIDIN'THESTORMOUT into the second turn then was repelled into upper stretch,
ran in pursuit into the final furlong, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and held safely at the finish for third. SILVER FLIRT unhurried in the early going,
raced a bit in tight into the first turn and was shuffled nearing the six furlong marker, was unhurried through the backstretch run while not far back, saved all
of the ground into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and found her best stride late. RADAR LOVE was crowded at the start but away in good order,
raced close up to the decent early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn
and chased the leading pair to the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the late stages. SOUTHERN BLESSING was crowded a bit
leaving the start and bothered a neighboring rival leaving the gate, tracked the decent early pace, tucked in two wide along the first turn and was well placed
into the backstretch run, chased three wide into the second turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired.
EXCLUSIVELY NOBLE was crowded leaving the start and was a bit slow away from the gate, recovered and settled three wide along the first turn while not
far back, tracked the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the far turn and was outrun to the quarter marker, trailed
into the stretch and did not factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
SMILE BABY SMILE broke well then was sent forward to stalk CLARE'S BABY to the outside, started to bid for the lead from the three furlong marker only
to have the rival battle back on the inside, gained the advantage near the furlong pole and drew off under strong handling and intermittent urging to win
clear. NO CAP checked slightly at the break to avoid contact with CHARLOTTES DELIGHT, then settled mid-pack on the inside, launched a bid from the
three furlong pole then angled out to the five path for the stretch run, closed stoutly under steady handling to gain the place. CLARINA came away well and
was up with the leading group through the initial furlong, launched a three wide bid at the leaders from the nine-sixteenths pole, swung four wide into the
stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in the late stages and held for third at the
finish. BRUNCH WITH AMY was under a drive from the break but lacked any early speed, went three wide through the turn, still under steady handling and
finished evenly. CLARE'S BABY was quickest away from the gate, sprinted to the front, held sway to the quarter pole then was taken on by SMILE BABY
SMILE dug in gamely to mid-stretch then gave way. CHARLOTTES DELIGHT broke a step slow but pulled up to be just behind the leaders by the half-mile
marker, saved ground through the turn, came under a ride with three furlongs to run but could not keep up with the pace down the stretch. BID ON THE
RIGHT ducked in at the start, dropped far behind the field and was outrun.

Footnotes
LAMMAS (GB) allowed to settle while not far back in the early going, was guided two wide along the first turn, gained ground into the backstretch run and
tracked the decent pace between runners approaching the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, roused four wide into
the stretch, responded to urging past the furlong marker and rallied into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and got up in the final strides for a
determined win. AIR FORCE RED broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch
run, was pressed by ASTRONOMER into the second turn then repelled that rival into upper stretch, dug in while under pressure approaching the final
sixteenth, drifted out a path inside of the sixteenth-pole, met the bid of LAMMAS in deep stretch and was tagged for the win in the final strides. BALNIKHOV
(IRE) unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the far turn and mounted a rail rally into the stretch,
gained ground at the furlong marker, finished well into the final sixteenth and just missed for the win and place. ASTRONOMER prominent away from the
start, stalked the solid pace from a two wide path along the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, advanced into the second
turn and pressed AIR FORCE RED nearing the quarter pole, battled for the lead into the lane then lost a bit of ground at mid-stretch, came in tight into the
final sixteenth when AIR FORCE RED drifted out and was outfinished in deep stretch. IL BELLATOR close up in the early going, saved ground into the first
turn, well placed while saving all of the ground into the far turn, chased the leaders to the quarter marker, advanced into the stretch, could not find the
needed late response and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. SUMTER allowed to settle while never far back in the early running, raced three wide along
the first turn, well placed through the backstretch run, chased three wide into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth but needed
more. FREEPORT JOE settled along the inside into the first turn, guided two wide into the far turn, offered a mild late rally but could not threaten the leaders
in the final stages. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) unhurried in the early going, settled two wide into the first turn, improved position three wide into the far turn but
could not sustain that run into the stretch. I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) allowed to settle away from the start, went three wide into the first turn, was guided two
wide into the far turn and did not factor. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY settled off of the early pace, trailed into the far turn and raced three wide to the quarter
pole, swung widest for the stretch drive and did not threaten. CLOVISCONNECTION forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the solid pace three wide
into the first turn, well placed along the backstretch run, chased three to four wide into the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
HAPPY CHAPPY broke sharply and took the early lead in hand, was pressed to the outside by SWIFT NATALIE with the rest in close pursuit, was
confidently ridden through the turn then responded when set down passing the three-sixteenths pole, finished strong under steady handling held safely in
deep stretch to prevail. LEEDSTHESKY broke out and bumped into AGELESS UNION, settled into stride mid-pack through the early stages, was a
threatening presence through the turn while waiting for room, split horses near the quarter pole then set out after HAPPY CHAPPY on the lead, was gaining
into the final sixteenth and bested the rest. AGELESS UNION broke awkwardly then was bumped by LEEDSTHESKY, angled out to the five path for the run
down the backstretch, made a little forward progress racing four wide through the turn, then swung five wide into the stretch and closed well to gain the third
placing. ALMOST GOT LUCKY reluctant to load, steadied at the break when SWIFT NATALIE came over at the start, then rushed up to race just behind the
leaders near the half-mile pole three to four wide and continued that path through the turn, came under a stiff ride from the three furlong pole while launching
a bid for the lead, was four wide of five horses across the track turning for home, had a little trouble changing leads in the stretch and was unable to find
another gear when needed. SWIFT NATALIE broke out and into the path of ALMOST GOT LUCKY, then raced close up behind the pacesetter, bid between
horses as five contenders fanned out across the track from the quarter pole, was outkicked at the furlong marker and weakened in deep stretch. KISSES
WITH ROSES broke well but dropped back to last before the turn, stayed to the inside through the turn and encountered traffic at the quarter marker, found
room into upper stretch, could not muster a response into the final furlong and did not threaten.
