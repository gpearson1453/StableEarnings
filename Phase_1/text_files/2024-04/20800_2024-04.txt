BARRELHOUSE broke inward bumping NATURE OFTHE BEAST causing a chain reaction of bumping to his inside, dueled for the lead along the inside
then two wide the entire trip and proved best while fully extended under a strong hand ride. SMALL SAILOR matched strides with the winner two then three
wide and finished second best. NATURE OFTHE BEAST bobbled then was bumped from his outside at the start and forced into TOYI, saved ground,
offered a mild bid inside the top pair into the stretch then leveled off. TOYI was bumped from his outside at the start into ONE HIS TOES and went evenly.
ON HIS TOES also bumped at the start, was no threat. THE EQUINEST failed to menace.

CANDLELIGHT HOURS prompted the pace three then two wide through the turn, responded readily when shaken up at the top of the stretch, made the
lead near the three sixteenths pole and drew clear under right handed urging. OAXACA stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied four wide to make the
lead nearing the quarter pole then was no match for winner. LADY LOTTIE set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn, had speed into the stretch
then weakened. QUARANTINA trailed until mid stretch and passed tiring rivals outside. SIERRA DIAMOND saved ground and was no threat. BOX STEP
pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and retreated on the turn.
