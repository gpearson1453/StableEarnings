Footnotes
ROSIEPOSIE was hustled on the rail being urged right handed inside to be forwardly placed early, assumed control on the rail by the half, shook clear of the
chasing duo at the top of the stretch and had enough to hold off the pair that were inching closer at the wire. MISS WATERLOO hopped slightly on the
break, regrouped to track three wide down the back straight, continued looming the threat three wide around the turn and could not reel in the winner late
but did win the battle for place in a photo. TAPPING A RHYTHM prompted the pace between runners along the backside, forced the issue just off the
frontrunning winner throughout the turn, had a chance at the top of the lane but was just outfinished missing the place share. FLIP FLOPPIN FAST stalked
five deep down the backside, travelled four wide on the turn making little impact and rallied somewhat to pass tired runners getting up for a minor role at the
finish line. IMPECCABLE TIMING travelled in mid-pack in the four path down the back straight, could not go on with rivals entering the turn, was shuffled
back to trail around the bend but could not find more in the stretch to get involved. LANEY GRACE broke out tossing her head on the break, made a good
move angling inside to the rail with seven sixteenths to go saving ground, offered a mild run around the bend on the fence but flattened out inside in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
COMMANDER AT SEA tracked the front threesome four deep on the outside down the backstretch, made a bold move cruising around the embattled
leaders midpoint on the turn to assume command, opened up going the rail at the top of the lane and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish.
HARPER CITY dueled up front between horses in the early parts of the race, hounded the pacesetter inside throughout the running on the turn, angled just
outside off the fence for the drive and was closing in late but could not get there in time. BUSTA GROOVE prompted the pace outside after the break, edged
in front outside at the half, gave way to the winner circling runners midway on the turn but still fought on down the lane to stay on holding for third money.
ASHUKA was hard ridden on the rail down the backside trying to keep inside position, had to check mildly on the fence at the seven sixteenths marker, lost
positions around the turn and re-rallied in the four path to garner a minor share in the end. WETIKO settled in mid-pack inside after the start, made little
headway with runners on either side around the oval, angled out five wide turning for home and finished up one paced running to the wire. IT'S ME MARIO
broke inwards to begin, had a good tracking position sitting behind the engaging trio in the early stages, came under a ride through the turn but could not
make any improvement and lacked a bid in the stretch running outside. OPEECHEE trailed four wide down the back straight, travelled four wide offering a
brief turn of foot outside foes at the three eighths marker, was fanned seven wide at the top of the lane and had no finish to give running to the wire.
QURBAAN'S KINGDOM brushed the inside of the gate on the break, stalked between horses near the rear in the early stages, lost touch with the pack
around the turn and could not recover to play a role in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SILVER BULLET LADY opened up to have a clear advantage on fellow rivals at the half, set the pace still all alone going around the turn and had more to
give when set down in mid-stretch to win convincingly in the end. SISTER COUSIN threw her head up at the break to trail after the start, recovered nicely to
track behind the frontrunning winner going into the turn, started a run to try to go after the lone leader with five sixteenths left to go, closed the gap
momentarily in upper stretch but was not match for the winner who had it her own way on the front end. HEKLA'S AURA settled at the back on the outside
in the early part of the race, began to extend ones stride at the quarter pole, shifted five wide gaining momentum straightening out for home and closed
belatedly outside for the show prize. DIXIERIBSY tracked three wide outside down the backstretch, kept pace travelling three deep on the turn, was in the
mix outside turning for home, could not find more late and stalled in deep stretch to settle on the fringes. T'PRING was unhurried stalked inside in the third
flight in the early going, saved ground but could not get into contention around the bend and offered a mild run down the lane to be involved for the minor
placings at the finish line. FEDALINE tracked between foes down the back straight, could not match strides with rivals on each side who were making a
move in mid-turn and yielded to horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TOMCAT BLACK broke just a hair slowly but quickly recovered, tracked from inside bumping a rival sideways early up the backstretch, continued inside into
the turn just off the leaders, moved out in upper- to mid-stretch seeking room, had aim on the two leaders inside the furlong grounds and surged past late
under confident handling. ALICIA'S KID was bumped lightly at the break but still had the early lead, ceded that position content to stalk or press the new
leader up the backstretch into the turn, bid at the top of the stretch taking a narrow lead, led till late but was outfinished. COURAGEOUS COPPER was
strongly urged from the start to make the lead, did so after a sixteenth, set the pace from inside but just off the rail, was headed by upper stretch but fought
on gamely. GHOUL (BRZ) stalked from outside, was ridden along by the five-sixteenths racing three to five wide throughout and traveling evenly.
COMMANDER JOE bumped a rival at the start, was not too far back of the leaders but bumped a bit early, shifted six wide turning for home, needed more.
TRICKY MAGICIAN settled off the pace, shifted eight wide at the top of the stretch and showed mild late interest. MASTER SPY was shuffled back after the
opening sixteenth then altered course abruptly dropping back further to avoid rivals, raced well back, swung nine wide for the drive and finished with late
interest. LION OF THE SEA was in tight soon after the start, took up the chase but was bumped into a rival early up the backstretch and shuffled back, was
never near enough to threaten. BLUE MAX showed little.

Footnotes
ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN broke out on the start, pressed the pace inside down the back straightaway, was checked in tight quarters on the rail at the three
furlong marker, then waited patiently behind the leaders at the quarter pole, moved out bullying through a seam in the four path at the furlong marker and
drew away in the late stages for the win. SOCIETY'S THUNDER settled three wide outside horses in the second flight down the backside, made a strong
move around foes three wide at the three furlong marker, loomed boldly in the five path turning for home and under left handed encouragement dug in to
just win the nod for second money at the finish. GAROFOLI was squeezed on the break, emerged with a slim advantage while hounded on both sides down
the backstretch, battled stubbornly inside for the front around the bend, put away the pace rival by the top of the lane but weakened in the final seventy
yards to lose the place photo at the wire. MOON OVER EGBERT was void of speed being outrun in the early stages of the race, could see the field
travelling three wide on the turn and showed some good late energy in the five path to close in and get a minor role in the end. SUPER SICILY leapt up at
the start to be relegated on the rail to a tracking position behind the front trio down the backside, was roused three wide at the quarter pole, but could not
offer a finish in the stretch running. FIELD HOCKEY was fractious behind the gate prior to loading, broke in at the start, forced the pace outside down the
backstretch, continued to go head and head outside around the bend for the lead, was in the mix in the four path at the top of the lane, was brushed inside
by the winner going for a seam at the eighth pole and retreated in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
TWO SIP SALLY broke sharp to lead after the break, then surrendered the lead to an outside foe with seven sixteenths left to run, continued to fight on
keeping pace with the leader running around the bend and re-rallied on the fence at the furlong marker to take command, drawing off in the end. SAUCY
NAME chased the pace in the three path down the back straight, settled back to be outside tracking the top pair through the turn, was roused for more run
four wide at the quarter pole and had a solid late surge to get up for place money at the wire. MAXIMUM FIFTY chased the pace four deep outside in the
early going, took over the front spot with seven sixteenths remaining, continued to dictate terms on the turn, was clinging to the lead turning for home, began
to shorten stride while never switching leads and weakened in deep stretch. UNHEARD was outside runners down the backstretch, had a stalking role on
the rail through the turn and showed some good late interest to finish up for a minor role in the end. NORMA NO settled on the fence near the back in the
early going, stalked in the third flight outside a runner around the turn making little headway and could not be a presence in the running down the lane.
AMI'S GIRL had a good position nestled on the rail sitting behind the frontrunner down the backside, was urged for more run with a quarter mile to go on the
rail but lacked a rally through the stretch. MRS. BENJAMIN leapt up at the start spotting the field many lengths down the backside, could not close the gap
running throughout the turn and could not be a factor after the compromised beginning.

Footnotes
GIANT TEDDY tracked outside horses in the second flight down the back straight, patiently waited to move going around the turn, burst through when a
seam appeared in the two path at the top of the stretch and wore down the pacesetter in the final sixteenth for the victory. BLACKTECA took command from
the onset, was travelling comfortably setting the pace around the oval and gave way grudgingly in a solid effort to be a clear second at the finish. AIM FOR
THE SKY chased the pace down the backstretch and throughout the turn, could not keep up with the top two finishers running to the wire but determinedly
fought on to the end to hold on saving the show award at the wire. LONG LANCE was allowed to settle trailing outside early, was roused with right handed
encouragement to go on four wide with two furlongs left, angled out widest in the six path for the drive and was gaining on rivals late just missing in a three
way photo for third money. HALLIE'S HERO stalked near the rear on the rail in the beginning, offered a brief rally between horses three wide at the quarter
pole, was in range for a share of the prize straightening out for home but finished up evenly to the wire. MAAKWA was alone stalking in mid-pack down the
backside, made an early move three wide outside rivals with three eighths to go, continued the run four wide at the top of the lane but could not find more
late and emptied out down the lane. GOLD MAGIC tracked in the second flight on the race in the early parts of the race, was asked for more on the fence as
the running quickened at the quarter pole but retreated inside in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MASCOT raced close in the early going, dropped back a little bit late up the backstretch tracking in behind the leader, came out for room in
upper stretch, was kept busy from that point on and edged past late. ADIOS NOW quickly moved to the lead, set a measured pace near the rail, edged
away from foes leaving the turn and was clear in upper stretch, put to urging at that juncture and led till late but was outfinished. NAPTOWN stalked from
outside, went four wide on the turn, evened out in the stretch. BREAK THE SPELL settled dropping back to last, swung six wide for the drive and passed a
couple tired rivals. TUNECHI was within range throughout the early stages stalking just off the leader from outside, asked to keep pace coming to the
quarter pole but had no late response. COUNTRYBOYSURVIVE broke just a half-step slowly, was encouraged forward regaining contact with the leaders,
chased from inside while ridden along, faded.

Footnotes
STEP FORWARD took control from the break, was unchallenged going easily on the front end around the turn and cruised home unopposed for the
impressive front running score. OLD CHESTNUT was on the rail in the third flight stalking, began to pick up runners commencing a rally on the fence at the
quarter pole, angled out in the three path for the drive and won the battle for place behind a dominant winner. LA BELLEZA NEGRA tracked outside two
deep in the early stages, chased the stablemate going around the turn, battled for the place share as the winner was long gone through the stretch and
faded late to be a clear third at the finish. RAPID TEST stalked outside in the third flight along the backside, could not close in on the leaders running
throughout the turn, angled out to the four path for the drive and got up to be a fringe player in the end. FORESTER'S FORTUNE was unhurried trailing on
the outside down the backstretch, continued to see the field around the turn and ran on mildly in the stretch battling for a minor role. SILENT RESERVE was
off just a step slow on the rail, was in tight on the fence behind the front runner having to be steadied at the seven sixteenths marker, regrouped to make a
brief run at the quarter pole but stopped on the fence in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
FAST BOAT TO SKYE had one rival beaten down the backstretch, began to smartly circle runners for wide starting at the three furlong marker, was
confidently handled going to the lead outside horses at the top of the stretch and drew away in the late stages. TRUEBELIEVE was in the third flight stalked
four deep along the backside, was nudged at the midpoint on the the turn gaining on the leaders with the eventual winner outside of him throughout the turn,
could not accelerate with the winner in upper stretch but tenaciously held on for the runners up share at the wire. HIGHLAND LIFE was brushed outside on
the start, travelled in midfield in the two path down the backside, rallied on the rail with three eighths remaining, angled out with run in the four path at the
top of the lane and fought on but just lost the place share in a photo at the finish line. GATLING GUN stalked three deep along the backside, began to edge
closer throughout the turn, shifted out widest in the six path driving to the finish and closed to garner a minor role in the end. WILBERFORCE could see the
field outside horses down the back straight, began to pick up challengers on the outside with five sixteenths left to run and continued a sustained run
passing a few tired runners in the drive to the wire. BOLD RELOAD broke inwards on the start, took a clear lead by the half mile marker, was collared
outside by foes at the quarter pole and faded inside in the final sixteenth. AMBER LIGHT tracked three deep outside in the early stages, was hard ridden at
the quarter trying to maintain position, could not find more in the drive and stopped in mid-stretch. YORKVILLE travelled in mid-pack on the rail, was
steadied sharply losing his path nearing the three furlong marker and could not recover to pose a threat in the stretch running. PLUS POWER chased just
outside down the back straightaway, could not keep pace with rivals making a move midturn and stopped in mid-stretch.
