Footnotes
TAKE SHAPE took light contact from an inner rival leaving the gates, prompted outside of the pace setter and from the three path around the first turn, vied
while gaining a narrow advantage with five furlongs to go, put away his inner counterpart tucking to the two path into the far turn, cleared an outer presser
nearing the lane and lasted safely from a pair of pursuers late. LITTLE DIXIE broke half a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in
the four path before advancing entering the lane, stayed on to bid for place in the final furlong, dueled for that position late and narrowly prevailed.
DIVINELY BOLT broke a step slow while last away, laid off of the pace in the three path, advanced in the four path and between horses to stalk outside of
the top pair entering the backstretch, sustained pressure outside of the leader into and around the far turn, but yielded to that one nearing the lane, dueled
with an outer bidder for place in the late stages and missed the bob. JACKIE'S LOVE showed the way inside of an outer prompter around the first turn, vied
with that one while headed down the backstretch, but failed to sustain position into the far turn and steadily gave way. IT WASN'T ME tracked along the
inside, chased two wide around the far turn and faded. SHEAR brushed an outer rival at the start, tracked in the four to five path around the first turn but
was done early.

Footnotes
PERFECT SHANCES showed the way in the two path, inched a clear margin well in hand entering the lane, then widened handily when lightly asked
entering the final sixteenth. CITIZEN JUDY stalked the eventual winner from the three path, chased that while hanging on her left lead and lugging inwardly
in pursuit in midstretch, then held place. HER HOLY NAME pursued from the four path and ran on willingly. BAYTOWN STORM raced close up along the
inside, but faded entering the lane, then drifted out while giving way. BAYTOWN AMY ROSE steadied between horses early on, trailed leaving the chute,
the improved position but failed to factor. RIO DE PAZ tracked from the five path but yielded while hanging on her left lead. MISTY SUNDAY was last away,
chased under urging while caught in the six path off of the pace around the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
TRES CHIC (ARG) laid off of the pace in the five to four path, gained ground in the six path around the far turn, advanced to bid along with an inner foe in
upper stretch, sparred with that one through the final furlong and prevailed. PITTORE D'ORO took light contact from an inner foe soon after the start, laid off
of of the pace in the three path, picked up stride in the five path around the far turn, gained to offer a bid along with an outer foe in upper stretch, battled with
that one changing to his right lead in the final furlong, fought on to the wire but was bested. SILENT SECRETARY (BRZ) transferred minor contact from an
inner rival to an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, chased the leaders around the far turn, then kept on up the rail for a minor placing.
LUMINOUS RULER hopped at the start and broke multiple lengths slow, trailed, advanced in the three path around the far turn and sustained progress to
surpass tired rivals. INSPECTOR PENNY showed the way in the three path as an outer foe applied pressure, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders in
upper stretch and gave way. BLUE VORTEX prompted the leader from the four path, lacked a bid under heavy urging around the far turn, got outkicked by
an outer bidding pair entering the lane, steadied when put to crowded quarters by those foes in upper stretch and weakened. MAYLEN broke a step slow
and took mild contact from an inner foe at the start, pursued from midpack in the four to three path and between horses around the first turn, chased closest
to the top pair approaching the far turn, but faded along the inside around that bend. STAGE RIGHT stalked outside of the top pair and from the five path,
then faded down the backstretch. FEDAH saved ground off of the pace and faded. SNAP JUDGEMENT raced forwardly in the six path around the first urn,
but steadily faded thereafter.

Footnotes
JEFFERSON STREET stalked outside of the leader and in the four path, assumed command from that one with five sixteenths to go, drove clear under a
left handed crop in upper stretch and was put to hand in the final furlong. ACCIDENT tracked in the five path and ran on to edge place entering the final
sixteenth. ROCK N ROLL BOLT was hustled forward to set the pace inside of the eventual winner, took the turn in the three path, proved no match for his
outer counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, yielded and lost place with a sixteenth to go. GUILTY AFFAIR chased along the inside and faded. TONKA
TROUBLE was outrun in the six path.

Footnotes
WELAKA was hustled to the front, showed the way under mild urging along the inside, remained under urging as a pair of outer rivals menaced into the far
turn, drove clear of them entering upper stretch, shifted out and inched further away. FAN THE FIRE pressed outside of the leader, then between horses
around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart entering the lane, dueled for place with his outer competitor through the final furlong
and prevailed. DUAL MONARCHY tracked along the inside, shifted out to press the top pair into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner
entering the lane, vied for place through deep stretch but was bested. STRIKING SPARKS transferred contact from an inner rival into an foe into the first
turn, tracked from the four path, chased from midpack around the far turn and moved up. WRITEITONTHEICE laid off of the pace in the three to two path
around the first turn, advanced to fourth approaching the far turn, but chased the leading trio around that bend and lacked a bid. LUKE bumped an outer
rival soon after the start, stalked in the three path and between horses, urged along into the far turn and faded. AMERICUS raced off of the pace tucking
from the six to four path around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn and failed to factor. LIAMS LAD never got involved from the three path.
HASKELLED took contact from an inner foe and brushed an outer rival into the first turn, pursued from midpack five wide and steadily faded. WRITE OFF
JERRY trailed in the five to six path early on and was outrun.

Footnotes
RO TOWN set a pressured pace in the two path, led from an outer pair turning for home, shook free entering the lane and held sway while flopping to and
from his left lead. STIR CRAZY laid off of the pace in the four to three path, tipped out to the six path entering the lane and rallied to reach place at the wire.
WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE tracked along the inside, ranged up outside of the leading pair and from the four path around the far turn, but only managed to
chase the clear leader through the lane and lost place to an outer bidder at the wire. STRIKINGLY SPUN trailed in the four to five path, pursued from the
two path around the far turn and failed to threaten. STORY HOUR prompted the leader from the three path, sustained pressure between horses around the
far turn, then faded entering the lane. SPANSIVE tracked from the three to four path, but was through into the far turn and eased thereafter.

Footnotes
YONO trailed in the two to three path , was roused in the four path around the far turn, rallied in the six path to sweep past the leaders leaving the furlong
grounds and kicked clear. C F V BULLET chased in the three path, closed in on the top pair turning for home in the four to five path, but was outkicked by
an outer bidder nearing midstretch, claimed place in the final furlong and was second best. HAROLD'S CLOUD stalked the leader from the three path while
closest to the hot pace, chased that foe around the far turn, got outkicked by an outer pair in the lane and kept on to reclaim show. STIRDATPOT dictated
terms in the two path while setting a fast pace, held sway turning for home, but was overhauled by the eventual winner leaving the furlong grounds and
weakened hanging on his left lead. LIAM THE BRAVE lacked speed along the inside, closed in behind the leading group in upper stretch, but encountered
traffic in the final furlong. COTE D'IVOIRE chased from midpack along the inside and faded approaching the far turn. SANT' ANTIMO pursued from the
three path but lacked a bid and was eased through the lane. AMERICAN HERO stumbled at the start and dislodged his rider.

Footnotes
UNCLE JAKE showed the way in the three path, built a clear margin into the far turn, drew further away under a drive through midstretch and was put to
hand late. EL KABONG broke a beat slow, lagged behind along the inside, then rallied along the rail to gain place nearing the wire. QUADRA ISLAND was
bumped by an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, gained place into the far turn, chased tipping the four path entering the lane, then lacked a
bid and lost place late. SANTORINI was fractious in the starting gate, bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked the leader from the four path, chased
that clearing foe into the far turn and weakened turning for home. LIMITED LIABILITY laid off of the pace in the three to five path and never got involve.
GUNTON ROE bumped with an outer rival then an inner foe at the start, tracked from the five path, but faded under urging around the far turn and was
eased through the lane.

ROCK STAR DOCTOR settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, ranged up in the four path turning for home to bid entering the lane, and
inched clear. LASERJET laid off of the pace along the inside, rallied in the four to five path turning for home and edged place late. UPSWELL pressed two
wide and between horses, led with five furlongs to go, showed the way along the inside around the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder in upper
stretch, gave way and lost place late. BLUE GUITAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked from the two path, pressed three deep around the far
turn, bid along with an outer foe entering the lane but yielded. AL TIRAH broke outwardly while last away, trailed along the inside advanced into the far turn
before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, and narrowed the gap on the main group. VIVID EXPOSURE showed the way along the inside, got
headed by an outer presser with five furlongs to go, stalked that one shortly after but faded around the far turn. MISSY BEE pursued two wide early on and
steadily faded. LANETTA bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked three wide, pressed two wide around the far turn but weakened between horses
nearing the lane. PERFECTLY WICKED laid off of the pace in the four to five path, but never got involved and was eased through the lane.
