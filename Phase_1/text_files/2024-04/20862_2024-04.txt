Footnotes
MID DAY IMAGE , away well, was taken well in hand soon after and rated towards the inside, eased out mid turn then circled four wide with a run into the
lane, sustained under right handed asks and joined LUCCI inside the furlong grounds, gained a slim lead leaving the sixteenth pole, dueled and held firm.
LUCCI took over soon after the break and set the pace two wide while taking some inside pressure, shook clear leaving the far turn, set a rated pace around
the turn, responded when set down in upper stretch, dug in when confronted, dueled inside the winner through the final seventy yards and kept on valiantly.
STRUGAR , off a beat slow, was sent up between foes early then advanced three deep heading to the turn, stalked around the turn, chased between rivals
leaving the three sixteenths but came up empty in the final seventy yards. SPEAK UNITY edged up between runners nearing the half, stalked between
horses around the turn and into the lane, gave hard chase near mid stretch and faded. CARVELLIAN QUEST broke a step slow, regrouped and settled in
the clear into the turn, angled out, came four wide for the drive and offered a slight response. SMITTEN ENOUGH vied inside LUCCI early on, steadied
back a bit into the turn, stalked inside rivals around the turn, failed to kick on in mid stretch and weakened. ROCKY DICE , off the pace, saved ground into
the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BUCKIN' GREAT saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the two path approaching the stretch, advanced inside horses to wrest command
in mid stretch, was under urging and drew away. HATEFUL , three wide around the turn chasing the pace floated to the four path in upper stretch and
rallied. SUSAN'S MULE disputed the pace outside STORMY MIDNIGHT, drifted to the three path in upper stretch, lost the lead in mid stretch and
weakened. REE NEE'S SIX , along the inner rail on the turn, eased out for the drive, floated to the five path in upper stretch and failed to rally. TRUE
SUNSHINE lacked speed, circled the turn three wide, was fanned to the six path in upper stretch and was not a factor. STORMY MIDNIGHT hugged the the
inner rail, disputed the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
BIG BIG STAR took command between rivals heading to the first turn, secured the inside and set a rated pace while handling some outside pressure,
spurted clear two wide soon into the lane, wandered outward leaving mid stretch, corrected with right handed asks and dug in tenaciously to prevail. GIVEN
TO FLY (IRE) stalked inside, was patiently handled past the five sixteenths, steadied lacking some room leaving the three sixteenths, regrouped and closed
gamely to the inside of the winner. BRITISH SEA prompted the pace outside the winner, stayed on as that one cleared in upper stretch, gave hard pursuit
between foes near mid stretch and stayed on well. ROCK BULLET , brushed at the break, lost ground four wide, move up outside rivals into the far turn,
gained under a stout ride into the stretch then flattened out late. FLAMENCO STAR , forwardly placed towards the inside, edged up between runners
nearing the stretch then lacked room with about a sixteenth remaining. MY SANCTUARY saved ground around the first turn, eased out leaving the five
eighths then was taken up between foes near the half, regrouped and circled five wide into the stretch, moved up past the furlong grounds then failed to
seriously sustain. OWHATANITE rated early and then between foes nearing the half, edged up then was stalled near the quarter pole, regrouped to make a
run past mid stretch then checked when blocked near the sixteenth pole. SILK SUIT settled off the pace, was steadied near the far turn, angled out and
closed belatedly. CESNOLA checked into the first turn, saved ground off the pace, checked lacking some room in upper stretch and then came up empty.
UWASNREDDI broke slowly then swerved inward, regrouped and settled off the pace while saving ground, angled wide for the drive but lacked a bid. I CAN
DO MAGIC , four to three wide, moved up to take closer order heading to the far turn, gave hard chase between runners approaching the quarter pole,
lacked a kick soon into the lane and tired. SCORESTOSETTLE , urged from the gate, stalked the pace two to three wide, was lightly steadied between
runners nearing the stretch then gave way.

COSTNER bobbled slightly at the break, was confidently rated, circled both turns three wide, swept to command turning for home and drew off under
energetic urging. AMANI'S TIGER bobbled at the break, was rated behind horses down the backstretch and around the turn, eased out four wide in upper
stretch, had aim on the leader and flattened out. I'LLTAKETHEBLAME lacked speed, was in hand along the rail on the far turn while lacking room, altered
course to the outside in upper stretch and retreated through the stretch. SNACK chased the early pace, raced four deep on the far turn, gave way, pulled up
lame and was vanned off. STORMY SEAS disputed the pace outside MARTY'S MAGIC, faltered and was eased. MARTY'S MAGIC hugged the inner rail,
dueled to the stretch, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
THAT'S RIGHT sped clear early and dictated the pace towards the inside, responded when set down left handed and two wide in upper stretch then
maintained a safe advantage while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. CHILDERS stalked the winner while off the rail, shifted out some in the lane and
finished gamely to bridge the gap. GRATEFUL BRED , fractious in the gate, was taken well in hand soon after the break, continued under rating while
saving ground mid turn, eased out some in the lane and had belated action. MARCHED , towards the inside mid turn, eased out and offered a mild run.
ROCK THE BOAT broke a step slow, was steadied along between rivals from the half mile marker to about the three eighths, angled out and came up
empty. NIFTY broke a bit awkwardly and failed to menace. EGO MAN edged up early while about three wide, chased off the inside to upper stretch then
faded.

PLAY HARDER bobbled at the break, chased the leader while two wide on the turn, challenged for the lead outside ONE WAY TRAFFIC in upper stretch,
remained on his left lead in the stretch and prevailed in an extended drive. ONE WAY TRAFFIC accelerated to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, was
hooked by the winner in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously to just miss. THE BAND RUNS ON , three wide around the turn, floated to the four path in
upper stretch and rallied. JAY lacked speed, swung to the five path in mid stretch and gained late. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR , well placed in the two path
mid way on the turn, gave way. HEARD ON THESTREET stayed along the inner rail on the turn, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
MYSTIC SEAPORT sped to the early lead and secured the inside, met an outside bid from BENEATH THE STARS around the far turn, dueled under
confident handling around the turn, spurted away after being nudged upon in upper stretch, responded to a couple of asks inside the furlong grounds and
eagerly widened. MONEY'S WORTH rated three deep early, shifted out four wide while under pressure into the lane, kept grinding through the lane,
switched over to her left lead inside the sixteenth pole and just got up for the place. GASTOWN BABE prompted the pace two wide, rated back off the
leading duo into the turn, tracked mid turn, eased out three wide into the stretch, moved up to have aim in mid stretch, gave hard chase then flattened out
very late. BITTY BOSS rated between runners early, eased back into the turn, angled out, circled five wide into the lane and closed steadily outside horses.
CAVALIER CUPID rated while saving ground, took closer order to the inside of a rival nearing the lane, chased to about the sixteenth pole then faded.
BENEATH THE STARS tracked three wide early, dropped in a bit and drew alongside the winner exiting the far turn, sparred around the turn and into the
lane, failed to go on leaving the three sixteenths and tired. ONLY KIDDING , off the pace, saved some ground around the turn and failed to menace.
FUHGEDDABOUDIT stumbled at the break and unseated her rider.
