Footnotes
NOT NOW VICTORIA led briefly in the opening stages then settled just off the leader content to press, was encouraged along about the five-sixteenths,
floated five wide and in a bit tight at the top of the stretch as the leader drifted out, edged past that one by mid-stretch and forged clear. ANGEL'S
SHADOWS was urged forward to the lead after the opening furlong, set the pace inside just off the rail, drifted four wide leaving the turn, was no match for
the winner but second best. MALIBU SANGRIA was in just a bit tight at the start, settled off the leaders outside racing four wide into the turn, was floated ten
deep by a rival leaving that bend, kept on and got the nod for show. COMPELLING UNCLE settled well back near but off the inside, came out nine wide in
the stretch, finished strongly. MOLLY'S ROSE was in tight at the start, raced unhurriedly at the back, came out eleven wide in upper stretch, belatedly
gained. SAICHI'S GOLD MINE was uncooperative behind the gate, coaxed forward chasing outside four wide into the turn, floated six wide out of that bend,
lacked the needed late kick. BLOOMING RESOURCE chased from inside mid-division, began shifting out from the three-eighths to the top of the stretch
entering the lane nine deep, evened out while drifting in. LOVESUNFAIR raced off the pace and removed from the rail, was never a threat. BILL chased
from near the inside, faded. SGT MUSKETT was not a factor racing off the inside.

Footnotes
ONLY ONE AMERICA was quick to make the lead, set the pace from off the rail shadowed by foes, moved clear leaving the backstretch, drifted out turning
for home and in upper stretch, held sway under steady handling. DEVILETTA bobbled just slightly at the start, was caught five then four wide early on the
first turn moving up on the leader, stalked that one from outside up the backstretch, was niggled along a bit past the seven-sixteenths and given more
encouragement five-sixteenths from home, could not match strides with the winner but secured the place under continued urging. EVERLEIGH'S QUEEN
was up close racing inside, came out turning for home then back in as the leader drifted, needed more and was outfinished for place. METHODS rated
inside foes at the back but off the rail in the early going, encouraged along a bit coming to the far turn, came out seven wide leaving that bend, ran on with
mild late interest. RASPBERRY WINE settled between runners into the first turn racing three to four wide, continued racing toward the rear up the
backstretch and outside, moved nearer the rail on the far turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
SHAME ON SAM was up close stalking five to six wide, took charge in upper stretch and forged clear. SHEZA GOIN COMFORT pressed the early pace,
took over three furlongs out racing three to four wide, was overtaken in upper stretch and no match for the winner but second best.
EVERYROSEHASATHORN was strongly urged from the start, moved up chasing inside and within range, dropped back on the turn, came out for the drive
and came again to finish strongly. CHARLIE DYNASTY broke a step slowly, brought up the rear, was gaining well inside but too late. LAUGHING STORM
was caught six to seven wide racing outside foes on the turn, kept on in the stretch but needed more. AMIGO LOCO stalked up close four to five wide,
flattened out in the stretch. BEACH STORM soon led, set the pace from off the rail, was overtaken by the three-eighths, weakened in the lane. DANJERUS
STORM raced off the pace and off the inside, failed to rally.

Footnotes
CORRINA CORRINA unhurriedly brought up the rear early, switched out and advanced willingly outside foes five wide coming near the half-mile marker,
took the lead three-furlongs out, was clear into upper stretch, maintained and extended the margin while never asked. FIRST AGAIN set a pressured pace
from off the rail in the two to three path, was no match for the winner but kept on well to be second best. WHISPER'S MARK stalked from outside, advanced
four wide at the half to be within striking range, shifted out six wide turning for home, evened out. OUR TIME TO SHINE settled tracking in behind two to
three wide, was between foes early up the backstretch, needed more. DELIA pressed the pace about three wide, weakened. AMASS MONEY rated inside
just off the early leader, dropped back, failed to rally

Footnotes
MASSIVE ROAR quickly moved clear to set the tempo from just off the rail, drifted a bit leaving the turn, drew away under moderate urging. DIABOLICAL
STORM was off the pace three to four wide through the turn, rallied in the stretch, got the nod for place. ALL CHROME was gaining late inside but missed
second. FLAGS FINALE was forwardly-placed chasing in behind inside a foe but off the rail, kept on late but was outkicked by inside and outside rivals for
the minor spots. SMARTSREALGOOD settled-pack, shifted out coming to the quarter pole, was floated wider still coming about eight deep into upper
stretch, ran on. SUNSCREEN failed to menace while racing off the inside. NO PASA NADA chased mid-pack near the inside, shifted seven wide at the top
of the stretch, flattened out. HOLLYWOOD HENRY chased the eventual winner from outside, weakened. LONZO WHO was well-placed mid-pack, floated
seven to eight wide turning into upper stretch and checked when in tight as a rival came out, did not threaten thereafter.

Footnotes
TRUST ANABELLE was coaxed forward to take the lead soon after the start, set the pace in the clear, widened in upper stretch, held safe. CHANCE TO
DREAM settled off the pace, steadied when in tight near the seven-sixteenths, was guided out a bit at that juncture and advanced quickly four to five wide
between foes past the five-sixteenths, angled eight wide turning for home, was clearly second best. HOODWINKED KATE was up close, chased the winner,
held show. KENTUCKY GOLD broke on top, settled in to stalk from off the pace, came into upper stretch five to six wide, kept on. ATTILA STYLE settled off
the pace near the rail, shifted four wide coming to the quarter pole then nine wide turning into upper stretch, ran on with mild late interest. MOON PIE
MONEY chased from inside, weakened. COMFORTS JAZEL was just a bit rank in the early going lacking speed, ran on up heels past the quarter pole
steadying slightly, kept on in the stretch. QUICK TRACK advanced three wide heading into the turn, flattened out. EXTRA SPIRIT chased from inside
mid-pack and failed to rally. AWESOME MIA was outside toward the rear, swung ten wide into upper stretch, was not a threat. SWAYING LASSIE chased
while floating eight to nine wide into upper stretch, faded. CASH UP chased briefly but soon dropped back five to six wide, tired.

ALOTALUCK pressed the pace prompting it periodically throughout the early going while under a tight hold, was allowed to move closer making a bid
coming to the five-sixteenths, dueled through upper stretch, edged away late under urging. NO TROUBLE set the pace hounded off and on by the eventual
winner, dueled with that one from the five-sixteenths through upper stretch, yielded grudgingly but was second best. YOUNG POPE tracked the leading pair
inside but off the rail, came out a bit for the drive, ran on to be best of the rest. NORWEGIAN CALLUM stalked then moved forward outside three to four
wide to within striking distance coming nearer the far turn, asked for more entering that bend, evened out. DA RINGO unhurriedly brought up the rear,
swung six wide into upper stretch, was not a threat. ARIZONA DAVIN angled in early, saved ground through both turns to no avail.

between runners, held. BENDER settled off the pace caught five wide early, advanced on the far turn still five deep, bid for the lead coming to mid- to
late-stretch, was held off. MINE THAT STAR bumped a rival lightly after the start, moved forward stalking the pacesetter three wide, bid coming past the
three-eighths, was engaged by outside foes soon after, dueled, yielded grudgingly late. HOLLAND settled well back racing inside, switched out heading up
the backstretch, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, ran on evenly. LOCO LUNA settled off the pace inside but just off the rail, swung five to six deep
turning for home and ran on. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT was bumped lightly and in tight after the start, still caught six wide entering the first turn, dropped
back and shifted in heading up the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, failed to rally. TULANE TRYST sped clear and shifted in, set the pace inside

LET HIM BE tracked from inside, began to maneuver outwardly on the far turn seeking room coming seven wide past the quarter pole, struck the lead at the
top of the stretch, lugged in a bit but moved clear and held safe. THUNDER DOME settled well back racing off the rail in the two to three path, bided time
still saving some ground on the far turn gaining on the leaders, came out a bit in upper stretch and responded when clear to gain steadily and willingly but
was too late. ANTONIOS MARK was caught six wide through the first turn, made a rapid advance five wide midway up the backstretch outside runners to
apply pressure, bid taking a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths, flattened out in the stretch. MCMERCELUS settled off the pace in the three to four path,
swung eight wide making a swift advance on the far turn, ran on mildly thereafter. JUVAL raced somewhat close five wide in the early going then eased
back content to stalk from mid-pack, continued about five wide floating out six to seven deep leaving the far turn, was in a hair tight at the top of the stretch,
kept on well. I'MAGAMBLER was forwardly-placed applying pressure four wide up the backstretch, made a mild bid at the three-eighths, flattened out in the
drive. BODIE GOT GOLD moved forward applying pressure between runners three deep up the backstretch, bid past the half, could not sustain the effort.
HENRY ON THE RUN angled in early saving ground inside through the first turn racing well back of the leaders, came out six wide at the top of the stretch,
ran on. MR. BIG RIG sped clear after the start, shifted in to about the two path, set the pace from off the rail, faced increasing pressure up the backstretch,
turned up empty. FARMER FRED R F reared badly at the start spotting the field numerous lengths, was never near enough to threaten. ANCIENT LAND
stalked under rating tactics and a tight hold early racing two wide, was floated eight wide coming past the quarter pole by the eventual winner, faded in the
stretch.
