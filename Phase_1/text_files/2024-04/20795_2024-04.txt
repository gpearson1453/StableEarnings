Footnotes
COZY COURTNEY raced within contention, moved up four wide around the turn, rallied down the lane, dueled with D'BUSKER and drove clear. D'BUSKER
vied for the early advantage, took the lead around the turn, dueled down the stretch and proved second best. MALLORY UNBRIDLED raced in the middle of
the field, came around the turn on the outside, made a bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. MY IDEA lacked early speed, saved
ground around the turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. FIELD OF LIGHTS dueled on the front end and faded. LA LOLA raced near the middle of the
pack, lacked a kick and finished evenly. QUICK BITE raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. SUGAR CANE GAL void of early speed and
showed little. LONG LEGGED LADY showed early speed, saved ground and made a steady retreat. ALESSANDE always raced near the back, came
around the turn on the outside and was outrun.

MIND ON MY MONEY raced within contention, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, dueled between rivals down the stretch and proved
the best. FORT BONZ unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, dueled down the home stretch from the outside and was outfinished for the win. AND
FIFTY went to the front, drove clear, dueled down the home stretch and was outfinished by the top two. APPLEWOOD lacked early speed, saved ground,
moved up, but was no factor. HONOR MY SPEED raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and faded. TAKEN BACK void of early speed, raced outside
around the second turn and was never close. COHERE raced within striking distance, came around the second turn on the outside, finished wide and
dropped back. ANICLUDE pressed the pace and made a steady retreat.

Footnotes
CANA GRIS unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a bid down the lane and proved the best. GRACE'S SOLDIER
raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, angled out, made a wide bid and finished willingly. ZIPPING MOLLY vied for the early lead,
forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished by the top two. SUM CHARM challenged on the front end, raced close throughout and weakened late in
the stretch. CECE WAVE raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. SPARKLE CITY pressed the pace, faded and
finished wide. ARCTIC GUITAR lacked early speed and showed little. JUST ANOTHER WIN raced evenly near the back and was outrun. BEAT THE
DOUBLE always raced near the back and was never a threat.

early speed, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, split rivals, made a bid and was outfinished. IZZY'S BABY BOY went to the front, led
throughout, drove clear and lacked a late kick. PACIFICISLANDTIME lacked early speed, raced outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and missed
show. GOLDEN QUALITY raced evenly near the back, had an outside trip and was no factor. INDIMAAJ raced within striking distance and faded. DOCTOR
LEO pressed the pace, dropped back and lost contact with the field.

Footnotes
TISSA unhurried in the beginning, trailing the field, moved up on the outside around the turn, swung wide into the home stretch, made an outside bid and
got up late. B MINOR lacked early speed, came around the turn four wide, made a bid, took the lead down the lane, but couldn't hold off the winner late.
JOLLY TOMMY raced within contention, came around the turn three wide, made a bid and hung. MR MIDWAY raced within striking distance, saved ground
around the turn, faded and finished evenly. MESA SPIRIT dueled on the front end and faded. GHENT vied for the early advantage, saved ground and
dropped back.

Footnotes
COMANCHE WARRIOR challenged near the front, took over down the home stretch, pulled away and proved the best. FATHER MARK went to the front,
forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. R T'S MIDNIGHT pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn,
eased back and proved no match for the top two. CATCHIN DRAMA raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, made a bid and
weakened. ROCK SOLID WORDS brushed at the start, raced in the back and was never a factor. INFINITESIMAL brushed at the start, lacked early speed
and was never close. COUNT ON RAIN raced in the middle of the field, dropped back and was outrun.
