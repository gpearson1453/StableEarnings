Footnotes
MAX IS G MONEY showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside, eased out a bit to race three wide in the drive, dug in and held well to
prove best under strong handling. GOTTA KEEP HIM rated under a firm hold early, made a good rail bid around the far turn through the stretch and finished
gamely to the wire. IRISH RANSOM tracked the early leader two deep, raced four wide in the stretch and kept on to the wire. SEAVILLE stalked the pace,
moved up four wide through the far turn and raced even with no closing run. DONEGAL DREAMER forced out a bit to race five wide around the first turn,
dropped in down the backstretch, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and had no late rally. STRONG DIAMOND was off slowly, raced off the early
going, was four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. PROVEN ADVOCATE settled off the early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch
and had no late rally. SPOKEN CODE swung wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. U RASCAL U drifted around the first turn, raced a bit rank as the
jockey tried to rate and was done early.

Footnotes
COUNTRY LADY rated along under a firm hold, made a good rail bid around the far turn through the stretch and drew off to be well clear under strong
handling. BAR TAP settled off the early going to race mid pack early, saved ground through the far turn, eased out to race four wide and finished gamely
late to secure the place position. MARY JACK tracked the early leader, raced three wide around the far turn and had no final winning bid. GIRL THIRSTY
raced two to three wide around the far turn and moved up to improve position. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT set his own pace, met bid near the five sixteenths
pole and falttered. HOLY WAR dropped back early, saved ground through the far turn and lacked a bid. MEAN AMERICAN raced wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor. FOLLOW THE SAINT failed to menace.

BEYOND THE HYPE tracked the pace just out of striking distance in early stages, launched a three wide bid for the top pair turning for home, dug in gamely
down the lane and collared BETISON in the final sixteenth. BETISON sped to the lead out of the gate then conceded position to MACEE, stalked rival
through the backstretch, engaged HARLANS WARRIOR for the lead near the three eighths pole, vied around the far turn, shook free turning for home,
continued to lead the way under firm handling then got wore down late. FASTED rated near midpack along the outside, remained in range four wide at the
quarter pole, hustled along into upper stretch and sustained a steady bid to grab a share. HARLANS WARRIOR was forwardly placed through the
backstretch, made a move with three furlongs left to run, vied for the lead around the turn, could not match strides heading into the lane, kept on with
interest then got edged late for show. GOODNIGHTLOVING tracked the pace near midpack, hustled along the inside into the stretch run and lacked a late
needed kick. MSCHITCHATTOUR was unhurried through early stages, swung five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. ASHLEY'S GIRL raced in
the back, came five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. FOUR PRINCESSES raced off the pace near the inside, swung four wide into the lane and had
no late response. MACEE set the pace, got collared at the five sixteenths pole and gave way.

Footnotes
HOME VISIT stumbled at the start, quickly recovered and vied three deep for the lead, could not maintain equal terms with rival around the turn, but
remained game in pursuit, launched a rebid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer under firm handling and got up late. UNFATHOMED dueled for
the
early
lead,
shook
free
and
led
the
way
around
the
turn,
continued
on
top
into
the
final
furlong
then
got
outkicked
deep
stretch.
NORTHERNREFLECTION tracked the top trio through the backstretch, came three wide around the turn, given cue two wide in upper stretch, showed
response and sustained a steady bid. ANDIAMO GIACOMO raced off the top trio along the inside, steadied slightly along the rail around the turn, angled out
upper stretch and lacked the needed kick for serious impact. PERFECT PERIGEE dueled between rivals through the backstretch then came up empty
around the turn. FLASHY PREMO lacked speed, trailed and had no response.
