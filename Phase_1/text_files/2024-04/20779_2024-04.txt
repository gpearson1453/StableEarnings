Footnotes
JANE AUSTEN stalked the top pair two wide into the turn, chased a bit off the rail leaving the bend, moved out a bit to take aim at QUICK BROWN FOX,
drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining and wore down the runner-up. QUICK BROWN FOX dueled for the lead from inside, put away outer rival past the
quarter pole, led clear to midstretch, met the bid from JANE AUSTEN in deep stretch but could not hold off the winner. MS BO J stalked the top pair from
outside, went four wide into the turn, asked three wide late on the bend, loomed from outside with a furlong left to run but faltered in the late stages. QUEEN
OF NAPLES dueled outside QUICK BROWN FOX for command, came under a ride to keep up around the turn, lost touch with the leader past the quarter
pole and weakened in the stretch. STRIKINGLY tracked the dueling leaders five wide into the turn, eased down to the three path and also weakened.

Footnotes
BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) settled along the inside, had to steady in tight at the three-eighths pole, continued along the rail to the stretch, moved out in
the lane, rallied and drove past in the final thirty yards. DEVIL MOON vied for the lead three deep then dueled outside SAWASDEE leaving the backstretch,
inched ahead on the turn, carried a short lead into deep stretch and got run down by the winner. GIVE ME THE LUTE tracked three deep, altered four wide
at the three-eighths pole, rounded the bend outside a trio of rivals, finished well and gained the show. SAWASDEE vied for the lead from inside a pair of
rivals then dueled with DEVIL MOON into the turn, kept the pressure on around the bend, fought back from the fence down the lane but got outkicked.
CANE CREEK ROAD tracked between foes then had to take up at the three-eighths pole, continued between rivals around the bend, moved out and
finished well four deep late but was also outkicked. HAPI HAPI coaxed along up the backstretch chasing well off the rail, took the turn five then four wide
and lacked a response. SILARDI vied between early then chased the top pair leaving the backstretch, lost ground and chased three deep on the turn, then
weakened and was not persevered with in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CAROL'S COMIC stalked the top pair in the early going, bid two to three wide outside the pacesetter at the quarter pole, cleared under hand urging in upper
stretch and was kept busy to the wire. MAGIC ACCOUNT brushed inner rival at the start, went up to duel from outside, cleared at the three-eighths pole,
challenged by CAROL'S COMIC at the quarter pole, yielded in upper stretch and stayed on for a clear second. THIRSTY LOV sat off the pace, traveled
along the rail into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane, failed to rally and churned on to save the show honors. BRING HIM HOME hit the
gate and brushed with outer rival, lagged behind early, exited the backstretch three wide, passed a tired rival while moving in a bit on the turn and picked off
another weakened foe in the lane to earn a minor award. SEATTLE SURF brushed leaving the gate, dueled for command from inside to the three-eighths
pole, started to weaken around the bend and folded in the lane. NATURAL CAT laid off the pace up the backstretch, dropped back to last on the turn and
made no impact.

Footnotes
JOHNNY PODRES chased at the back along the rail, drew closer late on the turn while tipping two wide, roused at the top of the stretch, moved out for a
clear run and overhauled the top pair in deep stretch. FIRST PEACE was up close early inside the pacesetter then chased that rival into the turn from the
rail, shifted to the two path around the bend, challenged from outside past the quarter pole, gained the advantage crossing the dirt and put MUCHO DEL
ORO away entering the lane, held a short lead over LANE WAY to midstretch, cleared that rival approaching the sixteenth pole but was soon confronted by
JOHNNY PODRES and could not fend off the winner. LANE WAY stalked the pace off the inside, bid three deep late on the bend, kept the pressure on
FIRST PEACE to midstretch but lacked the needed late punch in the last sixteenth. MUCHO DEL ORO stepped to the front showing the way outside FIRST
PEACE early, cleared that rival and crossed over to the inside, pressure by outer rivals past the quarter pole, lost command crossing the dirt and was ridden
cautiously next to the rail entering the lane, continued to give chase within range at the eighth pole and weakened in deep stretch. MACKINNON settled at
the back outside a rival, spun three wide into the drive and lacked a response when asked.

Footnotes
TAMBO dueled for the lead from outside, put away inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole but was immediately challenged by IN THEORY on the outside, lost
command leaving the turn, fought back to regain the advantage at the eight pole, put that rival away at the sixteenth pole while being confronted by NAY V
BELLE and stubbornly held. NAY V BELLE stalked between rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, tipped out into the clear late on the bend, chased
within striking distance to the sixteenth pole, drew alongside TAMBO and could not get by. IN THEORY stumbled leaving the gate, quickly moved into range
outside rivals, bid three wide past the five-sixteenths pole, took over entering the lane, lost command at the furlong marker and flattened in the last
sixteenth. MA RAE'S GIRL stalked the dueling pair along the inside leaving the backstretch, got put in tight at the seven-sixteenths pole and dropped back
on the turn, trailed two wide into the lane and passed a tired rival to earn a minor award. BEAU SOLEIL dueled for the lead inside a rival, could not keep
pace midway around the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
OUBABE prominent early outside the leader then stalked two wide into the turn, moved to the rail around the clubhouse bend, came under a ride on the far
turn continuing to save ground, came off the fence in upper stretch, drew alongside RED CROSS KNIGHT at the eighth pole and bested that rival in deep
stretch. RED CROSS KNIGHT stepped to the front and moved to the inside, dueled into the first turn, took back control around the bend, showed the way
under pressure to the far turn, cleared with a quarter mile remaining, confronted by OUBABE at the eighth pole, fought gamely to the wire but was
outfinished by the winner. FLY THE SKY reserved in the two path then moved out three wide on the first turn, quickly moved outside the top pair on the
backstretch, continued three deep on the far turn and finished evenly late. BIG GEORGE trailed along the inside, went outside a rival on the backstretch,
rounded the far turn in the two path, steered out into the lane and missed the show. MOOGIE SON reserved early and taken to the rail, saved ground
through the far turn, asked along the fence in the lane but could not summon the needed late kick. DICK BEST stalked off the rail in hand then raced keenly
in hand before being allowed to rush up to force the pace from outside, pressed the leader to the second bend, lost touch with a quarter mile remaining and
weakened in the drive. WORSE READ SANCHEZ tracked next to the fence then shifted over to the two path on the first turn, navigated the second bend
two then thee wide, swung out into the stretch and could not rally.

Footnotes
GAVEA took control from inside while under pressure, cleared on the backstretch, opened up on the far turn, held a diminishing lead with a furlong
remaining, asked right then left handed in deep stretch and held well. MISCHELOF (CHI) unhurried in the beginning, saved ground along the inside,
advanced on the far turn, tipped out into the stretch, moved to within striking range in upper stretch and loomed from outside with a furlong remaining but
failed to find the needed late kick in deep stretch. BAD SNEAKERS chased four then three wide on the first turn, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch,
went between foes into the far turn, ran into mild traffic from the three-eights to the five-sixteenths pole, altered to the inside shortly after, kept on through
the stretch and gained third. CRYPTO RIDE stalked the pace from inside, asked two wide on the second bend and weakened. DUAL THREAT reserved
three then two wide, trailed in the middle stages, advanced along the rail then two wide on the far turn and could not summon the needed to rally to threaten
in the drive. TELOS stalked in the two path, spun three wide into the lane and faded. SMOOTH SALUTE forwardly placed three deep in the early going,
moved out four deep up the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane and came up empty. LETSHAVEONEMORE vied between rivals into the first turn
then pressed from outside into the backstretch, chased after the leader in the middle stages, tired three wide on the far turn and was not persevered with in
the lane. MOESAHANDFUL unhurried four then three wide early, continued off the rail near the back into the second bend, rounded that turn three then two
wide, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
INNER BEAUTY (IRE) sped clear to take control, set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth and was able to hold on over
the late run from the runner-up. SMART KITTEN stalked two wide, tipped three wide around the bend, reeled in the winner late but ran out of time. NORTH
EAST STAR (IRE) tracked out of range early, saved ground through the turn, steered off the fence in upper stretch and gained third. ASPIRATIONAL
stalked from inside, moved out a bit into the lane, came back to the rail in the stretch and weakened. UNKEPT SECRET bobbled leaving the gate, trailed
along the rail to the stretch and could not make an impact. JUST IS closest in pursuit in the early going, chased two wide on the turn then lost positions
between rivals at the quarter pole and faded down the lane.

range with a sixteenth to go, came with a late rush and nailed the runner-up on the line. RUNAMILEINMYSHOES took control early, set all the pace on the
inside to the stretch, drew away in upper stretch, held a comfortable lead with a sixteenth remaining and got nailed at the wire. WARREN'S PARADICE
unhurried in the early stages and tucked inside, waited for room behind a rival on the far turn, found room leaving the bend, ran into traffic at the eighth pole,
altered out midstretch, moved back in late and surged to get up for third. ASHLEYS SANDCASTLE stalked in the three path then moved in a bit on the
clubhouse turn, went between rivals into the second bend, chased two wide into the stretch, was closest in pursuit with a sixteenth remaining, finished
willingly to cut into the margin late but got outkicked. BLONDZILLA reserved along the inside, tipped out to get a clear path but bumped with a rival past the
five-sixteenths pole, came two wide into the lane and improved. ANOTHER SUMMER tracked from inside, moved into range in the middle stages, ridden
along on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and kept trying to the wire. WISHES TO RICHES raced up close between rivals and bumped with outer
foes into the first turn, steadied briefly near the quarter pole, closest in pursuit into the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. MINERAL
RIGHTS traveled two wide off the pace, pushed on along the inside then in the two path again, tipped out into the stretch and lacked further response.
ISABEL LUDLOW tracked four then three wide, sat off the pace outside a rival in the middle stages, got bumped and put in tight past the five-sixteenths
pole, trailed into the stretch and could not menace after. GLACIER RIM showed speed three deep and bumped with inner rival into the first turn, chased off
the rail into the second bend, started to weaken around that turn and came up empty in the drive. BE A GOLDFISH came away cleanly then dropped back,
eased around the far turn, pulled up early on the backstretch and walked off.
