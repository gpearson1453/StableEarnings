Footnotes
R H SMOAKEM showed the way in hand from inside, was let out some on the bend, roused leaving the quarter pole, gradually drifted out through the lane
but held sway. SWAGGY GEORGE prominent from outside, was three wide through the turn, drifted out some at the top of the lane then again under
left-handed pressure inside the last eighth, was corrected, closed well but came up short. PEACOCK MAN pressed R H SMOAKEM from just outside,
gradually angled out as the latter came out in the stretch then also rallied belatedly. BAM BAM CAM was settled inside, commenced his bid along the rail on
the turn, threatened from inside with a furlong to go but finished evenly. AVENGING WARRIOR was an early factor but began to fade after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
FIRE WIRE a step slow at the break, advanced from outside, progressed four wide on the turn, lugged in as he engaged BRUCE ATTACK with a sixteenth
left and edged ahead in the waning yards. BRUCE ATTACK was sent to contest the pace from outside, moved clear on the bend, angled in with two
furlongs to go and did not have enough left nearing the wire. MARK'S BUDDY JACIN boxed in in the second flight on the backstretch, altered inside midway
on the turn, moved outside FIRE WIRE upper stretch, could not close the gap on the top pair but was easily best of the others. DURANGO CHROME broke
outward, bumping ANUNKA, vied for the lead from inside, was checked back from close quarters into the turn, bumped leaving the three furlong marker
stayed to the inside the rest of the way without a late bid. LORD ZEKE chased from outside and failed to menace. ANUNKA bumped at the start, disputed
the pace between rivals, was checked in close quarters near the three-eighths pole, bumped DURANGO CHROME leaving that marker, steadily gave way
and distanced from the field in the stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry into DURANGO CHROME'S and ANUNKA'S loss of action into the bend and the
rider of DURANGO CHROME lodged an objection alleging interference from ANUNKA that was initiated by BRUCE ATTACK into the turn. After their review
the stewards did not uphold the claim of foul.

WILDWOOD GHALY prominent from inside, waited along the rail on the bend, gained a clear path just outside HEAVENLY SCENT entering the stretch,
took the lead under urging, slowly drifted out as she moved clear inside the final furlong but maintained full control. HER NAME WAS LOLA vied for the lead
between rivals, did not keep up two wide on the turn, floated out some into the lane, was no match for WILDWOOD GHALY the last eighth but pulled away
for the place. MIDNIGHT SOCIETY disputed the pace briefly from outside but began to yield on the bend. HEAVENLY SCENT displayed early speed
between rivals, moved ahead and took the rail on the turn then flattened out for the drive.

SPANISH DOUBLOON shared the early lead from outside, moved clear nearing the end of two furlongs, floated out to path three entering the lane,
responded to urging upper stretch then continued to open up while ridden out the last eighth. SHEBA'S PAL displayed early speed from inside, did not stay
with SPANISH DOUBLOON approaching the seven-sixteenths marker, came off the rail some, moved clear for second upper stretch, was no match for the
latter the final furlong and began to float out in the late going. WICKED GUS inattentive in the gate, hesitated then was bumped from the rear when the gate
opened, advanced three wide on the bend, angled out widest at the top of the stretch and got up for third in the waning yards. DIAMONDONICE broke
somewhat slowly and inward, bumping WICKED GUS, was altered out, progressed four wide on turn, fanned out further into the stretch, still had a striking
position with a furlong left but leveled off instead. GONE AGAIN in contention from the outside, was three then four wide taking the bend, had every chance
in the lane but also leveled off. KNUCKLE faded from inside on the turn.

Footnotes
GHALY POSSE was kept close outside the early speed, went for the lead when allowed three wide on the bend then drew off under a drive in the stretch.
LUTION soon trailed, swung outside leaving the turn as she commenced her bid, altered inside WICKED SKY midstretch then moved outside TENSE for a
clear path as she rallied in the late going and caught TINA'S TAPIZAR for second at the wire. TINA'S TAPIZAR bobbled slightly leaving the gate, vied for the
lead from inside, was no match for GHALY POSSE when set down for the drive, began to wear down in the waning yards and was outfinished for the place.
WICKED SKY chased from outside, swung out to path four into the lane, drifted out upper stretch, was corrected and closing in for second nearing the wire.
TENSE contested the pace just outside TINA'S TAPIZAR on the backstretch, did not keep up from between rivals on the bend, angled outside GHALY
POSSE at the top of the stretch and ran evenly the rest of the way. STARSOVERPARADISE saved ground taking the turn and had no late bid.

BE MY BESTIE shared the early lead from outside, moved clear on the bend, gradually angled in upper stretch, began to wear down inside the last eighth
but held on under late urging. FREE LOVE vied for the lead from inside, did not stay with BE MY BESTIE on the turn, angled outside the latter upper stretch,
rallied the final furlong but was too late. WAR COLORS was away slowly, urged along from inside, angled out through the bend and rallied belatedly four
wide deep stretch. ORNERY ANGEL chased staying off the inside and could only make up minor ground late. BLAME TERI displayed brief speed between
rivals but began to yield on the turn. TAPICITA stayed well off the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
BUREAU without early speed, though urged along, picked up his pace between horses on the turn, split rivals two wide upper stretch then gradually drifted
out as he drew off the final furlong. LONESOME DREAM chased from between rivals, swung to the outside on the bend, drifted out to path eight at the top
of the lane, held a straight path the last eighth and caught LAYTON THE DAY for second. LAYTON THE DAY raced closest to the early speed from outside,
was three to five wide taking the turn, took over second deep stretch but was outfinished for the place. SHANGHAI POINT steadily progressed from inside
to vie for the lead briefly upper stretch, was no match for BUREAU and gradually wore down inside the final furlong. CITY OF GOD also void of early speed,
saved ground on the bend, swung out leaving the turn, angled out to path eight upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late. DUST DANCER vied for
the lead just off the rail but inside DANZA TAXI, floated out to path three entering the stretch and began to flatten. MAC PANDOWDY raced in midpack from
outside, failed to keep up four wide on the bend, angled outside LAYTON THE DAY for the stretch run and lacked a significant response. DANZA TAXI
disputed the pace outside DUST DANCER and also flattened out for the drive. AFRICAN WARRIOR broke alertly then gradually faded from between foes,
was three wide through the turn and also failed to have a serious stretch bid. LASTFORTINOFAMILY was soon far back and unresponsive to urging in the
stretch.
