FAST TRAFFIC stalked the battling trio from the inside down the backstretch, shifted outward to advance while three wide on the turn, then met BOUGIE
JOE to spar grudgingly down the lane and was up at the wire to prevail. BOUGIE JOE vied for the lead from the the three path then inched up to take
command into the turn, was confronted by an outer rival at the quarter pole to duel down the lane while in a gamely rally and just missed in the end.
OPTIMAL TRIP broke outwardly and bumped rival, was unhurried down the backstretch, came out three to four wide leaving the bend to rally in the stretch
but it was not enough to catch the cleared leaders. LEA ME BE was bumped at the start, then tucked along the inside towards to back, urged eagerly on the
turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. TALE TWISTER vied for the lead from the two path down the backstretch, continued to press the
emerging leader throughout the turn then gave way in the stretch. LUCYS MAJOR MIRCLE battle for the lead from the inside briefly and while in a hard
drive then flattened out throughout the turn.

Footnotes
GOLD MONEY was forwardly placed heading into the first turn then stalked the pace down the backstretch while two wide, inched up on the far turn to
contend with PRINCE RAMA down the home stretch and was up at the wire to claim success. PRINCE RAMA led the way into the first turn to set the pace
down the early backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn, then was confronted by GOLD MONEY on the outside to spar all out down the lane and hung
at the wire. STELLAR TAP chased the pace while two wide, was moving up from the three path heading into the far turn, menaced in the early stretch,
lacked the winning bid to catch the dueling rivals and held the show position. SPECIAL MOMENT broke outwardly and bumped rival, then chased the pace
from the inside down the backstretch, was steadily urging throughout the far turn to bid in the early stretch and came up flat in the end. MUFFIN NUTS was
hindered at the start, was allowed to settle along the inside, came out two to three wide leaving the far turn to rally mildly in the stretch and came up empty.
WILLY THE COBBLER chased the pace while four wide and outside of rivals in the early furlongs, then angle inside to bid from the two path on the far turn
and did not spark in the home stretch.

MONGOLIAN BEE saved ground well behind the field in the early furlongs, then swung seven wide leaving the bend and surged down the lane, surpassing
inner rivals and was up in time. BRAHMS BOY vied for the lead while three wide, then inched away to take command into the turn, was in a long drive while
maintaining the lead in the late stretch then was caught in the end. WILL THE THRILL vied for the lead from the two path early, then settled back on the
turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch and was gaining on the leader then was out finished by outer foe in the end and was best for show. CLEAT vied for
the lead from the inside early, then retreated to save ground throughout the turn, angled out to the five path and kept on in the late stretch. CASTILLE
chased the pace while four wide, was in a steady drive on the turn, then menaced in the upper stretch but it was not enough in the end. TIZ FABULOUS
chased the pace while five wide then moved up on the turn to press the leader under a gamely bid, could not take command and gave way in the late

Footnotes
YVONNE'S MISS raced while four wide down the backstretch, remained nicely rated throughout the turn while two wide, then dug in gamely to shake clear
in the upper stretch and was kept to task till the end. LA MORENA was squeezed at the start, then stalked the pace from the inside before settling back on
the turn, came out five wide in the upper stretch and closed well down the lane, besting the rest of the field and was up for the place prize. YOLANDA WHO
stalked the pace while three wide, then moved up vie with inner rivals on the turn, could not gain the lead but kept on for show in the stretch while in a
gamely menace. TOOTIE was squeezed back at the start, was unhurried early, then urged eagerly while five wide on the turn to rally mildly in the stretch
just missing the show position. EAGLE EXPRESS was allowed to settle along the inside, then bid mildly on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch.
CARPE HORSESHOE drifted out slightly at the start, then led the way from the inside, was confronted by two outer rivals to battle throughout the turn, was
hard used heading into the stretch and weakened in the end. PUT A BOW ON IT drifted inward and bumped rival, then stalked the pace while two wide,
moved up to vie between rivals while in a hard drive on the turn, was used up and tired in the stretch. TWO HANDS FULL chased the pace from the inside,
then flattened out on the turn and failed to rally in the stretch.

MISS CODE WEST was forwardly placed to duel with an inner rival down the early backstretch, gained command briefly at the half, then was challenged by
an outer rival to spar once again throughout the far turn, was in a determined rally to kick clear in the late stretch and prove best once again. STOIC LUNA
pressed the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then inched up to duel with MISS CODE WEST throughout the far turn, lacked the winning bid to
take the lead and gave way in deep stretch. WILD EXPRESS saved ground in the early stages, then urged steadily on the far turn to gain third position
heading in the stretch and held onto the show prize in the end. TEMPLAR RED stalked the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, then settled back on
the far turn, re bid in the early stretch and came up empty. TUDELA stalked the pace while two wide, then bid mildly on the far turn before flattening out in
the stretch. JUBELLA led the way into the first turn, then was met with an outer to duel in the early backstretch, then faded on the far turn and had no final

Footnotes
BOBBY BRINKLEY moved up the backstretch to bid while two wide on the turn, vied for the lead between rivals in the upper stretch then kicked clear and
was up at the wire to prove best. CHAMPAGNE STOOPER was well reserved behind the field down the backstretch, then came out four wide leaving the
bend to battle with inner rivals in the early stretch, rallied gamely throughout and just missed victory in the end. BLING MOUNTAIN pressed the pace from
the inside into the turn, then vied with outer foes in the upper stretch while in gamely bid and held onto the show prize in the end. CARBON STRYKER set
the pace two wide, was in a steady drive throughout the turn, then was challenged by rivals from both sides in the upper stretch, could not maintain the lead
and gave way grudgingly in the end. IMMA BLINGY LAD pressed the pace from the three path into the turn, then stopped and eased across the wire.

Footnotes
YANKEE INDIAN stalked the pace while four wide, then menaced on the turn to move up and duel with an inner rival in the late stretch and was up at the
wire to prevail. LARRY'S LEGEND chased the pace from the inside, then bid between rivals on the turn, was in a gamely rally to gain command briefly at
the top of the stretch, then was confronted by YANKEE INDIAN in the late stretch to spar in the final yards and hung at the wire. SUITABLE stalked the pace
from the inside into the turn, then shifted out to the four path mid stretch and kept on for the third position in the end. AMERICAN CODE saved ground down
the backstretch and into the turn, then dug in gamely in the upper stretch and closed willingly but it was not enough in the end. DOSE'S DREAM was
allowed to settle along the inside, then angled out six wide leaving the turn, rallied mildly in the stretch and came up empty. SAINT PIO pressed the pace
while two wide, was in a steady drive throughout the turn to take command briefly at the quarter pole, then gave way grudgingly in the stretch. DESOTO'S
WAR was allowed to settle while two wide, then swung seven wide leaving the bend to bid mildly in the upper stretch and did not fire in the end. MALIBU
THUNDER set the pace while three wide down the backstretch, continued to lead the way while two wide on the turn, was overpowered by rivals on both
sides, lost momentum and weakened in the late stretch.
