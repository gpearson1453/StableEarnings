Footnotes
SHARP ATTITUDE rated off the leaders soon after the break and angled out, tracked a contested pace well off the inside, engaged three deep and about
five to six wide mid turn, led between runners into the lane then kicked away through the final furlong while under a solid drive. STARDUST DREAMS ,
soundly bumped at the break, recovered and settled, ranged up six to seven wide outside foes and challenged past the five sixteenths, forced the issue to
mid stretch, failed to kick on with the winner but stayed on willingly to be second best. CREME DE MENTHE bore out at the break and bumped with the
runner up, corrected and chased while towards the inside, bid inside the leaders nearing the quarter pole, battled in the three path inside a pair in upper
stretch then faded late. BANGIE GO , sent to the front, set a pressured pace off the inside, failed to go on with the leaders in upper stretch and faded.
ALICESHOUSEOFHEART , awkward from the gate, raced off the pace, came two to three wide for the drive but lacked a rally. AMERICAN TSUNAMI vied
four to five wide outside BANGIE GO, failed to go on between runners past the five sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
LUNAR UNIT took over soon after the break and cleared, set a rated pace towards the inside, was joined from her outside leaving the half mile marker,
handled outside pressure then was roused clear while off the rail entering the lane, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, dug in when joined from her
inside past the sixteenth marker and proved resolute to the wire. HELLO BABY , bumped and in a bit tight at the break, recovered and secured the inside,
edged up near the half then gave hard chase of the leaders around the final turn, remained inside for the drive, moved up to engage LUNAR UNIT with a
sixteenth to go, battled gamely inside that one but just could not get past. PANCAKES AND BEER , keen early, eased out when pulling her way forward
past the five eighths, prompted outside the winner into the far turn, applied more pressure past the three eighths, could not match strides three wide entering
the lane, stayed on her left lead and went evenly through the final sixteenth. BOOSICAL LADY broke outward bumping with a rival, lost ground four wide
early on, angled in past the half and moved up some, eased out near mid stretch and continued on with effort. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE , bumped at the break,
raced three to four wide stalking the pace, was under pressure outside a foe past the five sixteenths and faded. ISLAND BEAUTY broke inward and bumped
with NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE, stalked three wide between runners nearing the half mile pole, faltered around the final turn and was vanned off. M G BIG
MARIA , bumped at the start, steadied when attempting to make a run between foes past the half, faltered, was eased in the lane then vanned off.

Footnotes
JAIME'S COMMITMENT edged up between runners nearing the turn then chased the trio of leaders, came six wide into the lane, leveled off under left
handed asks in mid stretch, kept on relentlessly and got up in the final yards. DARNQUICK , three deep disputing the pace, chased five wide in upper
stretch, came back on through the final furlong and nabbed the place over a tiring rival. HEAD FOR BUSINESS , two to three wide taking outside pressure
from a pair of foes, spurted away under a drive near mid stretch, kept on past the sixteenth marker but weakened late. FABSTRACTION forced the early
pace between foes, could not quite go on with the leaders near the quarter pole, shifted out some then came up empty. CORN POP , inside, moved up
some past mid stretch but was out kicked. BUFFETT , fractious behind the gate, circled seven wide pursuing past the quarter pole, shifted in some near mid
stretch but lacked the needed finish. D K'S CROWN , urged along off the pace, came three wide for the drive and offered a belated response.
NUMEROLOGIST , four wide nearing the lane, failed to menace.

Footnotes
PRINCESS K vied inside a pair of foes and moved to a slim lead leaving the far turn, shook clear under a drive in mid stretch, kept on under right handed
pressure inside the sixteenth pole and held firm. AWARENESS AUTISM broke a bit slow, edged up off the rail and behind a rival soon into the lane, worked
her way between runners in deep stretch and finished well to nab the place. GETAWAY DAY , in a bit tight at the break, rated behind runners early on,
dropped in and advanced along the rail in upper stretch, continued progress past mid stretch, altered out near the sixteenth marker and kept on willingly.
RICKELLE chased the embattled trio of the leaders past the three eighths, was guided outward near the three sixteenths, loomed but flattened out very late.
MAYA D chased the pace well off the inside, came six wide for the drive and churned on. SUZZIE'S DARLIN vied between foes early, pressed the pace four
wide outside the winner entering the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. KIKI'S CRUSADER , very wide, was not a factor.
LINDYSNOTOBNOXIOUS , three deep with the early pace, failed to kick on while five wide into the lane, steadied when in a bit close in upper stretch then
was eased through the final furlong.

MERINO WOOL steadied early, moved up five wide between runners leaving the far turn, took aim past the five sixteenths then angled out, closed nicely
under left handed asks, took over outside BORN TO REIGN leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear. BORN TO REIGN , seven wide into the backstretch,
rated close up, bid five wide outside foes three furlongs out, dueled, kicked clear past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. TIZ FOR REAL , eight
wide early, edged up six deep leaving the far turn, continued well wide into the lane and finished with good energy to nab the show. KEBA LUCKY DAY took
over early then guided off the rail to set the pace, took outside pressure then dueled around the final turn, ceded command into the lane then gave way
grudgingly. A THOUSAND DREAMS , three wide between runners, moved up with aim into the stretch then faded. METAROSE , four wide vying outside the
leader, dropped back between runners leaving the five sixteenths. LUCKY STEPPER , two wide between runners near the quarter pole and tired.
ORATORY GLORY saved ground, moved up some into the far turn, chased inside runners into the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
BEA MISCHIEF , six wide early, moved up five wide into the far turn, shook clear in mid stretch, drifted in while on the left lead and held sway under a drive.
SPRING SPINNING , bumped at the break, lost ground six to seven wide, advanced to contention leaving the far turn, chased and kept on willingly to gain
the place in the final yards. PARCO led early, rated back off of a rival past the five eighths, chased, came back towards inside in mid stretch and continued
with effort. BIG JOLT , four wide early, angled well wide in upper stretch and churned on. PONDERED bobbled at the break, moved up four wide outside the
leader then took over leaving the five eighths, was joined past the five eighths, fought on into the lane then gave way grudgingly. MISS JOANNIE , four and
five wide, moved up to take aim near the half, chased willingly past mid stretch then faded. CATTY DOM failed to menace. UPTOWN RHAPSODY , very
wide for the drive, was not a factor. HIGH FASHION LADY , four wide early, raced between foes near the five sixteenths but lacked a rally. HOT LIL MESS ,
bumped and in tight at the break, saved ground and faltered.

Footnotes
FIRST EMERALD sped clear into the turn, set the pace four wide into the stretch, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, drifted out a bit before being
corrected right handed then held firm. HEAVENLY VIOLET was hustled up early and pursued well off the inside, circled six wide into the stretch and finished
strong. JESSICA BLAH BLAH moved up to the inside of rivals mid turn, came three wide for the drive and kept on with effort to earn the show. SALLY
STANFORD stumbled at the break, gained towards the rail past the five sixteenths, continued progress past mid stretch then flattened out. LOTSA LOU ,
three to five wide, came up empty. CHEDOODLE RYLEE , four wide, lacked a bid. MY ANCHOR IS HOT failed to menace. ROYAL DANIELLE was not a
factor. QUEEN MYSTIC broke slowly and raced wide.
