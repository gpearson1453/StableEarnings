Footnotes
GLORIETTE sped clear early on, felt pressure from an outer bidder into the turn, shook free of that foe leaving the five sixteenths pole and drew off handily.
LET'S GO BRANDI tracked from the four to three path entering the lane, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch and ran on to edge place entering the
final sixteenth. MISSILE stuttered a step and took contact from an inner foe at the start, chased forwardly in the two path into the turn, gained place shifting
to the four path entering the lane, but relinquished that position to an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. ANDREA BEACH was brushed by an inner rival at the
start, lacked speed in the three path around the turn, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. MIKEY'S MAGIC GAL stumbled
awkwardly leaving the gates, trailed in the four path, moved out of last shifting to the six path nearing the lane and improved position. GLAMOROUS broke a
step slow, raced off of the pace in the five path and failed to menace. STUCK ON YOU rushed to press outside of the leader entering the turn, but yielded
while drifting out nearing the lane, caved entering the stretch in the six path, weakened and was found to have bled. FANCY PRANCE pursued forwardly
three wide and between horses early on, failed to sustain position before chasing from midpack along the inside around the turn, then weakened. IGUAZU
(IRE) brushed an outer rival at the start and made little impact from the three path. VEECATION bumped an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the
inside and got outrun. GET BY chased forwardly two wide and between horses, but backed out passing the half mile pole and faded thereafter.

Footnotes
ST. BENEDICTS PREP tracked in the four path, gained place leaving the three furlong pole before taking aim on the clear leader nearing the lane, but
lacked progress delaying a lead change in upper stretch, closed in getting subtly herded outwardly by the leader in the final furlong, then drove past that one
in the late stages. THEROANRUNNER led in the two path early on, cleared an outer presser moving to the three path at the three furlong pole, maintained a
clear margin through midstretch, drifted out subtly as an outer rival sustained pursuit, but was collared by that one in the final sixteenth and gave in late.
ROSIA BAY stalked along the inside, chased in upper stretch, but lacked a bid and lasted for show. LIAM'S CHAMP tracked two wide and between horses
into the turn, but steadied while getting shuffled back behind a tiring rival passing the three furlong pole, shifted out to the five to six path soon after, kept on
but needed more to reach show. SASSY WALKER pressed the leader from the four to three path into the turn, but failed to sustain pressure with three
furlongs to go and weakened between horses shortly after. EYES OF GOLD was outrun.

SIR GREYLIND vied for the lead with a pair of outer rivals, kicked clear entering the lane and held sway under a drive. EIRIK RIDGE took firm contact from
an inner rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, tipped to the three path passing the five sixteenths pole, progressed shifting to the four path in upper
stretch, ran on to gain place at the furlong grounds and was slowly gaining on the clear leader while second best. SUMMONYOURCOURAGE bumped an
inner rival at the start, stalked four deep early on, moved to press three wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane,
yielded, lost place in midstretch but safely maintained show. MOVING TO KENTUCKY bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked the top flight from the two
path, chased them around the turn, got outmoved for minor placings by an outer rival entering the lane, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and
failed to menace. PAVED IN GOLD vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but gave way at the five sixteenths pole and faded. ZECA DIABO broke
slowly but avoided being pinched between horses by doing so, trailed in the five path, advanced outside of rivals turning for home before floating to the
seven path entering upper stretch, but flattened out without reaching contention. EAST FROM WEST broke out and squarely bumped a rival causing her
own rider to almost be dislodged, recovered to race well back in the four path and never factored. UNREASONABLE took simultaneous contact from rivals
on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, chased in the four path and between horses turning for home, then tired. BEEZER vied
three deep early on, steadied between horses while failing to sustain pressure into the turn, then faltered between rivals turning for home.

Footnotes
RED STATE showed the way before dueling with an outer rival around the turn, drove clear in upper stretch, tired in the final furlong while hanging on his
left lead yet lasted from a pair of late challengers. FRACTURE transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe soon after the start, pursued from
midpack two to three wide around the turn, took aim while getting floated to the six path in upper stretch, stayed on while lugging in and hanging on his left
lead, bumped an inner rival at the furlong grounds, progressed while continuing to drift and hinder his inner counterpart in the final sixteenth, offered a late
bid while bumping that one again in the shadow of the wire and missed reeling in the tiring leader. LOU'S LEGACY was bumped by an outer rival soon after
the start, pursued from off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path aiming between horses leaving upper stretch, but was bumped by an outer
rival into an inner foe at the furlong grounds, closed in while taking more contact and being forced inwardly through the final furlong, attempted a late bid but
steadied in tight quarters in the shadow of the wire, then bobbled in the aftermath. COACH CAMPBELL bumped with an outer rival before shifting inwardly
and bumping inner foes shortly after the start, tracked along the inside, chased through the lane and lacked a bid. SHADOW SURGE prompted inside of the
pace setter before switching outside of that one with five furlongs to, reengaged and dueled two wide around the turn, but gave way in upper stretch, took
contact from outer rivals at the furlong grounds and continued to yield. BRODY took back shortly after the start, raced off of the pace in the five to six path
and ran on mildly. TEEN IDOL bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased forwardly in the four path but faded between horses entering the lane in the
five path. LET'S BOUNCE dropped back early on, climbed while trailing at the nine sixteenths pole and got outrun. TITLE CONTENDER broke a step slow
while last away, raced off of the pace three wide, but faded between horses into the turn and was done early. THE RIDER OF LOU'S LEGACY CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST THE RUNNER UP FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STETCH. FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY,
FRACTURE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
READY FOR SHIRL took back at the start, saved ground well back around the first turn, gained outside of rivals in the four to six path turning for home,
rallied to bid outside of the leaders in upper stretch, led into the final furlong and kicked clear. PIN UP BETTY tracked along the inside, stalked from the
pocket turning for home, slipped through tight rail quarters to offer a bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch, ran on to spar for
place in the final sixteenth and prevailed. SPALIDAY steadied slightly soon after the start, bumped with an outer rival entering the first turn while settling in
midpack along the inside, tracked from the three path around the far turn, took aim outside of the leading quartet entering the lane, bid along with an outer
foe in upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, sparred for place with an inner foe through the late stages but got outfinished. SCARLET
POPPY (IRE) stalked along the inside into the first turn before moving to press outside of the leader along with an outer foe entering the backstretch,
sustained pressure before wrestling a very narrow advantage entering the lane, but was outkicked by outer rivals in upper stretch, brushed and weakened
between horses nearing the furlong grounds. RACONTEUSE tracked two to three wide, but brushed with an inner foe while getting outkicked in upper
stretch and faded nearing the furlong grounds. EMBARK steadied out of crowded quarters between horses soon after the start, then steadied and shifted
across a rival's heels into the first turn, recovered trailing in the five path around that bend, tucked to the two path entering the backstretch, advanced
between horses with three furlongs to go, but leveled off without reaching contention. WINE AND WAVES got a bit keen early on, bumped and steadied
between rivals entering the first turn, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, chased along the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid.
ARGENTINIDAD laid off of the pace in the two path, saved ground around the far turn and failed to factor. CAT'S SYMPHONY bumped with inner rivals and
got knocked off stride entering the first turn, pursued from midpack three wide, but faded in the five path around the far turn. SWEET LILIBET was put to
crowded quarters and steadied off rival's heels into the first turn, raced well back in the four to two paths and made little impact. TEMPTING LADY showed
the way around both turns, but was headed entering the lane and caved between horses in upper stretch. ARGAN stalked two to three wide around the first
turn, but faded with a half mile to go, weakened around the far turn and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
MAGICAL LUTE raced at the rear along the inside, tracked creeping closer turning for home, split foes two wide entering the lane, sustained grinding
progress to bid inside of the top pair in the final furlong and edged past. MUSICAL MISCHIEF pressed two wide, stalked down the backstretch, bid around
the far turn, vied turning for home, got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane, fought on along with an inner bidder in the final furlong, but was bested
by that foe late. JULIA SHINING laid off of the pace getting floated from the two path to the five path around the first turn, quickly gained in the five path
turning for home to bid four deep entering the lane, but relinquished the advantage to an inner pair in the final furlong and yielded. FIRELINE tracked from
the two path, chased in the two to three path around the far turn and lacked a bid. SULTRY LASS broke a beat slow before being hustled forward at the
start, tracked along the inside before shifting outside of the top pair and to the four path around the first turn, chased the leaders around the far turn and
faded between horses nearing the lane. LIL KINGS PRINCESS showed the way, dictated terms with a loose advantage down the backstretch, met an outer
challenge around the far turn, got headed passing the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
ROSES FOR DEBRA tracked along the inside, tipped out turning for home, took aim in the six path in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to offer a
bid at the sixteenth pole and edged clear. LOVE REIGNS (IRE) pursued from midpack in the three path, tipped four wide entering upper stretch, rallied
along with an outer rival and gained place in the final sixteenth. ELM DRIVE tracked three wide, gained on her left lead in upper stretch, bid while changing
over at the furlong grounds, led leaving that station but was bested by an outer bidder passing the sixteenth pole, yielded and lasted for show. SECRET
MONEY lacked speed in the two path, shfited out to the six path in midstretch and offered a belated kick. B G WARRIOR showed the way along the inside,
but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and weakened. PLAY THE MUSIC saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on at the two wide
but needed more to offer a bid. BLING laid off of the pace two wide, altered course around a troubled rival in midstretch then failed to menace between
horses. OEUVRE broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace to no avail. BREEZE EASY (GB) broke slowly, raced at the rear in the two path and made little
impact. PORT TOWNSEND stalked two wide, but was outkicked and steadied when put to tight quarters in midstretch, then folded. HIGH CLASS broke
outwardly, pursued from midpack in the four to five path and faded. KISSED BY FIRE was outrun in the five path.

Footnotes
FROSTED DEPARTURE led two wide into the first turn, showed the way into the backstretch, moved to the inside into the far turn as an outer rival applied
pressure, got headed by that one entering the lane, yet fought back to regain an advantage in the final furlong and just lasted from a late on-charging
challenger. HAYES STRIKE broke a beat slow, got brushed and put to tight quarters by an inner rival at the start, trailed along the inside, took the far turn in
the two path, encountered traffic entering the lane, recovered and picked up stride along the inside nearing midstretch, closed in while tipping outside of the
tiring leading pair in the final sixteenth, but just ran on out of ground to reel in the leader at the wire. BRIGADIER GENERAL broke a bit out and brushed a
rival at the start, pressed outside of the leader, bid turning for home and gained an advantage entering the lane, led as an inner rival fought on into
midstretch, but relinquished the advantage to that one entering the final sixteenth, succumbed and gave way alte. CLASSIC CATCH lacked speed in the
four to five path and stayed on mildly. TRANSECT prompted along the inside early on, but was wrangled back around the first turn to stalk the pace entering
the backstretch, chased under urging around the far turn and faded between horses. GIANT GAME tracked from the three to four path, chased in the three
path around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
BEAUTE CACHEE (FR) dictated terms by setting an uncontested pace down the backstretch, felt mild pressure from an outer rival turning for hoe, shook
clear in upper stretch and held sway. ENGLISH ROSE (IRE) stalked along the inside under snug restraint around the first turn, chased the clearing leader in
upper stretch, ran on well to close in on that one in the final furlong but was only second best. DIDIA (ARG) stalked three to two wide, applied pressure
around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, chased that one losing place in the final furlong and safely held show. SURGE
CAPACITY was off a bit awkwardly, tugged forward between horses early on before entering the first turn a bit keen, tracked two wide and between horses,
then two to three wide around the far turn, then only managed to chase evenly through the lane. WALKATHON broke inwardly, tracked along the inside,
awaited racing room around the far turn, then pursued evenly and lacked a bid. FLUFFY SOCKS laid off of the pace along the inside, bided time behind
rivals turning for home in the three path, shfited out to the six to seven path in upper stretch and failed to menace between horses. GINA ROMANTICA got a
bit keen nearing the wire for the first time, settled off of the pace two wide into the first turn, pursued four wide around the far turn before spinning to the five
path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. STAR FORTRESS (IRE) trailed two wide, took the far turn in the five path before floating to the eight path in upper
stretch, and made little impact. ELUSIVE PRINCESS (FR) steadied early, raced well back along the inside, followed rivals in the four path around the far
turn, entered upper stretch in the six path and failed to factor. EMBRACE ME steadied back early on, lacked speed three to four wide and faded.

Footnotes
ENCINO dictated terms in the two path, dug in to resist an outer challenge nearing the lane, took brushes from that bidder while sparring through midstretch
and gamely held firm. THE WINE STEWARD tracked along the inside, advanced inside of rivals to press outside of the leader entering the far turn, bid
turning for home, dueled while brushing his inner counterpart through midstretch and was turned away. DILGER (IRE) settled well back in the two path,
advanced between horses at the five sixteenths pole, dueled for show with an inner rival through the lane and prevailed. SECRET CHAT pursued from
midpack along the inside, dueled for show with an outer rival through the lane but got bested. FOOTPRINT trailed along the inside, checked subtly when put
to tight quarters approaching the five furlong pole, advanced inside of rivals nearing the lane and failed to menace. LIBERAL ARTS raced at the rear in the
four to five path around the first turn, lacked a response to urging while trailing in the two path around the far turn, then surpassed tired rivals entering the
lane. HADES pursued from midpack in the three to five path around the first turn, chased widest of all around the far turn and gave way. LUCKY JEREMY
stalked in the four path but faded between horses with five sixteenths to go. HOW'S UR ATTITUDE applied light pressure outside of the leader and from the
three path, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole.
