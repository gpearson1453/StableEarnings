Footnotes
ODDS ON MISCHIEF set a pressured pace, was met approaching the quarter pole and briefly gave up the lead on the turn, but dug in determinedly to eke
out the advantage over TRUE BUCKPASSING, who was bumped leaving the gate then pressured the pace, contested the edge into the turn and dug in a
game factor to the finish. CANDY TRICKS chased, raced off the rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch for third. PRINCESS OF GOLD became a bit
anxious in the gate, ducked in and made contact with True Buckpassing at the break then gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened
in the stretch duel for third. NEEDLES COOKIE gave chase toward the inside, angled to the four path midway on the turn then flattened stride mid-stretch.
MEGEEZER veered out leaving the gate then chased from well back and saved ground on the turn. SPECIAL KAYLEE chased outside then weakened in
the three path on the turn.

Footnotes
LIEUTENANT BROWN stalked the early pace from the three path, took the lead leaving the half mile pole and was urged clear toward the three eighths,
raced at the rail on the far turn then kept sharp in the lane. XCELLENT START settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled through the stretch for second. SPUNMAN settled back in the three path the opening turn, gave
chase past the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, rounded the far turn about the three path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
NET WORTH saved ground racing well back from early contention, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed
little more. MY HANDSOME MAN raced well back in the three and four paths, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path then flattened. HOT FUDGE SONDE settled off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened.
BILLYKUS set the early pace inside, was met leaving the half mile pole, steadied past the three eighths and gave way. JAZZ WITH DENIS stalked off the
rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

the pace and dueled for the nod leaving the quarter pole, contested the advantage two deep on the turn, dug in leaving the turn but was caught in the final
stride. COLT ROCK set a pressured pace inside, was met leaving the quarter pole and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, dug in
leaving the turn but relented in the stretch duel. TIMMY chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. FROGGY THE GREMLIN
gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. REBEL WARRIOR was off stride leaving the gate then chased outside, raced

Footnotes
BULL'S LEGACY stalked the early pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased to the three path leaving the far
turn, dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. THELASTSAY rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of SPARKLEINYOUREYE
nearing the three eighths pole and contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dueled that one for second but was outfinished for the win. The latter was
bumped outward and into Philmary Castle leaving the gate then stalked from the four path the opening turn, challenged nearing the three eighths pole,
contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. DREAM STREET ROSE saved ground,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled widest into the stretch then flattened the final sixteenth.
SHEWONTTALKTOME broke inward and made contact with Philmary Castle and rounded the first turn about the seven path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and could only improve her position. SOMESUGARNSPICE broke awkwardly and outward and made contact with Sparkleinyoureye then
saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. HERE'S A QUARTER raced five wide on the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and weakened. ROMAN CANDLE raced six wide on the opening turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. CUT HIM LOOSE raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded past
the seven sixteenths. PHILMARY CASTLE was jostled at the break and mostly saved ground.
