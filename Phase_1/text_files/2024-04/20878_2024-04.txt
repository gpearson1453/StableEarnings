Footnotes
DREAMSTER tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, ranged up turning for home to strike the front entering the lane, and
drew off while kept to task. MUSIC CITY STAR raced forwardly along the inside before dropping back to chase approaching the turn, ran on up the fence to
offer a bid for place inside of rivals in the final furlong and edged that position. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH stalked from the three path and between horses
into the turn, got outmoved but her outer counterpart nearing the lane, kept on to bid offer a bid for place in the final furlong but got outfinished by a rail
bidder. BLAME DAY broke out at the start, showed the way in the two path, got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane, gave way and yielded place to
rivals on either side in the final sixteenth. ROSE PALACE was hesitant to load, got floated outwardly by an inner rival at the start, lagged behind in the four
to five path and was outrun.

SUNNY ISLE BEACH tracked the top pair from the two path, bid outside of the top pair while under urging nearing the lane and drove clear in upper stretch.
JUMP INTO THE FIRE showed the way along the inside as an outer rival applied pressure down the backstretch, vied with that one around the far turn, got
headed by a wider bidder entering the lane, proved no match for that one in upper stretch and held place. GUANA CAY raced at the rear along the inside,
edged show from outer rivals in upper stretch and needed more to bid for place. LUNA MOTH tracked from the four path, chased under urging around the
far turn and lacked a bid. AMAZON QUEEN stalked in the three path before moving forward to press the leader around the far turn, vied with that around
around the far turn, but was outmoved by an outer bidder nearing the lane and weakened between horses entering it.

Footnotes
CONDIMENT GIRL raced close up along the inside before stalking into the turn, pursued the clear leader along with an outer rival through midstretch, drove
past along with her outer counterpart at the sixteenth pole, dueled and prevailed. MAZOKU stalked in the five path, then from the three path around the turn,
chased the clear leader along with an inner rival through midstretch, bid and dueled with that one through the final sixteenth but missed. FOREVER HOME
vied three deep before moving forward to show the way in the two path around the turn, maintained a margin from chasers through midstretch, but was
caught by an outer bidding pair at the sixteenth pole, yielded yet saved show. GHOSTLY NIGHT bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked the main group
into the turn, inched closer four wide and outside of those rivals turning for home, but leveled off entering the lane, chased willingly through the final furlong
and missed reaching show. ENDLESS trailed along the inside and stayed on. GOSHEN was bumped by an inner rival at the start, lacked speed two wide,
then failed to menace between horses. SENSE YOU LEFT raced forwardly in the four path and between horses while under consistent urging, chased two
wide and among foes around the turn, then faded. LEMON BOMB prompted two wide and between horses for a quarter mile, chased approaching the half
mile pole, pursued three wide around the turn before drifting to the six path in upper stretch, and tired.

Footnotes
BATTEN DOWN showed the way in the three to two path around the first turn, established a loose margin entering the backstretch, opened up a wider
margin when let out a notch turning for home, then was put to wraps at the furlong grounds with the deal sealed. DAILY GRIND took simultaneous contact
from rivals on both sides at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, was roused to the four path to advance around the far turn, gained place at the
three sixteenths pole and was second best. MO RUM stalked in the four to three path around the first turn, chased closest to the clear leader around the far
turn, lost place to an outer bidder in upper stretch and remained clear of the rest. BETTERA bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, raced off of the pace in
the five to four path around the first turn before trailing entering the backstretch, advanced in the five path around the far turn and sustained progress to
surpass tiring rivals. BRICKLAYER stalked along the inside, chased and gave way turning for home. GET AHEAD NOW broke a step slow and was last
away, then made little impact two wide. LET'S BOUNCE bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked from midpack in the five to four path around the first turn,
then faded between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
PHILEAS FOGG showed the way in the two path, led in hand around the far turn, kicked away in upper stretch and widened under mild urging.
GATLINBURG pressed the leader form the three path, failed to keep pace while proving no match in upper stretch, yet safely managed place thereafter.
LUNA VIEJA raced off of the pace along the inside, was roused to the four path around the far turn and ran on willingly. CARCANO laid off of the pace in the
three to two path, advanced between horses entering the lane and leveled off. MILLERS RITE tracked two wide and among foes, backed out entering the
far turn, pursued from the three path around the turn and surpassed tired rivals. GO BALI GO was brushed by an outer rival at the start, stalked along the
inside, chased around the far turn and gave way. THREE ON THE TREE bobbled at the start and brushed an inner rival while awkward to recover, raced at
the rear along the inside, took the far turn in the four path and failed to factor. STONEMONT REUNION tracked in the four path, chased in the five path and
between horses around the far turn, then tired. BATTLE OF NORMANDY pursued from midpack under snug restraint in the three path and among foes
around the first turn, chased in the six path and outside of rivals around the far turn, then faded.

Footnotes
PIVOSKY tugged two wide pursuing from midpack around the first turn, stalked along the inside into the far turn, slipped up a vacated rail to bid for the lead
entering the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, held sway through midstretch and lasted from a late challenger. BROUGHTY FERRY settled off of the pace
three wide, took the far turn in the five path before floating to the six path entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but
ran out of ground to reel that one in. MO SENSE saved ground off of the pace, gained place at the three sixteenths pole but was outkicked by an outer
rallying-rival at the sixteenth pole. MISS TAPPY TONE brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, pursued
from the three to four path around the far turn, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and ran on mildly. CORKAGE FEE stalked two wide before tugging forward
in the four path to bid for the lead nearing the backstretch, sparred for the lead with an inner rival while taking the far turn in the three path, got outkicked by
a rail bidder entering the lane and faded between horses. LASERJET trailed in the four to six path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and moved
up. TRANSPARENCY brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced forwardly along the inside, pursued two wide and between horses approaching the far
turn, took that bend in the three path before entering the lane in the four path, and faded. LEUCADIA stalked in the three to four path, but drifted to the five
path entering the lane and weakened between horses. STAIRSTEP TOHEAVEN showed the way along the inside, vied with an outer rival entering the
backstretch, continued to spar while a path off of the inside around the far turn, then faltered between horses entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
CLEARLY UNHINGED prompted outside of the leader approaching the turn, vied around the bend, forged an advantage in upper stretch, drew clear in
midstretch and was ridden out before being put to hand late. PISTOL tracked in the three to four path, ran on willingly to gain place in the final sixteenth.
FILLY CRYSTAL brushed with an inner foe soon after the start, set the pace inside of a prompting foe into the turn, sparred before getting headed by that
one in upper stretch, proved no match, yielded and lasted for show. LAURA'S CHARM raced at the rear two wide, shifted out to the five path in upper
stretch and chased evenly. ADMISSIBLE bobbled a bit while breaking a step slow, raced at the rear along the inside, steadied behind a faltering foe at the
five sixteenths pole, then failed to menace. QUICK MUNNY brushed with an outer foe soon after the start, prompted briefly before chasing the top pair
approaching the turn, but weakened around the bend.
