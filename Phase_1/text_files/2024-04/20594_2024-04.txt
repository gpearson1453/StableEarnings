Footnotes
PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD showed the way in the three path, kicked away from outer pressers entering the lane and drew off under a drive. BETTE DAVIS
tracked outside oft the leading pair and from the five path, crept closer to press around the turn, vied for place with an inner foe while in pursuit of the
clearing leader in upper stretch and was second best. HIGH FASHION KATE pressed the leader from the four path, then between horses turning for home,
proved no match while vying for place with her outer counterpart in upper stretch and gradually yielded. CORKAGE FEE stalked along the inside and faded.
BERLAINE tucked to the inside down the backstretch, pursued from the two path around the turn and failed to menace. LUBU brushed with an outer foe at
the start, lacked speed in the five path and failed to factor. NOSHUGFORPOP brushed with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four path and was outrun.
FINAL TIME WAS CORRECTED ELECTRONICALLY. INTERNAL FRACTIONS ARE PENDING REVIEW.

Footnotes
SHOOT IT TRUE broke outwardly, yet quickly sped clear soon after, showed the way in the two path around the bend and widened well in hand.
STRUMMIN chased from midpack along the inside, then ran on between horses in midstretch and brushed with an outer foe to gain place leaving the
sixteenth pole. CHADO was hustled forward leaving the chute to vie for place with an outer rival while chasing the clear leader around the turn, then yielded
gradually. INDIGO WIND broke in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked vying for place in the three path around the turn, drifted about while maintaining
that position through midstretch, but brushed with an inner bidder while losing place passing the sixteenth pole and weakened. TURNBUCKLE lacked early
speed and trailed along the inside, swung out to the six path entering upper stretch and rallied belatedly. EL DANDI steadied soon after the start when
losing his path to an inner foe, then failed to menace from the three path. VINEGAR HILL was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, then
steadied hard when put to crowded quarters among rivals after half a furlong, pursued from midpack in the four path and faded. FORTHELOVEOFRUN took
contact from outer rivals at the start, lacked speed in the four path and made little impact. BAYTOWN BARACUS checked between horses into the turn,
dropped back to pursue well back in the two path and was outrun.

Footnotes
ROMAN GRACE showed the way a bit off the inside, drew clear from outer pressers entering the lane and held sway. PRINCESS MADISON pursued from
midpack in the three path and between horses, waited behind traffic turning for home, remained blocked in the four path in upper stretch, then rallied
between horses in the final furlong to gain place at the sixteenth pole. BEDAZZLE 'EM pursued from midpack in the five path, advanced to claim place at
the three sixteenths pole while pursuing the clear leader, got outkicked for place by an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole and held show. BELLS BEACH
rated at the rear hung six wide and ran on willingly outside of foes. KISS ME AGAIN laid off of the pace in the four to five path and between horses, then
stayed on while one paced. AMERICAN SAINT tracked along the inside, chased into the lane and yielded. TAMMY'S CRUISER saved ground off of the
pace, brushed with an outer rival in upper stretch and made little impact. SENSE OF PEARL pressed from the three path, then weakened between horses
brushing with an inner rival in upper stretch. NEAT TRICK stalked in the four path and faltered between horses.

Footnotes
SY B tracked along the inside, pursued from the three path around the far turn, tipped six wide entering the lane, rallied to drive past the leaders in
midstretch and held sway. MS SEDONA broke a beat slow and was taken in hand at the start, settled well back in the two path, swung out seven wide
entering the lane, rallied to bid along with an inner foe in midstretch but was kept at bay by that one through the final furlong. ROCK LUCKY rated close up
along the inside, took aim two wide and between horses entering the lane, bid and gained a brief advantage at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked
by an outer pair at the furlong grounds, yielded yet saved show. CAPO DONNA pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room nearing the
lane, shfited out five wide entering it and chased evenly. SWANS COVE brushed with an inner foe at the start, saved ground well back, then moved up
between horses in the final furlong. EVERYTHING BUGS ME bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the three to two path, then faded three wide
and between horses in upper stretch. LEMON LATTE laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. TALONNADE stuttered a step and took
contact from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and faded. PRISCILLA'S COVE
tracked in the four to three path, floated back four wide entering the lane and faltered between hroses. SAVA showed the way around both turns, but was
headed in upper stretch and stopped. MORNING SPLENDOR bumped with an inner rival and steadied out of crowded quarters between horses at the tart,
then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GLENGARRY showed the way in the three to two path down the backstretch, dictated terms around the turn, kicked away from chasers in upper stretch and
held well. WHO DEY pursued from midpack in the three path, lacked progress in upper stretch before shifting inwardly at the furlong grounds, then offered
rail improvement in the final furlong to reach place in the closing stages. FROSTY INDULGENCE broke inwardly while off slow, recovered to track along the
inside, shifted out while gaining place from an outer foe in the final furlong, but was bested by an inner bidder for that position late. DONCHO stalked
allowing an outer rival to show the way down the backstretch, moved outside of that one to press with a half mile to go, chased among foes turning for
home, failed to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch, lost place to an inner rival at the sixteenth pole and yielded. BOOTH stalked in the four
path and gave way. BAYTOWN CHATTERBOX laid off of the pace in the two path and tired. BOLT AT MIDNIGHT trailed in the four path and got outrun.

Footnotes
LEGADEMA tracked along the inside, took aim inside of the leader in upper stretch, bid in the final furlong and edged past. SAM'S TREASURE broke a beat
slow leaning into an outer rival at the start, rushed forward to set the pace inside of pressing foes, cleared then while entering the lane just off the rail, but
was caught by an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole and remained well clear of the rest. COZEE RAGS broke a step slow, trailed in the three path, moved
out to the five to six path in upper stretch and rallied for show. STREAMING NOW pressed three to two wide and between horses turning for home, but gave
way in upper stretch. BOURBON BREEZE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and improved past outer rivals in
upper stretch. AMOR FATI stalked four to three wide, pursued between horses turning for home and faded. BUTTERCREAM BABE broke out and bumped
a rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the five path, inched closer four wide turning for home, but weakened hanging on her left lead. BEST KISS YET
prompted two wide and between horses, but yielded into the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LESLIE'S ROSE stalked behind the leaders and path off of the inside, pursued well in hand around the far turn, split foes three wide entering the lane to
boldly take aim on the new leader, bid outside of that one entering the final furlong and drove clear. JUST F Y I took a light graze from an inner rival at the
start, tracked three wide and between horses, pursued four wide and outside of the leaders around the far turn, got floated five wide entering the lane, yet
ran on willingly between horses to edge place late. IMPEL prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, vied with that one in the two path around
the far turn, forged an advantage approaching the lane, but was bested by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, gave way and lost place late. CANDIED
settled at the rear along the inside, advanced four wide turning for home before fanning six wide entering the lane, then leveled off while hanging on her left
lead. STANDOUTSENSATION laid off of the pace along the inside, chased in three path around the far turn and failed to factor. SHIMMERING ALLURE
was brushed by an inner rival and lightly scraped an outer foe at the start, lacked speed two wide, then along the inside around the far turn and made little
impact. JODY'S PRIDE stalked in the four to three path, pressed turning for home, but weakened between horses after getting floated four wide entering the
lane. HALINA'S FORTE broke a bit outwardly and brushed a foe at the start, showed the way in the two path, sparred with an outer rival while saving
ground around the far turn, got headed turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
FAITH UNDERSTOOD prompted two wide, vied around the far turn, dueled with a narrow advantage in upper stretch, led late and lasted. HIDDEN
PRESENCE saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing room nearing the lane, rallied to be behind the top pair leaving upper stretch, altered course
outside of them passing the furlong grounds, sustained a bid but just missed. MOONLIGHT GAMBLER lacked speed along the inside, picked up stride
before shifting five wide in midstretch, rallied to offer a late bid but missed at the wire. TONALITE showed the way inside of a pressing foe, dueled with that
one turning for home and through midstretch but gave way late. JUSTDENY bobbled at the start, stalked two to three wide but lacked a bid. MIZOULA (IRE)
brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside while a path off the inner rival, then yielded between horses in upper stretch.
STEPHANIESWARRIOR brushed with an inner foe at the start, lacked speed in the three path, then four to six wide around the far turn and moved up.
LUCKY SPEECH pursued from midpack along the inside, shfited out around the far turn, chased before being floated six wide in midstretch and gave way.
REDO trailed along the inside and failed to factor. GUINEVERE brushed and was put to a bit of tight quarters between horses at the start, settled well back
in the two path, then in the five to seven path around the far turn and made little impact. HAND IT OVER laid off of the pace two to four wide and faded
between horses.
