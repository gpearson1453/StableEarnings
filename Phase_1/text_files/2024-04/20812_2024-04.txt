Footnotes
BRIGHT MOON never far back, rallied four wide through upper stretch to make the lead near the furlong marker then finished full of run through the final
stages and drew off to win in hand. MALI BALI stalked the pace for a half, loomed boldly three wide at the top of the stretch then was no match for the
winner while well clear for second. WORKING HOLIDAY pressed the pace two wide for a half, gained a narrow lead briefly, matched stride until deep
stretch then came up empty. SURPRISED GEM set a pressured pace along the inside for a half, remained a sharp threat past the furlong marker then
weakened. UNESCORTED was no factor. BEAUTY IN MOTION saved ground and was through after a half.

MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU away alertly, set all the pace while nicely rated and won under energetic handling. BOSS BEAR with the second flight two wide,
angled out three wide at the top of the stretch, had a mild late rally three wide under strong handling and got up for second. CAMBIASO with the second
flight three wide, moved up four wide into the stretch, shifted in two wide and was outfinished for second. DUEL FUEL failed to menace. RUBINSTEIN with
the second flight along the inside, failed to respond. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE offered a mild bid three wide nearing the half mile marker, chased the winner
into the stretch then came up empty. KLAATU pressed the early pace two wide and gave way on the far turn.

clear and lasted under right handed urging. BACKATYA hopped at the start, was allowed to settle then rallied determinedly in the four path through the final
furlong and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage late. LAUDA SPEED unhurried early, found his best stride late inside. SURF AND TURF failed
to menace. JOKEMEISTER sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, got out on the turn, swung out to the eight path entering the stretch and faded

IT'S OFFICIAL broke sharply then was allowed to settle, stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied four wide through the turn to make the lead in upper
stretch and finished full of run under a strong hand ride to win as much the bests. G T THREE FIFTY dueled for the lead two wide for a half, dropped back
entering the stretch then came on again late in the four path and got up for second. MIDNIGHT WARSHIP battled for the lead three wide into the turn,
gained the advantage, kept on but was outfinished. OVER THE HILLS never far back, finished determinedly four wide. GOLDEN SPOKE trailed down the
backstretch and found his best stride late. UPTOWN was no factor. AUTHENTIC COWTOWN was outrun. MORETHANREADYEDDIE dueled for the lead
along the inside and was through after a half. WILEY T was no threat.

determinedly along the rail under right handed urging and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage late. SICILIAN STYLE TWO pressed the pace
along the inside then two wide and was outfinished. MAKES SENSE TO ME offered a mild bid four wide nearing the quarter pole then leveled off. JACK'S

STRATOGALE chased the pace into the stretch, rallied two wide to make the lead past the three sixteenths pole, was put to right handed urging and drew
off to win as much the best while taken in hand late. SHARP AZ CAN BE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch
then was no match for the winner. DAISY JONES stalked the pace along the inside and went evenly. IN AMERICAN bore out at the start and was no threat.
DO YOU REALIZE got out, raced a wide trip and was no factor. NOT OVER YET had brief speed. ZULLY BELLA trailed.
