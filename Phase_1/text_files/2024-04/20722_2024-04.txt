Footnotes
LIGHT FACE brushed at the start, raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the turn, split rivals down the lane and proved the best.
IMMA MADI TUE sprinted to the front, drove clear, led until deep in the stretch, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was best of others. MALLORY'S
OCEAN pressed the pace, raced close throughout, proved no match for the top two, but held on for third. SWEETHEART VISION lacked early speed,
moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally, closed well and just missed third. ADIAMONDINTHESTORM pressed the pace, eased back,
lacked a late kick and finished evenly. RONA VISION void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. SWEET REVIVAL raced evenly near the
back and was never a factor. CHUCHI raced near the middle of the field and weakened. HARD CANDY KISSES raced evenly in the middle of the pack and
faded. AMELIES DREAMER showed early speed and dropped back. GLORIOUS GEARS broke in, brushed rival, always raced near the back and showed
little. PER RULING 25376, LIGHT FACE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO UNPLACED FOR A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

up, four wide around the turn, made a bid down the stretch, dueled with HAUNTRESS and just missed. AWESOME BECCA void of early speed, came
around the turn wide, made a late gain, finished willingly, but proved no match for the top two. MOR MOR MUSIC broke through the gates and got loose
before the start, sprinted to the front, drove clear and faded. CASBY showed early speed, faded and finished evenly. SAINT ISABEL vied for the early
advantage, dropped back and was no threat late. RUSTY'S SUNRISE raced near the middle of the field in the early part, saved ground around the turn and

Footnotes
WAR TOURIST unhurried in the beginning, racing in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, made a bid down the lane, challenging
NATURALBORNSENDER for the lead and proved the best late. NATURALBORNSENDER raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, made a
bid, took the lead down the stretch, but was outfinished for the win. ADDI BUG raced within striking distance, entered the stretch wide, made a late bid and
was a clear third at the wire. ARMS APRIORITY sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and tired. DAT GUITAR pressed the early pace, faded and
was no threat late. LAKE BALI lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. DEBS PRAYER void of early speed, improved position, but was
no threat. KATIE'S C raced evenly near the back and was never close. STOP SHOP N DROP raced within striking distance and dropped back. AGAMI
lacked early speed and showed little. SABERFIGHT always raced near the back and was outrun.

LIKE THIS went to the front, dueling for the early advantage, saved ground and drove clear before the wire. SONO broke through the gates before the start,
pressed the pace, raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. GOT ME A CHRYSLER lacked early speed, made a
steady gain and missed second. HOSTILE AFLEET raced near the back in the early going, made a wide gain and finished willingly. DREWMAZING void of
early speed, saved ground around the turn, showed late interest, but was no factor. HALF AGAIN vied for the early advantage and weakened down the
home stretch. GOLDEN PALACE raced near the middle of the pack, weakened and lacked a late bid. HOORAY AUSTIN raced in the back of the pack in the
beginning and passed tired ones. KAJUN KARMA lacked early speed and showed little. SADIE'S LIGHT void of early speed and was outrun. CREOLE
CHARLIE pressed the early pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
PRINCE COSMO stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the lane and pulled away. INGLIS went to the
front, drove clear, saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, while drifting out down the lane and was a clear second at the wire. PAPA FLEW
BOMBERS lacked early speed, made a steady gain, raced outside around the turn, made a wide rally and got up for third. MY STORY lacked early speed,
gained ground, while saved ground around the turn and missed the show position. COUNTRY CAT JAKE raced within striking distance, saved ground and
lacked a late kick. WILDCATS'S MEOW void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. BAY MOBILE raced in the middle of the field and put
forth an even effort. A FOOL FOR CARLOS raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. THE BOYZ REAL DEAL void of early speed and was never
close. MY LITTLE VISION challenged on the front end and made a steady retreat. TERNI VALENTINO raced near the middle of the field and dropped back.
