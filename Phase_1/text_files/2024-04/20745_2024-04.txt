Footnotes
CONTRARY THINKING chased three to four wide advancing on the top pair through the latter portion of the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, lugged
in at the three-sixteenths brushing CAGE MATCH, rallied to take command a furlong out crossing to the two path, then inched away in hand to the finish to
prevail. LIGHT THE WAY hustled from the gate, cut the pace from the two path under some pressure from CAGE MATCH to the outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared a furlong out, got taken very briefly in hand
and altered out near the sixteenth marker when the eventual winner drifted partially in front and ran on to preserve the place honors. CAGE MATCH coaxed
from the start, prompted the pace three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, got brushed when CONTRARY
THINKING lugged in at the three-sixteenths but continued under a drive despite it, then got brushed once more when LIGHT THE WAY tipped out near the
sixteenth pole, ran on well clear of the rest for the show honors. ALEAH ALEAH chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened. MANO E MANO chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. DISCREET BNB broke out at
the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of CAGE MATCH alleging interference against
CONTRARY THINKING in the stretch run. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared
official.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY GIRL showed speed on the outside then chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, gained on the leader under a drive into the
final furlong, took the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. KEEP IT SEXY came out a bit at the break then was hustled,
was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, gained outside into the final furlong and willingly
earned the place. LOVE LIKE CRAZY settled off the pace then came under urging, went three wide for most of the turn then shifted to the four path, spun
five wide into the stretch under a drive, gained on the leader into the final furlong, pursued the winner to the finish and flattened out some able to get the
show. ARMY OF THOUGHTS was last to commence while off a half-step slow, moved up along the rail while sent hard, brushed with a foe while taking the
lead near the five-eighths pole, moved clear while coming out to the two path late on the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path, came under
the crop in upper stretch, led into the final furlong then was overtaken outside the sixteenth-pole and tired while just able to hold the last spot in the
superfecta. SHASI was urged along at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and gained late but just missed the
superfecta. PROPER GRAMMAR showed speed between horses, brushed with a rival to her inside near the five-eighths pole, paused while having her path
taken outside the half-mile pole, dropped in into the turn, saved ground while chasing on that bend, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the
needed response. ROSEMARY POTATOES settled on the outside, dropped back while urged five then four wide on the turn, remained on her inside lead in
the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SILVER SATIN coaxed from the gate, settled just off the inside just off the duel up front, remained on hold in behind rivals through the latter portion of the
turn unable to tip out until angled six wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, rallied to issue a challenge to take command just outside the sixteenth
marker, then edged away to the finish. SCHLOMO broke in at the start bumping and forcing TOMACON to steady, settled four then three wide just off the
duel, advanced on those rivals through the latter portion of the turn and got set down swinging four to five wide into upper stretch, seized command
straightened away, dug in under threat to the outside and was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, ran on willingly well clear of the rest to be along second
best. TOMACON broke a half a beat slow and got bumped in the right shoulder at the start by SCHLOMO and was forced to steady in behind that foe
conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into
upper stretch and improved position to the finish to procure the show honors. ARTFUL DREAMER broke in at the start and was corrected, chased six paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the inside into the turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. HEY TOBY coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch and tired. BOSS TWEED coaxed from the start, dueled inside of the aforementioned foe, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took
the inside route into upper stretch and yielded command straightened away, then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
DISAPPEARANCE was urged along on the outside, went five then six wide on the turn, gained to make a bid in the seven path into the stretch, dueled
outside of the runner-up in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. UNION LIGHTS settled off the pace, was roused while three then four
wide on the turn, gained to make a bid in the six path into the stretch, dueled inside of the winner to the finish and was denied while clear for the place.
UNCLE WATER FLOW settled off the early pace then came under urging, was hard ridden late on the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the turn,
swung eight wide into upper stretch, chased outside while looming a threat into the final furlong but flattened out some while willingly earning the show.
STRONG LIGHT broke with the rest of the field then was was grabbed strongly with the left-rein and dropped back, spotted the front a few lengths, dropped
well behind the rest of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out near the furlong marker and improved position. EDGE OF GLORY was
reluctant to load, disputed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the four path while asked on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and
weakened. ARREBATO contested the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail while asked on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.
WINNING CONNECTION attended the pace between horses, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came out a path near the quarter-pole, dropped
back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
GRAYOSH broke out a step at the start bumping COLORFUL LADY into JUST ONE MORE which in turn forced that rival to steady, tracked along the inside
through the first turn before tipping to the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, tipped out to the two path diverting
WISH LIST three wide just past the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced to swing two to three wide for home, rallied to
engage the leader a furlong out, seized command near the sixteenth pole and edged clear to the finish to prevail. CHANTILLY ROAD got brushed at the
start in a chain of bumps begun the aforementioned foe, established the front shortly after the break and showed the way along the inside under rating and
the accompaniment of CLASSIC CARA latched on in the early stages to the outside, remained patiently handled until given a notch to work with near the
quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, slipped away briefly before coming under threat to the outside, got collared near the sixteenth marker and ran
on willingly to the finish to be along clear of the rest and second best. COLORFUL LADY got bumped at the start by GRAYOSH and in turn bumped JUST
ONE MORE forcing that foe to steady when in tight brushed up against the aforementioned rival, tracked just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish to secure the show honors. WAKE UP LAUREN coaxed
from the gate, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved
position to the eighth pole, then made no late headway. WISH LIST tracked two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch, offered no response. JUST ONE MORE got bumped at the start and was forced to steady in between foes when in tight briefly,
chased two to three wide, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CLASSIC CARA forwardly
placed three then two wide through the first turn, attended the leader to the outside in the two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and tired.

UPSIDE POTENTIAL brushed with a rival at the start, moved in while advancing to the lead, shook clear after tightening it up on CLUBHOUSE near the
nine-sixteenths, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when put to the crop in upper stretch and held under strong urging.
INDEPENDENT PAUL was urged along then chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out
when given one pop of a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, pursued the winner under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth, swapped back to
his inside lead when given a pop of a right-handed crop late and gained to just miss while clear for the place. NINETEEN OYSTERS was coaxed along off
the pace, went five wide under urging on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. WARRIOR RICHARD settled
under some urging, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, came between horses into the final furlong and also finished
willingly but just missed the show. CLUBHOUSE brushed with a foe at the start, showed early speed on the inside of a rival, was carried in near the
five-eighths pole then taken back before steadying off the heels of the leader, drafted inside on the turn, came a bit off the rail into upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick. LOOKIN' SUPER broke out and brushed the gate, moved up on the outside under urging then chased the pace, rounded the turn in the
four path, was carried out some inside the three-sixteenths and weakened. PINEAPPLE MAN dropped back while urged along, moved out late on the
backstretch, shifted from the five path to the three path on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS brushed with a rival shortly after the start, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, moved to the two path late on that bend,
rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead into the final furlong then burst clear and proved best under good handling. EQUITIZE (GB)
brushed with an opponent at the start and bobbled, was taken under a hold early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, saved ground
while asked on the far turn, came off the rail in upper stretch, gained fast between horses outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy for the
place. DAKOTA GOLD went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside but with some cover, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide
into the stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and improved for the show. PIONEERING SPIRIT brushed with a rival at the start, dropped from the
three path to the two path early on the first turn, settled on the outside but with some cover, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn, swung six
wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the final furlong and just missed the show. BRING ME A CHECK raced in the four then five path on the first turn,
tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the four path on the far turn, chased while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, paused while
in tight in traffic near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. HEAVEN STREET broke alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way on the
inside, was roused into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and tired. TIDAL FORCES settled on the inside, was roused on
the far turn, dropped back under urging into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. MASEN (GB) showed early speed on the inside of a foe,
tugged eagerly at the bit while taken back off the pace, came out into the first turn, went around that bend in the three then four path, stalked the leader on
the outside, engaged that foe in the three path on the far turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened.
