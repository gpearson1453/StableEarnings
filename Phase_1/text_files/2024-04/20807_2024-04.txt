Footnotes
COURT TUDOR took a quick lead and rated the early pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail
on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold on. RUDD'S ROCKET raced in the five path the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the
rail on the far turn and dueled gamely for second. CHRISTOPHER'SHEART stalked three wide the first turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and
contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but relented in late stretch. CANDY OUTLINE stalked two deep the first
turn, chased leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. LITTLE RICHIE saved
early ground then picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. COLONIAL
ROAD raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. GOGO GADGET
rounded the first turn about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. YAREAKH was not a factor. LORD CLANCY saved early
ground then raced in the three path on the far turn.

Footnotes
GIRVINIZED took over soon after the start and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn,
drifted leaving the turn and continued to drift under left hand urging mid-stretch, but dug in determinedly to hold on. YOU CAN'T WIN settled in the three
path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the three path on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and was outfinished in the duel
through the stretch. SAYYESTOTHELADY veered out leaving the gate then stalked two deep, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, stayed in range
off the rail on the far turn, steadied when shut off mid-stretch but came back to finish evenly. BARBERS POINT hopped from the gate then saved early
ground, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. AIM'S JUBILEE saved ground
close to the early pace, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
BLAME CATALAYA settled off the rail the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. QUANTICO
CREEK rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn. The Stewards
reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Girvinized for interference mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Sayyestothelady, which resulted in the
disqualification of the former to third place.

Footnotes
DEFIANT GIANT stumbled outward and made contact with Char Bar's Legacy leaving the gate then saved ground, started his bid past the half mile pole,
raced at the rail into the far turn but was eased to the five path through the turn, dug in from the head of the lane, took over inside the sixteenth pole and
drew away later yards. RACING HOT LINE rated off the pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail into the far
turn, eased out entering the stretch and dug in to take second later yards. BRADLEY DO RIGHT stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole and raced in range of the lead in the three path on the far turn, but flattened in the duel through the stretch. TOWN HOT saved
ground well back, chased nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. SHOOT THE BREEZE rated a slim
lead inside, was met and dueled at even terms leaving the half mile pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. DANTE'S
INFERNO raced well back in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and could only improve his position. SEA OF
TRANQUILITY stalked off the rail then challenged into the backstretch and dueled at even terms from that point, contested two deep on the far turn, was
met mid-stretch and weakened. CASTLE OF CORK raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but flattened in the three
path on the far turn. BLAZE FOR DAZE showed little response after a half mile. CHAR BAR'S LEGACY was bumped leaving the gate, rounded the first turn

the seven sixteenths pole, was met at the rail leaving the quarter pole, gave up the nod entering the stretch and reluctantly ceded later yards. CAMELIA

third the final yards. FLITTER saved ground off the pace the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then
