LORD CAPTAIN disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while asked on the turn, responded well when put to the crop while off the
inside in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear near the sixteenth-pole and proved best under a strong
hand-ride to the finish. AZTEC was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while inside of a foe on the turn, was
asked inside the three-eighths pole, drifted out under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker then was switched to a right-handed crop, fought with
the winner until near the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while clear for the place. I AM THE LAW was coaxed along off the pace, moved closer with six
furlongs to run, drafted in the two path on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response while clear for third. BEACHWALKER was off a step slow, moved up under coaxing on the outside near the three-quarter pole, chased the pace
on the outside, went around the turn in the four path, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired.

path near the three-sixteenths, moved inside the drifting winner near the furlong marker, gained to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on well to

Footnotes
ARREBATO dueled early along the inside of GUN MAESTRO before easing off to tip out to the two path near the turn, advanced on the front once more
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and swinging three wide into upper stretch, took over command just inside the three-sixteenths, dug in under a
drive under threat to the outside and held gamely to prevail. ICE ROAD hustled from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the
final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the wire while clear of the rest for the place honors. GUN MAESTRO broke outwards brushing the off side stall
and then OPPORTUNITY SET, dueled three then two wide early on with ARREBATO to his inside, shook off that foe and tucked inside into the turn, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front just inside the three-sixteenths and
weakened in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. JUNGFRAU got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased two to
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, offered up a bid swinging six wide into upper stretch, weakened to the finish. DEPUTY CONNECT six
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six to seven wide into
upper stretch and passed tired foes. ATLANTA'S ACUNA broke in at the start bumping JUNGFRAU in tandem with SORPRESO, chased three wide until
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. SORPRESO broke out at the start
bumping JUNGFRAU in concert with ATLANTA'S ACUNA, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper
stretch and tired. OPPORTUNITY SET got brushed at the start by GUN MAESTRO, chased four then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. PAPI ON ICE chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn
and into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SHINFULL stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the three path under urging on the turn, took a short advantage into
upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. MAGGIE T showed early speed then set the pace, vied along
the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage while coming off the rail into upper stretch, drifted further out while dueling with
the winner outside the furlong marker, took a straighter course in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. SHOOPTHEREITIS made contact
with a foe at the start, bumped with rivals on both sides shortly thereafter then steadied, was urged along off the pace, dropped back three wide on the turn
and improved for the show. SIMPLE SUGAR broke a half-step slow, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four then five path on the turn, dropped
back late on that bend, spun six wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead until just before the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and
lacked the needed response. DEVILLY bumped with rivals on both sides just after the start then steadied, established a good position just off the pace, was
urged along late on the backstretch, chased two then three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ROJA
LIGERA bumped twice with an opponent at the start then was pulled off that foe, was shut-off outside the three-quarter pole then clipped heels, settled
towards the back, moved in around the nine-sixteenths, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. LUNA LOCA came out leaving
the gate then bumped with a foe shortly after the start, was well placed just off the early pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, shifted from the rail to
the three path near the five-sixteenths pole, came five wide into the stretch and faltered.

SAFFA'S DAY chased four then three wide advancing on the duel up front and coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over narrow command and
swung five wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive kept to task. MASROUR vied early on down the backstretch before emerging in tandem with
FACTUALLY CORRECT to duel three then two wide with that foe to his inside, got joined by the aforementioned foe midway on the turn and came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest. THRILL OF IT chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. EMERALD FOREST hustled from the
gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. FACTUALLY
CORRECT vied early on with a pair before emerging to duel with MASROUR to his outside while just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. LOOMS BOLDLY vied briefly just off the inside
before easing back at the nine-sixteenths, chased in the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WHENLOVETAKESOVER stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the advantage coming to the
quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. INDEPENDENT PAUL broke out and bumped with a foe then was taken up
with a tug of the left rein, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the
stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. NOTAH broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and
reloaded, moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths,
lost the lead approaching the quarter-pole and tired then was caught for the place but just held the show. BORLETTI (IRE) was bumped on both sides at the
start then checked while pinched back, spotted the front several lengths, settled near the rear, was urged two then three wide on the turn, moved closer
near the quarter-pole, swung six wide into the stretch and just missed the trifecta. RED D G P was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on
the turn and came up empty. MAGNIFICENT MILE broke in and bumped with a foe then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, brushed with a rival
shortly thereafter, moved out then advanced on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. SHOWDOWN
KING chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and weakened. AMERICAN GRANT brushed with an
opponent after the start then dropped back, climbed while moving out at the rear, went four then three wide on the turn and was no factor.
