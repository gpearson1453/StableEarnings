Footnotes
BENZODINI stalked the leaders from the two path in the early furlongs, then crept up to spar with RUSTY GADGET throughout the bend and into the early
stretch, then tipped away in the final yards to prove best in the end. COPPER STATE raced down the backstretch at the back while two wide, then
advanced on the turn while in a hard drive, came out three wide in the upper stretch, gained second position in the late stretch but could not catch the
cleared leader and was best for the place prize. RUSTY GADGET dueled with an inner rival down the early backstretch, took command briefly at the half,
then was confronted by BENZODINI on the outside to go head to head throughout the turn, then was out kicked in the early stretch and missed the place
prize in the end. LEXINGTON RIVER was fractious prior to loading, then raced at the back of the pack down the backstretch, bid while two wide on the turn,
and continued to race evenly throughout the stretch. BIG AND BOLD stalked the pace from the inside early, settled back in the late backstretch, then bid
eagerly on the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. BOBULINSKI dueled with an outer rival down the early backstretch was depleted heading in the turn
and tired in the lane.

ALGEBRA battled with inner foes and while five wide heading into the turn, then dug in gamely in the early stretch to inch away and lasted to the wire to
prevail. NORTHVALE ROAD conserved energy behind the battling quintet in the early furlongs, then fanned out six wide leaving the bend, found the best
stride in the late stretch and was gaining on the leader and just missed victory in the end. ALTO ROAD battled for the lead with outer rivals heading into the
turn, continued to menace gamely in the early stretch before giving way grudgingly in the end. SHADOW MATTER vied for the lead while four wide,
continued to rally gamely leaving the turn then gave way in the final yards. FLEET OF HOOF vied while two wide and while in a strong drive, could not retain
bid after the turn and flattened out in the lane. MARKS PROMISE vied while four wide and between rivals, was in a hard drive throughout, was used up after
the turn and tired in the stretch.

VIEWERS DISCRETION broke inward and bumped rival, remained nicely rated while tracking the pace from the inside throughout the first three quarters,
then shifted out to the three path leaving the far turn to vie between rivals, gained command at the top of the stretch then held on while drifting outward and
was victorious in the end. CONTOUR was in a steady hand ride while racing in the middle of the pack while two wide down the backstretch, came out five
wide leaving the bend to vie between rivals in the upper stretch, shifted inward avoiding the drifting leader and kept on close behind under a gamely rally just
missing victory in the end. OUR DAVINA was unhurried in the early furlongs, continued to save ground heading into the far turn, swung seven wide then bid
gamely down the lane to close well for the show prize. GASTOWN was bumped inwardly, raced in the middle of the pack from the inside, was in a moderate
pace throughout the far turn, met with traffic in the early stretch, steadied slightly then shifted outward and kept on willingly to the end. OPTIMISTIC
COWGIRL raced towards to back of the field while two wide in the early furlongs, then came out six wide leaving the far bend to rally mildly in the stretch
and needed more in the end. MISSION BELLE was forwardly placed while two wide into the first turn, then inched up to duel with an inner rival heading into
the far turn, was overpowered in the early stretch by outer foes and gave way in the end. BLOOD ORANGE was allowed to settle along the inside at the
back of the field and was no menace. DRENCHED showed the way into the first turn, then was confronted by an outer rival to duel in the late backstretch
and into the far turn while in a strong drive, was used up at the top of stretch and weakened in the end. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to
interference in the home stretch. After reviewing the replay, no change was made.

settle along the inside, then bid mildly on the far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. CRESSONS LIL CHARM broke outwardly, bumping foe and
causing a chain reaction, then was rank heading into the first turn, raced while three wide in the back flight of rivals, bid six wide leaving the far turn and

in the upper stretch but it was to no avail in the end. SOLECITA steadied off heels heading into the first turn, then settled along the inside at the back, bid
mildly leaving the far turn and came up empty. ON WING led the way into the first turn, then was challenged by an outer rival to duel down the backstretch

stretch while in gamely rally and was up in the final strides. STANS HOME RUN moved up four wide on the first turn to set the pace while two wide down
the backstretch, cleared the far turn, then continued to hold onto the lead while in gamely menace in the late stretch then was caught in the end. THUNDER
ROAD chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, fanned out six to seven wide to menace in the stretch and kept on for
the show position in the end. GET WITT GONE led the way into the first turn, then stalked the emerging leader from the inside down the backstretch, inched
up to press the pace on the far turn while two wide, lacked the winning bid and gave way in the late stretch. SERMONONTHEMOUNT chased the pace
while two wide down the backstretch, then settled back on the far turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. IMA BIG BOPPER was allowed to settle along the
inside in the early furlongs, then rallied on the far turn and did not fire in the stretch. TAM'S TIME was no factor.

Footnotes
LADY JAE was bumped at the start, then tracked the pace from the inside throughout the early stages, moved up to gain second position on the far turn,
then sparred with an inner rival before kicking clear in the late stretch while in a strong drive. MISSINGYOUCRAZY was away well to stalk the pace from the
inside in the first half, then moved up to take over the lead on the far turn, was confronted by outer rival at the top of the stretch to duel briefly before being
out kicked in the end. SAN MATEO KAT broke inwardly and bumped rival, then chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive throughout the far
turn before rallying in the early stretch and was best for the show position. RESOURCE raced from the inside mid pack at an even pace throughout the first
three quarters then rallied leaving the far turn and still came up evenly in the end. PLAYMATE was bumped at the start, then tucked in along the inside
down the backstretch, bid five wide leaving the far turn to rally too little too late in the home stretch. WILBURNSCLASSYLADY was brushed at the start,
then moved down the backstretch while three wide, bid from the five path on the far turn to menace in the stretch but it was not enough in the end.
TAHITIAN BREEZE was reluctant to load, then was unhurried early, rallied mildly from the five path leaving the far turn and came up empty in the stretch.
CAIRO MOON chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, remained in a steady hand ride on the far turn then bid mildly in the home stretch
and came up empty in the end. CAFEZINHO raced in the middle of the field while two wide at a moderate pace, then bid from the inside on the far turn and
came up flat in the stretch. OCCURRENCE was allowed to settle along the inside towards the back of the field, then came out five wide leaving the far bend
to rally in the stretch and was no threat. ROSES ARE GRAY was brushed at the start, then failed to menace. WATCH THIS MUNNY set the pace from the
inside heading into the first turn and down the early backstretch, then was overtaken for the lead heading into the second half, was in tight on the far turn
and checked up and had no final bid in the end.

LITHE SPIRIT dueled from the inside down the backstretch, was met with a third rival to to battle throughout the turn, then found more in the early stretch to
shake clear and held on well to the end. CLIMB TO GLORY prompted the pace while four wide, moved up eagerly to vie with inner rivals on the turn, took
command briefly at the quarter pole, then was out finished by a determined LITHE SPIRIT in the late stretch. CALLE REINA was unhurried early, then was
advancing on the turn while three wide, dug in in the early stretch, lacked the winning bid and was best for the show position. LADY ATHENA saved ground
in the early furlongs while racing at the back of the field, then rallied five to six wide leaving the turn and into the stretch but it was to no avail in the end.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA stalked the pace from the two path early, then settled back on the turn, bid mildly in the early stretch and came up flat in the end.
CIRCA STAR was allowed to settle while three wide, then bid on the turn while passing retreating rivals and was no threat in the end. CLAY'S RUBY LOVE
dueled with an inner rival down the backstretch, then vied between rivals on the turn while in a mild drive then gave way in the lane. DIAMOND GAL chased
the pace from the inside between the two packs of rivals, then faded on the turn and lacked bidding in the stretch. EXCLUSIVE ACCESS was allowed to
settle while two wide and was no threat.

Footnotes
CATHOLIC GUILT showed the way while two wide into the first, maintained the lead throughout the backstretch and into the far turn while in a steady drive,
then drew off in the stretch to prove best in the end. YAK chased the pace from the two path into the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn to rally
in the stretch. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) saved ground throughout the first three quarters, then was improving position while three wide heading into the far
turn, gained second position at the quarter pole but could not catch the leader in the stretch and missed the place prize in the end. BIG BROTHER raced at
the tail of the field in the early furlongs, then came out four wide leaving the far turn to rally mildly in the stretch and just missed the show prize in the end.
BIG ROJO stalked the pace setter from the inside throughout the first half, was in a long drive heading into the far bend, could not retain bid and gave way
in the stretch. TOTAL SURPRISE chased the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, then settled back on the far turn before bidding mildly from the three
path in the early stretch and came up empty in the end. SILENT POWER raced in the middle pack from the inside down the backstretch, began to bid
eagerly heading into the far turn then stopped in the late stretch. EXETER raced in the middle duo while two wide down the backstretch, then faded on the
far turn and had no final bid in the end.
