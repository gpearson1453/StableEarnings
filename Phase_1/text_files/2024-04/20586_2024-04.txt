U CAN DO U , away alertly, disputed the pace four wide under rating and to the inside of a rival, held a slim lead past the three eighths, responded when
asked nearing the lane and repelled an inside threat, spurted clear then held firm while ridden out. DON JUAN BUBBA broke outward and bumped with
MARVELOUS MARK, corrected and edged up between foes, moved through towards the rail and challenged approaching the stretch, drifted a bit when not
quite quickening with the winner, corrected and stayed on well to be second best. BIYOMBO vied five wide outside the winner, failed to go on with the
leading past nearing mid stretch and faded. MARVELOUS MARK , bumped at the break, raced well wide and faded. HATAGASAL broke awkwardly,
faltered early then was taken wide and was eased through the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
WHISKEY VISION , taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, moved up in hand into the far turn then tracked the dueling leaders, angled out four wide
into the lane, closed in under pressure and engaged EMPEROROFTHENORTH near mid stretch, dueled on a slim lead through the final seventy yards and
dug in to prevail. EMPEROROFTHENORTH rated four wide early, edged up and bid three wide outside the leader near the half, dueled around the final
turn, spurted clear in upper stretch, dug in when confronted, battled gamely inside the winner and just missed. BLUES RAPPER checked sharply when in
tight at the break, regrouped and lagged back off the rail, had the rider lose the whip past the three eighths, advanced inside a rival nearing the stretch and
churned on. RUSTY B CAUSE rushed up outside HEARTBREAK KID into the first turn then cleared off, set the pace off the inside, was joined approaching
the far turn, dueled inside EMPEROROFTHENORTH around the final turn then weakened in the drive. HEARTBREAK KID was sent hard from the gate and
led briefly, angled out to pursue through the backstretch, failed to go on nearing the five sixteenths and weakened. PAINTED SMOKE , four wide early,
dropped back.

Footnotes
MEANT FOR ME sped clear early, set the pace well off the inside while coaxed along, moved away under a stout drive past mid stretch, drifted out a bit late
and was kept to task. MR. CLUTCH , inside rivals pursuing the pace, was guided three to four wide in upper stretch and kept on well while second best.
SHIP IT RED , three wide between runners leaving the far turn, shifted out wider for the drive and kept on with effort. CURLY ESA broke a step slow, edged
up behind foes and rated about three wide, swung six to seven wide for the drive and had belated action. ALL THE KING'S MEN , four deep nearing the half
mile marker, faded. FAR BEYOND settled off the pace, was hung out five wide outside rivals mid turn then gave way through the drive. ECONOMICAL gave
early chase between runners and tired.

Footnotes
RIVERSIDE , seven wide outside foes nearing the half, advanced five wide past the sixteenths and took aim on the leader, shifted in as the leader
wandered outward leaving mid stretch, forged to command under right handed asks and was edging away at the wire. GODSEND sped up to the inside of
foes to take the early pace, handled outside pressure while in the three to four path, moved away under coaxing mid turn, wandered well out in the track
past mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. RENEW dropped off the early pace, angled six wide nearing the quarter pole and kept on willingly to gain the
show. CREATIVE BID , four wide inside foes nearing the half, chased off the rail into the lane and came up empty. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL , six wide
near the half, failed to respond. SUDDENLY FAMOUS flashed speed between foes, was rated back past the five eighths, dropped inside but lacked a bid.
THE RONALD , off slowly, lagged off the pace, saved ground nearing the lane and failed to menace. RESPECT THE UNION , five wide between rivals
early, chased then dropped back mid turn.

Footnotes
HOUSE OF LORDS , patiently handled in the clear stalking the pace, edged up into the far turn, slipped through along the rail to take command into the
lane, spurted away under a drive, wandered outward and was taken in hand the final yards. CASHANOVA settled off the pace and inside a pair of runners,
gathered momentum past the five sixteenths, got through inside rivals when advancing past the three sixteenths and kept on willingly to be second best.
PRIMO TOUCH pulled his way clear early, set a rated pace two wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths, failed to contain the winner's inside bid
soon into the lane and faded. FALSELY ACCUSED , three to four wide stalking outside the leader, failed to kick on under pressure in mid stretch and faded.
FLY NIGHTLY , in a bit tight soon after the break, regrouped to race three deep through the backstretch, lacked a punch nearing the quarter pole and gave
way. KYSTONE , between foes, gave hard chase leaving the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LUCKY VEGAS prompted the early pace to the inside of CHRISTINA'S CANDY, eased back off that one and angled out leaving the far turn, circled five to
six wide advancing into the lane, closed in under right handed asks and bid past mid stretch, dueled outside and forged ahead in the final yards.
CHRISTINA'S CANDY sped to the early lead three wide, moved clear heading to turn, came four wide into the lane, dug in when collared past the furlong
grounds, battled gamely inside the winner, switched over to her left lead a sixteenth out and just missed in a sharp try. DORITA'S HAPPY broke a bit slow,
angled out into the turn, circled six wide into the stretch and finished with interest. RAINBOW STEW chased outside foes early on, came three wide into the
stretch and faded. KAMIKAZE BLUE , hard urged off the rail mid turn, lacked a rally. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY lagged back, saved ground nearing the stretch
and failed to menace. LADY OF THE RIVER , towards the inside, weakened. FLYING LADY , very wide nearing the lane, was not a factor.

Footnotes
BETSY IS THE CODE had speed between foes then raced as the closest pursuer mid turn, came three wide into the lane, closed determinedly under
pressure, reeled in the leader inside the sixteenth pole then forged ahead to prove best in the final yards. DIVINE GIFT , bumped at the break, vied outside
foes then cleared nearing the three eighths, set the pace two wide into the lane, kept on under a drive past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. O
SHUGAH MINT , brushed at the break, flashed speed between foes, chased four wide into the lane and closed steadily. LA DELHOMME'S SHOW had
speed inside foes, eased back into the turn, came back towards the inside in mid stretch, eased out then flattened out late. CALIFORNIA DIVA , five wide
mid turn, churned on. CANDIED JOULE , three wide mid turn, angled six wide and offered a mild kick. SNOOZY SUZY , taken to rate, saved ground into the
stretch but failed to generate a solid run. CHIRISCA , fractious in the gate, drafted back early on, raced very wide in upper stretch and failed to menace.
STORM CENT bobbled inward at the break and brushed with a rival, corrected, raced four wide mid turn and lacked a bid. MEMORIES IN GOLD , bumped
with the winner at the break, was shuffled back soon after, raced four wide in upper stretch and failed to menace.
