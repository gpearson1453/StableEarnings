Footnotes
ENTRUST , four wide to contention, edged up three deep nearing the five eighths pole and prompted the pace, was put to a strong ride as the leader kicked
back leaving the far turn, re engaged four wide outside foes into the lane, dueled under left handed asks, edged clear a sixteenth out then held firm.
WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD settled off the early pace, responded when put to pressure and commenced an inside run leaving the three eighths, slipped
through along the rail to challenge in upper stretch, battled inside rivals in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. LAST SECOND LOUIE sped clear early
and set the pace about two wide, was joined from his outside near the five eighths, spurted back clear around the far turn, dug in when collared into the
stretch, dueled between horses past the three sixteenths, shifted out after the top pair went on then found some more late. TUBTIMSIAM chased while
saving ground and came up empty. SUCCEED , three wide to contention, moved up and bid between rivals near the five furlong pole, failed to keep pace
with the leaders leaving the three eighths, angled out pursuing, drifted and gave way. GREAT CALL , forwardly placed into the backstretch, eased back a bit
and tracked the leading trio past the five eighths, was under pressure chasing around the final turn, lacked a kick in upper stretch and tired. HOMECOMING
KING stumbled badly at the break and was outrun.

Footnotes
CATAHOULA MOON broke a touch slow then quickly recovered and accelerated to the lead, set the pace towards the inside while handling some outside
pressure, edged clear past the five sixteenths, was guided two wide and put to asking in upper stretch, repelled and outside challenge from PETINGAS
TWIN leaving the three sixteenths, went back clear a sixteenth under strong handling then dug in determinedly to prove best. PETINGAS TWIN broke
outward and brushed with a rival, corrected and edged up four then three wide to reach a stalking spot, ranged up under a drive to threaten nearing mid
stretch, was turned away by the winner but kept on with good energy to earn the place. PLAY HARDER , fractious in the gate, broke forwardly despite a bit
of a hop, was coaxed along stalking towards the rail, got through and moved up past mid stretch, loomed, continued gamely but was edged for second.
MEDAGOOCH , off the pace while saving ground, was pushed along past the three eighths, eased out some in the drive but lacked a solid finish. HAD TO
HAVE HIM , between runners early, angled four wide for the drive but lacked a rally. NANCY MADE MY DAY , off slow and was brushed, raced off the pace
and off the inside, circled five wide into the lane but failed to make an impact. ANNA'S GOT STYLE , away alertly, forced the pace outside the winner, failed
to go on under a ride into the stretch and tired.

STRUGAR , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, secured command in upper stretch then edged away under encouragement. NOTTOWAY , four
deep around the turn, took aim on the lead in upper stretch then flattened out. PIT STOP MAN , along the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung to the five
path in upper stretch and rallied outside. BY ITS ABSENCE , between horses early, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the drive. HEMP broke
sluggishly, raced four wide on the turn and was no factor. GAGETOWN , pinched back at the break, was outrun. TOP BOSS showed speed along the inner
rail for three furlongs, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
SHADY MUNNI , a forward factor in the two path between horses on the turn, was taken to the four path turning for home, took command in mid stretch and
drew out under steady handling. CROSSLAND stalked the pace, saved ground around the turn, advanced along the rail to bid for the lead in mid stretch and
was second best. JARDANI lacked speed, worked between horses the final half mile and passed tired ones. WE DONT NEED ROADS bore out leaving the
starting gate, circled foes around the turn, was fanned five wide turning for home and failed to rally. TEMPESTIVO , outrun, swung to the six path in upper
stretch. CARVELLIAN QUEST prompted the pace outside BLAME THE TUX, gained a short, three wide lead in upper stretch nd gave way in the drive.
PORCH SWING , along the inner rail most of the race, was no factor. BLAME THE TUX bobbled slightly at the break, set a pressured pace near the inner
rail, drifted to the two path turning for home and faltered.

Footnotes
MY FLICKER drafted back early, angled out and moved up four wide outside rivals leaving the far turn, forged to command leaving the three sixteenths,
dueled outside foes under left handed asking while on her left lead, switched over to her correct lead in deep stretch and dug in to prevail.
EVERYONELOVESLINDA took over from between runners early then edged clear into the turn, set a rated pace two wide, was guided three wide when
engaged by the winner into the lane, fought on gamely inside that one past the furlong grounds, stayed on while between runners past the sixteenth marker
and grimly saved the place. ANONYMOUSLY moved up inside rivals heading to the turn, tracked in hand mid turn, got through along the rail to take closer
order past the three sixteenths, moved through to the inside of the top pair past the sixteenth marker, battled valiantly but wasn't quite good enough. I'M
GITTIN THERE had her rider lose his left iron after leaning in and hitting the gate, recovered after about a sixteenth of a mile, rated between foes then
steadied into the turn, dropped back to last around the turn, came back out some in the drive but lacked a solid finish. SWEET GRACIE bobbled at the
break, recovered and rated in range, checked entering the turn, angled out, circled five wide but failed to generate a serious run. FUNNY HOW broke a bit
slow, moved up and prompted the pace three wide outside EVERYONELOVESLINDA, failed to go on under pressure nearing the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
I HAD ENOUGH chased the pace in the two path around the turn, gradually advanced in the stretch and led late. SIMON'S CHOICE lacked speed, raced in
the two path on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. UNCLE CHINITO accelerated to the lead, set the pace along the inner rail and
weakened late. ROCKY'S ADVENTURE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, was three deep leaving the turn and failed to be a factor. TIK TOK DADDY
hugged the inner rail on the turn while outrun. MIKE THE BOMB , a forward factor long the inner rail around the turn, gave way.
