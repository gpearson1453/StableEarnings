Footnotes
HE'S INIT TO WINIT prominent leaving the start, engaged with DRUMADOON in the early going and contested moderate fractions heading to the half-mile
marker, pressed the pace two to three wide into the turn and took a narrow advantage at the quarter pole, set down into upper stretch, held a slim lead at
the furlong marker and battled inside a pair of rivals into the final sixteenth, dug in into deep stretch and determinedly held for the win at the wire. RUNNING
ON FIRE bobbled a bit at the start but was away in good order, was prominent in the early going and stalked the pace three wide approaching the half-mile
pole, was well positioned into the turn and chased three to four wide to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch, vied for the lead inside of the
sixteenth-marker, gamely battled into deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding for second at the finish. GOLF DRAMA forwardly placed in the
early running, took back and tracked the moderate pace from the outside, shifted in entering the turn and chased two wide nearing the quarter pole, raced
behind rivals and was blocked into upper stretch, found room past the furlong marker and closed into the final sixteenth, could not catch the leading pair in
deep stretch and got up in the final strides to secure third. MY BUCKET LIST a bit slow away from the start, was allowed to settle in the early running, taken
to the outside along the turn and chased five wide to the quarter marker, rallied while widest into the stretch and loomed at the furlong pole, ran on the left
lead and vied into the final sixteenth, hung in deep stretch, was outfinished and just missed for third. CARDINAL TRICK rated off of the moderate early
pace, saved ground into the turn, trailed to the quarter pole and did not offer a rally in the stretch. DRUMADOON showed speed leaving the start, engaged
with HE'S INIT TO WINIT in the early going and contested moderate fractions with that runner heading to the half-mile marker, disputed the pace two wide
into the turn and battled to the quarter pole, was outrun into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
TAMARA MINE showed good speed away from the start and assumed a narrow early lead, set pressured fractions to the half-mile marker then shook free
into the turn, carved out a decent pace while well handled nearing the quarter pole, was set down into the stretch and kept foes at bay heading to the furlong
marker, met the bid of FIVE O COCKTAIL into the final sixteenth and dueled into deep stretch, determinedly dug in in the final strides and dead-heated for
the win at the finish. FIVE O COCKTAIL broke alertly, took back off of the decent early pace and tracked from the outside heading to the half-mile marker,
saved ground into the turn and was well placed nearing the quarter pole, angled three to four wide into the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker,
rallied into the final sixteenth and drew to even terms with TAMARA MINE, dueled to the finish and dead-heated for the win at the wire. READY TO GIG
sent leaving the start, engaged with TAMARA MINE in the early stages and prompted the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, attended to the pace
into the turn and chased two wide nearing the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch and was kept at bay approaching the furlong pole, was outfinished
into the final sixteenth and was well clear in the end for third. STRANGE ADDICTION allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn and
trailed to the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and did not offer a late response. TESSA (GB)
hustled to be forwardly placed leaving the start, raced close up to the decent early pace and stalked three to four wide into the turn, gained a bit of ground
while outside of the leading pair approaching the quarter pole, was outrun into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RAMATHORN broke sharply and sped off to a clear lead, held sway through the turn always traveling well, extended the lead through the turn still in hand
responded to steady a hand ride and easily held clear to the wire. SUNRISE MISCHIEF raced inside of a trio chasing the runaway leader, separated from
those rivals from the five-sixteenths pole, finished well under strong handling and intermittent urging despite racing on the left lead but could not reel in the
winner. SUPERNAL was forced out at the start then overcorrected and cut in front of BOOK EM TAMO a few strides later, forcing that one to steady, then
raced outside of the trio chasing RAMATHORN through the early stages, bid three wide from the five-sixteenths and finished well despite having trouble
changing leads through the stretch. DRIVE BY raced between three horses chasing the early leader, was the first to back out at the five-sixteenths pole, and
was no factor from that point. BOOK EM TAMO broke outward at the start and bothered TIGER QUEEN then steadied when that same foe took the path a
few strides later, trailed the field early while staying out in the four path down the backstretch and through the turn, made a mild rally from the three furlong
marker but was unable to improve and continued to chase still wide down the stretch.

Footnotes
TIGER QUEEN broke sharply, vied for the early lead then prompted the solid pace heading to the half-mile pole, pressed MORNING ADDICTION into the
turn and went two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into the stretch and took command at the furlong pole, was kept to task while
leading into the final sixteenth, dug in while all out in deep stretch and just held for the win at the finish. LADY GREGORY rated off of the solid early pace
while never far back, improved position into the turn and stalked the pace three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide for the stretch drive
and chased while within aim approaching the furlong pole, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and just missed
for the win, while besting the rest. MORNING ADDICTION off a half-step slowly, showed good speed and assumed a narrow early advantage, set a solid
pace while prompted into the turn, set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, drifted out a bit into upper stretch and was confronted by TIGER QUEEN
approaching the furlong marker, lost the lead at mid-stretch and chased into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and just held for third at the finish.
TURA LURA vied for the early lead between runners, rated off of the solid early pace and stalked the leading pair heading to the half-mile pole, saved
ground into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, saved ground into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster the
needed late response and just missed for third at the finish. MO TOWN GAL hit the gate at the start, was bumped by an inner rival and was off awkwardly to
begin, was allowed to settle in the early running, improved position into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter pole, got caught four to five wide
nearing the top of the stretch and was outrun to the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. HEART ON THE RUN
forwardly placed leaving the start, took back and tracked the solid early pace from the inside approaching the half-mile pole, shifted to the two path midway
through the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, raced a bit in tight into upper stretch and was outkicked nearing the furlong marker, could not muster a
response into the final sixteenth and weakened.

Footnotes
TRIBAL NATION broke alertly and assumed early command, controlled the pace into the first turn, dictated terms through the backstretch run and set
decent fractions nearing the half-mile marker, was well handled into the second turn and drew to a clear lead into the stretch, was kept to task while clear
inside of the furlong marker, felt pressure from the oncoming runner-up in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish. EL JOY allowed to settle away
from the start, saved ground along the first turn and was unhurried into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and improved position at
the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, responded to firm urging and rallied into the final sixteenth,
surged in the final strides and missed for the win, while besting the rest. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the early pace
three wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased three wide into
the far turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, maintained a three wide path into the lane and ran evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked into the final
sixteenth and was clear of the rest for third at the finish. ARTEMUS GORDON prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace two wide into the first
turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, chased two wide into the second turn, was outkicked into the stretch, could not keep pace
into the final sixteenth and weakened. ATTENZIONE unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and was content to trail into the
backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and trailed to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the stretch drive and did not factor.
CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY never far back in the early going, rated off of the pace into the first turn and saved ground into the backstretch run, tracked the
decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, was guided two to three wide into the second turn and lost position at the quarter pole, could not find a
response in the stretch drive and gave way.

Footnotes
TAMARANDO STAR stumbled and came out of the gate awkwardly into the path of GROGU, recovered nicely to be near the front going into the turn but
opted to not get involved in the grueling early pace, tracked from the three path then angled to the inside going into the far turn, set off for the lead with
about three furlongs to run, slipped inside on the rail, took over the lead before the quarter pole and finished well under strong handling to prevail despite
drifting inward in the late stages. GROGU was squeezed at the start and slow into stride, settled near the rear of the field through the early stages while
saving ground, launched a bid from the three furlong pole then tipped out three wide to get around the weakening COME OUT FIGHTING, responded to
strong handling while chasing the eventual winner down the stretch, was not able to reel that one in while finishing clear of the third horse. CLASSY CITY
settled with the tracking group well behind the pace, raced to the outside of GROGU near the rear through the first half mile, then responded when set down
with three furlongs to run, was unable to keep up with the top pair but sustained the rally to grab the third spot in the final furlong. J. B. BOOKS allowed to
settle from the break then raced last of the strung out field for the first half-mile, made a strong move on the rail to get into contention then flattened out in
the stretch. COME OUT FIGHTING broke outward at the start then was hustled to the front but ceded the early lead to stablemate MEEKING, tracked well
behind the runaway leader but also clear of the rest of the field to the far turn, took over the lead at the five-sixteenths pole but was immediately inhaled by
the rest of the field at the quarter pole, was kept to task but outfinished down the stretch. MEEKING was hustled from the gate, easily won the race to the
turn then was allowed to open up a huge lead under little restraint, started to shorten strides on the far turn angled to the outside, stopped in upper stretch,
was eased through the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

ground along the bend and chased the pace two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, raced a bit in tight into upper stretch and ran in pursuit of SING A
HAPPY SONG heading to the furlong marker, responded to firm urging and vied between runners into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch
and just lasted at the finish for a determined win. GIANT KID tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, was guided three to four wide into the
turn and advanced at the quarter pole, loomed into upper stretch and came within range at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, vied
for the lead outside of a pair of rivals in deep stretch, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure place honors.
SING A HAPPY SONG broke alertly and sped to the early lead, cleared the field while a bit headstrong and set decent fractions nearing the half-mile
marker, dictated terms into the turn and showed the way to the quarter pole, drifted out a path into upper stretch and kept foes at bay heading to the furlong
marker, was kept to firm urging past mid-stretch and was all out into the final sixteenth, battled stubbornly into deep stretch, was caught in the final strides
and just missed for the win and place, while just holding for show honors. ADAPTED MEMORY rated off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the
turn, tipped two wide into upper stretch and was asked for run nearing the furlong marker, gained ground at mid-stretch, finished well into the final sixteenth
and missed for third at the wire. SELSAE settled off of the decent early pace, improved position along the turn and went two to three wide nearing the
quarter pole, chased into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker and found her best stride late. SUNGLASSES (GB) forwardly placed leaving the
start, tracked the decent early pace approaching the half-mile marker, advanced into the turn and saved ground along the bend, waited for racing room and
was boxed in at the quarter marker, found room into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, chased into the final sixteenth and was outkicked
in deep stretch. MS FLASHY HARBOR settled off of the decent early pace, maintained a two wide path into the turn and chased between runners
approaching the quarter pole, shifted three wide into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, showed good late interest but could not
threaten the leaders at the finish. GUIDE MY STEPS hopped at the start then was crowded by a neighboring rival and was away slowly, was unhurried in
the early going, went three wide along the turn, swung five wide for the stretch drive, rallied while widest into the final sixteenth but needed more in deep
stretch. CANDY ON TOP crowded a neighboring rival a bit leaving the start, was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn and trailed
to the quarter marker, made a mild rally in the stretch drive but was not a factor.

Footnotes
RIVER OF AMBITION was off a step slow but got a good tracking trip behind the speed duel, was traveling well into the turn but had to wait for room from
the three eighths pole, deftly split horses just before the furlong pole, pulled away from the rest and battled with SHADOWED THOUGHTS through the final
yards, gained a narrow advantage inside the sixteenth under steady handling and held off that game rival to the wire. SHADOWED THOUGHTS came away
well and tracked just behind the dueling leaders, advanced through the turn then bid three wide with the dueling leaders, took a short lead into the stretch
then was taken on by RIVER OF AMBITION, battled gamely but was outfinished while clear of the next horse. HAPPY CHAPPY broke well and was up with
the leaders early, backed off the developing speed duel, then tracked close into the turn, went six wide into the stretch and finished well but was no match
for the top pair. SWIFT NATALIE veered out after the break and slammed into KISSES WITH ROSES, was outrun in the early stages, went three to four
wide through the turn, was still last as the field turned for home but kept on well and was able to improve position in the final yards. KISSES WITH ROSES
was bumped hard by SWIFT NATALIE at the break, then steadied again a few strides out, lost ground, chased five to six wide down the backstretch, then
was able to get over to the three path for the run through the turn, came into the stretch behind a wall of horses, angled out into the clear and finished
willingly. PEGGY THE COLONEL tracked mid-pack while five wide down the backstretch, launched a rally from the three furlong pole, loomed six wide
turning for home, finished evenly in a drive without threatening. LEEDSTHESKY stumbled a couple of strides out of the gate with the rider losing the left
iron, was able to recover the iron before the five furlong pole, saved ground and advanced steadily through the turn, loomed a threat to mid-stretch then
flattened out and was outkicked in the last sixteenth. DIPLOMATIC was hustled from the break and made the lead with pressure to the inside from LADY
PROUD, dueled that one into the turn, continued to battle on when beset by challenges on both sides, hung in to the furlong marker then gave way readily.
LADY PROUD broke a step slow but was able to contest the early pace to the inside of DIPLOMATIC, took a slight lead past the half-mile pole, started to
backpedal at the top of the stretch and had nothing to offer in the late stages.
