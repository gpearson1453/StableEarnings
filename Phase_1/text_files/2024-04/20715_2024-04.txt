Footnotes
OUT WORK'M stalked the pace in the four path, rallied between foes at the eighth pole and drew off under mild urging. HADLEY'S MAX was brushed at the
start, rallied strongly in early stretch and was up for the place. NEUTRON vied in the four path but couldn't hold off the closers. INDIAN CREED vied
between foes, bid at the eighth pole and then yielded. HEZA RIG vied in the two path, took the lead in the stretch but couldn't last. MIDNITESTATEOFMIND
bid inside at the eighth pole but couldn't close. BOZAANO and DREAMING BRO raced evenly outside. THISCATSABULLET passed tired foes in the two
path. IT'S LAST CALL was not a factor. S J MATER was fractious in the gate, set the pace inside before giving way badly and being eased. FLURRIES was
squeezed back at the start, six back of the field and was eased.

MYGALJUSTICE raced five wide and rallied late for the show spot. SHIELDMEWITHPRAYER pressed the pace in the two path and yielded late. BELLA
FRANCESCA was well back early and rallied strongly through the stretch in the three path. MARTZ ROSEY raced inside, bid in the two path at the eighth
pole but couldn't close. HARD TRUTH WINS pressed the pace in the four path before fading in the stretch. RAFAELLA raced inside and then showed best
stride late in the four path. TIZ BAYOU raced in the four path with no late bid. LILMISS SASSYPANTS saved ground. POISED was squeezed back at the
start. THIZZLE pressed the pace in the five path before checking at the three-eighths pole. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE START, THE STEWARDS TOOK
NO ACTION. THEY THEN DISMISSED AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF THIZZLE AGAINST HARD TRUTH WINS ALLEGING
