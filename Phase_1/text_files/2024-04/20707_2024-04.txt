Footnotes
HIGH PRESS moved forward inside but off the rail to take the lead after about the opening quarter, set the pace moving clear entering the turn, drifted out
further leaving that bend, held under steady handling. SURPRISE FASHION shifted in, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner inside foes turning into
upper stretch, gained mildly but steadily on the winner and was clearly second best. MONGOLIAN MOON lacked early speed and switched out well off the
inside, continued to bring up the rear on the turn, came out a bit further for the drive, kicked on well late to get up for show at the wire. TRIBAL IMPACT
chased from outside, was encouraged along three furlongs out, floated seven wide into upper stretch, kept on evenly and lost show late. TEE CLASS settled
at the rear, saved ground on the turn, gained mildly between runners late. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL shifted in leaving the backstretch, chased the eventual
winner from inside just off the fence, asked to keep pace about the five-sixteenths but failed to rally. EMPEROR'S CHOICE had the early lead then chased
the eventual winner into the turn, lacked the needed late kick. WEAR THE CROWN chased from inside mid-pack, came out near the quarter pole, failed to
rally.

Footnotes
BEYOND AWESOME set the pace facing moderate outside pressure, met the challenge of the runner-up coming to the quarter pole, drifted out eight wide
leaving the turn, drifted out a bit further in mid-stretch, held that rival under steady urging. OUTSIDE THE LAW pursued the leading pair from outside,
advanced on the turn making a mild bid past the five-sixteenths, was carried nine wide by the drifting leader leaving the turn, kept on gamely in the stretch
but was second best. UNRIVALED QUEEN was ridden along at the back, swung ten wide turning for home, improved position. BANGIE GO chased from
outside a rival, angled five to six wide in the stretch and failed to menace. LOTSA LACE chased from inside and was not a threat. BOLD INTENTION
pressed the eventual winner from outside four to five wide into the turn, came up empty. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF OUTSIDE
THE LAW AGAINST BEYOND AWESOME ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
EL JOY tracked from inside on then just off the rail, sought room between foes in upper stretch but was briefly blocked, got through with clear sailing past
mid-stretch and got the nod. IRISH HEATWAVE stalked from outside the eventual winner mid-pack about three wide, moved out a bit turning into upper
stretch, bid about a sixteenth from home, just missed. BODEMONSTER settled at the rear shifting in to save ground, bided time till the three-sixteenths,
angled six wide in upper stretch, closed well but too late. LETTHERAINSETTLEIT ceded the lead on the first turn and switched outside the new leader to
stalk, edged nearer to press two to three wide heading into the far turn, bid at the five-sixteenths, had a narrow lead till mid-stretch and lacked the needed
late kick. ARIZONA JEREMY moved forward outside intent on the lead early on the first turn, edged clear and shifted in to dictate terms up the backstretch,
came up empty. DE LA LUNA stalked racing mostly three to four wide, failed to rally.

KATAR quickly went to the lead, set the pace from well off the inside, allowed a rival to come up inside near the quarter pole, was shaken up at the
three-sixteenths and back in command, drew off under vigorous hand urging. RES IPSA LOQUITUR shifted in early on the turn in pursuit of the eventual
winner, made a mild bid inside that one at the quarter pole, was no match. RENEW switched out, was encouraged along racing outside a foe early on the
turn, fanned eight wide for the drive, failed to menace. ARIZONA ANDREW was up close in pursuit of the eventual winner from outside, failed to rally.
SMOOTH PAPA shifted in, saved ground to no avail. WE MISS GENO appeared washy heading to the gate, chased just briefly then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
MR. CAPTAIN JACK shifted in and advanced inside foes to the lead past the three-eighths, continued to maintain a narrow advantage into upper stretch
while coming out a bit, was all out and just lasted. HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE settled off the leader stalking four to five wide into and on the turn, moved out
eight wide in upper stretch, finished strongly to rally between runners, was gaining and just missed. WHEREVER YOU ARE tracked from near inside,
moved out on the turn then again in upper stretch, surged late but missed. MY CAIRO KID set the early tempo kept well off the inside, kept on well late but
was simply outfinished. KNOCKOUT GUY was outrun and never near enough to threaten. ARIZONA MADE chased from outside five to six wide on the turn
floating eight deep turning for home before shifting in a bit, faded. ATTA BOY LLOYD veered in to the gap at the start and lost the rider, was quickly caught
and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CONRADO pressed from inside while strongly urged from the start and in the early going, drifted out to the three path leaving the turn brushing a rival
lightly, kept on strongly with a narrow lead and just prevailed. BIG JACK was close in the very early stages but allowed to settle dropping back off the
leaders, saved some ground near but off the rail on the turn, came out five wide turning for home, rallied strongly between runners, missed. BEAU
MISCHIEF settled off the leaders stalking outside racing five to seven wide on the turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch, was gaining late. BRAYBRAY
set the pace while kept wide early, moved in four deep entering the turn, drifted out six wide turning for home, was outfinished. UNCLE LEON stalked then
moved at the five-sixteenths to press the issue in striking distance, went about six to seven wide throughout, kept on late but needed more. NOTACRY
contested the pace from between runners, was brushed lightly leaving the turn, kept on late but was outfinished. YOU ENJOY MYSELF broke a bit
awkwardly and was lacking early speed racing outside, was not a threat. SOUTH COAST ROUTE settled at the back, was never a threat.

Footnotes
KYNLIE'S EMPIRE moved clear early, set the pace from off the rail, held well. JAMIES INHERITANCE settled off the pace racing inside, saved ground
before tipping out in upper stretch, was second best. DIRT FLIRT settled outside off the pace, advanced outside on the second turn while coming out from
four to seven wide, kept on late but needed more. FREE AND HUMBLE stalked from outside a foe, ran on. LOANA tracked inside mid-division, moved out
four wide past the quarter pole, ran on. TIZ A MACHO GIRL stalked the eventual winner from outside, came out further at the top of the stretch and
weakened thereafter. LOVE TANK raced off the inside mostly two to three wide and was not a threat.

Footnotes
WELTON had the early lead but was soon outsprinted, vied outside a runner, drifted six wide leaving the turn and drew clear, held well under steady
handling. WESTPORT CAPTAIN tracked the leading pair from inside, moved out four wide passing the five-sixteenths, was within striking distance while
being floated seven wide turning for home, was no match for the winner while clearly second best. FLEET OF FLAGS settled off the pace, went four to five
wide on the turn, kept on and was best of the rest. IT'S TURBO bumped a rival then in turn was bumped by that one after the start, settled off the leaders,
was mostly three to four wide, needed more. PRECEDENT settled outside racing mostly five to six deep early, floated eight wide turning for home, was not
a threat. BRANDYN exchanged bumps early, raced off the pace and two to four wide, was never a threat. O'BANION (IRE) saved some ground chasing
near but off the rail, faded late. CLEAR THE COAST moved forward inside to soon take the lead, forced the pace, drifted three deep leaving the turn, came
up empty.
