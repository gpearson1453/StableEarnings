Footnotes
ONACOUNTA rated between rivals, picked up her pace on the bend, rallied four wide, lugged in with a sixteenth to got up in time. SUNDAY SPEIGHT was
quickly clear of the others, all out in the lane, drifted out as she began to wear down in the waning yards but held on. BLUE EVEN SCORE chased from
inside and found best stride too late in the stretch. WILDWOOD ENOUGH chased from outside on the backstretch, angled in some on the bend, came into
the stretch three wide and had no rally. DRAGONFLY KISSES showed little. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION, THE BEATEN LENGTHS FOR
THE FINISH WERE ESTIMATED BY THE AXCIS INFORMATION NETWORK CHARTCALLER.

Footnotes
GLITTER BOMB showed the way in hand from inside, floated out entering the stretch, responded to urging and drew off ridden out the last eighth. RAIN
ATTACK raced closest to GLITTER BOMB from just outside from the outside, was no match for that one the final furlong but was unchallenged for the
place. GOT NO MORE TEARS a step slow at the break, chased from inside, angled outside RAIN ATTACK upper stretch, could not close the gap on the
top pair but was clearly best of the others. KONA KONNECT just off the inside taking the turn, had no late bid. DERBY DAY GOLD trailed saving ground,
swung to the outside for the drive but had little to offer. JANIE LEE saved ground taking the bend and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
BOISE stalked BOURTON DELIGHT from outside, went for the lead leaving the second bend, battled through the lane and gradually edged ahead the final
eighth. BOURBON DELIGHT bumped at the break, soon had the lead, showed the way just off the rail, was challenged leaving the second turn, fought
gamely in the stretch, did not have enough left but proved easily second best. COPPER CROSSING chased running widest, moved clear for third after a
half mile, came widest into the lane and could only just hold his position late. LOOK AWAY void of speed, though hustled from the gate, picked up his pace
after a half mile, came off the rail some entering the stretch and was getting to the wiring COPPER CROSSING in the waning yards. READY REDDING
broke inward, bumping BOURBON DELIGHT, gradually faded from inside, was unresponsive in the stretch and in hand in the late going.

Footnotes
TALIS PARK GRAD hesitated at the start, advanced from outside, stayed in path three through the turn, started to gradually drift out as he took the lead
approaching the last furlong, continued to drift after moving clear and kept YOU'RE IN COREY at bay under steady handling. YOU'RE IN COREY without
early speed, angled out taking the bend, drifted out entering the lane, steadily drifted out making his bid in the stretch but took over second with seventy
yards left. CRANKSHAFT shared the lead outside FASTNFURIOUS, took over nearing the quarter pole, was clear entering the lane but began to wear
down upper stretch. FASTNFURIOUS displayed early speed from inside then faded after three and a half furlongs.

Footnotes
SPAN was urged along to stay close between rivals on the backstretch, angled out some on the turn, was forced to come into the lane from path five, rallied
to gain the advantage inside the last eighth and was beginning to draw off in the late going. C C RITHMS inattentive in the gate, was a step slow when it
opened, rushed up from outside to gain the advantage, moved clear on the bend, drifted out entering the stretch, began to gradually wear down but was
easily second best. CHEF RAY WILEY raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up while just off the inside on the bend, was no
match for the top pair when set down for the drive but pulled away from the rest to secure third. STROPE bore inward after a slow start and only passed
between tired ones in the lane. BEST MAN SPEECH was a step slow at the break but soon prominent from inside, was caught in tight quarters along the rail
on the turn, angled out three wide upper stretch and had no late bid. TAPIT IN was a brief contender between rivals but faded three wide on the turn.
OSCAR NOMINEE was also a step slow at the start, chased from just off the rail and yielded just off the inside on the bend.

Footnotes
GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS was hustled along to share the lead outside MAJESTIC ATTACK, moved clear at the top of the lane and held on under steady
handli8ng. EMPTY HOLSTER chased from just off the rail, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, steadily closed the gap on the leader
while battling inside FAST CROSS TRAFFIC but came up short. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC in contention from the beginning, was three then four wide
through the bend and also rallied belatedly the last furlong. SANTINO'S FANTASY was an early factor from outside, failed to keep up while four wide on the
turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and found best stride too late. MAPACHE G broke poorly, was soon far back, saved ground taking the bend,
angled out some upper stretch and showed a willingness to run through the waning yards. BLUE NORTHER lost ground moving widest on the turn then
drifted out and lugged back in through midstretch. MAJESTIC ATTACK displayed early speed from inside but began to flatten nearing the end of three and a
half furlongs.

Footnotes
GINSBURNED shared the early lead from just off the inside, moved ahead of the other from along the rail on the turn, was clear leaving the bend, slowly
drifted out in the stretch but held on. SIRCORRI prominent from inside, angled out on the bend then rallied belatedly just outside GINSBURNED. MEDAL
OF FACT hustled early between rivals, was bumped midway on the backstretch, three then four wide through the turn and was closing in on the top pair
inside the final furlong. PERFECT WAGER was away slowly, just off the rail taking the turn, angled out five wide upper stretch and made a strong, but
belated, bid. OVERTHOUGHT saved ground through the bend and passed inside tired ones the last furlong. TIZRIK was hustled to dispute the pace from
outside on the backstretch, did not stay with GINSBURNED on the turn and yielded between rivals through the lane. GREAT PLAINES soon overcame a
slow start to be a factor between rivals, angled out widest on the bend and flattened out for the drive. WINDIGO SPIRIT steadily angled in as he vied for the
early lead, bumped MEDAL OF FACT midway on the backstretch then gave way three wide on the turn.
