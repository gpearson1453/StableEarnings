Footnotes
RUN AUNTIE T RUN sent clear, continued clear on the turn, entered lane clear, met bid from inside rival in upper stretch, and proved best. FLAG SALUTE
chased pace along the rail, continued along the inside on the turn, launched bid along the inside and failed to get to winner. JAYCEE chased rival two wide
on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, and kept on in the lane. SHVERE ARBETER broke in, stalked pace along the rail, continued along the
rail on the turn, and needed more in the lane to improve. FUNKY GREY stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered
lane four wide and lacked needed response under urging. AFTER SUNDOWN bothered by outside rival at the start, dropped far back on the backstretch,
saved ground on the turn, swung widest into the lane and made mild progress. PER RULING NUMBER ECM2024-142/ECM - RUN AUNTIE T RUN WAS
DQD FROM FIRST TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
