Footnotes
UPRIGHT seized the early lead from the break and set out to slow the pace down, ceded the lead to THECHIEFHASTRICKS entering the backstretch then
proceeded to track that rival to the far turn, bid and took command passing the quarter pole, met a bid by REEF CITY at the top of the stretch, held that one
off in a determined effort and proved best in the final stages. REEF CITY broke well then tracked the slow pace on the rail, got closer keeping to the inside
on the far turn but waited behind horses for room to run, tipped out three to four wide for the stretch run, engaged with UPRIGHT in a spirited battle down
the stretch but could not get past that foe while being floated out to the middle of the track and was well clear of the rest for second. CANTILEVER got away
in good order, went three to four wide through the clubhouse turn then tracked mid-pack to the far turn, made a three to four wide bid nearing the quarter
marker, came four to five wide into the stretch, could not impact the top pair and held well in deep stretch to secure show honors. CALLUM lacked any early
speed and trailed the field to the far turn while saving ground, went into a drive with three furlongs to run and gained ground at the quarter pole, finished
evenly in the stretch and just missed for third. THECHIEFHASTRICKS fractious in the gate, was off a beat slow then rushed up to join UPRIGHT on the
lead, grew impatient with the slow pace and was pushed on to open up on the field down the backstretch, went clear into the far turn then came under
pressure approaching the quarter pole, hung in to mid-stretch then faded in the late stages. HOLY SMOKES was a bit keen and hard to place through the
first turn, settled but dropped to last for the run down the backstretch, continued to trail through the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RESERVE PROOF hopped at the start and was off a step slow, rushed up to join the early pace battle, got to a stalking position just behind FANTASTIC
DREAM, found the pace too slow and took command passing the eleven-sixteenths pole, held the field at bay through the far turn while always traveling
well, opened up when roused at the top of the stretch and was ridden out as much the best. TALISKER BAY got caught three wide going into the first turn,
settled at the rear of the tracking group, advanced with a mild three-wide move through the turn, swung four to five wide into the stretch, responded to
steady handling in the drive, was no match for the winner in the late stages and was best of the rest. LOVE OF THE SPORT got a good break from the gate
but was not asked for speed, tracked the dueling leaders along the rail to then made an early challenge passing the half-mile pole, came under a ride from
the five-sixteenths and bid for the lead at the top of the stretch, could not keep pace with the top pair past the furlong marker and just held for third at the
finish. BALLROOM PRINCE allowed to settle mid-pack through the early running, made steady forward progress down the backstretch while staying in the
clear, got up close to the leaders then launched a three wide bid from the three furlong pole, weakened in the stretch and lost a tight battle for third.
FANTASTIC DREAM broke sharply and was sent to the front with RESERVE PROOF in close pursuit, was overtaken by that rival mid-way down the
backstretch then began to lose ground from the half-mile pole, went into a drive with three furlongs to run, angled widest into the stretch and could not
muster a late response. WINTER SOLDIER unhurried in the early stages, lagged at the rear of the field through the early stages, kept to the inside through
the far turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
IDIOT'S GOLD settled just off of the dueling pacesetters in the early going, tracked through the turn then responded when sent after that pair from the
five-sixteenths pole, tipped two to three wide into upper stretch, loomed at the furlong marker and took command past mid-stretch, responded to urging into
the final sixteenth and drew clear late. MARS ON FIRE was allowed to settle into stride and was last of the compact field into the turn, went into a drive from
the nine-sixteenths pole, swung widest into the stretch and closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not reel impact the winner at the finish and bested
LOOKIN TO EXCEL in the final strides to secure the place. LOOKIN TO EXCEL was sent aggressively from the break, won the race to the turn and set solid
fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, dueled with RUNNIN UTE into the stretch, shook free of that rival then was overtaken leaving the furlong
marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and was clear in the end for show honors.
OH GREAT (IRE) chased the solid early pace from the outside, went three to four wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, finished evenly in
the stretch drive and did not threaten in the late stages. RUNNIN UTE broke well and rushed up to join LOOKIN TO EXCEL on the lead heading into the
turn, dueled through solid fractions nearing the quarter pole, came under a ride from the three-sixteenths pole and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TIGER ATTACK broke alertly and assumed early command away from the start, drew to a clear lead nearing the half-mile pole and set decent fractions
while well handled into the turn, dictated terms while off of the rail heading to the quarter marker, repelled GOOD FOCUS entering the stretch and spurted
clear at the furlong marker, maintained a clear lead into the final sixteenth and kept to task late to hold sway. GOOD FOCUS tracked the decent early pace
from the second flight, went four wide into the turn, gained ground and loomed three wide at the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch and chased
TIGER ATTACK to the furlong marker, could not make headway on the winner into the final sixteenth and bested the rest. RANCHO RED settled while not
far back in the early running, saved ground into the turn, advanced at the quarter pole and maintained an inside path into the stretch, needed more into the
final sixteenth and was clear in the end for third. COUNT ASHER allowed to settle while never far back early on, raced five to four wide into the turn and
advanced at the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch and was outrun at the furlong pole, re-rallied into the final sixteenth but could not impact the
leaders in deep stretch. ALPHABETICAL ORDER antsy in the starting gate, took an awkward step then steadied at the break and was off slowly, was hard
to place in the early running, went three wide into the turn and chased the moderate pace heading to the quarter marker, lacked a response into the stretch
and did not threaten. SPLIT ACES was hustled way from the gate then tracked behind TIGER ATTACK through the early stages, was beset by challengers
on all sides passing the three furlong pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
YODERANDO broke well and dueled outside of HARBOR'S ROSE from the start, kept the pressure on while two wide through the turn and into the stretch,
was all out to get by that stubborn foe into the final sixteenth, wore down the game runner-up in the final strides and inched away for a determined win.
HARBOR'S ROSE broke well and dueled inside of YODERANDO from the break, kept a head in front through the turn and into the stretch, dug in gamely as
that rival attempted to get by, held on to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final yards and held safely for second at the finish. SMOOVE AS SILK
unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, closed well
into the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for show honors. WEGOTTODRINKING settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, chased three
wide along the turn and lost ground at the quarter pole, angled widest into the stretch and was outrun heading to the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final
sixteenth but could not threaten the leaders late. DRAW NEAR got away well and rushed up to join the dueling leaders, allowed those two to slip away on
the turn and chased from an inside position approaching the quarter pole, tipped three wide into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and did not
offer a late response.

Footnotes
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER sped to the front and led the field through moderate early fractions, was well handled into the turn and set a pressured pace to
the quarter pole, responded when roused at the top of the stretch and kicked clear the furlong marker, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth,
was all out in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish. TRULY FABULOUS hesitated at the break then broke outward and steadied, was outrun
early, kept to the inside through the turn then tipped out to the two path for the stretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch then dove to the rail nearing the
sixteenth-marker, closed fast in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure place honors. WESTWARD BREEZE raced close
up to the decent early pace, bid three to four wide at the quarter pole, was gaining under steady handling into the final sixteenth but could not reel in the
winner and was passed for second in the final strides. THE GREAT HAYNES hopped in the air at the break and spotted the field to begin, raced wide down
the backstretch, was guided two to three wide through the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and made a valiant rally but came up short at the finish.

Footnotes
STRAIT OF GEORGIA prompted POLACCO through decent early fractions, allowed that one to set the pace while never far back, bid for the lead passing
the quarter pole with POLACCO backing up, met the bid of RICH GOLD inside of the furlong marker, battled that rival into the final sixteenth and dug in in
deep stretch for a determined win. RICH GOLD was allowed to settle early, and was content to race near the rear of the field through the first half, launched
a rally just past the nine-sixteenths pole, and was in a stiff drive from the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, engaged STRAIT OF GEORGIA in
a battle down the stretch but could not get past that stubborn foe but was well clear for place honors. SUGAR BEETS was reserved early, raced three to
four wide into the first turn and was content to trail to the half-mile pole, guided two to three wide into the second turn, swung widest for the drive, was
gaining in deep stretch but could not impact the top pair late and held for third at the finish. TORPEDO AWAY broke well but settled behind the early leading
pair, continued to track while under a snug hold down the backstretch, made a brief bid three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not find another gear
when needed and weakened in the drive. GALLANT WARREN settled off of the early pace while never far back, saved ground into the backstretch run, lost
position into the second turn and saved all of the ground approaching the quarter marker, made a mild gain into the stretch but could not sustain that run
into the late stages. LOADED MUSKET went four wide into the clubhouse turn, remained near the rear of the field and was widest down the backstretch,
made a mild bid through the turn but could not make any headway and did not factor. POLACCO threw his head at the start and was off a step slowly, was
hustled for the early lead, secured the rail and assumed command before the first bend, dictated the pace while being shadowed by STRAIT OF GEORGIA
to the outside, attempted to slip away after passing the half-mile marker, opened up through the far turn, tired and was overtaken before the furlong grounds
then stopped.
