MAZUMA rated along the inside, shifted out three deep to challenge near the five sixteenths pole and just got up in a long drive under all out pressure.
DAME PLATA quick to begin to set his own pace down the backstretch, met bid near the five sixteenths pole, dug in near the rail and missed in a game
effort. SIR STERLING tracked the early leader two deep and had not enough in the drive. RIGHT TONE shuffled back at the start, stalked the pace from the
outside, raced four wide in the stretch and was even with no closing run. TOMMYHAWK dropped back early and failed to respond.

OKIE HOPE was bumped at the start, dropped back to the back of the pack early, advanced through the far turn, made a good rail bid in the drive and
finished well to get up under strong handling. UNBRIDLED KISSES stalked the pace, moved up to take aim into the upper stretch five deep and missed in a
game effort. RUN A FIRE dropped back off the pace, raced four wide between in the stretch and rallied willingly to the wire. SISSUE dueled near the rail and
weakened through the drive. ROCKINMYFEATHERBOA dropped back to race mid pack, was near the inside past the quarter pole, angled out and raced
evenly to the wire. SALT CREEK CAT dueled two deep from the outside of foe and faded. SUGAR COATED settled off the early pace, fanned seven wide
into the upper stretch and had no late rally. DEM CATS LUV ME was bumped at the start, raced three to four wide in the stretch and never threatened.
OPELUCY raced from the outside in the drive and failed to sustain a bid. The five eighths fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
AMMENTHEDESTROYER stalked the pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to edge up late under steady handling. LINCOLNS
BRISKET showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and kept on gamely to the wire. SEARCHIN SAFARI raced mid pack early on, was
three deep past the quarter pole, shifted six deep near the three sixteenths pole and rallied willingly to the wire. KYEMBEA dropped back early, was four
wide around the far turn, raced six deep into the upper stretch and made a late gain to improve position. SUPPOSE YOU DREAM raced three to four wide
in the stretch and had no late response. OOEY GOOEY CHEWY tracked the top pair from the inside and weakened. DOYOUKNOWMYNAME pressed the
early leader from the outside and faded. LATENT SHADOW saved ground and never threatened. MAJOR PAYNE raced far back and never was involved.
The five eighths fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes

TRICKLE rated along early, made an early rail bid near the three eighths pole and kept on gamely to the wire. HOLCOMBE settled off the early pace, swung
six wide into the lane and moved up to improve position. WHAT ABOUT JIMMY stalked the pace, loomed four wide around the far turn and flattened out in
the drive. TAPIT TWICE dropped back to race mid pack, was four to five wide in the drive and had no response. COWBOY WALT settled off the early pace,
was three wide into the upper lane and lacked a bid. HEXCEL set a pressured early pace and faded. GOSPEL PREACHER pressed the pace from the
inside and gave way. HOT NIGHT AIR failed to menace.
