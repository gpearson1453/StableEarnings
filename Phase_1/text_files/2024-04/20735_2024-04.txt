Footnotes
MIC'D UP took an immediate lead while tapering to the inside and set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep on the turn, dueled clear mid-stretch
and finished under steady handling. BIG BOY OVI gave chase inside, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn but dropped back
mid-stretch and settled for second best. IRISH WIZARD came in on the chute then gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and dueled to clear third inside
the sixteenth pole. BID ON BLUE came away a step slow then gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and could only improve his position. UNCLE PRESS
gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. EXCLUSIVE ORIGINAL was forced in at the break, gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and weakened. THOR'S LAD was shuffled back on the chute then angled to the outside to give chase, but
weakened in the three path on the turn.

Footnotes
THUNDERTURTLE settled off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily progressed from that point, raced in the four path on the
far turn, dug in for the lead leaving the sixteenth pole and edge clear toward the wire. CLEARLY VISIBLE rated a slim early lead inside, was met into the
backstretch and dueled from that point, cleared Sommer Velvet midway on the far turn, but was met mid-stretch and flattened late yards. CASTLE OF
CAYLEE saved ground on the first turn then eased out and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path, angled to the outside
leaving the turn and finished well to take third the final stride. SOMMER VELVET stalked from the three path then challenged into the backstretch, contested
at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but flattened stride nearing mid-stretch. PRACTICALLY THERE was bumped leaving the gate then saved
ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, closed to a boxed in position nearest the rail midway on the far turn then flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. WOODSONG'S CASTLE was bumped inward and into Practically There leaving the gate then settled in the three path the first turn, left the
turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. TIMEISGOLDEN
broke inward and made contact with Woodsong's Castle then rated close two deep, dueled leaving the half mile pole but dropped back midway on the far
turn and weakened in the lane.

GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN stalked the early pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail into the far turn, angled to the four path
through the turn and dug in under steady handling to take over the final strides. EMBERLY stalked from the four path into the first turn, took the nod into the
backstretch and dueled from that point, drew clear leaving the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady encouragement, but was
caught flattening stride in the closing yards. FLAT DISCOUNT settled inside on the first turn, angled toward the outside leaving the turn and gave chase past
the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead off the rail on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. FORTUNATA ITALIA
saved ground well off the pace the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, raced at the rail into the far turn then angled to the five path through
the turn and finished well outside. RIDE THE RAPIDS took the early lead inside, was met nearing the half mile pole and gave close chase from that point,
but dropped back passing the quarter pole and weakened inside the eighth pole. NIGHTTIME JUSTICE rounded the first turn about the three path, picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. UNCAPTURED RUBY stumbled behind
leaving the gate, rounded the opening turn in the five path and showed little response through the backstretch. DULCE KIARA rated close off the rail the first
turn, picked up the chase leaving the turn then weakened in the four path on the far turn. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT stalked from the five path the first turn,
gave chase into the backstretch but weakened into the far turn.

mid-stretch and inched clear under the wire. LANDON JACK pressured the pace outside and moved to even terms at the five sixteenths pole, took the nod
approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn but was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. AKITO was hustled to the lead
nearing the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, dug in at even terms leaving the five sixteenths pole, remained a factor at the rail on the turn but
flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. AIR KENNEY gave chase, raced two deep on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. DOCTOR JERRY chased
inside, was eased to the three path through the turn and ran evenly in the lane. SMOKIN SMITTY chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the
turn and finished evenly. TIZAFASTBULLET chased, raced in the five path on the turn then flattened. MONEY MAC chased outside, raced in the five path
on the turn and weakened in the lane. GLENHOLME gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path. MO EH HENNESSY pressured the pace inside,
