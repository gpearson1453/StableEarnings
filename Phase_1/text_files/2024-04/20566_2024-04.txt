Footnotes
MAKIZAN prompted the pace in the three path, took command after a right handed cue going by the three-eighths, and drew clear along the inside down the
lane. TAPIT'S DIRECTION tracked in the two path, was roused passing the three-eighths, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and chased
on for place. HEY RIVER stalked in the four path, came under a ride early into the turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the lane, but evened out for
show. GINGERSNAP JACK raced off the pace in the two path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. BOLKIN showed
the way along the inside, was challenged entering the turn, lost the lead before the three-eighths, then had to steady just after three-eighths, and weakened.
JOEL'S BOY broke in a tangle, chased in the four path but never menaced. SOLAR FLASH stumbled at the start, trailed inside, had to steady early around
the turn, and was eased. THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGES AFTER AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BOLKIN AGAINST THE
RIDER OF TAPIT'S DIRECTION, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF TAPIT'S DIRECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF MAKIZAN,
BOTH FOR POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE JUST AFTER THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE

Footnotes
MENSA set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. UNCHAINED ELAINE chased the winner in the three path in the clear, could not gain
on that foe but stayed on well to be well clear of the rest. TANK hit the starting gate, saved ground in range, lacked a rally but bested the rest. UNFILTERED
HONEY bumped with NOTTHATBAD at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. ROSE RITA was fractious in the gate, gave chase four wide and
lacked a closing bid. DELIGHTFUL FLAME had her head turned at the start, was hustled along early and never reached contention while racing two wide.
NOTTHATBAD bumped at the start and was outrun inside.

Footnotes
FLIRTINI showed the way in the three path, waited confidently in the two path around the turn, was cued passing the quarter, floated out to the four path
while drawing clear in upper stretch, and held sway. MISS M M chased in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, bumped an outer foe
while angling out to the six path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. TREVESS prompted the pace in the four path, was pushed along in the three path
around the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and finished evenly to hold show. NOW SHOWING raced off the pace in the five path, was coaxed
along in the four path around the turn, got bumped out to the seven path by an inner foe in upper stretch, and made no impact. MOOR STRENGTH trailed in
the two path, lost the whip midway around the turn, and was one paced from the four path down lane. DAVID'S ROSE tracked in the three path, was cued
along the inside passing the three-eighths, but faded in the two path down the lane.

Footnotes
VETERANS BEACH set the pace along the rail, was briefly headed late on the turn but dug in inside to prevail. GRAND JOURNEY prompted the pace two
wide, bid midway around the far turn, briefly led late on the turn, vied outside to the winner through the lane but was turned back. MY MAN FLINT saved
ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and ran on for the show. UNCLE CURLY saved ground in
midpack early, raced three wide around most of the turn, swung six wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. MOMZA raced in range two wide,
angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. TIZ A PRINCE saved ground and failed to menace. CHAPALU bumped with GRADED
ON A CURVE after the start, chased the pace three wide and faded in the drive. SIR TERRE threw his head at the start and was off several lengths behind
the field, raced three wide and never threatened. GRADED ON A CURVE was bumped after the start, raced two and three wide and was no threat.
RESTORED ORDER stalked the pace inside and retreated through the lane. DUBBY DUBBIE was outrun while racing four wide.

and inched ahead of an inner pair in the final sixteenth. WORLDLY BEAUTY laid off the pace in the two path. waited along the inside rounding the far turn,
was coaxed turning into the stretch, and ran on to get up for place. BEACH READY showed the way in the three path turning into the backstretch, received
a right handed cue in the two path midway around the far turn, dug in while floating out to the five path in upper stretch, but was edged out on both sided in
the final sixteenth to show. BOSTON PRINCESS tracked in the three path, had to wait in the two path around the far turn, was roused between foes passing
the quarter, floated out to the five path but got stymied in upper stretch, alter out to the seven path around the sixteenth, but flattened. LINNY KATE was

Footnotes
TIFFANY GOLD pressed the pace in the three path between foes, took over near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SPICY GUACAMOLE set the pace in
the two path, was collared by the winner near the sixteenth pole and held second. CHARLOTTES ROAD stalked the pace in the four path and was
one-paced through the lane to hold the show. GALLOP D'HERMES went evenly while racing two wide. BABY BLOCKS chased the pace from the rail and
weakened through the final furlong. EMILY'S ON FIRE was outrun inside. MOBAY PRINCESS was fractious in the gate and never threatened while racing
two and three wide. FEAR AND FRIDAY trailed in the four path.
