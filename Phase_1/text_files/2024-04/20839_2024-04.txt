Footnotes
AUCHINCRUIVE settled in the back for the first 1 1/2 miles, gained ground on the leaders after the seventh fence, moved wide to the outside to assume
command after the ninth fence, entered the stretch in the lead and prevailed at the wire. FINGAL went out to an early lead for the first two fences, dueled
with I AM FORTUNATA (IRE), exchanging the lead between calls through the eighth fence, dropped back until clearing the 9th fence, then gained ground
on the inside to approach the last fence in contention but was outrun in the stretch. CODIGO started just behind the leaders, settled midpack through the
first mile, dropped back until the ninth fence, gained ground before the final fence, and rallied in the stretch to pass tiring rivals for show. MR JEFFERSON
started midpack, gained ground after the fifth fence to stalk the leaders, lost ground after the ninth fence, and rallied in the stretch to maintain position. I AM
FORTUNATA (IRE) went toward the front at the start, assumed command after the third fence, dueled with FINGAL and exchanged leads between calls, led
the field over the ninth fence, could not hold off challengers before the final fence and had no stretch rally. REEL WELL ran out the back throughout the

the top of the stretch and rallied for the win. GO POKE THE BEAR was away alertly, led throughout the race, quickened the pace after the ninth fence, was
overtaken by TOTAL JOY (IRE) at the final fence and could not meet the challenge in the stretch. KIYOMORI rated early, trailed the field throughout, and
rallied to pass a tiring rival in the stretch. GOING COUNTRY (IRE) kept pace with the leader through nine fences, weakened after the ninth fence, lost
ground, and was unable to mount a final bid.

Footnotes
OSCAR WINNER led in the early going, relinquished the lead before the second fence, stalked the pace through the eighth fence, assumed command after
the ninth fence, dueled with ARTISTIC CHOICE (IRE) before the final fence, and rallied in the stretch to just prevail. ARTISTIC CHOICE (IRE) raced close
up throughout the race, bid after the ninth fence to come even with the leader, took the final fence in tandem with OSCAR WINNER, but was unable to
overcome the winner and just missed. STATE OF AFFAIR raced middle of the pack, never losing touch with the leaders, entered the stretch midpack in a
tight field, and gained position in the stretch for show. LYDFORD (GB) ran off the pace through the ninth fence, jumped the ninth fence last, bid before the
final fence to gain ground and found his best stride late to pass rivals in the stretch. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER trailed the field through the first mile, moved up
in position before the seventh fence, then flattened and could not gain further position. ARROWHEART started off the pace, gained position after the fourth
fence and held through the ninth fence, entered the stretch as a contender but could not sustain the bid and was outrun in the stretch. ICANDOTHAT set the
pace after the first fence, maintained the lead through the ninth fence, could not hold back challengers before the final fence to lose position, and faded in
the stretch. SEISMIC WAVE ran middle of the pack the first mile, dropped back after the sixth fence to trail the field and was no menace. AUCTION
KINGDOM traveled the middle of the pack in early going, rated by the first mile, and was no threat.
