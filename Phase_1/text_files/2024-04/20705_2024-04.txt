JERSEY PERFECTION trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground
late to get up for the win. LITTLE LUKEY veered out leaving the gate, led the way on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path
and was caught late. SEAX raced off the pace early, continued around the turn in the four path and improved position in the stretch. BLACK ECHO pressed
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded in the lane. YOU BACK chased the leader through the opening
stages, came around the turn in the two path and weakened in the stretch. NOMAR'S HOPE raced in the middle of the pack early, navigated the turn from
