Footnotes
HAILEYSFIRSTNOTION disputed the pace outside DOMINGUEZ, disposed of that one approaching the stretch, drifted very wide entering the lane and
drew off late. WRIGHTSVILLE broke slowly, hugged the inner rail on the turn, moved to the two path approaching the stretch and rallied inside horses.
LIVEHAPPY bobbled at the break, rushed up three deep to challenge for the lead outside the winner turning for home, was floated very wide in upper
stretch and weakened. SUMMER READY , well placed three deep leaving the turn, gave way. EVENING MAGIC raced in the two path on the turn and was
not a factor. DOMINGUEZ showed speed along the inner rail for a half mile and gave way. HUB unseated his rider when stumbling at the break. There was
a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
DESTINED TO DANCE rated close up while saving ground, sat patiently near the five sixteenths, eased out and was afforded a seam as an outer rival
drifted into the stretch, moved to engage the leader soon after, dueled outside, wrested command a furlong out then edged clear late under a drive.
SEARCH prompted the pace outside OJITOS BELLOS, was under a ride leaving the far turn, wandered out to about the four path leaving the quarter pole,
corrected and gave hard chase through the final sixteenths, kept on with effort and got the place between foes. LOOKING FOR WATER , attempting to lay
out a bit entering the first turn, settled while inside through the backstretch run, was under a ride exiting the far turn, shifted out leaving the three sixteenths
and closed steadily. OJITOS BELLOS was nudged clear early then dropped in when clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, came two wide into the
stretch, battled inside the winner from the three sixteenths to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. VOODOO PRIESTESS hit the outer portion of
her stall and was off a step slow, raced three wide into the first turn, came wider for the drive but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
FLOGE broke a step slow, recovered and edged up outside rivals heading to the half mile marker, bid three deep after a half, dueled outside TINA TINA
TINA from the quarter pole, gained a slim lead in mid stretch then edged away late while under a drive. TINA TINA TINA quickly went clear then was guided
towards the inner rail to set the pace, met outside bids near the three eighths, emerged in a battle to the inside of the winner leaving the five sixteenths,
fought on to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. MOMMA'S LINO , headstrong while under firm rating saving ground early on, shifted out after a half
mile, circled four wide under a ride into the lane, gave hard chase of the dueling leaders in mid stretch and churned on with some interest. G'S FIREBALL ,
towards the inside, was under a ride mid turn but failed to generate a serious run. SUN STREAMING , off the pace, swung five wide for the drive but failed
to kick on. NO WALK INTHE PARK prompted the pace, moved up and bid under a ride while between foes after a half, failed to go on with the leaders
approaching the stretch then tired.

flattened out between rivals. MASTER OF NONE lacked speed, raced in the three path leaving the far turn and lacked the necessary rally. TWIST 'N TWIRL

Footnotes
ROMINSKI cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside, met an outside challenge from CLASSIER inside the three sixteenths, briefly ceded command
in mid stretch, battled back under left handed asks to regain the lead nearing the sixteenth marker then was edging back away late under steady handling.
CLASSIER rated close up behind rivals while about two wide eased out leaving the turn and moved menacingly in hand past the five sixteenths, drew
alongside and appeared to gain a slim advantage a furlong out, could not maintain the edge nearing the sixteenth pole but kept on with effort to the wire.
EXCULPATORY , snugly rated five wide outside foes nearing the half, exchanged a bump with COWAN soon after, dropped in a path to advance past the
five sixteenths, chased the leading pair past the furlong grounds and continued on with effort to gain. MURRAY , brushed at the break, settled off the pace
while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane, moved up a bit in mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain. TENEBRIS rated stalking two wide, took
closer order past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on under asking in upper stretch then gave way through the final furlong. COWAN brushed with MURRAY
at the start, rated four wide between runners early, bumped with an outer rival entering the turn, regrouped to lay close mid turn, lacked a punch past the
quarter pole and retreated. DATS MR. MO , three wide between foes, was lightly shuffled back leaving the far turn then gave way.
