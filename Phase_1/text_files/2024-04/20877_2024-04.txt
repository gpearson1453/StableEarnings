SARA'S SAPPHIRE dueled near the rail and kicked clear in the drive to be well clear under steady handling. HEY ROXY settled off the early duel, made a
good rail bid around the far turn through the stretch and rallied to narrowly get up for the place position. COZZOLANI stalked the dueling pair early, raced
three wide in the stretch run and had not enough. EXCETERA dueled two wide from the outside of rival and faded.

the early pace, advanced through the far turn, was six wide into the upper stretch and rallied gamely to the wire. BIG MUCKITY vied near the rail and kept
on willingly to the wire. RUN FIRE RUN pressed the early pace while racing between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. I'M CRENSHAW

TAP N PLAY sprinted clear to a long early lead under steady urging and held well through the drive to remain safe under steady handling. SLEW'S LIAISON
chased the early pace between rivals, raced three wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. AWESOME OUTLAW coaxed along early, was
near the rail past the five sixteenths pole, angled out to race off the inside and moved up to close with good energy. TATER urged three deep early, raced
five deep near the three sixteenths pole and raced even with no closing run. IRA CHAMP was under a hard chase near the rail early and weakened a bit
through the drive. OKIE CHROME dropped back early, angled in to race near the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and lacked a closing bid.
HERO TIME dropped back early, swung six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. MISTER TYRO trailed early and failed to menace. The five

quarter pole, angled out wide through the drive to race from the far outside and moved up to improve position. LUCKY MCCOY tracked the early leader two
deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MAJESTIC CRAKEN unhurried early on, raced two to three wide in the stretch and had no response. DOCS
DUTY urged near the rail early and faded. DRAG MALIBU raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. BORN TOUGH saved ground

Footnotes
HAMAZING WISDOM stalked the pace, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, eased out into the upper lane and finished well to just get up under
strong pressure. DEL MOON set a pressured early pace along the inside and kept on gamely to the wire in a determined effort. LIARS CLUB pressed the
early leader from the outside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. CHARING CROSS was allowed to settle early, made a good rail bid through the
stretch run and moved up to improve position. WAVERUNNER raced three wide through the drive and had no response. LIMBO'S PROMISE stalked the
pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened. VANGILDER settled off the early going, saved ground and never threatened. REQUISITION
was unhurried early on, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. ELECTORAL failed to sustain a bid. JUST A IRISH LAD was pulled
up and had to be vanned off.
