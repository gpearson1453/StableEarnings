Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS MISS was on the pace outside MARY WHO to move clear late backstretch, widened quickly in the far turn then held a safe margin under
hand urging. MASTER JANE moved three wide to get nearest the winner into the lane but could not close the gap. MISS YOU NO MORE moved up four
wide to best the others only. PRINCESS VANELLOPE lunged at the break, moved up inside but never threatened. OLIVIA'S HOPE chased the pace from
three wide and weakened. MARY WHO showed early speed inside the winner, came well out in the track entering the far turn and dropped back. GOOD
GRACIOUS was not a factor. CRUISE TALK was always back four and five wide.

ASTA LAVISTA HONEY contested the lead outside SAMURAI'S GRANDSON throughout and held gamely through the lane. SAMURAI'S GRANDSON
dueled from inside the winner throughout and could not get by. FREEDOM FLASH angled out three and four wide in the far turn to have aim but could not
run down the top pair. WHONEW rallied three wide and closed late but came up short. SKYLINE failed to mount a rally four wide. CORTE weakened four
and five wide. TIZKANDOIT was close up four wide through the opening half and weakened. SCRATCH ME was always back. TOMMY TSUNAMI broke
hard into the side of the gate, trailed and dropped out in the far turn, pulling up with the rider in distress.
