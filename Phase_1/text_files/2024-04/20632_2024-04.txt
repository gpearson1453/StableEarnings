SEND OFF remained nicely rated while tracking the pace two to three wide down the backstretch, moved between rivals leaving the far turn while brushing
outer rival, dug in gamely and edged clear in the late stretch to be up in time. LET ME LOVE YOU was bumped at the start, then led the way into the early
backstretch, was challenged by an outer rival down the remainder of the backstretch and into the far turn, gain command again in the early stretch then was
caught in the end. BIG AND BOLD was forwardly placed into the first turn while two wide to duel with an inner rival down the late backstretch, continued to
menace throughout the far turn before giving way in the home stretch and held the show prize. MANIFESTED lunged at the start, chased the pace while two
wide, then bid from the inside on the far turn, came out to the three path, was brushed by an inner foe and came up evenly in the stretch. CARGO PANTS
bumped rival, then chased the pace from the inside at an even pace throughout and needed rally in the end. COWBOY WALT took position along the inside
and at the back and failed to rally. FIRST CAPE was allowed to settle while two wide, made a mild bid on the far turn and was no threat.

Footnotes
MOR PEANUTS pressed the pace down the backstretch while in the two path, then gained command leaving the bend and drew clear under a strong drive
to prevail. PICKINGUPSTRANGERS chased the pace while three wide, saved ground throughout the turn, then came out five wide to rally in the stretch,
could not catch the cleared leader and was best for place. DOC'S BOLERO chased the pace while two wide into the turn, came out three wide leaving the
bend, rallied in the stretch to gain third position but did not have enough to claim victory in the end. MY BUDDY MEL was bumped at the start, chased the
pace along the rail, rallied leaving the bend to gain second position in the early stretch then gave way in the end missing the place prize.
KEEPMOVINGFORWARD was unhurried early and did not rally. BAY BE GONE raced at the back of the pack, then swung seven wide leaving the bend
and came up empty in the stretch. MY FAVORITE SONG broke inwardly and bumped rival, then set the pace along the inside, vied with outer rivals heading
into the stretch and gave way in the end. SILVER AND GOLD tucked along the inside and was no threat.

Footnotes
PUDDING was well rated while three wide mid pack into the turn, dug in gamely mid stretch and surged to the wire to be up in time. SATURDAY'S GOLD
bid three wide, then led the way into the turn, maintained the lead under a gamely rally down the lane then was caught at the wire. BRAHMS BOY bid for the
lead while two wide before settling back to stalk the pace into the turn, then attempted to gain the lead at the quarter, lacked the winning bid down the lane
and missed the place prize in the end. BELEWS GOLD was allowed to settle while three wide, then came out six wide leaving the turn and closed willingly
down the stretch. SIGN OF WAR was unhurried early, then swung seven wide leaving the bend and was closing well down the lane while passing fellow
rivals. CLAY'S BLACK OPAL brushed foe at the start, then stalked the pace from the inside while in a mild drive, then rallied leaving the bend and needed
more in the end. COWBOY RIDGE was brushed at the start, then chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace throughout and did not fire in the
stretch. RECKLESS RED was allowed to settle while two wide, made a mild bid in the late stretch and was no threat. CIBOLO ERL was no menace.

Footnotes
SHE'S CANDIFIED reserved ground at the back of the field, then circled four wide leaving the bend and edged clear in the late stretch to prove best in the
end. CREAM PUFF REAPER was well along the inside close behind the leaders, then split rivals leaving the bend, continued to vie with an outer rival in the
early stretch then was surpassed by SHE'S CANDIFIED in the final yards and was best for the place position. HIGH CALIBER CATCH battled for the lead
between rivals, continued to vie with an inner rival in the early stretch before being out finished by an outer rival and missed the place prize in the end.
TAPITSGOTAPISTOL vied with inner rivals into the turn, continued to rally gamely before giving way in the late stretch. EARLY SPRING vied from the
inside while in a hard drive, was used up after the turn and stopped. PRESS ON BABY was no factor.

Footnotes
GLENDALE was pinched back at the start, then conserved energy in the early furlongs, was moving up eagerly while four wide on the far turn, shifted
inward in the stretch and kept on gamely to be up at the wire and prevail. WHITEROSE JEWEL tracked the pace while four wide, then was gaining ground
on the far turn, gained command in the upper stretch then was out finished in the end. INTERSTELLAR raced in the middle of the pack from the inside, was
in steady hand ride throughout the far turn, then dug in gamely in the early stretch, steadied slightly then kept on for the show prize in the end. GOOD
SWIMMER saved ground throughout the first half, remained well rated throughout the far turn before rallying in the late stretch to close willingly in the end.
NINTH OF APRIL was unhurried early, raced four wide down the early backstretch, attempted to move between rivals, was in tight, then continued to bid
mildly on the far turn and into the stretch coming up empty in the end. SINGING DIXIE was allowed to settle along the inside towards the back of the field,
then rallied in the late stretch but it was to no avail. WITCH'S VOW set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the far turn then faltered in the
stretch. SPIN WHEEL was unhurried early, then raced at the back at the pack down the backstretch, then came out three to four wide in the early stretch to
bid down the lane and came up empty. SWAMPDRAINER pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn, then
was used up and tired in the late stretch. TAKE FLIGHT chased the pace while two wide, was impeded in the late backstretch by an outer rival, steadied
sharply, re gained stride then checked up on the far turn and was out of it. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS stalked the pace while three wide down the backstretch,
was over powered by incoming rivals on the far turn, steadied at the quarter pole and lost bid. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference
in the late backstretch. After reviewing the replay, NINTH OF APRIL was disqualified from seventh and placed ninth for impeding rival.

Footnotes
ERNIE BANKER tracked the pace while three wide and outside of rivals down the backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the turn then switched
leads in the early stretch to edge clear and prevail in the end. SOARING BIRD saved ground down the backstretch, came out four wide leaving the bend to
improve position in the stretch and was best for the place prize. SHOTSHELL led the way briefly before being confronted by an inner rival to spar down the
backstretch and into the turn, gained command in the upper stretch then was over taken by an outer rival and held the show prize in the end. EMPERADOR
was bumped at the start, then tracked the pace from the inside, retreated on the turn, then angled out three wide to bid in the stretch but it was to no avail.
AVAILABLE STAR tracked the pace from the two path and while in a steady drive then menaced in the stretch and came up empty in the end. HAP HOT
moved along the inside to duel with an outer rival down the backstretch, was in a long drive entering the stretch then gave way. CHAMPAGNE STOOPER
broke inwardly and bumped rival and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BIG BERNIE moved in the four path to vie with inner rivals down the early backstretch, continued to battle with two remaining rivals at the half pole before
dueling with the last remaining rival heading into the far turn, took command at the five sixteenths marker then held sway down the home stretch to prove
best overall. MY BROTHER KEITH vied between rivals heading into the first turn before settling back on the backstretch, then rallied leaving the far turn to
gain second position in at the top of the stretch and held onto the place prize in the end. COUSIN LARRY raced in the middle of the two pack of rivals down
the backstretch, then rallied leaving on the far turn to gain third position and was drifting out in the late stretch and held onto the show prize in the end.
GOLD PRIZE saved ground in the early furlongs, then bid on the far turn, shifted out in the early stretch to close willingly while being floated outward by an
inner rival in the end. MIAMI MOONLIGHT was allowed to settle along the rail throughout the majority of the course then rallied entering the home stretch
but it was too little too late. TALE TWISTER was allowed to settle while three wide at the back of the field and outside of rivals, then made a mild rally
leaving the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. DOSE'S DREAM was brushed at the start, then vied between rivals down the backstretch before
dueling a remaining outer rival heading into the far turn, was hard used and tired in the home stretch. CALL OF HONOR vied for the lead from the inside
down the backstretch before retreating to third position on the far turn, was in a steady bid then weakened in the late stretch. TIBURON was shuffled back at
the start and was no factor.

Footnotes
TWIN MISCHIEF tracked the pace from the two path into the backstretch, was inching up on the turn to take command over the pace setter in the early
stretch and held on well to prevail in the end. HOLLY DOLLY moved five wide into the turn to set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, cleared the
far turn, then was met with oncoming presser in the early stretch and was out finished in the end. DIXIE CARROUSEL chased the pace from the inside, then
menaced leaving the far turn while two wide and kept on down the lane and was best for the show prize in the end. REASON OVER RICHES saved ground
in the early furlongs from the inside, urged steadily on the far turn to rally in the stretch and was closing willingly but it was not enough in the end. ARMY
KITTEN was allowed to settle between rivals down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn, came out four wide in the upper stretch and rallied too little too
late. NORDIC QUEEN was allowed the settle along the inside, then made a mild bid in the final furlongs but it was to no avail. CARRY ON was unhurried
early, swung six wide leaving the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. EAST COAST COWGIRL stalked the pace from the inside at a moderate pace
throughout three quarters of the course then lacked bidding in the home stretch. MISS GOLD raced towards the back while two wide down the backstretch,
bid briefly on the far turn then stopped.
