Footnotes
LAPINSKI UNION bumped lightly with ROCK CHALK while racing in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
came around the turn in the two path and dueled to the wire to get up for the win late. UNXPECTED TIGER saved ground around the first turn, led the way
up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and dug in gamely in the lane but just missed. SIDNEY'S BID raced in the two path early,
chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and kept on in the stretch. ROCK CHALK bumped
mildly with LAPINSKI UNION while racing in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far bend and was outkicked in the lane. POSEIDONS MYTH tracked the leader while saving ground through the opening half mile,
continued around the far turn in the three path and faded in the stretch. SKY TRAVELER was fractious in the gate, raced in the two path around the first
turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN JUAN raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and
dueled to the wire to just get up for the win. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY raced in the two path early, chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the
second turn still in the two path and dueled to the wire to just miss. HERCULES raced in the four path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside
up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the four path and chased on to the finish. OFF THE MEDS raced in the three path around the first
bend, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and gained ground mildly in the stretch.
GREAT FACES raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and showed no
kick. SWING LOW raced in the two path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the second bend and never
threatened. SEA SPLENDOR raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far bend and tired from there.

Footnotes
ADIOS JOE saved ground around the first turn, bumped lightly with NOBLE HERO in the process, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run
up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn, switched inside to gain ground between horses in the lane and dueled to the
wire. FIRST SLEW bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend
from the three path and dueled to the finish. FIRE BARON bumped with NOBLE HERO while racing in the three path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far bend in the three path and chased on in the lane. MILCHIN saved ground around
the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. ADMIRAL CURL
raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on from there.
NOBLE HERO bumped with the horses to either side and was squeezed back leaving the gate, headed into the first turn in the two path, bumped with
several horses and was jostled around before settling off the pace for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the far turn and
never threatened. MISTER CHARLIE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half
mile, came around the second bend in the four path and made no bid. RAGMAN raced in the four path around the first bend, pressed the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the four path and faded from there. VINDICATED TIGER raced in the three path early, pressed
the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and tired in the lane. LUCKY HEART raced in the five path around the
