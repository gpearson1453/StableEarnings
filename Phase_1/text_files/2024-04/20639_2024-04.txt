ORO DE MORO MORO matched stride for the lead two wide into the far turn, shook clear nearing the five sixteenths pole, set the pace and prevailed under
mild right handed urging. KING SOCIAL trailed early, saved ground into the stretch, shifted out to the four path, the rider lost his whip near mid stretch and
rallied for second under a hand ride. JACK'S ADVANTAGE battled with the winner along the inside for five furlongs, kept on but was outfinished. KLAATU
hopped then stumbled at the start, was a forward factor for a half mile then wilted. ONLYATTHESHOE stalked the early pace three then two wide and was
through after a half.

KISSING MEDALS prompted the pace two wide for three furlongs, gained a narrow advantage, turned back a strong bid from the runner up at the top of the
stretch and proved best under right handed urging. LIGHTENING LOTTIE with the second flight two wide, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole, matched
stride the balance of the trip but was denied in the final stages. ANGIE'S DEAR ONE slow early, had a mild late rally along the rail. IT'S E Z set a pressured
pace along the inside for three furlongs, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then weakened late. THIRTY SOMETHING was no factor. SOMETHING
LUCKY was outrun. MISS SIX was through early.
