Footnotes
GENTLEMAN GERRY settled in range inside, made a rail bid midway down the backstretch, took over near the seven-sixteenths marker, vied inside around
the far turn, was headed in upper stretch, battled on inside and regained command late. EUPHORIA STAR raced well back two wide, swung five wide near
the quarter pole and closed outside. FLATTER ME raced off the early pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, had aim in upper stretch, ran
on but was outkicked late. MANNIX (IRE) stalked the pace two wide, dueled around the far turn, led through much of the stretch but weakened late. EYES
OF CHAMPION set the pace in the three path, dropped back around the far turn, shifted further out in upper stretch and improved position. MIDWAY
MISCHIEF saved ground and failed to menace. SAMARITANO chased the pace three wide and faded in the drive. IMPRESSIVE SPEED was outrun inside.
ENSIGN SKIP was reluctant to load, broke a bit awkwardly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED BOY showed the way inside, waited confidently along the rail around the far turn, was cued in the two path turning into the lane, and kicked
away. PLEASE BABY raced off the pace in the five path, was roused while four wide early around the far turn, floated out to the six path in upper stretch,
and ran on to be up for place. BATTLE OF DOVER tracked in the four path, was ridden three wide around the far turn, drifted out to the five path passing
the eighth pole, and kept on for show. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE trailed in the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, bumped with an inner
foe and floated out to the eight path entering the stretch, but made no impact. HECHICERO chased in the three path, was coaxed passing the three eighths,
bumped with an outer foe while angling out to the six path turning into the stretch, and was no factor. DARTH rated in the two path, was ridden from the rail
around the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, but failed to bid. GO GO GE stalked inside, had to steady passing the half, was
roused along the rail into the far turn, but flattened down the lane. MORETHANICANHANDLE checked along the inside going into the first turn, laid up close
in the three path down the backstretch, was roused in the two path early around the far turn, but checked between foes in the two path passing the quarter,
and was eased.

Footnotes
GRAND MAXIME bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path, came under left handed encouragement between foes midway around the
turn, tipped out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kicked on to draw past the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. INSISTING broke in and bumped
an inner foe, showed the way in the three path, waited confidently in the two path rounding the turn, was cued turning into the stretch, tipped out after the
eighth pole to try to fend off an outer foe, but was caught in the final sixteenth to place. GROUP TICKET got bumped by an outer foe at the start, tracked in
the four path, was roused midway around the turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. AWESOME FOR SURE got
bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, trailed in the five path early, merged into the two path entering the turn, swung out to the seven path
entering the stretch, stayed on while drifting in on his left lead, but just missed show. MAYHEMINTHEPALACE had an awkward start, rated in the two path,
was roused in the four path early around the turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the lane, but made no impact. WEEKEND CONCERTO bumped
with an outer foe at the start, laid up close in the two path, had to steady along the inside going into the turn, was coaxed from the rail midway around the
turn, but flattened on his left lead in the stretch. IMAPEPPA broke in and bumped an inner foe, raced off the pace in the five path and never menaced from
the nine path down the lane.

Footnotes
DEFLECTION stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, closed and was up late. SPEIGHTFULELECTION set the pace along the rail,
kicked clear in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. WRIGLEYVILLE chased the pace two wide, angled seven wide in upper stretch and rallied for the
show. ELHUBOOB pressed the pace two wide and was outfinished. ALETTE D'ORO raced well back to wide and rallied belatedly between foes. ALAS
DORADAS saved ground and failed to menace. CASSIOPEIA raced off the pace three wide, was bumped in upper stretch, steadied near the eighth pole
and again in the final strides. ERNESTINA saved ground in range, swung out in upper stretch, bumped with CASSIOPEIA, lacked the needed rally and
steadied late. BUNNY HONEY lacked speed three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and was no threat. MAGHRA (IRE) played no factor while racing
three wide. BIANKA HEART chased the pace three wide and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
HARLAN'S LEGACY showed the way in the three path, was cued in the two path early into the far turn, and kicked away while just off the rail down the lane.
CURRENT SITUATION chased in the five path, came under right handed encouragement going into the far turn, and ran on from the five path down the
stretch for place. SANDPIPER MEMORIES prompted the pace in the five path, was ridden in the three path around the far turn, and finished evenly for
show. NOTHING BUT PUMPS trailed in the two path, was driven along the rail around the far turn, but was one paced from the four path in the stretch.
KHOSEA bumped with an outer foe at the start, then was checked and bumped an inner foe while in the two path early, tracked from out in the six path
down the backstretch, was driven in the four path around the far turn, but never threatened. MACASSA bumped with an inner foe at the start and briefly lost
the right iron but it was quickly regained, stalked in the two path, was coaxed along the inside midway around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. GREY
PRINCESS got bumped by an outer foe while along the rail early, chased in the four path, was ridden between foes from the three path into the far turn, and
failed to bid. STARSHIP NANA bumped between foes at the start, raced wellback in the four path and never menaced.

Footnotes
BRYCE CANYON settled off the pace two wide, angled four wide to bull through between foes near the quarter pole, took over in midstretch, quickly
cleared, angled in and held safe. GLOBES raced off the pace three wide and rallied for the place. KARTANO saved ground off the pace, swung six wide
near the quarter pole and finished well to gain the show. EL SOCIO raced in range three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. CALL MY BANKER
tracked the early pace two wide, bid three wide between foes around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. STORM P failed to
menace while racing three wide. SWAGGISH led at the rail early, settled back when BOHEMIAN BOY became intent on the lead around the first turn, tipped
two wide early on the backstretch, re-bid two wide around the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenth marker, led to midstretch and faltered.
BOHEMIAN BOY was hustled two wide to the lead, vied inside around the far turn and retreated through the lane. COACH ABERNATHY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
MISS UCRANIA stalked in the five path, was cued from the four path into the turn, bid entering the lane, took the lead just after the eighth pole, and edged
clear. AMY THE BUTCHER bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the four path, was coaxed along in the three path around the turn, angled out
while hanging on her left lead passing the sixteenth, and ran on for place. AMERICAN OF COURSE prompted the pace in the four path, took command
passing the three-eighths, dug in from the two path into the stretch, but was caught by an outer pair in the final sixteenth to show. BAZINGA C bumped with
an inner foe at the start, tracked inside, but lost ground along the rail around the turn, and faded in the five path down the lane. GO MARGIE GO bumped
with an outer foe and bobbled at the start, trailed in the five path and was never a factor. JUST TAKE NOTES showed the way in the two path but yielded
along the inside around the turn. SADE PURSE bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback in the three path and never threatened. SPEED
SALSA raced off the pace in the six path but never menaced.

Footnotes
SHAQ DIESEL trailed in the three path, was roused along the inside early around the turn, angled out to the five path while rallying into the final furlong, and
drew past the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. CLASSIC CAR WASH raced off the pace in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn,
floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. VIVIR CON ALEGRIA (CHI) showed the way in the three path, came under a ride
passing the half and tipped to the rail going into the turn, lost the lead passing the three-eighths pole, but kicked on to regain an advantage passing the
quarter, opened up on his left lead in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer pair in the final sixteenth. GREAT NAVIGATOR broke out and bumped an
outer foe, raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden into the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. X Y POINT
tracked in the three path but flattened down the lane. PRAIRIE HAWK stalked in the three path, was coaxed from the five path into the turn, but faded in the
stretch. LORD MILES raced wellback in the five path and never threatened. GATSBY got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, chased in
the five path but was no menace. RIVER DOG got bumped by an inner foe at the start, pressed in the four path, took a brief lead passing the three-eighths,
but lost it before the quarter, and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
BONMATI settled off the pace along the inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, bid in midstretch, dueled to deep stretch and edged ahead late.
SHAKREVENGE set the early pace along the rail, settled back inside when VANISHING WISH cleared off early on the backstretch, re-bid two wide into the
far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly inside of the winner. LITTLE MISS MUNNY steadied at
the start, trailed in the two path, swung five wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside. BUTTERFLY QUEEN settled off the pace while racing three wide,
edged closer four wide around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane. GOSSIPER saved ground off the pace, checked near the quarter pole and
was no threat in the lane. COOL TRICKS failed to menace while racing four and five wide. CORRIN PEAK raced off the pace three wide, steadied in upper
stretch and lacked a rally. WORLD SHOWCASE chased the pace two and three wide and had little left for the drive. VANISHING WISH advanced two wide
to the lead, cleared off down the backstretch, raced along the rail around the far turn and retreated through the lane. CITRUS BELLE raced three and four
wide in midpack and retreated after six furlongs.
