Footnotes
WINDY WALK pursued from midpack in the four path, rallied to sweep past the leaders at the three sixteenths pole, drew clear and was put to hand in the
final furlong. FASTA LAVISTA BABY tracked along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and ran on to gain place late. TROTTER dueled for the lead along
the inside, but was overhauled by an outer bidder in upper stretch, yielded and lost place late. DELIGHTED broke outwardly, dueled for the lead with an
inner rival, got outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and weakened. SOUL HEIR raced off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. CAUSE
IMA ROSE broke a step slow, lagged behind down the backstretch, improved between rivals turning for home and made little impact. LA PICASITA chased
forwardly in the three path, got outmoved by a wider rival nearing the lane and weakened. E STORMY broke step slow, saved ground well back to no avail.
MISS GOLDEN PENNY was outrun in the four path.

Footnotes
TRUST DADDY pressed four to two wide approaching the turn, bid turning for home sparking a duel, edged past at the furlong grounds, inched clear late
and lasted safely while tiring. MERLOTTI bobbled, bumped with an outer rival and was off slow at the start, took the turn in the five path while off of the
pace,, then stayed on along with an outer rival to gain place late but ran out of ground to reel in the clear leader. CRUISIN AND BOOZIN took contact from
an inner rival and was off slow, advanced from well back in the six path around the turn, stayed on along with an inner foe while hanging on his left lead, bid
for place approaching the wire but got outfinished and achieved show. QUINCY RIDER showed the way inside of a pressing foe into the turn, sparred with
that bidder entering the lane, fought on after getting headed in midstretch, but yielded and relinquished place to an outer pair in the closing stages. REDHILL
trailed around the turn and moved up. FORGE IN FIRE chased forwardly along the inside and weakened turning for home. TIME MUSE chased forwardly in
the three path but faltered in the four path around the turn.

Footnotes
CAMEO PERFORMANCE tracked along the inside, moved out to the three path at the eleven sixteenths pole, got outmoved by a wider early-bidder into the
far turn, patiently bided time before ranging up entering the lane to offer his own bid in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds and inched
ahead under a drive. GREEN LIGHT pursued from midpack tow wide, gained four wide approaching the far turn, sustained progress to forge an advantage
tucking to the two path turning for home, led into the lane as an outer foe menaced, resisted that rival's bid in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong
grounds while hanging on his left lead, fought on but was second best. CINDER BLOCK saved ground in midpack, split foes entering the lane and stayed on
to gain show in the final furlong. RADICAL MISCHIEF tugged keenly outside of the top pair early on, settled into stride around the first turn to stalk them
from the two path, got outmoved by an outer rival while awaiting racing room at the three furlong pole, crept between horses whlie chasing that rival entering
the lane, but lacked a bid and yielded. SPIN IT bumped with an inner rival and dropped back at the start, trailed along the inside, moved out of last before
encountering traffic tipping to the three path at the five sixteenths pole, swung to the eight path entering upper stretch and ran on. VILLAIN laid off of the
pace three wide, improved four wide into the far turn, but failed to offer a bid before flattening out. GARDEN LEAVE was off a step slow and bumped with an
outer foe a the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide into the far turn, shifted four wide turning for home before fanning to the six
path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. ACTING DEBUT lacked speed in the two to five path and failed to factor. INDY CHARGE dueled for the lead with
an outer rival, disposed of that one nearing the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder turning for home and weakened entering the lane. SALB raced
off of the pace two wide while between horses and made little impact. ENHANCED SCAT dueled for the lead with an inner rival while drifting to the five path
entering the first turn, recovered to spar in the three path around that bend, but yielded approaching the far turn and faltered between horses. PED D'ORO
tracked two wide, but faded between horses with nine sixteenths to go and was done early.

Footnotes
SHE'S A SAINT stalked four wide, bid outside of the leader and gained an advantage while well in hand at the three furlong pole, cleared nearing the lane
and held sway under a drive. GRACE GIVEN tracked three wide, pursued from the four path around the turn, gained place entering the lane in the five path,
shfited in willingly chasing the clear leader and was second best. DICE ARM vied along the inside, chased passing the half mile pole, faded around the turn,
yet sustained stride shifting out entering upper stretch and surpassed tired rivals. AMERICAN MAESTRA raced just behind the leaders along the inside
early on, but checked back at the eleven sixteenths pole, trailed around the turn, then improved past tired rivals in the shadow of the wire. SARISSA vied
three wide, led approaching the turn, but proved no match for an outer bidder leaving the three furlong pole and weakened. ALWAYS DREAM BIG vied two
wide and between horses early on, chased his outer counterpart approaching the turn and faded around the bend.

UTAH BEACH tugged off of the pace two wide and between horses, settled into stride before taking an awkward step and bobbling briefly around the far
turn, tipped and rallied inside of rivals turning for home, smoothly tipped to take aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds and
drove clear. SIX MINUS pursued from midpack along the inside, vacated the rail around the final turn, but allowed for an inner rival to get a jump while
tipping four wide entering the lane, ran on and edged place whlie in pursuit in the final sixteenth. VERBAL stalked the early leader, tugged outside of that
one to gain an advantage passing the wire for the first time, cleared off along the inside around the second turn, led in hand around the far turn, but was
confronted by an outer challenger in midstretch, yielded and lost place late. HEADLINE NEWS stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair
around the final turn, but got outmoved by a rail skimming foe entering the lane, lacked a bid and chased thereafter. WHO TOOK THE MONEY bumped an
outer rival at the start, saved ground well off of the pace, then stayed on to surpass outer rivals. TARTUFO laid well back two wide, pursued two to four wide
and between horses turning for home before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and moved up. HIDDEN STASH settled three wide, took the final turn
four wide before tipping five wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick while hanging on his left lead. DAI VERNON was jostled between horses at the start,
saved ground at the rear and made little impact. WOW WHATA SUMMER showed the way around the first turn, got headed by an outer rival before stalking
that one around the second turn, pressed two wide around the third turn, but faded between horses entering the lane. MUTAKATIF (IRE) pursued from
midpack two wide, chased between horses around the final bend and gave way. CLASSIC CREATION stumbled and bumped with an inner rival at the start,
raced at the rear three wide, got floated five, then seven, wide entering the lane and was outrun.

Footnotes
YO DADDY settled well back in the three path, rallied outside of the leading trio turning for home, bid entering the lane, led approaching midstretch and
inched clear. MONTEVALLO vied with an outer rival, led narrowly down the backstretch, clung to an advantage inside of a pair of pressers around the far
turn, shook free of them as an outer bidder loomed a danger entering the lane, got headed by that one in upper stretch, yet kept on well to be clear of the
rest. J T'S IMAGINATION pursued the main group from the inside, chased around the far turn, then edged show from outer rivals at the furlong grounds.
STINGY vied two wide, prompted down the backstretch, then between horses around the far turn, but yielded entering the lane. BLOWN COVER stalked
three deep, pressed the top pair around the far turn, but was outmoved by an outer bidder entering the lane and gave way. MR. FAVERSHAM was slow into
stride, trailed around both turns and never got involved. DR BAYTER tracked four wide but faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
LADY EMILY KATHRYN stalked along the inside and from the pocket, smoothly tipped to take aim outside of the top pair entering upper stretch, bid and
gained an advantage approaching the furlong grounds, then held from a late outer challenger. NOTINAMILLIONYEARS (IRE) settled well back two to three
wide, took the far turn in the four path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, rallied to bear down on the leader in the final sixteenth, but was
denied. BOSS LADY BAILEY pursued from midpack along the inside, vacated the rail turning for home, moved forward four wide and between horses in
midstretch and stayed on willingly. LAST CALL was taken back while keen early to trail the field entering the first turn, advanced inside of rivals approaching
the nine sixteenths pole, saved ground around the far turn, shifted three wide and between horses while gaining in midstretch, but needed more to offer a
bid. CATMINT leaned in and brushed a foe at the start, tracked three to four wide, entered the lane five wide, but got outkicked by an outer rival in upper
stretch and only produced a mild kick. HIGH STICK set a pressured pace along the inside, got headed entering the lane and yielded. IMPLOSION tugged a
bit keenly early on, tracked two wide and between horses, shifted four wide entering the lane and yielded. TEXAS SHUFFLE took light contact from an outer
rival at the start, prompted two wide and between horses, vied around the far turn, wrestled a narrow advantage entering the lane, but was outkicked by an
outer bidder nearing midstretch and weakened between horses. ZIPADOO laid off of the pace two wide, then between horses around the far turn, but was
put to tight quarters in the five path and between horses in midstretch and failed to menace. GET YOUR KICKS broke a beat slow and bumped with an
outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued two wide and between horses passing the nine sixteenths pole, fanned to the six path
entering lane and failed to factor. LUCKY ANA bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace three deep but faded between horses entering the
lane.

PURE PANIC brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked in the three path, slowly closed in on the tiring leader in midstretch, bid at the sixteenth pole
and drove clear. LUNAR MODULE tracked along the inside, chased in the three to four path around the turn, then ran on willingly to reach place at the wire.
DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN showed the way in the two path, built a clear margin entering the turn, held sway while beginning to tire entering the final
furlong, but was collared at the sixteenth pole, yielded and got nailed at the wire for place. GUNNER BAY tracked from the four path, got floated to the five
path entering the lane and yielded hanging on his left lead. MAC DADDY TOO prompted inside of the leader early on, but failed to sustain pressure and
chased that one into the turn, then gave way. SOLIDIFY brushed with an outer rival and dropped back at the start, trailed early on, improved in the three
path into the turn, fanned to the five path entering the lane and failed to menace. NAVY SOUL raced off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path

Footnotes
OHANA HONOR set a soft pace, drew off entering the lane and widened under a drive. FOREIGN RELATIONS pressed the eventual winner around all
turns, but failed to keep pace entering the lane and was second best. HE'S GOT SWAGGER tracked three wide early on before dropping back to saved
ground in midpack leaving the first turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and moved up to reach show at the wire. WIND TWIST tracked along the
inside, chased through the lane and got caught at the wire for show. BEUYS (IRE) pursued from the two path, came under a drive around the final turn and
lacked a bid. REGAL KINGDOM laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. FIRST STRIKE lacked speed along the inside, trailed and never got
involved. HIGH TIDE raced at the rear three wide, advanced into the final bend, but tired without reaching contention.
