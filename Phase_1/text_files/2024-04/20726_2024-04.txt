Footnotes
LIAM'S JOURNEY prompted the pace from the three path, vied around the far turn, cleared nearing the lane and held sway safely. GLENBROOK GERRY
transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, rallied on his left lead,
gained place changing leads at the sixteenth pole and held from an inner bidder while closing in on the leader. BRICKLAYER bumped with an inner rival at
the start before taking much firmer contact from that one soon after, laid off of the pace in the two path, rallied to bid for place while between horses entering
the final sixteenth but was denied. MONEYSHOT broke out and bumped a rival sparking a chain-reaction of trouble for outer rivals, showed the way inside
of the eventual winner, sparred with that one around the far turn, but proved no match entering the lane and weakened. COASTING BY bumped with an
outer rival before being jostled between horses at the start, lagged behind the rest down the backstretch and made little impact. PRIORITY LANE stalked
outside of the top pair and from the four path, but faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
ULTIMA GRACE sparred for the lead with an outer rival around the turn, disposed of that one while well in hand in upper stretch, drew clear and held sway
confidently. KISS CAM chased along the inside, gained place nearing the furlong grounds and was second best. BAYTOWN SHINJUKU raced off of the
pace in the two path and moved up to edge show entering the final sixteenth. CALCETINES broke a step slow and dropped back at the start, lagged behind
around the turn then surpassed a tired rival. HAVEN'T A RED CENT dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but weakened in upper stretch and
caved while hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
SABRINA laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, tipped to the six path to progress between horses in midstretch, bid
entering the final sixteenth and drove clear. BABY SASSICAIA pursued off of the pace in the four path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, sustained
slow progress in upper stretch before being floated to the seven path and outkicked by an inner rival in midstretch, then kept on to edge place late. UP THE
CREEK got briefly keen as an inner rival shifted across his path leaving the chute, tugged forward to track the top flight from the two path, pulled between
horses and steadied under restraint at the half mile pole, settled into stride around the turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane to take aim on the top
pair, bid and forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and lost place late. GRAYTON prompted
the pace three to two wide, but was outkicked by outer rivals in upper stretch and kept on mildly to reclaim a minor share. CANDY LOVER set the pace
moving to the inside approaching the turn, but was headed by an outer bidder in midstretch and gave way. HEDGE THESE BETS broke slowly, trailed along
the inside and moved up between horses. STAGFLATION lacked speed in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane and failed to menace.
LIFE ADVICE tracked three wide and faded nearing the lane. EVERMORE hopped at the start, steadied behind rivals and got keen running through
kickback leaving the chute, raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses, entered the lane in the six path and failed to factor. BEAUTY OF
THE NILE laid close up along the inside, stalked around the turn, chased into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
OUR DREAM RYE'D tracked two to three wide, bid three deep with a half mile to go, led two wide around the far turn and drew clear nearing the lane.
CERTIFIED LOVERBOY pressed outside of the leader early on, bid along with an outer rival at the half mile pole, vied inside of that one around the far turn,
but proved no match nearing the lane and safely held place. SMILE MON shied and lost action inside of rivals early on, then steadied in tight rail quarters
into the first turn, shifted out to the four path around that bend, surpassed tiring rivals to gain show around the far turn and leveled off. WHAT'S UP DOC
trailed in the three path early on, then in the six path into the far turn and moved up. JOINT VENTURE backed off the top pair into the first turn to track along
the inside, then gave way behind a tiring rival around the far turn. POOL GUY laid off of the pace in the two to three path and faded in the four path around
the far turn. PRESIDER set the pace along the inside, but gave way to a pair of outer bidders approaching the far turn and weakened around that bend.

Footnotes
WAVES OF MISCHIEF stalked along the inside, awaited racing room traveling well in the pocket behind the leaders around the far turn, smoothly tipped two
wide entering upper stretch to bid outside of the leader, led into the final furlong, drove clear and held sway. DEEP SATIN laid off of the pace two to three
wide, fanned to the six path into the lane, rallied to gain place late and was kept at bay by the leader through the closing stages. BEYOND LUCKY bobbled
slightly at the start, moved forward early on to set the pace along the inside, but was collared by an outer bidder in upper stretch, gave way in the final
furlong yet held show. KIMBER SPICE tracked two wide and between horses, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and stayed on. CENTURIA (IRE)
laid off of the pace along the inside, took closer order before continuing to save ground in midpack around the far turn, sustained a rail chase to vie for minor
placings in the final furlong, but needed more. DON'T LOOK BACK laid off of the pace three wide, then moved up. FOR LOVE AND HONOR pursued from
the two path, then between horses approaching the far turn and failed to menace. FIGGY tracked in the four path, pursued within striking range entering the
lane, but was outkicked by an inner bidder in upper stretch and faded between horses. ALWAYS WANTING pressed the leader from the three path, but
faltered between horses in upper stretch. BLUE HAIRDO broke a step slow and trailed early on, took the far turn four wide and was outrun. FUN LOVING
broke a beat slow, steadied hard and altered course off an outer rival's heels while rank entering the first turn, pulled five wide to pursue from midpack down
the backstretch, but attempted to bolt wide while erratic turning for home, quickly faltered and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
UNLIMITEDPOTENTIAL set the pace inside of a prompting foe, shook free of that one around the far turn, dug in to meet an outer challenge entering the
lane, exchanged light contact with that one nearing the furlong grounds, then tenaciously clung to an advantage through the final furlong. REYNOLDS
CHANNEL tracked two wide, advanced inside of rivals turning for home before bidding outside of the leader entering the lane, exchanged light contact with
that one leaving upper stretch, sparred while at that one's throatlatch throughout the final furlong but was staved off. SECRET CRUSH stalked in the four
path, chased around the far turn, got outmoved by an inner rival nearing the lane, failed to keep pace with the top pair in upper stretch, dug in to resist an
outer challenge for show in the final sixteenth and held. SARDIS broke a step slow, lagged behind in the two to three path, shifted out to the five path in
upper stretch, stayed on to bid for show in the final furlong but hung late. CROSSING prompted outside of the eventual winner and from the three path,
chased that one around the far turn, then faded between horses nearing the lane. AXED AVENGER broke a beat slow and was brushed by an inner rival at
the start, tracked along the inside, but was done early and eased through the lane.

AWESOME TREAT tossed his head leaving the gates then took back from between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path and between
horses around the turn, fanned out to the six path entering the lane and rallied to reel in the leader in the final sixteenth. SHOOTOUTTHELIGHTS showed
the way along the inside, cleared an outer presser entering the lane, but drifted out in the final furlong, was caught by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth
and saved place at the wire. L J'S EMMA raced at the rear in the two path into the turn, shifted out to the five path entering the lane before moving to the
seven path for clear sailing nearing midstretch, quickened after changing to her right lead in the final furlong, offered a belated kick and missed reaching
place. YOUR SO SILLEA stalked along the inside, chased up the rail and needed more. DARING DO tracked three wide, pursued in the four path around
the turn, chased in the five path in upper stretch, but was outkicked for place at the sixteenth pole and lacked a bid between horses. MISS ARLINGTON
pressed two wide, but yielded entering the lane and gave way between horses. MARISSA'S LADY raced forwardly under constant urging in the three path
and between horses, pursued among foes through the lane and failed to menace. BENEDICT CANYON was reluctant to load, then bobbled at the start,
raced off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. JILL JITTERBUG retreated to race off of the pace four wide into the turn, floated to the seven path
entering the lane and was outrun.

Footnotes
THE DISTRACTOR brushed with an outer rival at the start, rushed forward to set the pace, took the bend in the three path and held well.
KNEEDEEPINSNOW stalked the leader from the four path, chased that one while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed over at the sixteenth
pole and was second best. ZIPPIN GIGI tracked along the inside, then chased the top pair home and safely held show. SECRET RULES saved ground off
of the pace, then narrowly prevailed in the photo for fourth. FITZPATRICK lacked speed along the inside, got a bit keen at the half mile pole, shifted to the
four path into the turn, improved between horses nearing the lane before tipping to the five path, failed to threaten thereafter and lost fourth at the wire.
BORN FLAWLESS bumped with an inner rival soon after the start, trailed in the two path and failed to factor. AWESOME AARON was bumped between
rivals and pinched back soon after the start, pursued off of the pace two wide and made little impact. VULCAN lacked speed in the four path and made little
impact. UNRAPTURED brushed with an inner rival before bumping an outer foe at the start, chased from midpack in the five path, floated to the seven path
entering upper stretch and tired.

NIKI NINE DOORS sped clear down the backstretch, widened entering the lane and held sway safely. LA SALVADORENA was bumped between horses
and steadied out of crowded quarters at the start, saved ground well back awaiting racing room behind foes around the turn, remained blocked until splitting
rivals at the three sixteenths pole, then offered a rail surge to gain place in the final sixteenth. SHORE WAR tracked along the inside, tipped two wide
turning for home, bid for place between horses at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked by an inner rival late. RILEY JEAN took contact from an inner foe at
the start, tracked three wide, bid for place along with an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, but got outkicked. VICKI ROSE stalked three to two wide, failed to
keep pace with the leader nearing upper stretch and yielded. MO LANTERN was fractious in the starting gate, was backed out for a veterinarian exam
before being cleared to go once more, was bumped between horses at the start, raced off of the pace four wide, floated to the six path entering the lane and
failed to threaten. MAMBO MASTER transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, shuffled to race well back two wide into the turn,
swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to menace. GAL CAPONE failed to factor three wide. BOUGIE NOT BASIC raced off of the pace
along the inside, vacated the rail entering the lane and made little impact. MOONLIT MISCHIEF raced forwardly along the inside, but faded entering the
lane. NOW HIRING showed little.
