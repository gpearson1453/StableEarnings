Footnotes
JOKEMEISTER sprinted to a clear early lead, widened the advantage on the turn and finished unchallenged as much the best. TRIGZ TOO stalked the
pace from four wide to be well placed turning for home, lacked a closing bid in the lane and kept-on evenly to just hold the place. MY MAN VITO chased
along the inside while under an early drive on the turn, cut the corner, closed mildly just missing the place and pulled up with an injury after the race and was
vanned off. POWERFUL MOON broke alertly, settled into a contending position from between rivals through the turn and faded in the stretch.

FRANKLY MY DEAR stalked the pace through the turn, rallied down the stretch and wore the pacesetter down inside the sixteenth pole to be going away at
the wire. SABELLE sped to the lead to open a clear advantage, responded when called upon in upper stretch, weaved her way down the lane and was
outkicked in deep stretch. LA REINA DEL NORTE tracked the leaders through the turn and finished evenly lacking a closing kick. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY
chased the pace to the top ofthe lane, made a mild bid in the lane and flattened out late. O K BABY was never a threat. ROSE RING trailed early, made a
mild rally on the turn and dropped back coming up empty.

GHOSTLY REVIVAL tracked the early pace, made an early three wide bid on the turn to quickly go clear midway on the bend and continued unthreatened
to the wire. SHAKA'S LYRIC reserved off the pace, saved ground while rallying up the fence turning for home and was along for the place with a mild rally.
UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN sped to the early lead, had no answer when engaged by the winner on the turn and kept-on evenly through the stretch to hold
the show. DEE'S KY WILDCAT trailed the filed to the quarter pole, angled eight wide at the top of the lane and passed tiring rivals down the stretch.
TITEBLUEJEANS showed early speed to prompt the pace and weakened coming home. HALO EFFECT contended through the turn and steadily faded
down the stretch.

COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY pressed the pace from two wide under mild urging, kept battling with the runner-up through the turn and down the stretch, digging
in the final yards to prevail at the wire. THEDAYOFTHEGREY set a pressured pace dueling from the inside throughout, gamely fought on down the lane and
just missed in a game effort. MANGA MAN unhurried early, rallied down the stretch between rivals to be up for the show. MISTER MOBIL trailed to the
quarter pole, swung eight wide turning for home and made a belated rally to be gaining late. THE PINK Z stalked the pace to be well placed on the turn in
striking distance and weakened in the lane. RUMBLE STRIP RON chased the leaders through the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
BOOGIE BOOGEE prompted the pace to the head of the lane, took command in upper stretch and pulled away convincingly. TWERK reserved off the early
pace, swung nine wide turning for home and closed well to gain the place. CAUSE OF LOVE tracked the leaders to the turn, made a threateneing bid
nearing the quarter pole and kept-on in the lane unable to gain on the winner. OUT FOR FUN bumped by the his inside rival leaving the gate to drop back
well off the pack and gained ground steadily showing good late interest. RAINBOW SHIP showed speed to lead to the quarter pole and weakened coming
home. JETTIN PEGASUS stalked the leaders to midway on the turn and faded down the lane. SOLE FACTOR was not a factor.

C V DYNAMIC raced near the pace along the fence in the first turn, steadied when in tight quarters, dropped back to settle into a stalking position, cut the
corner turning for home to quickly take command and drew away down the stretch. KENNEDY'S CAMELOT set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, was
no match for the winner and finihsed willingly to be second best. INDY CARR prompted the pace to the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane finishing
evenly. CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS tracked the leaders through the final turn and lacked a closing response. NO MAS CERVEZA went one-paced never
posing a threat. MUSIC GEM trailed as a non-factor.

MAY MAYHEM pressed the pace from three wide through the turn, overtook the pacesetter turning for home to be engaged by the ground saving runner-up,
dueled with that one through the lane and prevailed in a determined drive. KELLEHER stalked the pace through the turn, cut the corner to take the lead in
upper stretch, battled down the lane and was outgamed in the final yards to be second best. LIVING THE DREAM unhurried early to be near the rear of the
field and made a steady advance through the field from midway on the turn to be along for the show. COUNTEVERYBLESSING tracked the leaders from
four wide and failed to mount a clsoing rally. SOL OF VAQUERO trailed to the top of the lane and passed weakened foes. REDDEN set a pressured pace to
the top of the lane and weakened through the drive. HAPPY TAKEOVER raced without impact.

for home and rallied mildly. KERRI'S MIRACLE pressed the pace to the turn, took the lead on the bend and weakened late in the drive. KISS VALENTINA
