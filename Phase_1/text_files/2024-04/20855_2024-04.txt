Footnotes
ALCAZABA (IRE) bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path
and battled to the wire to get up for the win. IM STILL BRAVE bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, tracked the leader from the rail through the
opening quarter of a mile, challenged while saving ground around the bend, and dueled in the lane to just miss. KID EMERALD raced off the pace on the
inside early, came around the turn in the five path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. NANGA PARBAT (GB) bumped with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
chased on to the finish. VENEZUELAN FEELING raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path
and finished evenly. SWIFT DANCER hit the gate leaving it, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path
and weakened in the lane. ART HANDLER bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, dueled on the rail through the opening stages, continued
around the turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. NOMAR'S HOPE raced off the pace up the backstretch, swung out to the six path coming around
the bend and made no bid. RED'S MR Z bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
two path and was not a factor.

Footnotes
UNXPECTED TIGER saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming
around the far turn and kicked clear in the stretch. AMBUSHED raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn
still in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. SIDNEY'S BID bobbled slightly leaving the gate, saved ground early,
tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the two path and chased on from there. POSEIDONS MYTH raced in
the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack, began a bid from the five path coming around the far turn and
improved position in the lane. SIR DANIEL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, swung out to the five
path coming around the far bend and was outkicked in the stretch. CODE ENFORCER saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside for the run up
the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and showed no kick. RANSEUR raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way
on the inside up the backstretch, battled while saving ground around the far turn and gave way in the final furlong. SKY TRAVELER raced in the middle of
the pack in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four and five path and faded in the lane. UNIQUE
PATH raced in the two path around the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the four path and
tired in the stretch. DIAL HIM UP was pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the
far turn still in the two path and was never a factor.
