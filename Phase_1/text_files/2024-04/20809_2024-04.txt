Footnotes
SURFACE TO AIR broke a step slow, moved forward after shifting out to the four path around the first turn, made an early challenge for the lead with nine
sixteenths to go, sparred two wide around the far turn, led into the lane and drew off at the furlong grounds. UNCLE TUFFY was off a beat slow, raced at the
rear getting floated from the three path to the five path around the first turn, followed inner rival's progress to track the top pair with nine sixteenths to go,
chased them under urging in the three path around the far turn, then stayed on to reel in a tiring rival for place at the wire. TRUE FAITH led in the two path
around the first turn, dueled with an outer rival around the far turn, yielded to that one at the furlong pole and lost place at the wire. BOAT HOUSE tracked
along the inside and faded around the far turn. CAN'T YOU SEE stalked in the three path, yielded position to outer rivals with nine sixteenths to go and
faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
INTO DIAMONDS tracked in the three to four path, rallied to range up to the leader at the sixteenth pole and edged past. CHEVAL DE GUERRE showed
the way in the two path, scooted clear entering the lane, held sway through midstretch but was collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and was
bested grudgingly. BRIGHT SKITTLE leaned into an outer rival at the start, raced well back in the two path, moved out to the four to five path entering the
lane and rallied to reach show in the closing stages. MONTEREY BAY raced off of the pace in the three path into the turn, shifted to the five path entering
the lane, leaned inwardly while chasing in upper stretch, forged show leaving the sixteenth pole but was caught by an outer bidder late. MADROC stalked in
the four to three path around the turn, got outkicked by an outer rival while chasing on his left lead in upper stretch, then yielded show to an outer pair in the
late stages. CHADO was hustled to prompt inside of the pace setter early on, eased back to pursue passing the seven sixteenths pole, chased around the
turn and gave way. BAYTOWN BARACUS pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted from the four to six path in upper stretch and failed to menace.
MALEVAJE was antsy loading, urged along off of the pace along the inside and saved ground to no avail. THE TONER raced forwardly in the three to two
path and between horses, then weakened through the lane. AMERICAN CITY was bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three path,
shifted in entering the lane and never got involved. RAVENSHIRE was outrun along the inside. BAYTOWN BUMP broke outwardly, was urged well back in
the four path around the turn, drifted inwardly entering the lane and was eased thereafter.

SUGOI stalked in the two path before moving outside of the leader around the first turn, applied pressure with eleven sixteenths to go, vied around the far
turn, led narrowly as an outer foe offered a menacing bid entering the lane, dueled whlie headed by that one entering the final furlong, yet gamely fought
back to regain an advantage in the closing stages. ACCIDENTAL HERO tracked along the inside, bid outside of the top pair entering the lane, forged a
narrow advantage in midstretch, but failed to kick on and was repelled by an inner rival in the late stages. TIWANAKU broke outwardly, showed the way in
the two path, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, but got headed by that one and a wider bidder entering the lane and yielded. KEROUAC bobbled at
the start, pursued from the three to four path, tracked before chasing in the three path around the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
BERLAINE trailed along the inside, paused behind traffic turning for home, tipped to the five to six path to split foes entering the lane, rallied to drive past the
leaders at the furlong grounds and drew clear. SMART WITH HEART broke outwardly, stalked four deep into the turn, bid outside of the top pair and in the
four path turning for home, vied into the lane and through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, then held place.
LITTLE SASS bumped an inner rival at the start, led narrowly from a pair of outer vying foes into the turn, clung to an advantage while vying into the lane,
but was outkicked by a wide bidder in midstretch, fought on to battle for place thereafter, but was denied and saved show. XTRASAUCEWELLDONE took
contact from an outer rival leaving the gates, tracked two wide and between horses, got keen among foes moving to the turn, shifted out to the four to five
path behind traffic while getting outkicked by an outer rival leaving the quarter pole, then kept on mildly to miss show. FROSTED DIAMOND vied two wide
and between horses, but yielded through the final furlong. RIVIERE broke inwardly, chased along the inside, entered the lane in the two path, subtly lacked
racing room passing the furlong grounds and lacked a bid. VERY WEALTHY hopped when the gates sprung and broke slow, pursued from off of the pace
three wide, got floated to the seven path entering the lane and gave way. ONE STORMY LADY broke a touch outwardly, vied three deep, but faded in the
four path and between horses leaving the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE JUAN tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, encountered traffic in the three path among foes in upper stretch, tipped out for
clear sailing four wide entering midstretch, rallied to range up to the leaders in the final sixteenth and edged past late. BETTER BET pursued from midpack
along the inside, came under coaxing with three furlongs to, sustained stride to split foes two wide in midstretch, rallied to offer a bid along with an outer foe
in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked and forged place. TRULY QUALITY stalked two wide, vied in hand around the final turn, gained an advantage in
upper stretch, drew clear at the furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer pair of bidders in the final sixteenth. IRONSIDES stalked along the inside, got
briefly keen with nine furlongs to go, loomed a danger from the pocket just off the rail around the final turn, tipped three wide to take aim outside of the
leading pair entering the lane, but only managed to chase in upper stretch and got outkicked for place by bidders on either side in the final furlong. CYBER
NINJA laid off of the pace two to three wide, spun to the four path entering the lane before floating wider in upper stretch, yet kept on willingly to move up
late. SGT. PEPPER pursued from midpack three wide, tracked before chasing within striking range around the final turn, but was floated four wide entering
the lane, outkicked and floated again by inner foes nearing midstretch then kept on mildly between horses. GOOD MEDICINE set the pace, vied with an
outer rival around the final turn, got headed in upper stretch and gave way. MIRACLE ON ICE broke slowly, raced at the rear two wide, fanned from the
three path to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor. BREES laid off of the pace along the inside, moved between horses down the backstretch,
then lacked a response to urging around the far turn. MARQUET MALICE broke a step slow and steadied back at the start, then saved ground at the rear to
no avail.

Footnotes
BEAUMONT RED showed the way, got headed by an outer rival while inside of a pair of foes at the three furlong pole, fought back to reclaim an advantage
turning for home, then drew off entering the lane. JR'S GIFT raced off of the pace along the inside, rallied four wide in upper stretch to gain place at the
furlong grounds, and was second best. YORK TAVERN stalked along the inside, chased in the two to three path around the far turn, got outkicked by an
inner rival floating five wide in upper stretch, then surpassed tired rivals late. BROWN LIQUOR MAN tracked in the two path, moved to press the top pair in
the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch and tired. MAXIMUM CAPACITY stalked outside of the leader, applied
pressure before forging a narrow advantage with three furlongs to go, vied between horses turning for home but faded entering upper stretch. NEWHART
trailed early on, lagged behind down the backstretch and never got involved. DR KRINGLE settled off of the pace three wide, tracked four deep into the far
turn, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
BOURBON HEIST tracked in the four path, loomed a danger in hand outside of the top pair entering the lane, pursued the clear leader in upper stretch,
drove past that one at the furlong grounds and drew clear. EYE WITNESS brushed an outer foe leaving the gates, showed the way in the two path, scooted
clear entering upper stretch, but was caught by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and was second best. CONDEMN took light contact from an inner
rival at the start, stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, came under urging between horses around the turn, yielded to the top pair in upper
stretch and held show. WARRIOR JOHNY pursued two wide, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace. EYEING CLOVER tracked
along the inside, but chased entering the lane and faded.

prevailed in a tight photo. ROYAL WINTOUR pursued from midpack in the two path, then four wide around the far turn, rallied to offer a late bid but missed.
HELLO HOLLYWOOD prompted two wide, sustained his chase to vie for the lead into the final sixteenth, but got outkicked by an outer bidding pair late.
SASSY PRINCESS set the pace along the inside, held sway from an outer presser through midstretch, but was collared by that one at the sixteenth pole,
and bested by wider rivals late. JANEY CREED raced at the rear along the inside, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and offered a belated kick for a
minor share. RAINING SUGAR stalked along the inside, chased through the lane and lacked a bid. SACRED IMAGE saved ground off of the pace but to no
avail. TARNEEMA raced at the rear two wide, swung to the seven path into upper stretch and failed to factor. MIDSUMMER MARCH stalked three deep,
chased around the far turn, then faded between horses entering the lane.
