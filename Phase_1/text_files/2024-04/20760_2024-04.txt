Footnotes
DOUGHTY away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, continued to alternate up front into the stretch, edged away inside the furlong marker,
enough left to last. SASSY LASS stalked the dueling leaders from the three path, continued to maintain contact with that pair through the turn, set down for
the drive, late surge to be quickly closing the gap on the winner late to narrowly miss. KITIARA dueled up front along the inside, continued on equal terms
with the winner through upper stretch and past the furlong marker, first to blink with just over a sixteenth remaining, comfortably saved the show. GOLD
STRATEGY ducked in, rank at the start to spot the field several lengths, moved out, three to four wide turn, improved position a bit while not a threat to the
top three. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. PREDICTING broke out to be away slowly, dropped inside,
moved off the inside around a rival midway on the turn, had little more for the drive. COROMANDEL moved inside early in the turn, tired.

Footnotes
POLTERER prompted the pace while three wide, fell back a bit the second quarter, advanced three wide and took over late in the final turn, clear into the
lane, continued to steadily increase that advantage while being kept to task with a right handed crop. FIGHTERTOWN showed the way into and through the
first turn in the two path, showed the way early backstretch, relinquished the advantage far turn, came back and put that rival away as the winner was
moving to challenge, no match for that one, clearly second best. MAN ON THE MOON lacked early foot off the inside, two to three path in the second turn,
lacked a closing punch to pose no threat to the top pair, narrowly finished best of the rest. NEPAL UP last to leave, trailed early while saving ground,
continued along the inside second turn, came in the two path around a tiring rival into the lane, improved to be gaining for the show late. W W CRAZY four
wide into the first turn, three to four wide turning into the stretch, lacked a closing punch. COOL MEMORY ducked out bit broke alertly, raced forwardly and
outside, began to weaken late in the final turn. R DOC raced inside, moved up and challenged inside the runner up just after a half, led far turn, was giving
way when steadied in tight late in the second turn, continued to weaken to the wire. GOLDEN BANDIT four wide in the first turn, continued out in the strip to
be four wide far turn, stopped soon after, distanced after losing contact with the field through the stretch.

Footnotes
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER moved up to take control soon after the start,shrugged off nearest pursuer by late in the turn, drew away through the final furlong
under pressure. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN back off the pace, advanced to chase the winner into the stretch, could do little with that one in the run to the
wire, clearly second best. DIXIE GIRL TO lacked speed, angled out to be four wide into the stretch, rallied widest to be in time for the show, not a threat to
the top two. PAT'S GAL brushed at the start, mid pack just off the inside for a half, dropped to the rail turning for home, improved a bit, not enough for the
show. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE fell back to trail after the start, began advance while along the rail midway on the turn, shifted out a bit in upper stretch,
improved position, flattened out a bit the final furlong. NATURAL TOUCH raced in mid pack and three wide, failed to muster a response in the drive. LITTLE
BURRITO squeezed at the break to be away slowly, failed to menace while racing three wide. NGALA brushed at the start, second flight off rail, got out a bit
to be four wide into the lane, gave way. CLASSY EDGE pressed the winner in the three path for just under a half and gave way.

Footnotes
SIR OTTO never far back off the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide and between horses turning for home, gained the advantage and outkicked the
runner up late in a determined effort. J J'S RANGER in the second flight outside the winner, moved with that one and challenged four wide into the stretch,
outkicked by the winner the final furlong, narrowly held sway for the place. CATALINA CRUSH off a step slow, raced back early inside, swung out four wide
turning for home when beginning to advance late in the turn, angled in steadily through the lane to continue willingly to the end, narrowly missed the place.
ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT lacked speed, a bit rank in some traffic early in the turn, angled five wide late in the turn, improved position with some late interest.
VERACRUZIN off a step slow, raced in mid pack in the three path, improved inside of horses with a mild advance upper stretch then flattened out a bit late.
KENNEL CLUB off slow, fell back to trail, four wide into the lane, found best stride too late. MAX'S MAP in mid pack while racing off the inside, three wide
into the stretch, lacked a closing punch. LET'S GO CHAMP sprinted clear soon after the start, dropped inside turn, faltered when headed entering the
stretch. GUATAPE off a step slow, remained always back while five wide out of the turn. EXECUTIVE POWER chased the leader for a half off the inside,
challenged briefly between horses late in the turn and gave way. SKY MASTER forwardly placed early inside, steady retreat rail.

Footnotes
EMPIRE'S BEST took control from the outside before a half, rated into and through the second turn toward the inside, remained clear through the stretch
under steady handling. PARISIAN PROMISE bumped, in tight start to be away slowly, raced back toward the inside, steered out three wide late in the final
turn, roused for the drive, finished with good late energy to be up for the place while getting to the winner. PHENOMENAL DREAM broke out, brushed,
raced toward the back of the main pack, three wide second turn, rallied mildly upper stretch to reach closest to the winner a furlong out, could do little more
with that one late, nailed for the place. REBELIOUS off slow and was pinched, raced back off the inside, three wide through the second turn, displayed
some mild late interest while not a threat to the top three. STRASSE carried out five wide into the first turn, raced within striking distance while three wide
the middle half mile, lacked a closing punch in the drive. DIOMEDES pinched at the start to be off slow, trailed well back, 4w into the lane, passed mostly
tiring rivals to improve position. DIRBAS broke in, raced in mid pack while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive. FAMOUS FINAL SCENE in mid
pack while inside, saved ground to no avail. TRABR'S CREED got out to be four wide into the first turn, angled in, chased the next four furlongs and caved.
TAP VALLEY broke sharp, showed the way early inside, relinquished the advantage to the winner before a half, briefly chased that one, stopped far turn,
jogged in far back.

BACKSIDE BUZZ broke on top, cleared to the inside to set the pace, headed into the stretch from the outside, battled back in game fashion to prove best.
CREW DRAGON forwardly placed while racing three wide, continued in a forward position into the lane, failed to muster any late gain on the winner while
holding sway for the place. RITHM NIC in the second flight while four wide backstretch, middle move to challenge three wide turn, gained a brief lead
between calls upper stretch, hung the final furlong to lose the place. LIFE IS HARD asked a bit to vie up front early along the inside, fell back late
backstretch and into the turn, moved out a bit to be in the two path into the stretch, went evenly late. SHUFFLE DANCE chased the winner off the inside
early, began a gradual fade in the turn and continued to weaken through the stretch. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR failed to menace while racing three to four
wide. SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL slipped a bit to be last away, raced back and just off the inside, improved slightly two path into the lane, faltered the final
furlong to trail in.

Footnotes
FLASHY DANCER off slow, lagged well back for six furlongs, angled out four wide turning for home when beginning to rally, closed with a flourish to kick
down the leader in the waning strides. MISS ROCKETTE away in good order, settled just off the leader in hand, remained under restraint into the far turn,
moved on the leader at will to take over late in the final turn, clear into the stretch, roused with a left handed crop, remained clear past the furlong marker but
was no match for the winner late, clearly second best. DEFINING JOY lacked early foot, raced in the two path through the second turn, staged a mild rally to
annex the show, not a threat to the top pair. GOURMET broke on top, showed the way just off the inside early, firmly in hand when showing the way up the
backstretch, offered but brief resistance to the winner midway on the second turn and began to weaken. AMY Z within striking distance while racing three
wide, came up empty for the drive. LOOKING FOR GINNY remained back in failing to menace while along the inside. SCENIC BEAUTY forwardly placed
early just off the inside, dropped to the inside second turn and faded. CATALYST was finished after a half.

Footnotes
MIGHTY MESSAGE prompted the leader from the outside, hooked up with that one for a spirited stretch battle along with another rival while between that
pair, dug in late to prevail in a game effort. PAPPY'S REVENGE got clear into the first turn, showed the way while pressured up the backstretch while rating,
responded when confronted by a pair of rivals in the second turn, vied past the furlong marker closest to the inside of the lead flight, held on stubbornly to
narrowly miss. GIVE ME A REASON within striking distance, moved closer in the three path into the far turn, challenged on the outside entering the stretch,
raced on equal terms wit the top pair past midstretch, outkicked late, remained clear of the others. DIMATIC was racing in mid pack when steadied between
horses late in the first turn, remained back, checked up when in tight early in the far turn, fell back, was advancing when forced to steady yet again, with a
quarter mile remaining, then staged a mild rally when finally clear. AWESOME RUTA went one paced while racing in the two path throughout. GOLDEN
PLATE within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, came up empty for the drive. CHAPERONE remained back win
failing to menace while racing three wide. ETHAN ENERGY off a step slow, four wide in the first turn, began to tired while four wide again into the second
bend. CALL THE CAVALRY off a step slow, raced off the pace inside, tired.

Footnotes
INFORMED PATRIOT away in good order, prompted the leader from the outside, continued to apply pressure up the backstretch and into the far turn,
moved to challenged, dueled through the rest of the second bend, shook clear when straightened for home, enough left to last. IMPERIAL GUN forwardly
placed along the inside into the first turn, a bit keen midway on that bend, settled in the run up the backstretch while remaining inside, behind traffic turning
into the stretch, roused, shifted out past the furlong marker, was coming late to be steadily closing the gap on the winner. GOULD'S GOLD in hand and
three wide behind the pace, remained in the second flight into and through the final bend, three wide again into the lane run outside to be in time for the
show, not a threat to the top two. MAXIMUS MAGIC broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, rated up the backstretch, offered some resistance to the
winner when that one challenged second turn then began to falter. BRILLIANT MAN last away, raced back along the inside, improved a bit inside of a
couple of rivals in the two path entering the stretch, flattened out in the late going. COUNT DRACULA lacked speed while racing outside, failed to rally.
MILITANT broke back, moved up to race in the second flight, four to five wide turning for home, faded in the run down the lane.

WINNABLE back off the pace while four wide through the first turn, moved closer after a half, crept closer still to challenge three wide late in the second
bend, long drive, wore down rival under firm handling. NEOM BEACH broke well, set the pace inside, shrugged off nearest rival turning for home as the
winner was moving to challenge, continued to hold the advantage past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly. TX WOMEN FOR ARTS in the second
flight while racing three wide, shuffled back steadily in traffic second turn, slight bother late in the final bend, set down when clear for the drive, finished
willingly to be up late for the show while between horses. I'M A MESS last away, trailed early, raced four wide through the second turn, staged a belated
rally while widest to improve position late. XTREME SMOKE SHOW settled in mid pack while three wide in the first turn, angled out four wide turning for
home, went flat late. BLUE SQUALL forwardly placed inside, continued to save some ground second turn, traffic behind the leaders, lacked a late punch.
MERASOL SUGAR pressed the leader to that one's outside for six furlongs, faltered in the drive. MIDSHIPMAN'S DANCE off the pace while racing inside,
was finished after a half. ORGINIAL ORDER OF FINISH CONFIRMED BY VIDEO REPLAY DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH OPERATOR ERROR. UPON
FURTHER REVIEW ON APRIL 21, 2024, XTREME SMOKE SHOW'S NARROW FINISH MARGIN OVER BLUE SQUALL FOR FIFTH WAS CHANGED TO
A DEAD HEAT BETWEEN THOSE TWO FOR THAT POSITION.

Footnotes
SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING closest to the leader while outside following a solid break, continued to prompt that one up the backstretch, engaged that same
rival midway on the final turn, quickly clear into the lane, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handlinbg. HIGHLAND FALLS settled along the inside,
steered out three wide when mounting an advance late in the final turn, finished willingly to be well clear of the rest, no real threat to the winner. RED
ROUTE ONE void of early foot inside, continued to save ground second turn, steered out in the two path around a tiring rival, rallied up the inside through
the stretch to annex the show, no match for the top pair. REINCARNATE settled off the pace and the inside, raced three to four wide out of the final turn,
lacked a serious closing response. MAGIC TAP in mid pack while racing toward the inside, moved a bit closer while steering three wide into the lane,
encountered traffic past the furlong marker, finished up evenly when clear. LAST SAMURAI broke back, lacked speed, four wide when showing some mild
interest into the lane, continued mildly to the end to improve position. OCTANE forwardly placed along the inside, continued with contact of the leaders far
turn, had little left for the drive. COUNTY FINAL broke alertly, set the early pace while along the inside, weakened when headed by the winner in the second
turn. INSTANT COFFEE in mid pack and outside, four to three wide in the second turn, faded in the drive. GUNTOWN finished early while racing three
down to four wide, no threat.. DOUBLE CROWN broke back, moved closer along the inside, gave way after five furlongs.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD QUEEN behind the pace toward the inside, waited in traffic late in the turn, steered out three wide for room entering the stretch, responded
with good energy when clear for the drive, won going away. QUEEN MALLARD broke on top, vied up front along the inside, shook clear into the stretch,
remained clear until late, proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place. MY JULIA behind the pace while three wide early, floated out five wide
turning for home when making a mild advance, ran on to be clear for the show. ALOHA BABY bothered to be off slowly, raced back and off the inside,
fanned six wide into the lane, improved position. LINNIE MAE in mid pack off the rail, continued one paced in the two path to lack a closing kick. THIS
DAMSEL MAYFLY in the main group outside, three to four wide through the turn, lacked a serious closing response. Q'S YOUR MAMA vied up front
between rivals and outside the runner up, began to weaken turning for home. ARR PIRATETREASURE void of speed, raced in the two path turn, passed
tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. PRESLEYS TURN failed to menace while racing two to three wide. QUEEN WILHELMINA off a step slow, was
outrun while racing four wide. INDIAN SPIRIT bumped at the start, quickly recovered to contest the pace three wide, gave way late in the turn. SPARKLY
steadily faded inside.
