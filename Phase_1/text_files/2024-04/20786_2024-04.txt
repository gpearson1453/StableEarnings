Footnotes
KISS OF SPICE was hard to load, urged from the break, stalked the leading pair about five wide into the turn, floated seven wide leaving the turn beginning
an advance, bid about the three-sixteenths, lugged in a bit soon after, edged clear late. MY BELLA FOR LISA quickly made the early lead, set the tempo
facing pressure while kept in about the three path, was headed at the three-eighths, dueled soon after, drifted five wide turning into upper stretch, kept on
but was outkicked by the winner. DIAMOND DEE switched out passing the half, raced outside a foe about three deep into the turn at the rear, swung eight
wide for the drive, ran on for show. LADY QUICKSAND pressed the early pace, put a short head in front nearing the three-eighths, lost the lead past the
five-sixteenths, floated six wide into upper stretch and weakened. AWARENESS AUTISM chased from near the rail, was not a threat.

Footnotes
LUCKY SMILE pressed from inside, bid at the five-sixteenths taking a narrow lead, drifted five wide leaving the turn, continued to drift out but drew clear and
held sway under steady handling. ASANO'S BACK broke just a step slowly brushing the gate and was urged but lacking speed racing off the inside, came
into upper stretch four deep, kept on well to be second best. BEST CHOICE BABY pressed from outside, bid past the five-sixteenths, floated six wide into
upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. FIGHT ME settled at the rear, shifted in to save ground on the turn, went evenly. BOOMER JUSTICE tracked the
leading trio near but off the rail, came to the top of the stretch three wide, kept on evenly. DAD BOD set the early tempo from between runners, weakened.

STEIN'S GIRL broke just a half step slowly, dropped back off rivals moving in from five to four wide on the first turn, settled up the backstretch, went three to
four deep on the far turn swinging out eleven wide by upper stretch, ground on steadily to get up in the final strides. CLUBHOUSE SAINT shifted in entering
the first turn to track in behind in the two to three path, advanced inside foes late up the backstretch, continued to advance on the far turn, floated eight wide
coming out of that bend making a bid at the top of the stretch, dueled a rival into submission and led late but was just nailed. LUCY L stalked the pace five
wide in the early going, advanced on the far turn, floated nine wide turning for home making a mild bid in upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up, yielded
grudgingly late. IN THE RED set the pace while kept well off the inside, weakened. GUARDING ELK CAMP was caught six wide through the first turn racing
off the pace, shifted in and saved ground on the far turn but failed to rally. TRULY A MESS chased four wide early, dropped back while shifting in a bit,
faded.

LOVELY LOLA settled tracking from inside just off the fence, came out a bit for the drive, bid inside foes taking a narrow lead, held. TROUBLE N
PARADISE broke in the air, settled off the leaders outside, moved out from four to six wide early on the turn, fanned eleven deep into the stretch, was
gaining steadily but missed. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE set the pace from off the inside racing in the three path into the turn, drifted eight wide into upper
stretch, kept on but was outkicked. TIGER QUEEN stalked from just off the pace four to five wide, fanned ten deep, was in contention in upper stretch but
lacked the needed late kick. BIG MAMA THORNTON stalked four wide, shifted nine wide in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. MY CRAFTY GAL
moved out off the inside chasing in behind about three deep into the turn, came out further for the drive, was never near enough to threaten.

LEMON DROP LADY tracked from inside saving ground on the first turn, moved out two wide advancing in behind runners on the far turn, moved out further
bidding inside foes at the top of the stretch, drifted out late, held. FINNLEY'S KITTEN tucked in settling at the rear, saved ground to the quarter pole, moved
out past that point shifting five deep, gained steadily in the stretch but missed. HIGH FASHION LADY settled two wide off the leaders, moved out three then
four wide commencing an advance on the far turn, bid at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. SEE YOU AT THE TOP stalked two to three
wide outside a foe through the first turn, was guided out four deep up the backstretch, fanned out further for the drive but could not keep pace and
weakened in the stretch. MICKEY DOBBS pressed three wide in the early going, weakened. PONDERED set the pace inside, appeared to take an awkward
step while weakening past the quarter pole, tired.

Footnotes
COASTAL FOG set the pace inside a pressing foe but well off the rail, moved out further from four to the five path late on the turn still dueling inside a foe,
was engaged by an inside rival in upper stretch, dueled with that one to the wire and dug in under stout urging to get the nod. YANKEE HUMOR steadied on
heels slightly in the early going, saved ground on the turn advancing on the rail, drifted three wide leaving that bend and commencing a bid inside foes,
dueled to the wire but lost the nod. GENERAL CROOK broke outwardly, pressed then dueled outside the eventual winner, was carried from five to six wide
by that foe late on the turn, was outkicked. SOUTH COAST ROUTE tracked in behind the leaders off the fence, raced two to four wide throughout, went
evenly in the stretch. HALF THROTTLE stalked from between the second flight, moved out from four to seven wide on the turn, ran on evenly in the lane.
CONRAD THE RED stalked from outside, went five to eight wide, ran on evenly. FACT OR FICTION raced near but off the rail, cut the corner into upper
stretch, went evenly. PLEASE NOTE THAT YANKEE HUMOR RAN WITHOUT FRONT SHOES.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE LOVE settled off the leaders, advanced outside on the turn coming to the top of the stretch nine wide, bid a sixteenth out, surged past a rival late.
MORE HONOR tossed the head at the start, stalked from between runners early, switched out on the turn, advanced seven wide coming into upper stretch,
bid a sixteenth out but was outfinished. ESTEEMED was reluctant to load, settled at the back, advanced three wide on the turn, altered inside foes at the top
of the stretch, bid inside near the furlong grounds but was outkicked. ABRAAJ MIRAGE stalked from outside, bid four wide three furlongs out, contended
while drifting six deep turning for home, needed more late. BUENISIMO settled outside a foe off the leaders, shifted out four wide past the quarter pole, kept
on in the stretch. HUNTER JUMPER chased in behind about three wide moving out five deep past the quarter pole, was in contention in upper to
mid-stretch but needed more late. LIMITED OFFER chased in behind, bid inside at the three-eighths, weakened in the stretch. CHAMPS SUCCESS was
reluctant to load, went sideways as the gates opened with the assistant starter still having a hold of the horse, settled into stride, advanced outside moving
eight wide past the quarter pole, ran on. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was not a factor. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE chased outside four wide, fanned ten wide
turning for home, faded. BLUE GESSAMI was never a threat racing near but off the inside. CAJUN FIRE hopped at the start but was nevertheless quick into
stride, set the pace from just off the rail, came up empty. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED CHAMPS SUCCESS
RECEIVED AN UNFAIR BEGINNING AND WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
