Footnotes
COALMINER'S KITTEN settled in hand early to be well off the pace, was angled out to the clear down the backside, rallied six wide on the turn to engage
the leader in upper stretch and pulled away as much best down the lane. COUNTRY GUY stalked the pace from the fence through the turn saving ground,
cut the corner at the head of the lane and finished willingly along the rail to be up for the place. SLAVA UKRAINI set a well rated pace on a measured lead,
responded when called upon turning for home to hold the lead to mid-stretch and weakened late in the drive. DESERT HIGHWAY reserved off the pace in
mid-pack through the turn, angled out in upper stretch, was carried further out down the lane by a tiring rival and showed some late interest. OVER
CALENDARED prompted the pace to the top of the stretch and tired in the lane. ON K P well placed tracking the leaders into the turn, rallied three wide to
threaten at the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane drifting out while coming home. JIM'S RIVER RUNNER was never a factor.

Footnotes
BOYCE'S BANDITA tracked the leaders from the inside through the turn, angled five wide at the top of the lane and closed well to be up in time. PEGGY'S
WAY pressed the pace into the turn, dropped off the pace on the bend, came on again from three wide down the lane to take command in the final sixteenth
and was outkicked by the late charging winner. MAGGIE E set the pace under early pressure, took a clear lead on the turn, widened in upper stretch and
weakened late in the lane. TRIBEST (ARG) reserved off the pace through the turn while saving ground and made a mild bid down the lane. IMAGE OF
CURLIN broke awkwardly when off balance at the start, trailed the field to upper stretch and passed tiring rivals in the lane. TU ROYAL was well placed into
the turn and faded coming home lacking a response when called upon in the turn. GRACEFUL SCARLETT was not a threat.

JOCELYN stalked the pacesetter through the far turn, tipped out on the bend to commence a steady advance, ran down the leader in mid-stretch and drew
away down the lane. ANNA AFTER MIDNITE set the pace on a clear lead through the first turn, was throttled down on the backside, re-opened the
advantage into the far turn, was clear in mid-stretch but could not hold on. ALTAR GIRL reserved off the pace to the far turn and rallied mildly to be along for
the show. GOOD MAGIC WOMAN went one-paced without impact. MULSANNE (IRE) was never a threat. HOLY STAR contended for the first half mile and
gradually gave way.

Footnotes
DEVIL tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied four wide turning for home and drew clear in the lane convincingly. LIONS LAW set a well rated pace on
a clear lead and kept on through the lane for the place while being out-finished by the winner. JOYZELLA reserved off the pace to the top of the lane,
angled well wide and finiahed with good late interest. I DID THE MATH taken in hand early, angled to the rail down the backstretch and made a mild bid
down the stretch. THE LAST THRILL well placed off the pace from the inside through the turn and lacked a closing bid. CHERYL'S APPEAL stalked the
pace into the turn, made a threateneing bid on the bend and flattened out coming home. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY was not a threat. COLLIE WRAYS KITTY
broke awkwardly to be the distant trailer and was never a factor from there.

Footnotes
BROKEN HEARTS BAY prompted the pace from the inside into the turn, rated patiently on the bend, cut the corner turning for home and rallied up the
fence down the stretch to prevail late. FIRST LOVE sped to the a clear lead down the backside, maintained the advantage to upper stretch, drifted out a bit
down the lane while responding for the drive and was outkicked late in the lane. FAST N HAPPY trailed early, made an early move entering the turn to rally
to a contending position and was along for the show. HIGHWOOD stalked the leader into the turn, made a three wide bid to threaten at the quarter pole and
finished evenly failing to sustain the rally. NO TAPPIN OUT went evenly lacking a response when called upon. BLAZE BEAUTY had no impact. LIL CHILLY
was fractious during the laoding process and trailed as a non-threat.

MODAZZLE stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, angled out in upper stretch and closed well to be going away in deep stretch. SOVIET
STANDARD tracked the leaders through the turn and rallied from four wide down the lane to be second best. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN set a pressured pace to
the top of the lane, shook clear in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. U S HONOUR NAP slow early to trail and made a steady advance to hit the
board. READY MADE pressed the pace to the head of the stretch and faded in the lane. NEW DICE lacked a response when called upon and posed no
threat. TEQUILA FLATS raced wide throughout failing to mount a rally.

Footnotes
PERFUMER slow early to trail, angled in saving ground on the first turn, commenced a rally on the final turn, swung seven wide turning for home circling the
field and closed with a strong kick to prevail decisively in deep stretch. IZEONDEC unhurried early to be near the rear of the field for the first half, rallied
splitting rivals on the far turn and made a steady gain in the lane to garner the place. PALHACO set a pressured pace to midway on the final bend,
surrendered the lead midway on the turn and kept-on willingly to hold the show. HAWAIIAN HIDE AWAY tracked the leaders from the rail throughout and
finished evenly lacking a late bid. MINNESOTA MOON pressed the pace for the first five-eighths, took the lead on the far turn and tired down the stretch.
MASQUERADE BALL raced near the rear of the pack to upper stretch and passed weaker rivals in the lane without impact. ARMAVIR contended while
racing three wide in the second flight down the backside and flattened out on the far turn. JUST BECAUSE chased the leaders from between horses down
the backstretch and faded coming home.

Footnotes
PLAY TWENTY broke alertly to take eommand quickly from the gate, opened a clear leadon a well rated pace and was never challenged as a convincing
winner. ESSENTIAL BELLA prompted the early pace and kept on willingly to be second best while no match for the winner. LADY ATLANTIC tracked the
leaders from mid-pack and ralied late for the show. SUMMER AT THE SPA well placed from three wide and finished evenly just missing the show spot.
AUNT STELLA stalked the leader to the head of the lane and lacked a closing kick. TAP N TWINE went one-paced without impact. STACK SHACK was not
a threat. SHEZA HOOT chased early and tired giving way through the stretch. THE WINNING NUMBERS FOR THE PLACE PICK EIGHT WERE
