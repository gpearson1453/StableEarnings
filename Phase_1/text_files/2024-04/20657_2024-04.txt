Footnotes
BELTS 'N BROOKS raced in range three wide, came under urging near the half-mile pole, made some progress three wide around the turn, was outkicked
in upper stretch, kept on outside and was up late. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU stalked the pace two wide, took over nearing the five-sixteenths marker, drew
clear in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. MAJOR KING chased the early pace between foes, angled four wide nearing the turn, advanced four deep
around the bend, continued on the left lead in the lane and churned on to hold the show. NATURE BOY was fractious in the gate, had his head turned at the
start, set the pace along the rail and gave way nearing the five-sixteenths marker. ENDLESS SUNSET failed to menace while racing four wide.
WEDNESDAYNIGHT LAD stumbled at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, chased inside around the turn, swung five wide turning for home
and lacked a closing bid. FEDERAL EXCHANGE was outrun in the three path.

Footnotes
HOT BLOODED bumped with foes on both sides at the start, trailed in the two path, received a pair of right handed cues going into the far turn, was short of
room turning into the stretch, angled towards the rail, then tipped back out to the three path around the eighth pole, and rallied between foes to be up in the
closing stages. READ ON raced off the pace in the three path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kicked on
for place. SIR SEAMUS went clear early to set an open pace along the inside turning into the backstretch, was cued nearing the quarter, tipped out to the
three path at the top of the lane, drifted back to the rail and switched back to his left lead around the sixteenth, evened out, but held show. CASHIER
CHECK broke out and bumped with an outer foe, rated inside, steadied going into the far turn, angled out to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on,
but had to steady late. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback in the three path, fanned out to the seven path
turning into the stretch, but made no impact. SAFE CONDUCT chased in the three path but weakened in the five path down the lane.

MR NARCISSISTIC was reluctant to load, set the pace in the two path and just lasted. JACKSON'S WEBB raced off the early pace, advanced three wide
around the turn, steadily gained through the lane and just missed. THE CONNECTOR chased the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane while
lacking a totally clear path. UNDALAY pressed the pace from the rail and weakened in the final sixteenth.

WICKLOW GAL set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway. NANA FANNY stalked in the two
path, got stymied along the rail early around the far turn, angled out to the four path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. A RING THING prompted the
pace in the three path, was ridden around the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but evened out for show. PEACE SEEKER
chased in the four path but did not threaten in the five path down the lane. RADIANT GEM trailed throughout around the two path.

Footnotes
NANTASKET BEACH rated inside, was cued from the rail into the far turn, swung out to the five path to bid at the top of the lane, took a clear advantage
while angling back towards the rail passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. EXULT trailed in the four path, was coaxed from the two path early into the far
turn, and ran on between foes into the final furlong for place. BORN A GAMBLER chased in the three path, fanned out to the six path under a drive turning
into the lane, and kept on for show. SPETTRO vied for the lead along the inside, was roused into the far turn, but faded in the stretch. THE DOORMAN
tracked in the five path, was ridden from the four path into the far turn, but flattened in the stretch. PLUMA ROJA steadied around the first turn, was held up
from up close in the two path, cued early into the far turn, but had to steady passing the quarter, and weakened down the lane. IT'S GRAVY dueled for the
lead in the two path but gaveway in the stretch. MUFRIH raced wellback in the two path down the backstretch and never menaced. KINGFISH STEVENS
stalked in the three path but was empty entering the lane.
