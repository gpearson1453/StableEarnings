throughout and came up empty in the drive. P R WHY NOT stalked the pace three wide and lacked a closing rally. PAISANO JIM was just off the early pace
along the inside and weakened. LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT lunged at the break and trailed while saving ground.

Footnotes
AMERICAIN JOEY was on the pace inside GETCHA through the opening half, shook off a challenger through the far turn and drew off under an energetic
hand ride. PAYNTER'S BOY stalked the pace four wide in good position then rallied clear for the place but could not get to the winner. U S NAVY CROSS
was unhurried early while saving ground, moved out going to the far turn to rally four wide and continued to gain the show late. OUTLAW X. stalked the
pace three wide to bid late backstretch and weakened in the drive to lose position. OH BE ONE improved position three to five wide while not a threat.
NATE'S REVENGE saved ground and failed to make a bid. GETCHA set the early pace three wide and tired nearing the lane. R T'S IRON MAN tired racing
three wide.

dueled from outside the winner throughout and just missed. CZECHITOUT stalked the dueling leaders three wide and just held the show late. ATHENIAN
PRINCESS stalked four wide and could not produce the needed late effort. FESSY lacked a solid closing bid three wide. SPOILED BRAT was along the
inside and weakened. WHERESTHECARTGIRL failed to mount a bid three to four wide. DONNA LIRICA was always back. REASON WHY was not a factor
while wide on the turn.

Footnotes
SISAWAY NOW prompted the pace outside PARLAY PETE to bid through the far turn and slowly edged clear in the lane. RAFAEL'S SURPRISE stalked
the pace from along the inside and just gained the place late. PARLAY PETE made the pace from along the inside and came up empty late. PREACHER
hesitated at the break to get away last, moved up five and six wide but could not run down the top ones. OPTIMAL was in reach three wide but lacked a final
closing run. REVIVAL lacked a rally three wide. SCREENPLAY was always back. TOUGH COMPANY was not a factor. ZOE'S PAPA CEE tired four wide.

Footnotes
SLIM SLOW SLIDER stalked the early leader three and four wide to bid going to the far turn, dueled outside that rivals into the lane and proved best in the
drive. TIME MACHINE moved to a clear lead early about the two or three path, was joined by the winner going to the far turn, dueled into the lane but could
not handle that one late while finishing on even terms with FORCED RANKING for the place. FORCED RANKING settled off the pace three wide, angled in
on the far turn to rally, came up the rail in the lane to get a share of the place. PRAYFORPEACE was angled out going up the backstretch to rally four and
five wide and finished best of the others. ITS A WRAP was along the inside, angled four wide on the backstretch and had no rally. SHAKEN AND SHIMMY
was along the inside and weakened. COLLUSIONIST stalked the pace three and four wide, moved up to bid into the far turn and could not sustain the run.
MO SUMMER was four wide through the first turn and weakened after a half. CELERITY trailed throughout.
