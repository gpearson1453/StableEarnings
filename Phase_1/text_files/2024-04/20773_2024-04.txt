UTTERLY ENCHANTING chased the pace outside horses, was four deep leaving the turn, challenged for the lead in mid stretch, dueled with BANDITS
WARRIOR and prevailed in a hard drive. BANDITS WARRIOR saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, hugged the inner and bid for the lead near
the eighth pole, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. MATTITUDE , in the three path between horses leaving the turn, chased the pace to
mid stretch and weakened. SPICY MARGARITA sped to the early lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn and weakened in the stretch run.
CANOODLE , no factor, drifted wide leaving the turn. NO MORE MASK bore in leaving the starting gate, stayed along the inner rail and was outrun.

JUSTIFIED STRATEGY , taken to rate between rivals a long way, took closer order past the three sixteenths, shifted in, surged between foes to take
command near the sixteenth pole, spurted clear under a drive in deep stretch then prevailed. LUTE WARM settled off the pace while saving ground, eased
out and moved up in mid stretch, altered out near the sixteenth marker, straightened, split rivals and finished strong to just miss. STEAM KNOT vied outside
a rival heading to the first turn then cleared, set a relaxed pace towards the inside, maintained the lead while guided three wide soon into the lane, was
joined from her inside by a pair of rivals in mid stretch, fought on past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. INDEPENDENCE WAY broke inward
and was away slowly, recovered and settled off the pace and outside a rival, angled seven wide into the stretch, bumped with an inner rival near the three
sixteenths, corrected and closed willingly outside foes. VIRTUAL vied inside a rival into the first turn then was rated back to stalk, raced forwardly under
some asking and saving ground past the five sixteenths, , came out a bit then shifted back in and threatened inside a pair of outer rivals in mid stretch,
battled to deep stretch but failed to sustain. MEXICAN SUGAR rated inside, awaited room near the quarter pole, moved up past the three sixteenths,
steadied behind rivals soon after, shifted out but failed to make a significant recovery. PASQUINADE settled outside foes, eased out a bit making some
headway into the lane, angled out and bumped with INDEPENDENCE WAY near the three sixteenths, straightened while in about the six path, moved up
leaving mid stretch, steadied sharply when in tight with a sixteenth to go then faded. DIAMOND'S CABARET prompted the pace outside the leader, was
under pressure four wide into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. VINO DOLCE , three wide early, moved up and stalked
outside horses, circled five wide under a ride into the stretch then gave way. An objection by the rider of PASQUINADE against LUTE WARM alleging
interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
BOSS IS A PAL , quickly to the front, was guided towards the inner rail and set a rated pace while handling some outside pressure from POWER BACK,
responded when asked in upper stretch, spurted away in mid stretch then held sway under a drive. SPEAK UNITY edged up between runners heading to
the turn then dropped in to stalk, eased out when advancing past mid stretch and finished well to gain. CAERUS settled off the inside, eased out making
some headway in upper stretch, bumped with an outer rival when working between foes past the three sixteenths, angled out and closed strong. PRINCE
PERE was rated back after an alert break, saved ground under some rating, moved up under pressure past mid stretch but was out kicked in the final yards.
POWER BACK advanced outside runners heading to the turn then dropped in a bit to prompt outside the winner, stayed with that one while three wide into
the lane, failed to match strides past the quarter pole, remained willing to the sixteenth marker then faded. E. P. MILTON , three wide between runners
leaving the half, chased three to four wide and faded. TENAX settled off the rail, angled out to be about five to six wide making a bit of a run soon into the
lane, was jostled and turned inward leaving the three sixteenths, steadied then came up empty. SHACKLED LOVE , off the pace, raced three wide into the
lane, steadied briefly past the three sixteenths then failed to generate a solid run. BOURBON AND ICE , four to five wide, edged up between rivals in upper
stretch, was jostled when in tight between runners leaving the three sixteenths marker, stumbled soon after and fell. JACKIE A , off the pace, angled well
wide soon into the lane then fell over the stricken BOURBON AND ICE. There was a stewards' inquiry into the incident in the stretch involving TENAX,
BOURBON AND ICE, and JACKIE A. No action was taken.

Footnotes
FORCE OF JUSTICE , confidently ridden three wide around the turn, secured command at the head of the lane, responded to the whip in upper stretch and
was hand ridden late. KING'S RIVER saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail approaching the stretch, was caught in tight quarters between horses in
mid stretch and closed gamely. RESTLESS sprinted clear in hand down the backstretch, remained along the rail, lost the advantage mid turn, steadied at
the head of the stretch and drifted out on KING'S RIVER in mid stretch. SILVERBULLETTWENTY lacked speed, swung four wide in upper stretch and
flattened out. BANDITSGOLDENCHILD prompted the pace, bid for the lead between horses mid way on the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
BODE'S MAKER , away a bit when tossing his head at the break, was squeezed back soon after, regrouped and settled off the pace, was patiently handled
outside a rival leaving the three eighths, moved up between runners into the lane, shifted out to about the five path in mid stretch, closed strong outside the
embattled leaders and got up in the final yards. ELDEST SON rated between runners while stalking the pace, took closer order leaving the five sixteenths,
was guided out to about the four path in upper stretch, closed in and engaged the leaders from there outside in mid stretch, dueled, gained a slim advantage
in deep stretch, kept on gamely but wasn't quite good enough. THE ADDISON POUR , unhurried early, remained under patient handling near the five
sixteenths, angled seven wide for the drive and finished well outside rivals. WISH ME HOME , under a snug hold stalking two wide, moved to take on the
leader after six furlongs, dueled, gained a slim lead in mid stretch, fought on to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly between runners.
EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE , inside foes stalking the pace, moved up under coaxing and to the inside of ELDEST SON past the quarter pole, was kept
towards the inside by that one soon into the stretch, forged through between runners to challenge in mid stretch, dueled then gave way stubbornly inside
rivals. WICKED PRANKSTER cleared early then secured the inside, set a rated pace, was taken on by WISH ME HOME near the five sixteenths, sparred
with that one to mid stretch, stayed on with effort past the sixteenth pole then faded. JOE , three to four wide and outside of runners, raced forwardly into the
far turn, came under a ride leaving the three eighths but failed to kick on. TUNE IN , towards the inside, came up empty when called upon.

TAKE CHARGE TOO accelerated to the early lead, set the pace off the rail and was under the whip in the drive. DISPUTED CLAIM lacked speed, was five
deep leaving the turn, floated to the six path, rallied and switched to his left lead near the sixteenth pole. NASTY HABIT trailed leaving the turn, was taken to
the seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. JOLLY BY GOLLY raced in the three path between horses turning for home and was steadied in
close quarters near the eighth pole. MR. ANTONELLI , two wide chasing the winner around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole and weakened in the
drive. DARK TIMBER , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the winner and weakened. SWIFTY DEVIL , squeezed back at the start, checked in tight
quarters inside the four and a half furlongs pole. DILLINGER , three deep on the turn, chased the pace, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
WHERE'S RAY took over between foes then dropped in and set a rated pace, handled outside pressure around the turn, kicked away after being set down
in upper stretch then was not threatened through the final eighth while kept alert. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE , bumped at the break, rated just off the leaders
into the turn, saved ground stalking mid turn, came out to be four wide in upper stretch, gave hard chase from there, switched over to his left lead inside the
sixteenth marker and stayed on between runners to save the show. HAD TO HAVE HIM had speed then was firmly rated back off the leaders near the half
mile marker, stalked three wide mid turn, dropped inside through the drive and churned on. TIDEWATER , four to five wide, made a mild run past mid
stretch then flattened out late. CHAT BLANC broke a bit slow, recovered and was angled to the rail when eagerly advancing past the half, stayed inside
around the turn, eased out in upper stretch then lacked a solid finish. SHAPE NOTE made his way forward outside rivals soon after the break, prompted the
pace outside the winner, could not keep pace past the three sixteenths, pursued to about the sixteenth marker then faded. UPSIDEDOWN MAN , bumped
at the start, raced two wide mid turn, angled six wide for the drive but lacked a bid. BRUDER broke a bit slow and to the outside then failed to menace. OUR
HOISTED MAST , bumped between runners leaving the gate, raced three to four wide and lacked a response. HYTECK PRINCE drafted far back into the
turn, swung very wide and failed to get involved. ROCKLAND EXPRESS was outrun. SOUTHERN LAD saved ground and faded.

BESTSUGARDADDYEVER stalked the pace outside TOP THE CHART, floated out in mid stretch, closed late and was up between rivals. TOPS THE
CHART sprinted clear early, saved ground around the turns, drifted out in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. ARMANDO R , bumped and pinched back
leaving the starting gate, circled horses on the far turn, entered the stretch four deep and rallied outside the top pair. IT'S VIPER , along the inner rail the
first turn and backstretch, raced in the two path the far turn, moved back to the rail in upper stretch and rallied. GILMORE stalked the pace between horses
down the backstretch, remained off the inner rail the far turn and failed to rally. MOSE PERFECT bore in at the break, raced forwardly along the inner rail on
the turns, faltered, angled wide in upper stretch and was eased. CAPTAIN QUINT , three wide on the turns, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
PERSPICACIOUS BOY drifted out at the break, corrected and was sent up outside of AVES MAKIN'S WAVES to take over, cleared heading to the turn,
raced three wide into the lane, wandered outward late and prevailed. CATCHING STARS settled off the pace while saving ground, commenced a run
leaving the three eighths, advanced inside of a rival nearing the lane, shifted out, moved up past mid stretch, was guided further out as the winner drifted,
closed strongly but simply ran out of ground. AVES MAKIN' WAVES went clear in the opening strides, rated off the winner heading to the half, saved ground
pursuing into the stretch and faded. TORTOLA broke outward, corrected and raced wide but failed to generate a rally. ALL FRUITS RIPE , carried out at the
break, corrected and tracked wide, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and gave way.
