Footnotes
ADIOS ASHER set the pace in the two path, drifted out turning for home and dug in inside a foe. CHRISTENSEN pressed the winner in three path and
could not quite get past. EXECUTIVE SEARCH stalked the pace in the two path and ran on inside of the top two to narrow the gap. ACAMAR was bumped
at the start, raced in range four wide, angled in upper stretch, angled back out late and went evenly. UNSOCIABLE failed to menace while racing three wide.
KITTEN'S SPA broke in and bumped ACAMAR at the start, raced off the pace in the two path and never threatened. UNDALAY was outrun while racing four
wide. NO NAME DUDE hit the starting gate causing the rider to lose the left iron, saved ground and made little impact.

Footnotes
MY HAPPY HOLIDAY tracked inside, received a right handed cue along the rail midway around the far turn, kicked on while hanging on her left lead to bid
along the inside into the final furlong, and inched ahead of the outer pacesetter in the closing stages. DENVER'S ALLEY showed the way along the inside,
was cued from the two path midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch, and ran on, but was edged out by an inner foe
in the final sixteenth to place. TINTA ROJA laid in range from the two path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the five path entering the lane, and
kept on for show. PARALLEL rated in the three path, was coaxed along from the five path around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the
stretch, and stayed on. PRIVACY SETTING (FR) chased in the two path but never threatened in the five path down the lane. MISS SPITFIRE hesitated at
the start, trailed in the three path early and never menaced. COTINGA stalked in the three path, but steadied between foes midway around the far turn, and
gaveway.

Footnotes
SUBTLE FAITH laid in range along the inside, was cued in the three path passing the three-eighths pole, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane,
stayed on while hanging on her left lead, and drew past the inner pacesetter in the closing stages. TOVIA got bumped by an inner foe at the start, set a clear
pace in the two path, waited confidently around the turn, received a right handed cue in the three path at the top of the stretch, and kept on, then was
wrapped up around the sixteenth, and got caught by an outer foe in the final strides to place. UPSTREET broke out and bumped with an outer foe, chased
in the four path, was ridden into the turn, swung from the seven path turning into the lane, but finished evenly for show. GENERAL ROBINSON tracked in
the two path, was coaxed passing the three-eighths, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but flattened. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) stalked in the
three path but backed up from the five path around the turn. CRASH THE CREASE trailed throughout around the three path.

Footnotes
MIDNITE MUSKET set the pace two wide, ceded the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, regained command in upper stretch and held firm late. PARAKEET
(IRE) prompted the pace three wide, rallied through the final furlong and ran out of ground. ALWAYS DIALED had speed inside, took the lead inside of the
winner near the five-sixteenths pole but could not match strides in the lane. PRAISEWORTHY raced off the pace two wide and improved position in the
lane. FIRST SHOT FIRED failed to menace while racing four wide. RED ABARRIO was outrun inside. FUJI FIRE saved ground and never threatened.
ARROW GHOST had his head turned at the start, raced two wide and was never involved. DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND chased the pace four wide and came
up empty in the lane. YASUR played no factor while racing three wide.

NO DELIBERATION rated in the two path, ranged up while angling outward under ride to take aim in the six path at the top of the lane, took the lead while
hanging on his left lead passing the eighth pole, and inched clear. THREE ZERO pressed in the three path, was roused from the four path turning into the
stretch, and ran on for place. JESTERS HONOR tracked in the two path, was ridden into the turn, angled out to the five path turning into the lane, altered
out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. CANTARO trailed in the three path but made no impact from the seven path in the
stretch. DUNDIE vied for the lead inside, was coaxed along around the turn, but gaveway from the two path in the final furlong. NEXT EPISODE prompted
the pace in the four path but weakened from the eight path in the stretch. BEGANINGREENPOINT chased in the four path but never menaced.

SUNSHINE FROLIC pressed the pace two wide and drove clear in the final furlong. FLAT TOP BOX stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near
the quarter pole and was second best in the lane. MISTER ABARRIO set the pace along the rail, led past the eighth pole and was outfinished.
DONTBESOOGROUCHY saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. YOU AIN'T POPPN raced in
range two wide and had no response when roused around the far turn. JUNIPERO SERRA broke slowly and trailed inside.

Footnotes
AVELLINO laid up close in the five path, was coaxed along from four wide around the turn, bid from the six path turning into the lane, took the lead passing
the eighth pole, and held off a late charging outer foe. ESCAPE ROOM bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the two path, was ridden in the four
path around the turn, fanned widest to the ten path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. DR. RAY D. broke out at the start, tracked in the four path,
was coaxed along while five wide around the turn, floated out to the nine path at the top of the lane, and kept on while hanging on her left lead for show.
ROTONDO prompted the pace in the three path, bid between foes around the turn, took the lead passing the quarter, but faded from the three path in the
final furlong. LITTLE MINSKY trailed in the six path and never threatened from the eight path down the lane. BUCCHERA stalked inside, tipped out to the
four path turning into the stretch, but lost the whip in upper stretch, and flattened. PARTY SHAKER bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the
two path but gaveway down the lane.
