Footnotes
LITTLE FRAPPUCINO was hindered at the start, then moved between rivals to set the pace down the backstretch while two off the rail, inched away to clear
the far turn and was kept to task down the lane to prove best. NORTHWIND tracked the pace while three wide heading down the backstretch, then bid on
the far turn to gain second position, continued to rally in the stretch but could not catch the leader and held the place position. TOP COP was unhurried
early, saved ground in the early stages, came out three wide leaving the far turn to rally in the home stretch then dueled for the show prize and was up at
the wire. SEND OFF chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then attempted to bid between rivals heading in the second half, was in tight
and settled back, then rallied leaving the turn while four wide, angled inward to duel for third position and missed the show prize in the end. AWESOME
CAJUN pressed the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was steadily urging throughout, was used up on the far turn then flattened out. MAN IN THE
MIDDLE was bumped at the start, then chased the pace from the inside, was in tight heading into the second half then steadied, re bid on the far turn and
did not fire in the stretch.

Footnotes
KOLKATA tracked the leaders from the two path down the backstretch, remained nicely rated on the far turn, then menaced gamely in the stretch and was
up at the wire to prevail. MISCHIEF ANGEL pressed the pace while two wide in the early furlongs, then gained command at the top of the far turn, was in a
strong bid down the lane then was caught at the end and was second best. BACK IN CHARGE saved ground in the early furlongs, then moved up on the far
turn while four wide, rallied in the early stretch and was best for the show prize in the end. CATHERINE BLAZE tracked the pace from the inside, was in a
steady drive throughout the far turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. SUMMEROSA was allowed to settle along the rail down the backstretch, remained at
the back of the pack on the far turn, then bid at the top of the stretch but it was to no avail. LEPRECHAUN CHARM was allowed to settle two to three wide
down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn and into the stretch and came up empty. MISS CARMEN CIBO set the pace from the inside headed down
the backstretch, was in a long drive on the far turn then faltered in the final furlongs.

SHELL SHOCK pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, gained the lead briefly at the top of the far turn before being confronted by outer
rivals to battle heading into the stretch, disposed of one then continued to duel with the remaining rival in the late stretch and was up in time to prevail. ITS
MY MONEY TOO was bumped at the start, then moved up to bid from the four path on the turn, met with inner rivals to battle for the lead at the quarter
pole, then continued to duel with SHELL SHOCK in the late stretch and was out finished in the end. POETIC UNION raced at the back while two wide, then
bid on the turn, shifted out to the five path in the early stretch and closed well for the show prize. SHARP LIKENESS chased the pace from the inside, then
bid on the turn from the two path, menaced in the stretch and missed the show prize in the end. SUPERCENTS broke outwardly and bumped rival, then
chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, then rallied in the stretch and came up evenly in the end. ATTA MOY GIRL chased
the pace while three wide, then moved up on the turn while in a strong drive to vie between rivals heading into the stretch, was hard used and tired in the
end. SWEET SLEW led the way into the first turn, was in a steady drive down the backstretch, then was over taken for the lead on the turn and weakened in
the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPER CINDY raced while two wide in the middle pack of rivals down the backstretch, then moved up on the far turn to duel with the pace setter in the
early stretch then kicked clear in the final yards to succeed in the end. QUINN ELLA raced from the inside mid pack, remained well rated on the far turn,
then rallied gamely in the stretch and was up for the place prize in the end. ALLIACEOUS tracked the pace while two wide, was in a long drive on the far
turn, then bid in the upper stretch and was best for the show prize in the end. RUBY THE DESTROYER showed the way from the inside into the first turn,
maintained a clear advantage heading into the far turn, then was challenged by an outer rival at the quarter pole to duel briefly in the upper stretch then
gave way grudgingly in the final yards. STREET TAPPER was allowed to settle along the inside, then bid from the three path leaving the far turn and came
up evenly throughout the stretch. BASKET CASE raced while three wide down the backstretch, was in a moderate pace throughout, then came out six wide
leaving the far turn and needed more in the stretch. POET LAUREATE hesitated in the gate at the start and lost chance. HAL'S DREAM was allowed to
settle while two wide and was no threat. There was an INQUIRY in regards to the start of the race. After review, POET LAUREATE was declared a starter
and was the cause of the false break at the beginning of the race.

CAJUN CHROME chased the pace while three wide, was gaining on the turn, cleared the pace setter then sparred shoulder to shoulder with an inner rival
down the stretch and was up at the wire to prove best. FIREBALL BIRDIE chased the pace while two wide, then moved up on the turn to duel with an outer
rival down the lane and hung at the wire. EL QUESO GRANDE chased the pace from the inside, then settled back on the turn, rallied from the three path in
the upper stretch and finished gamely for third position. CARRY THE FLAG bumped rival at the start, was allowed to settle while three wide, then bid leaving
the turn while four to five wide and came up empty in the stretch. DEACON JONES was brushed at the start, then settled between rivals, bid leaving the turn
and was no threat. TOOLITTLETOOLATE was allowed to settle along the inside, angled in towards the rail to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late.
MR. SHORTY led the way from the inside while in a strong drive, was hard used after the turn and tired in the late stretch. UKRAINE STRONG bumped
outer foe at the start and was no factor.

Footnotes
COUNTRY CAPER dueled with an outer rival down the backstretch and throughout the far turn then kicked clear at the top of the stretch and held on well till
the end. SINGING DIXIE was allowed to settle while two wide, continued to save ground throughout the far turn, came out eight wide and surged down the
lane and was up for place prize. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD saved ground in the early stages, was in a steady drive along the rail on the far turn then closed
belatedly down the lane while splitting rivals and was up for the show prize. WITHOUT A TRACE stalked the pace from the two path while remaining well
rated throughout the far turn, then gained second position mid stretch while in a determined bid then was out finished for the place prize. MOON CAT raced
in the middle of the pack while three deep, then rallied leaving the far turn and kept on down the lane while between rivals but it was to no avail in the end.
VARSITY chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, remained in an even pace throughout the far bend, then bid mildly in the early stretch but it
was not enough. WILTON was allowed to settle while three wide in the early furlongs, then circled seven wide leaving the far turn, menaced in the stretch
and came up evenly. TIGERS 'N BEARS was unhurried early, then came out six wide leaving the far turn, bid between rivals in the early stretch and kept on
under steady urging but it was not enough. MANOR BORN stalked the leaders while three wide in the early stages, remained close throughout the far turn
while in a strong bid, then gave way in deep stretch. STORM MAN dueled with an inner rival leaving the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long
drive throughout the far turn, was used up and tired in the end. TAKE FLIGHT raced in the middle of the field while four wide, bid mildly leaving the far turn
and into the stretch and came up empty. COWBOY RIDGE tracked from the inside at a moderate pace throughout the first three quarters and lacked rallying
in the home stretch.
