SQUEEZE THE DAY bore in leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace two wide, gained the lead mid way on the turn and eagerly pulled away through
the stretch. LIGERAZO , fractious in the starting gate, broke alertly to make the early lead, battled inside the winner to upper stretch and faded. MY BUDDY
GEORGE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, steadied when shuffled back at the start, raced in the three path leaving the turn and finished willingly.
INXPRESS , well place three deep on the turn, drifted four wide approaching the stretch and weakened. SHESAYSHELLO , outrun, raced in the two path
leaving the turn. BY DECREED , forced in leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path leaving the turn and was no facteor. PLEASANT BOSS stayed
along the inner rail around the turn while outrun.

Footnotes
LIL MIRACLE MAN disputed the pace three deep and gradually edged away through the stretch. BIG SCOTT DADDY , sluggish early, worked between
horses leaving the backstretch, swung to the four path leaving the turn and rallied. RHODIUM RUNNER saved ground on the turn while stalking the duel,
eased off the rail turning for home and rallied mildly between rivals. ABRAAJ MIRAGE disputed the pace inside horses and faded in the drive. ARIMONY ,
five wide on the turn finished willingly. BRICKHOUSE raced in the four path on the turn and failed to rally. MORE HONOR was not a factor. FIGHT ME
disputed the pace between horses and gave way in upper stretch. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE was no factor. TRACK BOUND , caught in tight quarters
leaving the starting gate, was outrun. ESTEEMED , outrun, was carried very wide leaving the turn. TAINO drifted very wide leaving the turn and dropped

Footnotes
JUST CALL ME LUCKY , four deep on the turn, dueled outside NARIZON, brushed with that one in upper stretch and prevailed in an extended drive.
NARIZON , well off the rail but inside the winner around the turn, battled that one, brushed in upper stretch and just missed in a sharp effort. DANCING
PORKY , always wide, failed to menace in an even effort. BOTTLE CAPS saved ground on the turn, chased the pace and weakened. RED HOT SERMON ,
always inside horses, failed to rally. CHASIN A DOLLAR broke slowly, raced wide around the turn and showed late interest. CASCABEL , wide on the turn,
was not a factor. CACTUS JANE dropped back. T B'S GRAY , outrun, bore out on the turn. An objection by the trainer of NARIZON against the winner for
alleged interference near the three sixteenths pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
OVIATT CLASS lacked speed, floated to the six path leaving the far turn, closed smartly outside horses and was up approaching the finish. GINOBILI
chased the pace outside MARKS HIP, gained the lead turning for home and gave way grudgingly. KEEN HEIR , never far back, finished willingly between
horses. DESHAMBEAU chased the pace outside horses and weakened. TRUTH SEEKER , wide both turns, showed a nice, late move. MARKS HIP set the
pace inside horses, drifted out turning for home and gave way. COASTAL KID , wide on the turns, angled in for the drive and weakened.
