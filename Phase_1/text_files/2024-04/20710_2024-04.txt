MOLLY'S TOWN led in the three path, drew off under mild urging and geared down late. FIVE O' SOMEWHERE pressed the pace outside of the winner
while no match. NEW YEAR'S FEVER stalked the pace between foes, bid at the quarter pole but faltered. PICKLE FEET raced in the five path and
improved position late. BUTCH'S BEST stalked the pace in the four path before fading in the stretch. EL ROSILLO angled four path on the turn.
HOMERUNHAPPY saved ground to no avail. MEADOW VALUE and KING ME raced wide.
