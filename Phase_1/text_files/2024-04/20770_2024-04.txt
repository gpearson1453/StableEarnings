Footnotes
NO VALLA tracked inside, was nudged along the rail around the far turn, waited for an opening in the two path at the top of the lane, was roused to split
rivals while still in the two path passing the eighth pole, and kicked clear of the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. BIG BAND LUZZIANN showed the way
along the inside, was pushed along around the far turn, kept on along the inside into the stretch, got caught by the winner around the sixteenth, but held
place. OKAY FINE chased in the four path, came under right handed encouragement in the five path rounding the far turn, tipped out to the six path at the
top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. STARRY HOPE laid in midpack from the two path, was coaxed along around the far turn, but was one paced
from the five path in the stretch. MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) trailed in the four path down the backstretch, tipped to the two path entering the far turn, fanned
out to the eight path at the top of the lane, but was no factor. JUDGE JUDITH stalked in the three path, was roused into the far turn, but faded in the stretch.
FOUNDER'S DAY was unhurried in the two path early but never menaced.

Footnotes
BOURBON WARRIOR set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. SIR BANANA BRIAN was bumped at the start and again soon after,
raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. JAKE'S AFFECTION saved ground in range, made progress in
upper stretch but flattened out a bit in the final furlong. XY FACE was bumped after the start, chased the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead
in the lane and finished evenly. ANADOLU chased the winner in the two and three paths, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. MISTER
COOPER was knocked sideways near the nine-sixteenths marker, raced seven wide around the turn and never threatened. BERNARDO'S LEGACY broke
inwardly and bumped foes at the start, raced off the pace five wide and lacked the needed rally. WALKING TESTIMONY bumped with AMAZING WOO at
the start, was bumped again not long after, saved ground and was never a threat. ROYAL ABERDEEN was bumped between foes at the start, chased the
pace four wide and faded. SOUTHERN CIVILITY was bumped near the nine-sixteenths marker, raced three wide and was never involved. PAISAN was
outrun inside. AMAZING WOO was bumped at the start and again about sixteenth of mile into the race, raced six wide around the turn and was through
early.

her left lead just after the eighth pole. NAUGHTY FAVORS showed the way in the three path, was cued along the inside midway around the turn, tipped out
to the two path entering the stretch, was caught just after the eighth pole, but dug in to hold place. DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT prompted the pace in the four path,

HAPPY RUNNER stalked in the two path, waited along the rail around the far turn, was roused while tipping out to the three path at the top of the lane, and
drew clear of an inner foe in the final furlong. HENLEY'S JOY bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path, came under right handed
encouragement in the five path around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and ran on to be up for place at the wire. MR
CROWLEY showed the way inside, was roused into the far turn, tipped out to the two path at the top of the lane, but was caught in the final sixteenth by an
outer pair to show. SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) bumped with an inner foe at the start, was held up in the four path, had to steady going into the far turn,
swung from the seven path into the stretch, tipped to the four path passing the eighth pole, but evened out late. SOUPER ENERGIZER laid in midpack from
the three path, was cued along the rail passing the quarter, but finished evenly. NAPOLEONIC WAR got bumped by an inner foe and had to check early,
rated in the five path, was roused in the four path midway around the far turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. SWORD
ZORRO (IRE) chased in the six path, moved up to bid under coaxing while two wide going into the far turn, floated out to the four path entering the lane, but
faded. ROUGH DRAFT veered out and bumped an outer foe early, tracked in the five path, had to steady going into the far turn, was driven between foes in
the three path around the far turn, but weakened from the six path in the stretch. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY prompted the pace in the four path, but steadied
between foes approaching the far turn, and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
ONE OF ONE showed the way in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, and kicked away down the lane under a drive. FOGGY NOTE tracked
inside, steadied into the turn, was ridden in the three path around the turn, and kept on from the five path in the stretch for place. LEXI'S SPIRIT chased in
the two path, checked going into the turn, was driven in the four path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of lane, and finished evenly for
show. PRINCESS BLAKELY stalked in the three path but flattened on her left lead in the stretch. BLACK BELT BARBIE pressed inside but weakened
turning into the stretch. BON DIA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HOPE IN HIM showed the way in the two path, waited confidently around the turn, opened up passing the quarter, continued to kick away under rousing in
upper stretch, began to shorten stride in the final sixteenth, but held on. HILARIOUS AFFAIR chased inside, tipped out to the four path while under a drive
midway around the turn, and ran on for place. OUTLAW COUNTRY stalked in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, and kept on for
show. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT trailed in the two path, angled out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, but made no impact. FROSTED
FAITH rated in the three path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, but flattened from the five path in the stretch. LOYAL LOUIE tracked in the four
path but backed up around the turn. ETNICO prompted the pace in the three path, but steadied in the two path midway around the turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
MO CALIENTE set a pressured pace along the rail, dueled inside of foes through the lane and dug in gamely to prevail. WHITING FIELD pressed the
winner two wide, vied between through the lane and just missed. DIXIE PREACH stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, had aim
outside of the top two through the lane but could not get past. DOWNING STREET saved ground off the pace, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied
belatedly. LOMACHENKO was bumped and steadied at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled five wide in upper stretch and finished well.
RAPSCALLION failed to menace while racing three wide. TIGGEROO was outrun inside. HIGHLAND PEAK played no factor while racing two wide. SWEET
TRAVELS chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. SUGAR IT'S ELI made little impact while racing three and four wide. GRAND TOWER
bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide, was getting out around the far turn and retreated through the lane.
