Footnotes
BAND CAMP hugged the inner rail stalking the pace, eased out to the two path leaving the turn, secured command outside RASCALLY REBEL near the
quarter pole and was under urging in the drive. BROOKLYN GUY lacked speed, raced along the inner rail throughout and rallied nicely. TOAST TO COAST
, in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. RASCALLY REBEL sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in
upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and tired. MARYLAND MOON , outrun, passed a tired rival late. LANGLEE AVENUE , three deep around the
turn, chased the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
SMOOTH PEBBLE angled in advancing to towards the half mile marker, was snugly rated tracking the leaders mid turn, found room along the rail to
advance near mid stretch, engaged GOLDEN CAN near the sixteenth marker, kept on determinedly under a drive, wrested command late and was edging
away a bit at the wire. GOLDEN CAN , confidently handled stalking three wide outside rivals, circled four wide in hand into the lane, was nudged clear a
furlong out then given an ask right handed, was guided inward once joined from her inside, dueled and gave way grudgingly. OLIVE KAT , bumped at the
break, regrouped and settled off the pace, saved ground mid turn, came out in upper stretch, split rivals and finished with interest. GOGO CHANEL broke a
step slow, settled off the pace while saving some ground, eased out into the lane, altered out widest past mid stretch and finished with good energy.
CUPIDS DREAM , off the pace and under urging leaving the far turn, entered the stretch three to four wide, moved up some past mid stretch then flattened
out. SPEAK YOUR MIND broke inward and bumped OLIVE KAT, corrected and stalked three wide early, dropped in a path leaving the far turn and
threatened the leader, forced the issue into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. QUEEN OF HEARTS forced the early pace between foes,
chased off the rail mid turn and faded. HIPNOTIZADA vied inside foes before clearing, set the pace towards the inside, took outside pressure mid turn,
entered the lane two wide affording the winner a path, stayed on past the three sixteenths then gave way.

GOLDRUSH HOTTIE disputed the pace outside CELTIC BOND under confident handling, was put to the whip near the eighth pole and edged clear late.
CELTIC BOND , fractious behind the starting gate, hugged the inner rail, dueled with the winner and finished gamely. LUCKY HONEY lacked speed, stayed
along the inner rail throughout and gained the show position. QUALITY WEEKEND circled foes on the turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and
weakened. LANCE'S SMILE chased the pace between horses, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
NOT THISTIMERANDY , urged along soon after the break, saved ground and remained under a ride mid turn as a duel went on up front, eased out soon
into the stretch, closed determinedly under left handed asks and surged between rivals to just get up. I HAD ENOUGH , brushed at the break, got engaged
in a battle to the inside of KICK STARTNESS after a sixteenth of a mile, carried that scrum around the turn and into the lane, shook clear under a drive in
mid stretch, widened a bit near the sixteenth marker, kept on valiantly but was edged in the final jumps. ASCENDANCE , off the pace and three wide
between foes, shifted out wider in upper stretch, rallied with and to the outside of the winner but just wasn't quite good enough. SURFBOARD , in the clear
early on and within striking distance of the embattled leaders, came under a ride around the turn, chased between foes into the stretch but came up empty.
KICK STARTNESS , away alertly, disputed the pace outside I HAD ENOUGH, failed to go on with that one in mid stretch and weakened through the final
seventy yards. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN flashed speed then eased back off the leaders, dropped back between runners around the turn, angled out and
came up empty. THENAME OF THEGAME , four wide outside rivals, wandered outward entering the lane, was given a couple left handed asks with his
rider high in the irons in upper stretch, failed to respond then was guided inward while being eased.

CLOUD MUSIC , clear early, was taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, set the pace along the rail, was under the whip in mid stretch and pulled away.
SHOOT THEMESSENGER prompted the pace outside the winner, weakened through the stretch but held the place. LOOSE GOOSE , three wide on both
turns, weakened through the lane. VIRGINIA FULLA , four wide on both turns, passed tired horses. FORMAL ORDER , along the inner rail on both turns,
was never a factor. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , never a factor, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed faders. STARDUST ZIGGY , a forward
factor inside horses to the stretch, gave way. STEELE MONEY raced in the two path between horses down the backstretch and dropped back after leaving
the turn. ALOTTACENTS was outrun.

LAW OF THE JUNGLE broke a tad slow then settled three deep early on, commenced a run leaving the far turn, took closer order of the dueling leaders
past the five sixteenths, came four to five wide into the lane, moved to engage HURRYING HOME inside the three sixteenths, gained a slim advantage
outside that one leaving the eighth pole, dueled and held sway while kept to task. HURRYING HOME , brushed at the break, moved up early and tracked
three wide, bid leaving the far turn, sparred on a short lead outside LAST SECOND LOUIE past the the five sixteenths, got the better of that one in upper
stretch, was met with an outside challenge soon after, dueled and stayed on gamely. VERBIER , awkward from the gate, was squeezed back soon after,
secured the inside for the backstretch run, came out for the drive and churned on. LAST SECOND LOUIE took over early and set a pressured pace towards
the inner rail, briefly edged clear around the far turn, was then taken on by HURRYING HOME, sparred with that one to upper stretch, stayed on past mid
stretch then faded. SUCCEED , bumped at the break, raced between runners past the five eighths, failed to kick on into the far turn and faded.
HOMECOMING KING lagged back, angled out for the drive, offered a belated response but could not threaten. PRINS FIRE , bumped at the start, pressed
the early pace outside LAST SECOND LOUIE, saw that one get away into the far turn, chased to about the five sixteenths then retreated.

RUN AROUND SLEW prompted the pace outside GRANUAILE around the turn, overtook that one in upper stretch and held sway in an extended drive.
RYE SMILE worked between horses in the stretch and rallied. THE AMAZING MIZZEN stalked the pace outside horses, was well positioned four deep
turning for home and flattened out. GRANUAILE sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gradually weakened in the drive.
KRONE failed to show speed, raced near the inner rail in upper stretch, steadied lacking room near the three sixteenth pole, altered course to the outside
and rallied gamely. KISS ME MORE , lightly steadied between horses leaving the backstretch, left the turn in the three path and came up empty. TEA ROSE
, checked in tight quarters entering the turn, raced near the inner rail and weakened. HOT DANCE bumped MARGARET P when coming in at the break,
was no factor and floated to the seven path in upper stretch. GATE SONG stalked the pace four wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and
failed to rally. COOTER'S REVENGE (AUS) bore in after breaking in the air then was outrun. INTEL AGENT , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased
the pace to the stretch and gave way. MARGARET P , soundly bumped at the start, trailed.

Footnotes
HAINT BLUE , unhurried early while saving ground, commenced her run leaving the far turn, quickly gained towards the rail near the five sixteenths, angled
four wide into the lane, sustained nicely under solid handling, rolled past CONTINENTALCONGRES in deep stretch then went clear at the wire.
CONTINENTALCONGRES , a bit keen when clearing off early, settled through the backstretch while towards the inner rail, kept an initial challenger at bay
soon into the lane, responded when set down past the three sixteenths, maintained a clear advantage under a drive approaching the sixteenth marker, kept
on gamely but could not fend off the winner's charge. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE , forwardly placed while saving ground, eased out and took aim nearing the
stretch, gave hard chase to mid stretch then flattened out. MAVILUS , between horses soon into the backstretch, was under a strong ride nearing the half,
dropped back to last around the final turn then passed tired foes in the lane. PISTOL LIZ ABLAZEN moved up into the backstretch and prompted the leader
from her outside, was put to a solid ride outside a rival leaving the far turn, failed to kick on entering the stretch and retreated. CARROLL GIRL broke a step
slow, was used four wide to contention, chased three wide into the far turn then gave way.
