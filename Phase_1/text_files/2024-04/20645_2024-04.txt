stages, continued around the bend in the three path and finished evenly. BENNY BUCKETS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. HOT ROD JIMMY chased the leader on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and weakened in the lane. SPORT COAT raced off the pace on the inside through the opening
stages, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. GOTHAM'S FINALE pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
two path and faded in the lane. RANGER JOE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, tracked the leader on the rail up the backstretch, swung
out to the five and six path coming around the turn and tired in the stretch. ARIZONA SUMMER trailed the field through the early going, continued around
the turn in the three path and was never a factor.
