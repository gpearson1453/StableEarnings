Footnotes
THE MAR chased in the three path, was roused into the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, and rallied past an inner trio around the
sixteenth. ADMIRAL'S WAVE bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked between foes in the two path, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch,
but was stymied passing the eighth pole, altered out to the seven path, and ran on for place. CRYPTO MAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, got rank
between foes early around the first turn, moved up in the three path to vie for the lead passing the half, drifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, tipped
back inwards, and kept on for show. HENDRICKSON bumped with an outer foe at the start, showed the way inside, was challenged by an outer foe passing
the half, received a right handed cue early around the far turn, floated out to the four path entering the stretch, and dug in, but was outlasted. SUMMER
STORM STRIC bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed inside, came up the rail to bid passing the eighth pole, but lost the whip just after, and flattened.
HABERDASHERY tracked inside early but failed to menace.

Footnotes
PATTY'S HAVING FUN set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive. RED HOT SPARK raced off the pace
three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and ran on to gain the place in the final strides. GHOZ ON broke awkwardly, bumped with MAS VINO not long
after, was on heels midway down the backstretch, advanced four wide around the turn and flattened out a bit in the lane. SAND WEDGE chased the pace
two wide and lacked the needed rally. HOLY KINGDOM failed to menace while racing four wide. FOR THE THRILL prompted the pace three wide and tired
in the drive. MAS VINO bumped early, saved ground and never threatened. MISS ATHLETIC bobbled at the start but was still out quickly, pressed the
winner two wide and faltered in the drive. COSMIC SYMPHONY hit the starting gate and was outrun inside.

LADY MAX showed the way in the two path into the turn, was challenged by an outer foe passing the quarter, dug in entering the stretch, lost the lead
around the sixteenth, but fought back gamely to inch ahead late. TINKI ABARRIO stalked in the five path, bid approaching the quarter, was roused from the
six path into the stretch, ran on while drifting in to lead passing the sixteenth, but hung for place. DANZIT pressed in the four path, was ridden between foes
in the three path around the turn, flattened on her left lead in the four path down the lane, but dug in late to hold show. LAURIE BLUE tracked inside, angled
out to the seven path in upper stretch, but made no impact. TAP MY BELLE rated in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but
failed to menace. SILVER MOONLIGHT slowly broke in at the start, then trailed throughout along the inside.

Footnotes
LUNI SIMA was away last, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three wide around the turn, took over nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off
under a drive. REAL TALK set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the three-eighths marker, swung outside of that foe into the four path
leaving the quarter pole, could not match strides but held clear of the rest. FLOAT ON raced in range three and four wide, lacked the needed rally and kept
on for the show. MAPTITUDE had brief speed two wide. SCARAMANGA pressed the pace two wide and faded after a half.

Footnotes
BELLE'S BLUE BELL chased in the six path, was driven in the four path around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and drew past
an inner pair around the sixteenth. DOT prompted the pace in the five path, bid in the four path around the turn, got floated out to the six path at the top of
the lane, ran on to head the leader passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe around the sixteenth to place. CARESS showed the way in the
three path, was cued from the two path midway around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on, but was caught by an outer
pair in the final furlong to show. JAYANA raced off the pace in the seven path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, and stayed on from around the
seven path down the lane. MIUCCIA got fractious in the gate, tracked in the three path, but backed up in the two path around the turn, and made no impact.
JUST GREAT vied for the lead along the rail but faded in the stretch. CANDY GRAY raced wellback in the four path but never menaced. TALLY'S RIVER
trailed throughout.
