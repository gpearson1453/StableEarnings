GLORY DIA gave a quick four wide move at the quarter pole showing full of run the final eighth to win going away. LOST ANCHOR chased the pace racing
four then three paths in upper stretch drifting in a bit while holding up for place. MY PINK BABY BIRD raced evenly to upper stretch rallying late in the four
path. TRUE HEIRESS slow early lagged to upper stretch showing some late interest. CLAIRE'S DARLING sent clear was overpowered into upper stretch
weakening late along the inside. DOUBLE D'S REVENGE off slowly played no factor. CAPTAIN ANNE was never involved. ARTISTIC ALIBI was always
outrun. LOLA FLO had speed through the turn then gave way in upper stretch.
