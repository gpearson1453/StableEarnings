wide along the turn, roused four wide into the lane, gained ground and came within aim at the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth,
found more in deep stretch while on the left lead and was up in the final strides to prevail. MR. FIGHTER rated off of the decent early pace, trailed into the
turn and went two wide to the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed with a rush while widest into the
final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while just earning the nod for place honors. TOWN PERFORMER asked for speed away

nearing the quarter pole, dug in into the stretch and held a narrow lead at the furlong marker, shook free into the final sixteenth, was tagged in the final
strides and just missed for the win and place, while holding safely for the show. MARS ON FIRE broke out a step at the start and bothered a neighboring

solid pace between foes nearing the top of the lane, chased his stablemate into the stretch and vied at the furlong marker, battled to the sixteenth marker,
could not find the needed late response and was outkicked in deep stretch. ITS THIEVERY tracked the decent early pace, maintained a two wide path into
the turn and was well placed approaching the quarter pole, raced a bit in traffic into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, needed more into the
final sixteenth and finished evenly. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the decent pace three deep nearing the half-mile
marker, chased into the turn and attended to the pace three wide at the quarter marker, chased outside of the leading pair heading to the furlong pole, could

Footnotes
COOLWIND was unhurried away from the start, saved ground along the first turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run, trailed into the second
turn and saved all of the ground approaching the quarter marker, swung four to five wide and was asked for run into the stretch, loomed at the furlong pole
and battled the stubborn WINGBACK into the final sixteenth, drifted in into deep stretch, surged in the final strides and got up in time to prevail for a
determined win. WINGBACK forwardly placed leaving the gate, took back off of the solid early pace and saved ground into the backstretch run, tracked the
quick pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased the pacesetter while saving ground into the second turn, tipped two wide into upper stretch and vied
for the lead nearing the furlong marker, became erratic and raced greenly while holding a slim lead at mid-stretch, met the bid of COOLWIND past the
furlong pole, battled that determined rival into deep stretch, was crowded a bit by the drifting COOLWIND and was bested in the final strides, while well clear
of the rest for second. GOODBYE KAI broke in a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, forwardly placed into the first turn, settled off of the quick early
pace and went two wide into the backstretch run, content to track the fast pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the second turn, tipped
three wide for the drive and vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, was squeezed by a pair of rivals past mid-stretch and checked while in tight
quarters, lost position into the final sixteenth and could not impact the top pair in deep stretch, while holding clear for third. NOT MY RODEO broke alertly
and assumed early command, showed the way into the first turn and drew to a clear lead into the backstretch run, pulled on the rider into the backstretch
and set quick fractions while on a long lead heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the far turn and held a clear lead at the quarter marker,
came under pressure into the stretch, was overtaken at the furlong marker and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
WORK TO LIVE away in good order, ceded the early lead to LADY GOOD TROUBLE and stalked that runner into the first turn, attended to the decent pace
along the backstretch run, was given her cue into the second turn and pressed the pace two wide nearing the quarter pole, took command into upper stretch
and drew off at the furlong marker, was kept to task to the sixteenth-pole and was geared down in the late stages to prevail as much the best.
SHEZARUNAWAY settled off of the decent early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, taken to the outside
into the second turn and was roused three wide at the quarter marker, shifted four wide into the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well into the
final sixteenth, was no match for the winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. BOLD DAUGHTER was unhurried away from the start and saved ground
into the first turn, was content to trail to the half-mile pole, guided two wide into the far turn, was roused three wide into the lane, found her best stride late
and was outfinished for second, while holding clear in the end for third. LADY GOOD TROUBLE hustled away from the start, assumed early command and
set the pace into the first turn, set decent fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the far turn and held a slim lead at the quarter
marker, was overtaken into the stretch, could not keep pace with WORK TO LIVE approaching the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. GEA
forwardly placed in the early stages, was caught five wide into the first turn, tracked four wide into the backstretch run, raced close up to the decent pace
approaching the half-mile marker, went two wide into the second turn and lost ground at the quarter pole, could not muster a response in the stretch drive
and weakened. J AND M EXPRESS forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the pace four wide and between runners along the first turn, advanced into
the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace approaching the half-mile mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn, was outkicked into the stretch,
could not keep pace into the final furlong and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
EMBRACEABLE YOU had to steady when NOTHING IS FOREVER was forced into the path gave the field a head start, was allowed to settle into stride
and was patiently ridden to the turn, took advantage of clear run on the rail through the turn then tipped out four wide for the stretch run, responded when
set down in the stretch with a spirited run down the lane and was along in plenty of time for the win. ANN LOVES MARK raced between a trio of horses
tracking CLARE'S BABY down the backstretch, broke away and made an early run at that rival from the nine-sixteenths pole, had trouble getting by that one
then was passed in the final sixteenths by the winner while getting the nod for the place. NOTHING IS FOREVER took up sharply at the break when
CLARE'S BABY came over after the start, and was left far behind in the early going, made a little forward progress through the turn but was still last turning
for home three wide, kept to task under strong handling then dove to the rail approaching the last furlong and found best stride in the final yards to gain third.
CLARE'S BABY veered in sharply at the start and bothered both NOTHING IS FOREVER and EMBRACEABLE YOU, still managed to secure a clear early
lead, maintained the margin through the turn, came into the stretch with something in reserve, weakened a bit past the furlong pole and was outkicked in the
final yards. ELWOOD ROAD was a little keen in the initial furlong but settled down and raced inside of a trio tracking the early leader, went into a stiff drive
from the five-sixteenths pole, swung three wide into the stretch, had dead aim on the leader in upper stretch but flattened out and was outfinished in the last
furlong while racing a little eratically. CANDY LITZ got away in good order, and raced with the tracking trio three wide down the backstretch, started to lose
ground approaching the quarter pole and had nothing to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD RUMOR forwardly placed in the early running, settled just off of the quick pace and tracked the leading pair heading to the half-mile marker,
saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, took command
into the final sixteenth, was kept to task into deep stretch and drew clear in the final strides to prevail. A PERFECT PATH tracked the solid early pace from
the second flight, gained ground into the turn and chased four wide approaching the quarter pole, swung to the five path into upper stretch and continued to
advance at the furlong marker, sustained her bid into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held well in the final strides for
second. DADDY INDEED rated off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and made a mild gain at the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch
and advanced at the furlong pole, needed more into the final sixteenth but was gaining in deep stretch and held well in the end for show honors.
LOCHMARA was bumped by a neighboring rival at the start and was away a bit slowly, unhurried in the early stages, raced two to three wide into the turn
and gained ground at the quarter pole while between runners, navigated traffic into the stretch, slipped to the inside at the furlong marker, closed willingly in
the late stages and missed for third. LILLY'S JOURNEY showed good speed away from the start, rushed up in the early going and pressed the solid pace
heading to the half-mile marker, dueled inside of EXTREME BLAZE into the turn and took command at the quarter pole, drifted out into upper stretch and
led to the furlong marker, was overtaken into the final sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. STANDFORGRIT prominent in the early stages, took back off
of the solid pace and tracked the leading pair into the turn, chased three wide heading to the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and was outrun to
the furlong marker, could not muster a response into the final sixteenth and weakened. ACHROMATIC hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, was
allowed to settle in the early running, taken to the outside entering the turn and gained ground three to four wide at the quarter marker, shifted five wide into
the stretch and offered a mild late rally. EXTREME BLAZE broke alertly and assumed early command, showed good speed and was pressed while setting
quick fractions heading to the half-mile marker, dueled with LILLY'S JOURNEY into the turn and lost the lead to that rival nearing the quarter marker, could
not keep pace into the stretch and stopped in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TIMELY COMFORT got bumped by R HEART OF GOLD at the start then pinballed into TOP WOLF, was still able to get good position early, taking up a
stalking position behind HOT CAKE to the turn, pulled even with that one two wide into the stretch, quickly seized command and drew off under a brisk hand
ride. HOT CAKE broke out at the start and bumped TOP WOLF but was able to speed to a clear early lead, held all at bay through the turn then was taken
on by TIMELY COMFORT at the quarter pole, could not match strides with that one down the lane but kept on to finish well clear of the next horse.
UPDRAFT settled three wide behind the tracking group, was under a drive from the three furlong pole, tipped out three wide into the stretch and continued
to run on under strong handling and steady urging to win the race for third. THE FUSS lacked any early foot then moved over to the rail once clear, saved
ground through the turn, came three wide into the stretch had trouble finding clear run to mid stretch, tipped out near the furlong pole and surged but missed
third. R HEART OF GOLD broke inward, bumped TIMELY COMFORT, then got sandwiched a few strides later between that foe and UPDRAFT, raced
close up three wide to the turn, was put into a drive and set out after the leaders, came into the stretch with good momentum but was unable to make any
headway, weakened late and was caught for the third spot in the last jumps. THECHIEFHASTRICKS got pinched back at the start when horses on both side
got forced into the path, dropped well behind the field in the early going, saved ground through the turn, still last at the top of the stretch, swung out to the
five path before the furlong marker and improved in the late stages. WHAT A RELIEF came away in good order, tracked close up while saving all the
ground, got clear run into the stretch but could not find another gear when needed. TOP WOLF got forced out at the break when HOT CAKE came over
then was bumped on the other side by TIMELY COMFORT who had been forced in by R HEART OF GOLD, raced mid-pack to the turn, tried to launch a
mild bid between horses from the three-eighths pole but did not quicken, finished one-paced and lost position in the last furlong. MISCHIEF'S KING drifted
out at the start, raced well behind the field down the backstretch, went into a drive three wide from the three eighths pole, did not respond and was unable to
improve down the lane.
