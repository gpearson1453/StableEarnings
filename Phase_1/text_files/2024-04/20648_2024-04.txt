Footnotes
SPIRITUAL LADY prompted outside of the leader, dueled with that one turning for home in the four path, bumped with her inner counterpart while wrestling
an advantage in upper stretch, then drove clear in the final furlong. GOLDYS LOCK chased along the inside, then stayed on shifting out in the lane and
reached place late. BLUE EYED SOUL (IRE) led inside of a prompting rival while four to three paths off the inside into the turn, dueled with that one turning
for home, exchanged contact while getting headed in upper stretch, resented a right handed crop, yielded in the final furlong and lost place lat. CHARM OF
THE SONG trialed along the inside, swung out to the six path advancing entering the lane, but leveled off without reaching contention. GIFT GORGEOUS
bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked four wide, pursued from the five path around the turn and yielded between horses. LADY JUNE was urged
along pursuing two wide and between horses into the turn, shifted out turning for home and made little impact. BROWNIE BAY was off awkwardly and
bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased from the five path before tucking to the three path into the turn, then tired between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
RAISE THE BAR sped forward to lead in the three path leaving the chute, brushed an inner rival to deter a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, cruised
away in hand entering the lane and held sway under confident handling. TUXEDO PARK stalked close up in the three path and between horses, then ran on
well chasing the leader home to prove second best. AKINMUSIRE hopped at the start and was last away, raced well back in the four path around the turn,
shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and offered a good belated kick to gain show at the sixteenth pole. MO HAIR SAM lunged outwardly at the
start and bothered multiple outer foes while doing so, raced forward two wide and between horses leaving the chute, backed out and yielded position with
three furlongs to go, then sustained stride in the lane to keep on for a minor share. HAPPYFLYER raced forwardly along the inside, was hustled leaving the
three furlong pole to attempt to slip inside of the leader and offer a bid, but was brushed by that one nearing the five sixteenths pole stalled out his challenge
approaching the lane and weakened hanging on his left lead. TAPIRS VALOR was unable to rush between horses and gain forward position soon after the
start, settled off of the pace in the three to four path, then moved up. ENDURING SPIRIT prompted in the four path and weakened on his left lead. ACE IT
leaned into an inner rival and bobbled slightly at the start, tugged keenly under restraint into the turn, raced well back in the two path turning for home and
made little impact. MISBEHAVIN was jostled by rivals on both sides and crowded between horses at the start, lacked speed in the four path and was outrun.
CUPID'S THUNDER failed to facto from the five path. BOTTOMS UP chased forwardly in the five to six path and weakened. SERGEANT CAPPS was
pinched back at the start and trailed throughout.

TOP OF THE STREET prompted outside of the leader, led into the far turn, drew away entering the lane and lasted from closers to the wire. STATELY
ORDER broke a step slow, raced at the rear along the inside, improved in the two path around the far turn before fanning to the four path entering the lane,
rallied outside of foes to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, took contact from inner rival soon after and forged place late. CURLINS INCHARGE tracked in
the two to three path, bid outside of the leader and from the three path turning for home, chased that one in upper stretch, drifted about and bumped an
outer place-bidder in the final sixteenth, and got outfinished. ACCONA broke a step slow, raced at the rear two wide, advanced in the four path around the
far turn, shifted in entering the lane, attempted a rail charge, but needed more while mildly lacking racing room. QUIET RUSH bumped an outer rival at the
start, laid off of the pace in the three path then failed to menace hanging on her left lead. MOONOVERMONTGOMERY stalked along the inside, chased
around the far turn and faded. VINO FA DANZA laid off of the pace in the four path, was done early, eased through the lane, jogged across the wire and
walked off. WAUHATCHIE was bumped by an inner rival at the start, set the pace inside of the eventual winner, got headed into the far turn, readily
retreated before being eased through the lane, jogged across the wire and walked off. PHOTO OP laid off of the pace along the inside, but weakened
between horses turning for home, was pulled up in the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
SAMARITA prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, vied before forging an advantage with three furlongs to go, drew off nearing the lane
and widened under a drive. MAZOKU pursued from midpack in the three path and between horse and ran on to edge place in midstretch. GHOSTLY NIGHT
tracked from midpack along the inside, slipped through tight rail quarters to bid for show at the furlong grounds and edged that position. GOSHEN tracked
from the two path bid for place between horses at the furlong grounds but was outkicked by rivals on either side. STORM CHARGING laid off of the pace in
the two path and improved position. PRINCESSTAPITURE lacked speed in the four to six path and failed to menace. FOREVER HOME showed the way
inside of a prompting foe, got headed around the bend before proving no match nearing the lane, then faltered between horses at the furlong grounds.
PROTOMAGIC pursued from the five path, then yielded between horses. GIN N SIN raced off of the pace in the four path among foes, checked out of tight
quarters into the turn and failed to factor. BANNED FROM MIDWAY trailed in the three path and got outrun.

MALIBU SPRINGS showed the way inside of a prompting rivals, kicked clear of that one entering the lane and drew off under a drive. DISSOLVED
prompted three wide, then two wide into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane and safely held place. CARCANO tracked two
wide and between horses, then ran on without threatening and was best of the rest. OVERBORE hopped when the gates sprung, bobbled upon landing and
spotted the rest multiple lengths at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, improved position moving to the four path around the far turn, then failed to
menace. GAMER tracked in the four path, then faded in the five path around the far turn. COACHES MEETING stalked from the two path, chased around
the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
NATIVE LAND stalked along the inside, pursued from the pocket just off the fence into the far turn, took aim outside of the leading pair tipping from the four
to five path entering the lane, ranged up changing leads leaving the furlong grounds, bid at the sixteenth pole and drove past. HEARTENED took contact
from an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path, bid outside of the top pair and from the four path at the five sixteenths pole, wrestled an
advantage entering the lane, dug in between horses as an outer rival menaced in the final furlong, but was bested by that one late. ROCKETEER broke out
and bumped a rival at the start, prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, vied along with an outer bidder around the far turn, got headed by
that one entering the lane, fought on gamely inside of a pair of foes in the final furlong but needed more to reclaim even terms. GAMBLERS TAIL pursued
from the four path, retreated to trail entering the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and moved up. KITTY HAWK bumped an inner rival leaving
the gates, showed the way in the two path, got headed by a pair of outer rivals turning for home and weakened. EVERDOIT was bumped by an inner foe at
the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and faded in the five path around the far turn.

Footnotes
PIPELINE showed the way in the three path, remained in hand while clear around the far turn and sealed the deal under a drive. NOT NORMAL pressed the
winner from the four path early on, chased down the backstretch and was second best. WOODCOCK FLIGHT (IRE) tracked from the five path, proved no
match for the top two and held show. LINCOLN HIGHWAY saved ground off of the pace to no avail. HE'S GOT THIS trailed two wide and never got
involved.
