Footnotes
DUST MAKER saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the four path
coming around the far bend, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear. CAIRO MOON raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way
on the inside up the backstretch, battled from the rail around the far bend and was caught in late stretch. DADDY'S GIRL raced off the pace on the inside
through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the second bend and gained ground mildly in the lane. OCCURRENCE raced in the three
path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch.
POP CHART bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far
turn in the two path and faded from there. PER THE HORSERACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, DUST MAKER HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A
POSITIVE TEST.
