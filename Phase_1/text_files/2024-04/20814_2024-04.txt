Footnotes
HAVE YOU HEARD settled on the outside under some restraint, moved closer while tucked in the three path around most of the turn, shifted five wide while
asked outside the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging. BADGE OF
WAR was well placed just off the pace, drafted behind horses in the two path for most of the turn, dropped to the rail while asked outside the quarter-pole,
pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. DARK DEVIL showed early speed then set the pace
on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, came off the inside into the stretch, lost the advantage to the
winner near the three-sixteenths pole and tired but just held the show. VENGE hit the inside of the gate and was off a step slow, angled in while urged along
towards the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GUILE bumped hard
with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked late on the backstretch, chased in the four path on the turn, dropped back while
remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and capitulated. LOGIN REQUIRED bumped hard with a foe at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in
the three path on the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and faltered then collapsed returning to be unsaddled. MITOLE'S DIAMOND broke a
step slow then dropped back while taken up off heels, moved out at the rear then fell well behind the rest of the field, rounded the turn in the four path and
trailed.

Footnotes
FIRST GLIMPSE chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
a furlong out, dug in under threat from a pair to the inside through to the finish and gamely held safe kept to task. COLLOQUY leapt up at the start getting
away last and conceding seven to eight lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun two to three wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to rally into contention through the final furlong while up for the place honors.
THUNDERIAN prompted the leader from the outside in the three path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command swinging four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the eighth pole, fought on to the finish. CENTAVO chased four then three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. DANGEROUS RIDE showed
the way in hand under prompting from THUNDERIAN to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and took the inside route
into upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five to six wide into upper stretch, weakened. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES broke in at the start and was corrected, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened.

turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch and held under strong urging. HOLD THE SALSA was rated just off the pace on the inside,
came under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the winner in the drive and willingly earned the place.

was roused on the far turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. SAMBURU (GB) bobbled
ever so slightly after the start, came in a bit leaving the chute, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while two then
three wide on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the last
spot in the superfecta. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER bumped with rivals leaving the chute then checked, went three wide around most of the first turn then
dropped to the two path, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and improved position. GOING CONCERN (GB) bumped with a rival shortly after

the stretch and lacked the needed response. RUSE was forced out leaving the chute, jostled with a rival into the first turn, went five wide on that bend, was
reserved on the outside, traveled four then five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. GHOSTLYPRINCE bumped with a foe
at the start, was bumped leaving the chute then taken up, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the three path on the
far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LANDBISCUIT bumped with a foe leaving the chute then steadied, shifted from three to five
wide early on the first turn, settled outside without the benefit of cover, was roused five wide on the far turn then driven six wide into the stretch and also
failed to threaten. COLLECT FROM IKE was forced out leaving the chute, jostled with a foe into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled off the
pace, rounded the far turn in the three path and also failed to rally. BLESS AMERICA came out a bit and bumped with a rival leaving the chute, raced in the
three path on the first turn, was spotted just off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn, dropped back three wide into the stretch and came up
empty. AUTHORIZE bumped with a foe at the start then bumped with another rival, went around the first turn in the four path, was rated just off the pace on
the outside, came under urging before the seven-sixteenths pole, went three then four wide on the far turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch,

stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. LOCKE AND KEY settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. MASON MANIA brushed with a rival at the start
then was hustled, moved up to make a bid between horses near the five-eighths pole, was asked between foes in the two path on the turn, dropped back
under a drive in upper stretch and tired while clear for the show. BAR FOURTEEN showed early speed and led the way, lost the advantage late on the
backstretch, vied in the three path while urged along on the turn and weakened. MAJESTIC FRONTIER brushed with an opponent at the start, was urged
along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. CLEVER FOREVER settled towards the back, was
urged between foes in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide late on the bend then floated to the five path and failed to respond. UNCLE MARTY
was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, dropped inward in upper stretch and was no factor. D'ONT LOSE CRUZ showed early
speed then pressed the pace on the inside, passed the half-mile pole on even terms for the lead, was asked along the rail while inside of two rivals on the
turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and retreated.

SHORT SHIFT broke out at the start bumping GENEROUS LUVA into ADULT ENTERTAINER and in turn TROUBLED LUCK, established the front and
showed the way under rating stargazing briefly into the first turn before settling into a comfortable rhythm along the inside, remained on hold as a pair of
rivals advanced outside into the far turn, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held
well to the finish. IN ALL MY DREAMS just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four
wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors. ASSISI forwardly placed just off the inside early on, advanced in tandem with
GENEROUS LUVA on the leader three furlongs from home, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while prevailing
for the show honors. GENEROUS LUVA got bumped at the start by SHORT SHIFT and in turn bumped ADULT ENTERTAINER into TROUBLED LUCK,
raced three wide through the first turn pulling a bit eager early on, chased three wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, offered up a bid in concert
with the aforementioned foe to latch on the leader near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BROOKLYN
DANTZ coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no
response. TROUBLED LUCK got bumped at the start by ADULT ENTERTAINER due to pressure from SHORT SHIFT, raced four then three wide through
the first turn, settled under some urging, checked off heels leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on far turn, came eight wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. ADULT ENTERTAINER got bumped and pinched back at the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
six wide into upper stretch and tired.
