Footnotes
GOLDEN WILDCAT vied three then two wide and edged off through the final furlong while kept to his task. FREEDOM'S START chased in midpack,
advanced inside, angled out in the stretch rallying to narrow the gap. CHIP'S FRIEND vied between rivals then inside and weakened slightly in the stretch.
KABOD dueled along the inside, steadied near the three eighths pole and faded. STARSHIP GOTHAM chased along the inside and continued willingly
while no threat. SMARTEN UP dropped back outside then moved very wide with a mild rally. EDDIEMUSH raced wide between rivals in the opening half
and was no factor. WHERESTHEPASSION trailed far behind then passed tiring rivals. OUR ANDREW B moved within striking range early then faded on
the turn. MR. TUTTLE dropped back inside and weakened steadily. BACK EAST was well placed outside the dueling pacesetters then stopped abruptly. A
claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the third finisher for interference on the turn was dismissed.

DONTINVADEMYSPACE dueled between rivals, drew away after half a mile then was kept to a drive while staying safe. DAD'S ON A ROLL far behind
early, swung wide rallying at the quarter pole then closed well too late. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA bid wide on the final turn then flattened out in the stretch.
DOCTOR DOOM far back early, raced very wide and lacked a solid rally. MIDNIGHT CAT well placed behind trio of pacesetters, faded on the final turn.
DREAM OF BLESSINGS trailed for five furlongs then passed rivals without menacing. SENSIBLE JIM outrun early, bid inside on the final turn then proved
empty. FOREVER WICKED lagged far back and was never in contention. GIVE IT A GO chased in midpack and was never a factor. SAILOR'S RETURN
vied outside for half a mile then gave way. SMARTHUMOR flashed speed along the inside then stopped abruptly.
