Footnotes
GOLD FOOT dueled from outside first time through the lane, chased outside HOT LEGS ROMOLO around the first turn, moved up to apply pressure again
on the backstretch, stayed alongside through the far turn, drew on even terms again in the lane, battled into deep stretch and dug in to edge HOT LEGS
ROMOLO late. HOT LEGS ROMOLO dueled inside GOLD FOOT before taking command around the first turn, pressured by that rival again on the
backstretch, maintained a short lead through the far turn, dueled through the lane and yielded grudgingly in the end. CARIBBEAN KING stalked in the two
path then between rivals, roused past the quarter pole, finished willingly in the drive and held the show. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS stalked the pace from
inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, remained inside in the lane and went evenly late. PROMISSIO settled in the two path, chased between rivals into the
far turn, spun three wide into the lane, produced a mild rally and whittle the gap late. MIGHTY KAI pulled a bit between rivals early, steered to the inside and
settled along the rail, saved ground through the far turn, chased a bit off the rail into the lane, kept on through the stretch and ran into traffic late halting his
momentum. HARD MISSION reserved at the back early on, went three deep into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and failed to threaten.
MONGOLIAN ALTAI tracked three deep around the first turn, remained three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
OUR BUCKY CHARM got brushed by outer rival leaving the gate, showed good early speed from inside to clear, challenged by the runner-up at the
five-sixteenths pole, cleared that rival in upper stretch and drew away under urging. SMOKEM IF U GOTTEM chased the early speed outside a rival, bid
three to four wide midway around the bend, fought to upper stretch, then failed to kick on with the winner but was clearly second best. EAGLES DARE away
quickly then chased the pacesetter off the inside, took the turn two to three wide, could not summon the needed late kick while coming home a clear third.
BLAME THE CLASSIC was off slow to begin, chased well off the rail from off the pace to the turn, rounded the bend four wide and failed to menace.
WHATS THE BUZZ broke in and brushed the winner, chased out of range three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend and lacked
further response. EVERTORIANO stumbled leaving the gate, dropped back while under urging, raced along the rail into the turn, eased off the fence around
the bend and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
SNEAKER prompted the pace from outside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, cleared shortly after and held safely on the wrong lead. SAFA broke a step
slow and got bothered by inner rival, tucked inside trailing early, went two wide into the far turn, angled widest and came five wide into the stretch, closed
well but could not reach the winner. QUICK KATE settled along the rail, moved into range on the backstretch, tipped two wide late on the far turn, chased
within range through the lane and faltered in deep stretch. DORIE MILLER stalked two wide then moved to the rail on the clubhouse turn, moved out and
took aim three wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. PUTT FOR DOUGH chased three wide into the first turn then moved into the two path between rivals,
got boxed in behind a rival from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths marker, swung out leaving the far turn and weakened. GREASE MISSLE
broke a bit slow, was keen early on while forced four wide into the first turn then traveled three deep around the bend, continued outside a pair of rivals
leaving the backstretch, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. THE SHUSHALA set the pace along the rail under pressure, folded after losing
command at the quarter pole, eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader at the three-eighths and took over shortly after, put away inner rival past the
five-sixteenths pole while taking pressure from HAPPY JACK to the outside, maintained a short lead to midstretch, then drew clear in the last sixteenth to
prove best. HAPPY JACK chased three deep up the backstretch, bid outside the top pair midway around the bend and fought outside THE CHOSEN VRON
late on the bend, kept the pressure on into the final furlong but lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch. EXPRESS TRAIN tracked the speed four wide
into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, tipped back out a bit approaching the stretch, could not summon a rally in the stretch run but kept
on for a clear third. ZEUS' WAR hit the gate to lose a step in the beginning, trailed wide up the backstretch, took the turn four to five wide and improved
position. SEE THROUGH IT chased towards the rear early on, went two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the lane and lacked further
response. PRINCE ABU DHABI forwardly placed early, asked two wide around the turn and came up empty in the stretch run. FORBIDDEN KINGDOM took
control early and set the pace under pressure from THE CHOSEN VRON to the outside, relinquished the lead to that rival approaching the five-sixteenths
pole, chased after the top pair late on the bend and gave way down the lane.

Footnotes
BIG HAT WILLIE forwardly placed three deep on the clubhouse turn, challenged the leader from outside on the second bend, led three wide into the lane,
cleared upper stretch and edged away in the final sixteenth. ANMER HALL settled inside, coaxed forward on the first turn then raced keenly when taken in
hand leaving the bend, saved ground through the far turn and was roused with a quarter mile remaining, cut the corner into the stretch, finished willingly
down the lane and held the place. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) stalked two then three wide around the first turn, moved back into the two path on the
backstretch, angled four wide approaching the stretch, chased within striking distance through the lane but finished evenly to secure third. LAHAINA
FLAVOR traveled outside a rival off the pace, swung out into the lane, finished willingly from the middle portion of the track and was denied third.
TARANTINO stalked on the inside then moved into the two path on the first turn, was taken in hand around the bend, roused on the fence on the far turn,
stayed inside in the drive and lacked a rally. INCREDIBLE SHOT unhurried in the early going, saved ground through both turns, asked right handed entering
the stretch and proved no menace. KIMMER steered to the inside racing at the back, trailed into the lane and was never a factor. THREEBROTHERS
showed keen early foot two then three wide around the first turn, continued to set the pace in the middle stages, confronted by a rival on the far turn and
dueled around the bend, overtaken approaching the stretch and faded.

TOP GUN TOMMY forwardly placed outside the top pair, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, took over past the quarter pole and cleared into the
stretch, then drew away under right handed encouragement and steady handling in the last sixteenth. TRUSTY RUSTY stalked two wide into the turn,
moved over to the rail to save ground, angled out at the top of the stretch, finished well but could not threaten the winner. LAMBEAU dueled for the lead
from outside, vied between rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, chased the new leader into the stretch, kept on through the lane and edged LANSDOWNE
(GB) for third. LANSDOWNE (GB) dueled from inside to the turn, vied inside rivals midway around the bend, chased after TOP GUN TOMMY entering the
lane and lost the battle for third. THE LITTLE H MAN chased briefly off the pace then moved into range six deep, exited the bend outside a trio of rivals and
flattened out. GOOD VIBES ONLY bumped with ELECTOR leaving the gate, raced in range five deep early, moved into the three path around the bend,
came four wide into the stretch and weakened. ELECTOR bobbled and got bumped back at the start, trailed seven wide into the turn, ridden along while
moving into the five path around the bend and was never a factor. MIDNIGHT FURY chased four deep early on, dropped back while moving in some on the
turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
LEGISLATOR traveled near the back well off the pace, went two wide into the turn, angled out across the dirt, rallied to challenge with a sixteenth
remaining, fought four deep to the wire and won the bob on the line. TIGERHON (FR) raced in range off the inside then angled in on the turn, bid between
rivals at the three-sixteenths pole, moved over to the inside once clear, fought inside a trio of rivals in deep stretch and lost the head-bob to LEGISLATOR.
FORGIVING SPIRIT vied three deep then ceded command to the inner rivals, stalked three wide around the bend, drifted out a bit to brush CALI BAY (IRE)
crossing the dirt, battled through the lane and got outkicked. CALI BAY (IRE) tracked three to four wide, got brushed and floated out a bit across the dirt,
challenged five wide into the stretch, held a narrow lead entering the final sixteenth and got outkicked. SHORTMAN was off slow in the beginning, coaxed
along trailing the field, saved ground on the rail then tipped around weakening rival on the turn and finished well through the lane. ON THE WHIM sat off the
pace, moved into the two path for the turn, angled widest late on the bend and kept trying to the wire. FLEET FEET vied from between foes early, dueled
outside a rival around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened. BELMONT BILL vied inside a pair of rivals early, dueled inside FLEET FEET
around the bend and gave way in the stretch. LAWLESS WORLD chased on the inside to the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
AMERICAN CAT hustled early and took over around the first turn in the two path, cleared into the backstretch, asked at the five-sixteenths pole, showed the
way two wide into the stretch, met bids from both sides late and gamely prevailed. FIREMAN DAN stalked in the three path on the first turn, fell out of range
on the backstretch, drew closer staying off the rail on the far turn, spun four wide into the lane, challenged three deep in the final furlong and could not get
by the winner. SYNTACTIC settled a bit off the rail then moved inside, went outside a rival on the backstretch, gained inside through the far turn, rallied
along the fence in the final furlong and missed second. MY PARTNER GLEN tracked four to five wide early, driven two wide into the lane, found the rail int
the stretch and offered a mild response to round out the superfecta. LETTHELIQUORTALK chased five then four wide early, moved into range on the far
turn, came five wide into the lane and flattened out. THOMPSON away quickly, forwardly placed near the inside, dropped back in the middle stages and
passed tired rivals down the lane. DERECHO DANDY chased three deep into the first turn, started to climb around the bend, continued near the back into
the far turn, chased two wide into the lane and failed to menace. HANDSOME HARRY chased along the rail then moved into the two path on the clubhouse
turn, dropped back on the backstretch, trailed into the far turn, passed a tired rival and failed to make an impact. L'ENFANT DIT had early speed then
chased the new leader three wide into the backstretch, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
ASHCROFT stalked three deep early, moved up to challenge outside the top pair on the backstretch, dueled inside SMART MO past the five-sixteenths
pole, maintained a short lead over that rival through the lane and gamely prevailed. SMART MO stalked four deep on the first turn, raced up close from
outside on the backstretch, vied four deep on the second bend, dueled outside ASHCROFT past the five-sixteenths pole, battled down the lane and could
not get by the winner. FAUSTIN tracked two wide or between rivals, angled out and raced four wide turning for home, put in a mild late bid but lacked the
needed final kick in deep stretch. ULTIMATE GAMBLE settled three wide, moved in range outside rivals, eased further out and came five wide into the
stretch, finished willingly from outside and rounded out the superfecta. YELLOW BRICK stalked along the inside, tipped three wide on the far turn, moved in
some midstretch and could not find the needed late response. I DON'T GET IT traveled in the two path at the back early, advanced around the far turn but
failed to threaten in the lane. ST. ELMO raced along the rail near the back early, trailed into the far turn and passed tired rivals in the stretch. HEY
BROTHER sped to the front in the two path, took an awkward step late on the first turn while being confronted by outer rival, dueled from inside up the
backstretch while losing command, regained the lead into the far turn, yielded at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the drive, tired in the stretch,
eased to the wire and walked off. SANTO DIOS (ARG) took an awkward step when running on heels around the first turn, chased two wide into the far turn,
had little left turning for home, eased and walked off. IT'S MY HOUSE stalked two wide then went up to challenge for command from outside late on the
clubhouse turn, put a head in front on the backstretch, lost command into the far turn, dropped back around the bend, tired and eased in the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
SUNSET GLORY (IRE) broke a step slow, content to trail on the inside early, went between rivals into the far turn, got boxed in at the quarter pole, trailed
two wide into the lane, started to gain quickly, surged between late and edged IMA JOKER for the victory. IMA JOKER settled in mid-pack on the inside,
pulled from the five-eighths pole to the nine-sixteenths marker, chased between in the two path leaving the backstretch, waited two then three wide on the
far turn, tipped out and commenced a rally but got outclosed by SUNSET GLORY (IRE) in the final strides. WILLA T unhurried in the early going from the
rail, coaxed along on the far turn saving ground, tipped two wide in upper stretch, split foes and got bumped past the eighth pole and finished gamely for the
show honors. RUNYON CANYON tracked two wide, bid three deep at the quarter pole, fought four wide into the lane, took over in upper stretch, shifted in
past the eighth pole, led late and was run down. KELLY'S OUT (IRE) located near the back early in the two path, chased three deep on the far turn, ran into
mild traffic at the quarter pole and split foes four wide leaving the bend, chased within range with a furlong remaining but needed to find more late. BALTIC
FIRE tracked from inside, bid inside, late on the far turn, got bumped past the eighth pole and weakened. IRISH ROSE rated on the inside, bid two wide
past the three-eighths pole, took over with a quarter mile left to run, led three wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, bothered by RUNYON
CANYON and steadied at the eighth pole and weakened. DEN OF INIQUITY (GB) sat off the pace in the two path, went three deep into the far turn, spun
five wide into the lane and weakened. SWEET GEM sped clear and moved inside, showed the way to the far turn, challenged past the three-eighths pole,
lost command near the quarter pole and gave way. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED RUNYON CANYON FROM THIRD TO
FOURTH FOR SHIFTING IN AND FORCING IRISH ROSE INTO WILLA T AT THE EIGHTH POLE, COSTING WILLA T A CHANCE AT SOLE
OWNERSHIP OF THIRD PLACE.
