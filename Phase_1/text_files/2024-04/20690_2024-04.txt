OTTOMAN EMPIRE pressed the pace from the outside, made a three wide bid off the turn and had a long drive with BIG CREED and edged clear late to
prove best. BIG CREED set a pressured pace on the inside, dug in gamely in the drive but was out-kicked late while being clearly second best. BAJA
BOOGIE was reserved early two wide, advanced three to four wide on the turn, then had a mild late rally to clearly best the rest. REIGN OVER ME was
settled back early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally for the minor rewards. SPEND AGAIN was settled early on the inside, came four wide
into the lane and had no rally. MOTOWN CLASSIC tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. TRIPPLE SHAKE chased the pace three to two wide and
tired.

Footnotes
MITHQAAL was well placed on the inside, made a three wide bid on the far turn, then had a long drive with BLUEGRASS FAITH and slowly edged clear late
to prove best. BLUEGRASS FAITH pressed the early pace three wide, made a bid in between rivals on the turn, then was out-kicked late by the winner,
second best. BRAZEN NOW set a pressured pace on the inside, then vied for command on the inside on the far turn, angled off the inside leaving the turn
and weakened. OPEN ROAD was reserved early on the inside, came four wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. BULLAWAY was dwelt at the start,
then rushed three wide and tired. SILVER DADDY was settled back on the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and offered no rally. STEWARDS
INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE START BUT THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS AND MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
CATS GOTTA CHANCE set the early pace in the two path while clear, then was given a breather and turned back bids and drew clear on the far turn, then
remained clear to wire to prove best. JON L chased the pace four wide and finished well to be clearly second best. DOM WAYNE tracked the early pace
and made a early three wide bid but flattened out, saved show award. IZA DADDY was four wide into the first turn, settled on the outside and came five
wide into the lane and had a mild late rally. NORTHERN QUEST passed the tiring rivals. DUBRONSKY was rated early, made a inside middle move to
press the pace by the three eighths marker, then took a bad step on the turn and weakened. WILLTOBELUCKY failed to menace. CEBOLLA failed to
respond. GORDY'S RULES chased the pace on th e inside and stopped.
