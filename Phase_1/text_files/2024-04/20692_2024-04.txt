Footnotes
JIMMY DAN was away alertly at the start, set a pressured pace to lead throughout the race, held off a late bid by I AM FORTUNATA (IRE), then drew clear
at the stretch for an authoritative win. I AM FORTUNATA (IRE) started close behind the leaders, gained ground on JIMMY DAN after the first mile,
challenged for the lead after the 8th fence but could not sustain the bid to finish second best. BEOWULF (IRE) ran evenly through the first mile, gained
ground on the leaders after the 7th fence, was unable to maintain the pace, lost ground before the stretch, and held off DIZZY KITTY for show. DIZZY
KITTY ran evenly throughout, made no gain in position during the race, but made a stretch bid to pass the nearest rival before the wire. TRISAETUM ran
evenly during the first mile, bid for better position after the 7th fence, was unable to keep pace with the leaders, lost ground before the last fence, and had
no stretch rally. LARGER THAN LIFE ran evenly during the first mile, gained ground on the leaders 1/2 mile from home, fell at the 8th fence and was
vanned off. GET KHOZY broke sharply, showed early speed, pressing the pace of the leader through the first mile, then backed out of contention, tired, and
pulled up after the 7th fence and walked off. BUNKER HILL trailed throughout, tired and pulled up after the 7th fence and walked off. ICE BAR ran out the
back, landed awkwardly over the 4th fence and lost his rider.

GO POKE THE BEAR was away alertly, led throughout the race, was challenged by ZIGGLE POPS (GB) 1/4 mile from home, rallied to maintain the lead
and prevailed at the wire. ROCKET ONE trailed the field through the first five fences, was allowed to settle back further to the 6th fence, began to rally after
the 7th fence, running wide on the outside, steadily advancing on the leaders, and entered the stretch in contention to finish second best. TEASE AND
SEIZE (FR) kept pace behind the leaders throughout the race, rallied to approach the stretch in contention, landed awkwardly over the last fence, could not
meet the challenge of ROCKET ONE and finished with the show. ZIGGLE POPS (GB) stalked the pace through eight fences, bid 1/4 mile from home and
flattened in the stretch. L'OR DES ROSES (FR) ran evenly throughout the race and was never a threat. SOVIET PIMPERNEL (IRE) trailed the field early,
gained position after the 5th fence, held position until the 7th fence, then dropped back to trail the remainder of the race.
