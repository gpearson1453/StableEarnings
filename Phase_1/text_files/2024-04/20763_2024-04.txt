Footnotes
ZOFFARELLI (IRE) stepped to the front quickly, showed the way along the inside down the hill, given his cue at the top of the stretch, asked right handed in
the final furlong and held well. LOVESICK BLUES stalked the leader three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, chased within
striking distance through the lane, had to alter in a bit from behind the winner late and held second. BEEF WINSLOW settled at the back off the rail, moved
into the two path entering the turn, moved into range while angling out and spun four wide into the lane, loomed from outside in the final furlong but failed to
summon the needed late kick. PLAYER B gave chased along the rail and could not respond when called upon.

YELLOW SUN DRESS stalked behind the leader on the inside into the turn, chased a bit off the rail leaving the bend, tipped out and set her sets on the JAI
HO in upper stretch, drew up on even terms and dueled into deep stretch, then dug in late to edged the runner-up. JAI HO pressed the pace from outside,
headed the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, took over into the lane, edged clear briefly at the eighth pole, challenged by YELLOW SUN DRESS shortly
after, dueled through the last sixteenth but got outkicked. MS MCWHINNEY traveled outside a rival at the back into the turn, got blocked behind
KIMBERLY'S DEVIL and bumped with inner rival early on the turn, gained an opening near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch and finished
with late run to earn the show. SABRES set the pace inside a rival up the backstretch, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, lost command exiting the bend,
fought to midstretch and weakened late. PRECIPICE broke a hair slow then settled three deep early, drew closer four then three wide on the turn, moved
back out at the top of the lane and could not rally. I'M STILL IN IT stalked off the inside then angled in on the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, took
aim entering the stretch but weakened down the lane. IN WITHOUT KNOCKIN coaxed early near the back and moved inside, got bumped by outer rival
past the three-eighths pole, continued along the fence to the stretch and failed to menace. KIMBERLY'S DEVIL chased three wide into the turn, shifted in to
bother rivals early on the bend, dropped back and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
NORMANDY LANDING was well placed early stalking the top trio from inside, moved off the rail on the backstretch, chased three wide into the far turn, bid
four deep past the five-sixteenths pole, took over and cleared leaving the bend while moving into the three path, drifted to the rail in upper stretch and drew
away in the furlong grounds. MONGOLIAN GOLD lacked early speed and tucked inside at the back, lagged behind up the backstretch, gained some ground
two then three wide on the far turn still far back, moved out in the lane and rallied to best the rest. DURAN vied for the lead between rivals to the quarter
pole, chased the new leader two wide into the lane and weakened while managing to save third. FAST CHAZ vied inside a pair of rivals, carried a short lead
to the quarter pole, overtaken by the winner shortly after and weakened in the lane. NUCLEAR fought three deep for command to the quarter pole and gave
way.

Footnotes
TRAVELIN' SHOW forwardly placed on the outside early, roused three wide on the turn, drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole and drove clear in the
final sixteenth. LUCKY N SMART off slow to begin, sat off the pace along the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, angled out with a furlong remaining and
got up for second. CAPITAL OUTLAY sped to the front then dueled outside a rival into the turn, maintained command to the stretch, relinquished the lead
past the eighth pole, shortened late and managed to save third. JUST A GRAZE off slow to begin, traveled outside a rival off the pace, went two wide into
the turn, moved out to the four path around the bend, tipped out into the lane, kept on through the drive and missed the show. WESTERN GRIT stalked the
leader for a bit then moved up to duel from inside into the turn, fought along the rail through the bend, stayed on to the eighth pole then weakened in the late
stages. J DUTTON away quickly then dropped back to a stalking position, rounded the bend in the four path and weakened in the drive. IGNATOWSKI off
slow in the beginning, laid off the pace outside a pair of rivals, navigated the turn three to four wide and proved no menace. MOTIVATING FORCE tracked
between foes early, entered the lane three deep and weakened. DATSYUK broke a step slow, steered to the inside and moved into range up the
backstretch, chased two wide exiting the turn and faded. MUCHO SUERTE broke a bit slow, dropped back and lagged behind, saved ground through the
turn but was never a factor.

Footnotes
TIZ TOK stalked in the two path then between rivals, moved inside for the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, dug in along the rail to collar the leader at
the sixteenth pole, put a head in front late and held over SEATTLE BREAKOUT in the closing moments. SEATTLE BREAKOUT was closest in pursuit two
then three wide early, chased between foes on the backstretch and far turn, drew alongside the leader approaching the sixteenth pole and got outkicked by
TIZ TOK in the final fifty yards. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT took control early and moved to the rail then eased over to the two path, showed the way on the inside
through the far turn, remained clear into the final furlong, confronted by opponents on both sides at the sixteenth pole, finished gamely to the wire but
succumbed to the pressure. FIFTY CINCO stalked three then four wide on the first turn, tracked four then three deep in the middle stages, remained three
wide into the lane and could not summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. AURELIAN MAN chased four then five wide around the clubhouse turn, kept
off the inside and spun four wide into the lane, then weakened in the stretch run. BRAVESTONE was off a bit slow to begin, moved down to the inside,
trailed into the far turn, dropped back around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
MOON ICE set the pace under pressure from outer rival, brushed early on the turn, shook free around the bend, cornered nicely into the stretch while
starting to draw away and remained well clear under urging. CHARLEY PRIDE was off slow to begin, sat off the pace along the rail, saved ground to the
stretch, rallied up the fence and gained second. ANTIBES chased outside a rival off the pace, started to move but got blocked behind rivals and had to take
up at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out to the four path, finished determinedly and missed second. GHOSTLY ACT stalked the top pair from outside, got
floated out and bobbled past the three-eighths pole, bumped with inner rival entering the lane, was closest in pursuit with a furlong left to run and got
outfinished for the place and show. DRIVE FOR SHOW tracked the pace from inside, bumped with outer rival into the lane, lost path in upper stretch and
churned on to the wire. HANDSOME RED was off slow to start, trailed early then passed a rival up the backstretch, took the turn two wide, moved out in the
lane and failed to rally. FINNERS GOLDNSENSE pressed the pace from outside, bumped with the leader past the three-eighths pole, chased two wide to
the stretch and faded. DAPITAN STAR took a bump from inner rival to lose a step at the start, traveled near the back off the rail then trailed and moved
inside for the turn, continued at the back and entered the stretch two wide but failed to threaten. UNUSUAL MEASURE bumped outer rival at the start, raced
in range outside rivals, got floated out early on the turn and took a bad step, spun three wide into the lane, had the rider lose his whip at the eighth pole and
came up empty.

MR FISK tracked the pace two to three wide early, chased widest up the backstretch, bid three deep on the far turn then dueled past the five-sixteenths
pole, inched ahead late on the bend, put away JUDGE MILLER with a furlong remaining and drew away in deep stretch. JUDGE MILLER took control early
and moved inside, showed the way up the backstretch feeling slight pressure to the outside, challenged by a pair of rivals on the far turn, dueled with MR
FISK past the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead with a quarter mile remaining, fought to upper stretch and stayed on to hold second. MIXTO stalked
from the two path early, flanked the leader from outside on the backstretch, bid three wide then between rivals on the far turn, got crowded and had to pause
past the five-sixteenths pole, spun four wide into the lane and kept on to the wire. NONE ABOVE THE LAW broke a bit slow, rated along the inside early,
roused at the five-sixteenths pole but had already began to lose ground and weakened through the stretch.

Footnotes
MEDORO chased keenly behind the top pair for a bit before split those rivals to duel into the first turn, pressed SHILOH'S MISTRESS to the five-sixteenths
pole, drew on even terms late on the bend, put a head in front at the top of the stretch, battled through the final furlong holding a slight advantage and
gamely prevailed. SHILOH'S MISTRESS dueled for the lead from inside first time through the stretch, inched ahead around the first turn, set the pace under
pressure up the backstretch, headed by MEDORO with a quarter mile remaining, lost command at the top of the stretch, battled back through the furlong
grounds and narrowly missed. CIRCLE OF TRUST stalked behind the leaders then had to take up crossing the finish line for the first time, continued in a
good spot on the inside, came under a ride on the far turn, chased two wide into the lane, stayed within striking distance with a furlong remaining, tipped out
in deep stretch and finished willingly to gain late on the top pair. PINK WHITNEY stalked three deep early then moved into the two path for the first turn,
continued two wide on the far turn then between rivals at the quarter pole, moved out a bit in the lane and could not produce a bid. ENGLISH DANGER
settled at the back and moved inside, asked right handed leaving the far turn and weakened in the drive. BRAND NEW DREAM stalked three wide around
both turns, had the rider lost his whip at the three-sixteenths pole and also weakened.

and a showing up the crop and was geared down approaching the wire. PRINCIP settled along the inside, came off the rail into the stretch, split foes at the
eighth pole and bested the rest. HARD TO FIGURE dueled inside MAN O ROSE for the lead, kept the pressure on to the five-sixteenths pole, lost touch

pole and drove clear. CALM SEA pressed the pace from outside, took a narrow lead between rivals on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, put away
inner rivals entering the lane, collared at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. ONE OF THESE DAYS (IRE) bobbled leaving the gate, stalked next to the rail
inside rivals, came under a ride on the far turn while shifting over to the two path, could not summon the needed response in the final furlong but kept on to
secure the show. ORDER AND LAW stalked widest down the hill then three deep, tipped four wide past the quarter pole and improved position. LINCOLN
HAWK (IRE) reserved early off the rail then outside a rival, chased three deep at the quarter pole, swung out leaving the bend and finished with a mild rally.
MO REWARDS set the pace under pressure from outer rival, lost command on the backstretch but continued to dispute the pace inside a pair of rivals,
failed to keep up with the leader leaving the far turn and weakened in the drive. BEE CATCHER stalked between rivals and became rank into the clubhouse
turn, dropped back on the far turn and failed to menace. BETTER THAN GOLD hopped at bit at the start, had to steady when a rival came over early, pulled
along the inside to the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the stretch and could not rally. GOLDENEYE bobbled leaving the gate, pulled and became
rank early, chased three wide on the clubhouse turn then moved out and went four deep into the backstretch, challenged three deep on the backstretch and
fought for command to the far turn, could not keep up with the top pair midway around the bend and tired down the lane.
