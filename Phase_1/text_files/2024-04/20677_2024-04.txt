steady gain, but was no real factor. UNIFIED LOVE broke in, brushed rival, racing in the back, showed late interest, but was no threat. QUEEN OF THE

KELLYS THE BOSS pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, drove clear and held on well. DROMAS vied for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. UNAFFILIATED bothered at the start, racing in the back, made a wide gain and proved no
match for the top two. JOVIE G dueled on the front end, saved ground and weakened. BOONE LAND EXPRESS raced near the middle of the field, came
around the turn on the outside, made a wide bid and hung. BOBBY JR. raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid.
SIMPLICATED broke out, steadied and raced evenly near the back. MISTY RUNAWAY raced within contention, faded and was no threat late.
UNITEDAPPEAL void of early speed, lost contact with the field and was eased.

RYAN'S GRACE pressed the pace, moved up on the outside around the second turn, rallied down the lane, drove clear and finished well. THAT IS
AWESOME sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. INDY LOVER lacked early speed,
moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and proved third best. SANTANGELO raced near the middle of the field, came around the
first turn five wide and put forth an even effort. A P HUMOR raced near the middle of the pack, was wide coming down the final stretch, finished evenly and
was never a factor. FITTS N STARTS pressed the early pace and faded. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS void of early speed and was never close.

Footnotes
DOUBLE BARREL MAN pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a stretch bid and was going away at the end. COROT unhurried in the
beginning, came around the turn on the outside, made a bid, racing six wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second at the wire. INDIA INK
broke through the gates before the start, went to the front, bumped with LIKEN IT, pulled clear and lacked a late kick. THE FEATURE pressed the pace,
made a bid around the turn, finished five wide and weakened. LIKEN IT bumped at the start, raced near the back and was never a factor, while finishing on
the rail. SLITHER pressed the pace, faded and was no threat late. OUR FREDDIE MAC raced within contention and dropped back. FIRST LINE void of
early speed and trailed throughout.
