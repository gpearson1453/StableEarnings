Footnotes
GREEK HEIRESS broke with the field, edged clear toward the inside before a quarter, rated into the turn while in the two path, steadily drew out through the
lane under a hand ride to win ridden out. RIBBONSINHERHAIR in the second flight while in the two path, dropped to the inside for the drive, rallied mildly up
the rail to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. INSIGHTFUL MISS prompted the winner from the outside and in the three path, could do little
with that one through the stretch, outkicked late for the second spot. COLLECTED GLORY trailed early, raced three to four wide out of the turn, made little
impact through the stretch while remaining well out in the strip. ESPIRIDION forwardly placed, raced four wide through the turn, weakened in the drive.
LUCKSME was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY LOTTIE forwardly placed inside, patiently handled behind the leader through much of the turn, tipped out into the two path late in the bend, took
over into the stretch, drew clear, kept to task inside the furlong grounds. DOCS SEVEN back off the pace and the inside, angled out to be four wide into the
stretch, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. TENACIOUS LADY in the second flight while racing outside, floated out to be four wide into the
lane, closest to the winner a furlong out, failed to contain the runner up, saved the show late. AWESOME VIEW within striking distance off the inside,
between horses and three wide turning for home, came up empty for the stretch run. VARTON took command soon after the start, cleared to the inside turn,
gave way when headed by the winner entering the stretch. CHECKCASHINGCONNIE lacked speed, carried out five wide turning into the lane, failed to
rally. SHE DAZZLE off a bit slow, trailed most of the way to be always outrun. CATCHUSIFYOUCAN raced in mid pack and the two path for a half, steady
retreat down the stretch.

Footnotes
ALAMO in the second flight while racing off the inside, in some traffic late backstretch, moved closer three wide late in the second turn in preparation to
strike, challenged outside the leader entering the stretch, dueled through upper stretch, edged clear late. PIVOSKY also in the second group early, closer
three wide to vie into the far turn, put a head in front soon after, responded when the winner came alongside exiting the final bend, dueled, could not match
strides the final furlong, clearly second best. SWEET SWEETFANTASY bothered a bit a the break, moved up to race in mid pack while racing inside,
steadied briefly late in the first bend, moved out, three to four wide midway on the far turn when moving a bit closer, continued mildly to the wire to finish
best of the rest, no match for the top pair. WHAT'S TO DO void of speed, four wide through the final turn making minor improvement, picked off another rival
or two in upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. UNSTABLE PRINCESS broke back, lacked speed for five furlongs, asked along off the inside
far turn, checked up in tight quarters soon after, recovered and improved position with some belated interest. LIL TOWN SIS lacked early speed inside, two
path second turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. GI GIS MAP broke in, prompted the issue up front, brief bid between horses far turn,
weakened soon after. QUIERO DINERO four wide through the first turn, continued in mid pack, had little left for the drive. GATA RUNZ broke on top, set the
pace inside, stopped far turn when headed by the runner up.

Footnotes
CHAOS REIGNS broke on top, set the pace along the inside, extended that advantage into and through upper stretch, enough left to just last. AIN'T THAT
A KICK broke back, lacked speed for five furlongs, asked along far turn, made a good advance in the two path through some traffic into the stretch, angled
out a bit and continued to close well, narrowly missed at the wire while continued to be ridden an additional sixteenth. POINT BLANK moved closer from
between horses before a half, chased that one into and through upper stretch, closed the gap on that same foe late while being caught for the second spot.
HUMOR ME NOW slipped at the start to be off slowly, raced back, advanced two path second turn, moved to the inside, second flight through the stretch,
outkicked late for the show while remaining toward the inside. WICKED PRINCE chased the winner to that one's outside for six furlongs, weakened in the
drive. NACHO CHROME one paced off the inside early, three to four wide second bend, lacked a closing kick. WATER TO WINE forwardly placed in the
early going while three wide, began a gradual fade after six furlongs. FASHION IDOL four wide into the first turn, moved to the inside when still back in the
second bend, picked off a few tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LAST OUTLAW tired while racing four wide much of the way. PHILHARMONIC
in the second flight early, began a steady fade inside after a half. QUINCY MARKET five wide through the first turn, four wide through the second bend, not
a factor.

Footnotes
MAKE NOISE unhurried behind the lead pack toward the inside, waited in traffic through much of the second turn, steered out to be three wide into the lane,
bid, gained the advantage nearing the furlong marker, held sway late under steady handling. CANADIAN PHAROAH void of speed, raced in the two path
into the lane, picked way through some traffic and rallied inside the winner to be getting to that one late. EVERLOVINGHAND five wide when with the lead
pack into the first turn, continued within striking distance while four wide through the second bend, brief bid into the stretch outside the winner, pressed that
one past the furlong marker then lacked a closing punch. CANADIAN GAME prompted the early leader off the inside and between horses, moved closer
and vied into the stretch, weakened gradually the final furlong. CYCLONE void of speed, raced in some traffic turning for home, improved a bit with some
mild interest when clear. HIGHTAIL COWBOY moved up along the inside to set a pressured pace along the inside, weakened when confronted for the drive.
JIM AND JIM broke in the air, raced back, improved position while not a serious threat. PROMISING SHOES in the main group early inside, moved out, four
wide exiting the second bend, failed to rally. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE in the main group off rail, four wide second bend, came up empty for the drive. EGO
raced three wide most of the way, failed to menace. RUNNINGFORCASH four wide into the first turn, moved inside a bit to save some ground, rank inside
of horses late in that bend, remained inside second turn, backed up through the lane. GALACTIC EMPIRE prompted the issue for six furlongs three wide
and stopped.

Footnotes
PATTERN BET back off the pace and the inside, moved to the rail late in the turn, steered to the outside of the tiring leader nearing the sixteenth marker,
closed with good resolve to be up in time. TOO PRETTY broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch closest to the inside, shook clear
midway on the turn,continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner while inside that one, remained clear for the
second spot. PETULA pressed the pace while between horses, fell off the winner and chased that one through upper stretch, could not contain the runner
up, lasted for the place. CHAI TEA lacked early foot, improved position inside without posing a serious threat. LADY ASTRID one paced while three to four
wide through the turn, lacked a serious closing response. HOT SPRINGS BLING lacked speed, was floated out five wide into the stretch, improved slightly
while also not posing a serious threat. MOCHA KISS pressed the issue for a half three wide and began to fade. JERI DAWN void of speed, passed tiring
rivals, no threat. SHE'S STORMING in mid pack in the two path, gave way in the turn. NAVAGATIONALBEACON raced briefly forward while three wide and
between rivals, also staged a steady retreat. SHUTUP PLEASE was finished early, well back. BLONDES HAVEMO FUN off slowly, trailed, distanced
through the stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
RUGGS away in good order, contested the pace while between foes for five furlongs, late duel inside the runner up, found more late after being headed to
prove best in game fashion. TOP GUNNER with the pace from the start three wide, continued to vie into the lane on the outside, late duel, outfinished to
miss. SAMURAI PRINCE broke well, set or forced the pace while along the inside for six furlongs, first to blink of the lead trio past the furlong marker, saved
the show. PAPA ROCKET behind the first flight while racing off the inside, came three wide for the drive, lacked a winning kick, not enough for the show.
SUMMER IN MALIBU one paced outside, four to five wide through the turn, went evenly through the lane. FLAGS UP broke back, two to three wide, lacked
a rally. OUT RUN'M remained back while racing off the inside. HI YAH unprepared for the start to spot the field several lengths, moved out and advanced
five wide into the turn, prompted the issue early in the bend then began to give way, continued to fade stretch. BANDERA AZTECA lunged just prior to the
start, was detained while rearing by the assistant starter, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, BANDERA
AZTECA WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER.

Footnotes
LAKE RADIO close up from the start off the inside, dueled in the two path turn, turned back bid a furlong out, edged clear under firm handling. ATOMIC
TONE behind the pace while outside, four wide into the turn, advanced and briefly tried the winner from the outside, approaching the furlong marker, turned
back, remained clear for the place. GOOD HEART broke with the leaders, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn inside the winner,
could not match that one in the drive, lasted for the show. THREEFIFTYSEVEN went one paced while racing three wide throughout. ROMAN GIANT
shuffled back soon after the start, lagged well back off the inside, came three wide for the drive, improved position with some belated interest down the
middle of the strip. HAPPYMAC lacked speed off the inside, three to four wide through the turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. AIR COMBAT
turned in an even effort while racing four wide. CITRUS BAY saved ground to no avail. IAN GLASS behind the pace off the inside and between horses, in
tight entering the stretch, took up, fell back to lose all the chance. CONCEPT forwardly early while inside the winner and between horses, gave way.

Footnotes
BETTYS CASH with the pace while racing off the inside, dueled early turn in the two path, disposed of that rival by late in the bend, well clear past the
furlong marker, enough left to last. HOLDING PATTERN off a bit slow, raced back and outside while remaining out in the strip, four to five wide into the
stretch, late surge to be rapidly getting to the winner late. AL'S ROMEO fractious in the gate, broke well, within striking distance while just off the inside,
remained in the second flight in the two path turn, roused for the drive, slowly gaining late. HIT SCENE behind the pace while well off the rail, crept a bit
closer four wide turning for home then lacked a further advance. TABLE MONEY in the second flight while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive.
MAHOMEY lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, flashed some belated interest down the middle of the strip. WHERE'S RANDY went one paced
while racing along the inside. SHAKE UP raced in the two path and in mid pack, also found lacking in the drive. STRIKE RIDGE showed the way up the
backstretch along the inside, dueled inside the winner through the early part of the bend, gave way. PEACE DOG off slow, remained always back.
NATORADE also off slow, was always outrun.

Footnotes
AMAZING SUCCESS broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, extended that advantage into the stretch, held the runner up safely at bay under steady
handling. STRING THEORY pressed the winner early from the two path, fell back off that foe into the lane, made little headway the final furlong while
remaining clear for the place. ROCKET SANDERS in the second flight while racing in the two path, went evenly through the stretch to be clear of the rest.
SPEAKING LOUD back off the pace and the inside, angled four wide into the lane, improved position with some late interest down the middle of the strip.
DAY JO in mid pack while three wide, came in a bit to tighten up PREPAREDNESS midway on the bend, came three wide again for the drive, dropped
inside, finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. PREPAREDNESS behind the pace while just off the inside, steadied midway on the turn when in a bit
tight, failed to rally after recovering in the drive. CLASSIC CINEMA forwardly placed while racing three wide, weakened. LITTLE BISCUITS hesitated to be
off slow, remained back in failing to menace. HARD LUCK HENRY was finished after four furlongs while four wide. SAFETY staged a steady retreat along
the inside. CRIME ZONE fell back to trail while three wide, continued to lag, distanced after losing contact with the field through the stretch, jogged in.
