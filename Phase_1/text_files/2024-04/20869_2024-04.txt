WHY FOR got away well, set the pace and held safely under mild urging. JASMINE BABY broke out, raced close to the pace along the inside, lacked the
needed late response and finished second best. POW WOW brushed at the start, angled in and advanced along the inside on the turn, shifted out and
offered a mild bid to be along for show. MOTORIZED brushed at the start, stalked the pace, swung wide leaving the turn and faded. SUERTUDA was slow
early, angled out into the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. SPICEY SECRET showed brief speed between horses and steadily
dropped back. MARKED BY MISCHIEF showed little.

ABSTRACT KAT was never far off the pace, raced outside, was carried out leaving the turn, closed willingly and got up late. ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST
broke awkwardly, race in close, challenged into the second turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. B A CHAMPION bumped
at the start, set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch, didn't have enough late and was outfinished. REVOLT AND RIOT was never far back, rallied
between horses on the turn, angled in, bid willingly to challenge and didn't have enough late. SILVER DADDY was unhurried early and trailed the field,
offered a mild bid only and improved position. GORDY'S RULES broke out and bumped lightly at the start, pressed the pace inside to the second turn and
flattened out.

Footnotes
BONITO was hustled along to set the pace and just lasted at the wire. ATTILA'S BOY bumped at the start, raced close to the pace, went four wide on the
turn, closed willingly and was gaining fast late. WATTS broke in, overcorrected, came out and bumped, chased the pace, closed steadily and was gaining
late. EL RAYADO was never far back, bid off the rail to get within range and came up empty late. VIPER BREATH showed good early speed along the
inside, angled out on the turn and lacked a bid. CHARLIE THYME showed good early speed, fell back on the turn and had no further response. TRUST
PACO P was void of early speed, raced outside and was not urged late.

Footnotes
TEQUILA TIME set the pace, drew off on the second turn for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. BLUEGRASS FAITH stalked the pace to the
second turn, fell back and was no match for the winner. BULLAWAY stalked the pace to the second turn, fell back, had little left for the drive and settled for
show. TEXAS BAD BOY put in an even effort in an outside trip and failed to threaten. CHARLIE'S GHOST bumped at the start and lacked a response in an
inside trip. SPEED BUMP BOB broke awkwardly and bumped at the start, stalked the pace, tired into the second turn, gave way and was not urged late.
LET THERE BE PEACE saved ground in an even effort and was not urged. MT. TAYLOR showed speed around the first turn, dropped back steadily and
was not urged late.

Footnotes
STYLE BENDER got away well, stalked the pace, closed steadily and wore down FACETIOUS to get up near the wire. FACETIOUS moved up to set the
pace, led to the final strides and was caught. BUMBLEBEE bumped at the start, lagged in an outside trip, finished well and got up for show. RIGHT ON
TIME broke out and bumped at the start, stalked the pace, lacked a late response and was caught for third. ABETEMARCO raced in the back, saved
ground, closed well and didn't have enough late. BUG ZAPPER ran loose behind the gate, flashed speed, fell back and went evenly thereafter.
MENTIROSA was void of early speed, swung wide leaving the turn and offered a mild bid only. OKIE FREEZE bumped on both sides at the start and did not
threaten. JAZZ TOWN was hustled along to show speed to the turn, fell back and faded.
