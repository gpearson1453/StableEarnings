MALIBU ROCK STAR away alertly, set all the pace and winded through the stretch under mild left handed urging to win as much the best. RAINBOW'S
PRIDE hit the gate at the start, rushed to contention in the four path, dug in late two wide and finished clear for second. SCRATCHOFF chased the winner
two wide and was outfinished. YOU BET A FORTUNE broke slowly, offered a mild bid four wide through the turn then leveled off. AURA OF GOLD stalked
the pace three wide into the stretch then weakened. DESTINO had good early speed along the inside and was through after a half. HUNTERTOWN was
outrun. EL BANDIDO was no threat.
