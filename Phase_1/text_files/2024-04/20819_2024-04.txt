NONA was on the lead from the start out from the rail and inside rivals, shook free in the far turn and drew off under hand urging. SHE AINT A BEAUTY
settled three or four wide to move up through the far turn and rallied to narrowly gain the place late. ALL LEGS tracked the winner three or four wide to make
a mild bid going to the far turn and could not sustain the run. DAZZLE YOU MY WAY followed the pace three wide and weakened. CLARA SMILES tired
from along the inside. R R JUDE gave way early.

WAR HAWK moved to a clear lead early about the two or three path, maintained the advantage into the lane and continued under a steady hand ride.
JAMAICA MISTAICA bumped with a rival at the start, rallied four and five wide in the far turn and continued on to gain clear for the place. KA POW stalked
the leaders four wide to move nearest the leader while angling in on the turn then was outfinished for position late. ONE PRETTY GIRL in reach two or three
wide failed to mount a bid. DADSAMUMBLER leaned into the gate then bumped with a rival at the start, angled three to four wide going to the far turn and
did not threaten. BENZ LAKE THUNDER chased the pace three or four wide and weakened. WANTABE was along the inside and dropped back going to
the far turn. MOONSPLASH was always back.

Footnotes
CHARMING CHARLIE stalked the pace three or four wide, offered up a strong surge through the lane and ran down STAR OF STARS in the closing jumps.
STAR OF STARS made the pace racing about the two or three path, kicked well clear into the lane then could not contain the winner's late run.
BLUEGRASS BREEZE rallied three and four wide into the lane and continued on to gain the show late. MINISTER MAZ saved ground to move up into the
far turn then was outfinished for position in the lane. MR CREED saved ground back off the early pace, angled out into the lane and made a mild rally.
MONTEREY PENINSULA tracked the pace three or four wide and weakened. BRILLIANT COLORS weakened two to three wide.

Footnotes
MINNIE'S READY stalked the early pace three wide while never far back, angled out into the lane and offered up a good late run to prevail in the closing
jump. RICHIE'S GAL moved three and four wide inside a rival to bid in late backstretch, led to deep stretch and was caught on the wire. KINGMAKING (GB)
moved four wide outside RICHIE'S GAL to bid in late backstretch, continued with that one into the lane and could not produce the needed late run. MISS
GRAND SLAM was in good position three wide but lacked a final closing run. TERRI GOT A FRIEND moved up three or four wide but failed to make a solid
bid. I GUESS NOT bumped with a rival into the first turn, angled out four wide and failed to threaten. HIT'EM UP bumped with a rival into the first turn and
dropped back going up the backstretch. SAENGER STAR was always back. PIZZA GIRL showed the most early speed to gain inside position going to the
first turn and tired.

STOLEN HALO gained the early lead about the two or three path, shook off bids and held safe through the lane. QUALITY BOW moved up three and four
wide to bid into the lane but could not run down the winner. NORTHERN GEM moved up inside the winner to bid entering the backstretch, pressed into the
