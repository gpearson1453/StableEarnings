BRIEF ENCOUNTER stalked the pace into the stretch, responded under left handed urging to make the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best
under strong handling. PRIDE AND ATTITUDE unhurried early, rallied determinedly five wide through the stretch and got up for second. SPUNKY ONE
slow early, found her best stride late outside rivals. HALO EFFECT offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch then leveled off. DOLCE MARIE pressed
the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, set the pace until deep stretch then weakened. FEELING EASY well placed, went evenly. ZASHIXIARAYAN
with the second flight two wide, was through after a half. KISSING MEDALS sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set a pressured
pace for a half then was used up. WILD MARIAH trailed from the start, stopped on the turn, was distanced and walked off.

inside through the second bend then leveled off. KERANOS settled two then three wide, dropped inside on the far turn and had a mild late gain. CANDY
CRUSHEM failed to menace. ITASCA was under strong restraint through the clubhouse turn, remained a forward factor for six furlongs then wilted. MALIBU

BEAUTIFUL SCORE bore in at the start, rushed up the inside to make the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace until deep stretch, drifted out under
left handed urging and prevailed under a strong hand ride. LIGHTENING LOTTIE pressed the pace two wide and finished second best. CORA CORONA
was squeezed inside the winner at the start, gained quickly three wide into the turn, dropped inside before the furlong marker and finished with good
courage. ANGIE'S DEAR ONE went evenly. NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK trailed, swung wide and was no threat. NATIONAL DIAMOND had brief speed.

second. MACHO GIRL never far back, finished with good courage along the rail. MY SUZIE Q vied for the lead four wide and went evenly. FOUR
BLESSINGS pressed the pace three wide into the stretch and weakened late. BETTY'S SONG prompted the pace along the rail and was through after half.

Footnotes
ROWDY DAISY never far back, closed willingly three wide under right handed urging to make the lead nearing the furlong marker and drew off under
confident handling. THEODOROPOULOS pressed the pace two wide then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. PEARLINTHEROUGH
with the second flight, had a mild late rally two wide for a minor share. CITRINA away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside to the top of the stretch
and weakened late. JUMP INTO SANITY was no threat. BELLAVALENCIA stalked the early pace three wide and was through after a half. CONTESSINA
had brief speed.
