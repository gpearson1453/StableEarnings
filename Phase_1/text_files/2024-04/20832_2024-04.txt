Footnotes
PRACTICAL MISS went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole,
responded well to the challenge of the runner-up in upper stretch, battled outside that rival in the final furlong and held under a strong hand-ride while
flagged with the crop. TERESA settled off the pace, was roused in the two to three path on the turn, moved to a clear two path late on that bend, dropped to
the rail while gaining into upper stretch, made a bid inside of the winner at the three-sixteenths, fought with that foe in the final furlong and was outfinished
while well clear for the place. MONTAUK MYSTIQUE broke a step slow, moved out at the rear then advanced on the outside, ranged up in the four path on
the turn, was asked late on that bend, chased into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and came up empty while just able to get the show.
BELLA ISOLA was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole, came off
the rail into upper stretch, angled out into the final furlong and tired then just missed the show. BABI DREAMS pressed the pace on the outside, was asked
in the three path on the turn, dropped back at the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and faltered.

LADY MIA (FR) showed speed on the inside of a foe, was eased back off the pace outside the half-mile pole, saved ground while drafting behind horses on
the turn, was asked when given a clear opening at the top of the stretch, rallied inside to get the lead just inside the furlong marker and proved best under
good handling. SOLOSHOT moved in while going to the front then showed the way, vied two path to the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch clearly off the
inside, battled between foes into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. KERRY showed speed then chased the pace, went three
to two wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch on even terms for the lead, battled outside of two foes into the
final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while able to hold the show. RISK FREE dropped back then angled in early, saved
ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. CATSKILL HUMOR was carried in early then bumped with a foe,
settled off the pace, was roused two to three wide on the turn, jostled with a foe near the three-eighths pole, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. MASTEROF THE TUNES was bumped on both sides early then checked, settled towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. RUVIES IN TIME was bumped in the hindquarters early, settled towards the back, jostled with a foe near
the three-eighths pole, moved from the inside to the two path late on the turn and failed to rally. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO AN

CLEM LABINE tracked the early pace three wide, moved up to vie for command between rivals on the turn, made a three to four wide bid off the turn to
move clear and drew off under a right-handed crop to prove much the best. MOUNT TRAVERS was bumped at the start then reserved early, saved ground
on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch then shifted off the inside, split rivals by the sixteenth marker and got the place award. PRINCE JAMES was well
placed early on the inside, tracked the leaders on the turn, was two wide nearing the quarter pole then tipped out three wide, fought on in the drive but was
out-kicked for the place award. FIRST DEPUTY was settled back early, four wide on the turn, came seven wide off the turn and improved position.
POPPY'S PRIDE bumped with a foe and broke near the back, was sent to the front to set the pace on the inside, vied for command to the quarter-pole and
weakened. JOKER BOY chased the early pace two to three wide on the turn and swung out four wide leaving the bend but had no rally. STRIKING SPEED
was off slow while coming inward, moved up on the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn to press the -pace by the five -sixteenths, spun five wide off
the turn but came up empty. TOMMY GUN broke thru the gate and ran about a quarter of a mile, was brought back around and reloaded, showed brief foot,
went three wide on the turn and stopped.

steady handling. FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER went five then four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while three then four wide on the far
turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to make a bid into the final furlong but was outfinished while able to get the place. ROAGNA raced in the
three path on the first turn, was reserved between horses, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, gained six wide into the stretch, held a
reasonable striking position into the final furlong but flattened out. STELLA MARS went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside,
was roused in the two path on the far turn then gained four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MIM showed early speed, dropped from the
three path to the two path on the first turn, opened up a large advantage on the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, came under the crop while
shortening stride in upper stretch, was collared nearing the furlong marker and tired. SUCCULENT bobbled at the start, tossed her head while rank briefly
early, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and
improved position. ARTEMIS GIRL settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn and lacked the needed response. MYSARIA showed early speed on the
inside, dropped off the pace late on the first turn, settled well behind the runaway leader, was asked while inside on the far turn, gained in the two path into
the stretch but came up empty. BEING BETTY brushed the outside of the gate at the start, was reserved in the two path, came under urging outside the
quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. ACCELERINA went three to four wide on the turns and failed to threaten.

BETTRLUCKYTHANGOOD was settled early and saved ground throughout under a good hold, cut the corner off the turn then made a inside bid and edged
clear to prove best under strong urging. KORU took an awkward stride inside the seven-eighths pole then was taken up a bit while tossing her head, was
rated three to four wide, moved out on the far turn then ranged up four wide by the quarter pole, made a five wide bid off the turn, came in slightly leaving
sixteenth marker brushing with SHERZANDO and finished well to the wire but was out-kicked by the winner. COURTLY BANKER set the pace while racing
in mostly the two path, shook clear by the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the lane but was caught with about eighty yards to the wire and stayed on to best
the rest. SCHERZANDO tracked the pace on the inside, eased out nearring the quarter pole, made a three wide bid off the turn, then was brushed by the
sixteenth marker and flattened out, vanned off. RABAJA stumbled badly at the start, reserved on the inside, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally.
SWEET TONE was allowed to settle early, three wide on the turn and came four wide off the turn and had no rally. BARRON'S BOUNCE bumped at the
start, was reserved early, saved ground throughout and lacked a rally. SAKA SHOCKA stalked the pace three wide, was ridden along on the turn, came four
wide off the turn and weakened. ROAD SODA bumped with a foe at the start then stumbled badly, settled towards the back and never threatened. DILLON
chased the pace three to four wide and tired.
