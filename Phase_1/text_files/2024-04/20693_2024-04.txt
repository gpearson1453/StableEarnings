Footnotes
SHE'S AWESOME coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the front before advancing in tandem with RUVIES IN TIME to vie through the turn
between foes, swung five wide into upper stretch roused and emerging from the quartet in concert with the runner up, took over command with
three-sixteenths to go and edged clear under a drive to prevail. VIOLENT VIXEN traded the front with WILLFUL DESIRE early on while in hand along the
inside, then vied inside a trio through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front with
three-sixteenths remaining and kept on to preserve the place honors. TAMING THE TIGRESS chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. RUVIES IN TIME four wide in range of the front down the backstretch,
advanced four wide through the turn to vie for command coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. WILLFUL DESIRE forwardly placed from the start, traded the front with VIOLENT VIXEN down the backstretch from the two path early on
before vying between foes through the turn patiently handled, swung four wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and came under
encouragement straightened away, tired in the drive. SLACK TIDE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
VIRTUAL REALITY stalked the pace on the outside of the leader, engaged that foe in the three path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole,
gained a short lead in upper stretch, drifted out some outside the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. SWEET
MYSTERY was rated in a good position down the backstretch, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, dropped to the
rail while put to a drive in upper stretch, gained inside into the final furlong, fought inside the winner in the final sixteenth and finished with good courage but
missed while up for the place. PITCH CLOCK angled in while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace with an easy lead, vied inside while
challenged on the turn, was given her cue coming to the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to her stablemate in upper stretch, fought on under a drive
into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. RISK FREE tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the
turn, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. VERY PRACTICAL broke a step slow, settled
at the rear on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path under the crop into the stretch and
lacked the needed kick. MONGOLIAN PANTHER tossed her head and was off a step sow, was reserved off the pace, dropped well behind in the two path
on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TIZZY IN THE SKY got away to a sharp start and was directly in front, raced along the inside through the first turn before taking to the two path once settled
in the backstretch, remained in hand showing the way in a comfortable rhythm into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, went clear under a light drive and was geared down just inside the final sixteenth through to the finish, the outcome in no doubt.
MOVIE MOXY three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best. TOWHEAD got bumped at the start by COMPARATIVE, who
broke out a step, chased just off the inside through the opening bend and then along the inside thereafter, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cut the
corner into upper stretch and weakened. COMPARATIVE broke out a step at the start bumping TOWHEAD, raced along the inside through the first turn in
behind the leader before tipping out three to four paths off the rail down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the far turn under coaxing from the half mile
pole, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SPIKED just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CALL HER BLUFF was forwardly placed on the outside, came under urging while four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, made an outside bid
at the three-sixteenths pole then took the advantage, battled with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. TOP OF THE
TABLE bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was roused late on that bend, made a bid
between horses in upper stretch, fought with the winner in the final furlong and just missed while well clear for the place. HAPPY'S SMILE prompted the
pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and tired but held the
show. ISLAND FOX settled off the pace, dropped from the five path to the three path early on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. TROUBLED LUCK bumped with a foe at the start, moved up to get the lead, set the pace under pressure, vied inside on the turn, was
asked outside the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. SHE'S A
NATURAL settled at the rear, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted three wide and failed to rally. TURNUPTHEMUSIC broke in then
brushed with a foe, moved in outside the three-quarter pole, raced towards the front, dropped back fast then climbed some outside the half-mile pole, saved
ground on the turn and failed to respond. BOOK OF WISDOM dropped back near the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace, moved from three to five wide
on the turn and also failed to respond. SENDERA was brushed by a rival at the start, checked in tight quarters entering the main-track, dropped back off
heels leaving the backstretch, moved from three to six wide on the turn, moved to the four path outside the quarter-pole, drifted out in upper stretch and was
no factor.

Footnotes
ANTONIO OF VENICE got bumped at the start by BLACK ALMIGHTY, who broke inwards, came under coaxing briefly and prompted the pace from the
outside three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took command just outside that station, swung four then three wide into upper stretch,
edged clear under a drive shying out from a left handed crop and then in from a right handed crop, switched leads awkwardly seventy yards from home
while clear kept to task. DOC SULLIVAN coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, lugged in straightened away to the three path and offered up a mild kick. GRAND OPENING got bumped at the start by FREEDSDALE, who
broke inwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors well
clear of the rest. FREEDSDALE broke in at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, tipped out to the four path when DOC SULLIVAN lugged in in front at the three-sixteenths and tired. CABLE READY bobbled
at the break, crossed directly to the rail soon after and chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and made no impact. HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPS cut the pace along the inside under pressure to the outside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, yielded the front and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. BLACK ALMIGHTY broke in at the start bumping
ANTONIO OF VENICE, chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

TOUGH STREET three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, got on track near the eighth pole
and rallied to take command a sixteenth out, then edged away to the finish to prevail. FRAU DIABLO hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along
the inside, came under pressure from STARSHIP DEFIANT with half a mile to go and faced the prompting of that rival through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to command until collared a sixteenth out, ran on willingly to
preserve the place honors. STARSHIP DEFIANT chased just off the inside until advancing to prompt the leader through the turn under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the aforementioned foe keeping on to the finish but simply could not go
by and was forced to settle for the show honors while well clear of the rest. DAME CINCO coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside and then just off
the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. IT TAKES HEART tossed her head and lunged
just as the latch was sprung getting away last and conceding four lengths to the front, chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
tipped six wide at the top of the stretch, tired. EFFICACIOUS chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside
into upper stretch, tired. INTO HAPPINESS devoid of speed, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper
stretch, trailed.

SUNDAY GIRL disputed the pace on the far outside, moved in outside the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped to the two path at the
quarter-pole, kicked clear when asked for his best in upper stretch, came in when given a pop of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, swapped
back to his inside lead when given another pop of the crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the finish while much the best.
MY SHEA D LADY chased the pace, went around the turn in the four path, pursed the winner under a drive in the stretch and proved no match while able to
safely secure the place. SOHANA brushed with an opponent at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three wide for most of the turn then shifted four
wide, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while up for the show. FAST AND FRISKY bumped with a rival at the start then was
hustled, chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and
weakened. HANDLE ON YOU was hustled from the gate then ridden along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and failed to rally. BARONESS BOURBON broke a half-step slow, was urged
along near the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. BUSTIN TIME disputed the pace on the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, dropped
back in upper stretch and tired. JAY'S LOVE bumped with a rival at the start while brushing with another foe then was squeezed back, was urged along
towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn and was no factor.
