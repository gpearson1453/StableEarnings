Footnotes
ONACOUNTA rated just off the inside, gained a clear path three wide into the lane, slowly lugged in as she rallied inside the last furlong and edged ahead
the final sixteenth. CAT TALE BREEZE vied for the early lead between rivals, did not stay with HALLIE'S RAINBOW nearing the end of two furlongs, stayed
just outside the latter through the bend, was slowly forced in inside the final eighth and did not have enough left in tight quarters through the waning yards.
HALLIE'S RAINBOW a step slow at the start, split rivals at the five furlong marker, moved clear before finishing a quarter mile, took the rail on the turn,
began to wear down inside the last furlong, drifted out slightly deep stretch and was checked in tight quarters nearing the wire. LORI ATTACK in contention
from inside, began to yield on the turn. CAMDEN'S BEAUTY chased running widest and flattened out for the drive.

REAL NEWS shared the early lead inside MADE TO FIT, moved ahead when asked leaving the quarter pole, floated out some entering the lane, began to
wear down deep stretch but dug in and held on. JOEY B in the second flight from inside, gradually angled out leaving the turn, rallied from path five, came
up short but was easily second best. BLAZEN ROAD chased from outside, came widest into the stretch, ran evenly but gained third with a sixteenth left.
FRONTANA was a step slow at the break, saved ground and failed to menace. MADE TO FIT displayed early speed outside REAL NEWS but began to
flatten before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
HIDDEN FIGURE bumped from the rear at the break, soon had the advantage just off the inside, saved ground on the bend, moved clear when allowed
leaving the turn, floated out some entering the lane, lugged in under right-handed pressure midstretch, was corrected and maintained full control. ABBMAR
pressed HIDDEN FIGURE from just outside, was no match for that one when set down for the drive and could only hold her position late. WITCHING well
placed from inside, did not keep up on the bend and rallied belatedly along the rail in the lane. BAILESTON LASSIE forwardly placed between horses, was
just off the rail on the turn, angled out four wide for a clear path at the top of the stretch and could only make up minor ground in the waning yards. NEXT
TIME YOU WIN broke a bit awkwardly and inward, bumped with HIDDEN FIGURE then failed to menace racing widest of all. CARSON RESERVE
prominent from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned out to path five for the stretch run and gave way.

SAFE without early speed, though hustled along, advanced outside on the bend, floated out to path five entering the stretch, rallied and got up in time.
KRUELESS vied for the lead between rivals on the backstretch, did not stay with INSIDE THE CIRCLE on the turn, rallied just outside that one deep stretch,
closed well but was outfinished. INSIDE THE CIRCLE contested the pace from outside, moved clear on the bend, angled to the rail, gradually wore down
deep stretch but was easily best of the others. RA'DOM bumped with LAGRUE at the start, displayed early speed from inside but began to yield before
finishing three furlongs. LAGRUE bumped with RA'DOM at the break, dropped back from tight quarters with five furlongs to go, saved ground through the
turn, angled out widest at the top of the lane and had little to offer.

Footnotes
I'M YOUR VALENTINE shared the lead from outside, moved clear when urged on the bend then kept PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN at bay under steady handling
the last furlong. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN was bumped at the start, was angled in midway on the backstretch, did not keep up along the rail on the turn,
came off the rail upper stretch, rallied belatedly but was easily second best. SANGFROID displayed early speed inside I'M YOUR VALENTINE, did not stay
with that one on the bend, angled outside the latter midway on the turn then flattened out for the drive. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN prompted the pace from outside
on the backstretch, was just off the rail on the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and gave way. GREER CROSSING broke inward, bumping PAPA'S
LUCKY SEVEN, was steadied and always outrun.

Footnotes
ON THE MONEY RED was a step slow at the break then cut off by HE'S A FINE MAN, altered out, advanced to vie for the lead, moved ahead on the turn
then gradually opened up under urging in the stretch. HE'S A FINE MAN broke inward, displayed early speed between rivals, moved to the rail with two
furlongs to go, slowly wore down for the drive and stayed clear for the place. TRUIST well placed from inside, angled outside ON THE MONEY RED at the
top of the lane, lacked the extra needed and could only just hold his position. MOVE IN SILENCE jostled repeatedly with TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS while in
close quarters just outside TRUIST on the backstretch, was two then three wide taking the bend and failed to have the needed late bid.
TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS reluctant to load, jostled repeatedly with MOVE IN SILENCE on the backstretch, came into the lane four wide and also failed to
have a significant response.

Footnotes
LATIN CASINO shared the lead inside FEVER NATION, moved clear when allowed on the bend, was asked leaving the turn, drew off from just off the
inside upper stretch then held GIRLOLAMO'GLORY safe under steady urging. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY chased from just off the inside, angled in some for the
stretch run, began his bid, moved outside LATIN CASINO after entering the last furlong then closed the gap belatedly on the leader as he drew off for
second the last sixteenth. ONE PUTT RICHIE raced in contention toward the outside, came four wide into the lane, had every chance but leveled off inside
the last furlong. KARAYEL chased from inside and only improved position some in the stretch without threatening. GOLD SMOKE bumped with SNOOZER
at the start then was forced inward, chased from just off the inside, angled out upper stretch and passed between tired ones. FEVER NATION displayed
early speed just outside LATIN CASINO, did not stay with that one on the turn and gave way between rivals through the lane. SNOOZER was fractious in
the gate, taken out to be approved to run by the veterinarian then reloaded, bumped with GOLD SMOKE once the race began, soon moved out widest and
showed little.
