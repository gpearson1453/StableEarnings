Footnotes
CAROLINE KRYSTYNA broke sharply and took a short lead outside PROFITUNITY, edged clear under rating into the turn, was confidently handled around
the turn with a trio of pursuers behind her, spurted away after being set down past the quarter pole then held firm through the final sixteenth while kept to
task. SHARE THE BLESSING hopped at the break then bumped with a rival to be away second last, regrouped and settled outside a runner leaving the far
turn, angled five wide into the stretch, straightened away and closed willingly to gain the place. NUWANDA had speed then was rated back off of foes
heading to the turn, gained a forward spot in the clear soon after, worked between runners into the stretch, shifted out with pursuit, chased between runners
past the sixteenth marker then flattened out late. GOLDEN HEART stalked the pace two wide and between runners, had aim soon into the stretch, saw the
winner get away in mid stretch, shifted in towards the rail and faded. MISCHIEVOUS DOLL drafted back off the pace and saved some ground, eased out to
chase between runners in the stretch but lacked a serious response. WISE AND ELEGANT broke in the air to be away last, bumped with an outer rival then
steadied, lost ground three to six wide and was one paced outside rivals in the final furlong. FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD rated inside early on, made a slight run
into the stretch but failed to go on once put to solid asking. PROFITUNITY , forwardly placed along the rail, tracked inside foes around the turn, lacked a
punch in mid stretch and gave way. PAYOUT RATIO (IRE) , four wide advancing outside foes to a stalking spot early on, chased three deep mid turn then
faltered through the drive.

backstretch, bid between foes leaving the far turn then poked a head in front past the three eighths, dueled, briefly spurted clear approaching the stretch,
was joined then headed from his inside by IN THE DANCE past the furlong grounds, stayed locked on and battled back under right handed encouragement,
was carried out several paths in deep stretch then got the best of the bobs at the wire. IN THE DANCE , inside and within range into the backstretch, took
closer order while nudged upon heading to the half, was under a hearty ride pursuing the leaders past the five sixteenths pole, cut the corner with a gain and
then bid inside RAKIA a furlong out, took a slim lead nearing the sixteenth pole, wandered outward despite efforts with right handed encouragement, fought
gamely but was nipped at the line. DERBYNESS , taken to rate four wide, moved up to have aim outside rivals leaving the far turn, gave hard chase four
wide into the stretch but failed to kick on. MAGICAL MONARCH broke slowly, recovered and moved up four wide outside foes to take over then clear
nearing the seven eighths, dropped in a couple paths to set the pace, was engaged into the far turn, sparred under a ride and towards the inside from the
three eighths to the quarter pole then tired.

the three eighths, took over after a half, responded when asked and kicked away leaving the three sixteenths, widened through the final furlong and was
kept alert to the wire. HOW SWEET SHE IS , three deep near the half, found a good spot in the clear chasing the three pronged battle mid turn, circled four
wide into the stretch, angled out a bit wider near mid stretch and churned on to gain the place. SWEET SHUGS broke outward and brushed with the winner,
corrected and dueled outside ROYAL SEAMSTRESS, stayed on between runners after the winner joined the fray three furlongs out, shifted out in upper
stretch, pursued past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. GIRLS HOUSE , rank at the break, was outrun early, circled four wide into the stretch and
passed tiring rivals. MO TRAFFIC chased between foes early, eased back a bit leaving the far turn, pursued outside a rival leaving the three eighths and
came up empty. SULTRY SALLY H had speed inside, rated back a bit heading to half, failed to kick on while saving ground near the three eighths and
faded. ROYAL SEAMSTRESS dueled inside a rival then a pair of foes around the turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch, faltered and was eased through the

Footnotes
WITTY , comfortably well off the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn four wide, floated to the eighth path in mid stretch, closed outside horses,
drifted in late and was up approaching the finish. OUTLAW KID , well off the inner rail in upper stretch, was in hand waiting for room in mid stretch, split
horses to bid for the lead, drifted out late and just missed in a game effort. CHARGING chased the pace, advanced between horses in upper stretch, gained
the lead in mid stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and hung. BUMP N RUN saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and offered a late
move. FUTURE IS NOW showed speed between horses down the backstretch and on the turn, remained prominent to mid stretch and weakened. FORE
HARP , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, failed to sustain his move and was eased late. FLUID SITUATION advanced to gain a short lead
between horses entering the stretch and weakened the final furlong. BROTHER CONWAY showed speed along the inner rail and gave way in mid stretch.
COFFEEWITHCHRIS trailed. An objection by the rider of CHARGING against WITTY for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

CALL ANOTHER PLAY , unhurried early while off the inside, took closer order into the far turn then moved boldly three wide to engage MISS HARRIETT
near the five sixteenths, sparred with that one into the lane, shook clear under strong encouragement in mid stretch then steadily widened while kept alert.
JEANNE MARIE prompted the pace two wide outside the leader, dropped back a bit around the far turn then shifted towards the inner rail, stayed in range
while coaxed along past the five sixteenths, angled out for clear sailing entering the stretch, straightened away and gained game chase while earning the
place. MISS HARRIETT quickly established command, set the pace inside while handling outside pressure, dug in when collared by the winner, fought on to
mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. GRAMMY GIRL , three wide around the first turn, tracked under rating while
remaining three wide to the half, dropped in a path and applied pressure around the far turn, failed to go with the leaders nearing the quarter pole and tired.
SHIMMERING ALLURE , off the pace while in about the two path, was put to a strong ride leaving the five eighths, failed to respond around the final turn,
faltered, was eased through the lane then walked off.

DATAMAN , reserved in the two path down the backstretch, eased out to the three path mid way on the far turn, remained on his left lead in the stretch, too
command near the sixteenth pole and edged clear. ENGLISH BEE prompted the pace outside GRAY'S FABLE, gained a short lead in upper stretch, raced
on his left lead and finished gamely. FOREVER SOUPER saved ground under patient handling, was blocked behind three horses in mid stretch, altered
course to the outside and rallied. GRAY'S FABLE , a bit rank at the break, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in the
stretch and weakened late. EONS , three wide both turns, gave way.

Footnotes
COPPER TAX stumbled at the break, regrouped then traveled five wide outside rivals into the first turn, remained well wide commencing a run past the five
eighths, took closer order under coaxing near the five sixteenths, exchanged a brush with INVEIGLED while four wide into the lane, closed determinedly
under left handed encouragement and forged past SPEEDYNESS in the final yards. SPEEDYNESS , bumped at the break, took over early and set the pace
towards the inside, moved away under a ride in upper stretch, kept on gamely through the final furlong but just could not fend off the winner's charge.
INVEIGLED settled in the clear while not far back, edged up three wide near the half then gave hard chase, raced between rivals approaching the stretch,
brushed with COPPER TAX soon after, pursued to the inside of that one past mid stretch, kept on with effort and saved the show. CAROLO RAPIDO ,
bumped and in tight four wide between foes soon into the first turn, raced three wide between runners past the three quarters, gained off the inside then
worked between foes in upper stretch, shifted inward and finished with good courage. LAT LONG , bumped and in tight at the break, regrouped and raced
between runners into the backstretch, was put to urging and started an advance heading to the half, took closer order leaving the three eighths, angled five
wide approaching the stretch, continued with effort to mid stretch then flattened out late. STARTSWITHADREAM checked repeatedly and bumped with an
outer rival when difficult to settle into and around the first turn, dropped back to last, saved ground past the five sixteenths, shifted out but failed to make a
serious recovery. CELTIC CONTENDER , bumped with CIRCLE P then an inner rival at the break, was put to snug rating early while saving ground, eased
out to go around a tired rival leaving the far turn, shifted back in near the five sixteenths, chased, faltered and was eased late. CIRCLE P broke inward
bumping with CELTIC CONTEDER, was wrangled back soon after then checked along into and through the early part of the backstretch, went erratically
near the five eighths, raced between foes under some rating nearing the lane, gave way and was eased late. CLASSIC JOKE broke outward, corrected and
pulled his way forward into the first turn, settled better while stalking inside through the backstretch, chased past the five sixteenths, faltered in upper stretch
and was eased late. MALINOIS stalked outside the leader early on, faltered leaving the far turn, was eased through the lane then was pulled up shortly past
the wire while bleeding.

SNEAKING SUSPICION , three wide both turns, swung wide in upper stretch, closed steadily, led late and drove clear. COME RAIN OR SHINE set the
pace near the rail, was off the rail on the far turn, raced a bit erratically in the stretch and weakened. FORCEFUL stalked the pace inside horses, was in the
two path in mid stretch, angled to the inner rail and flattened out. RIGHTHERE RIGHTNOW stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, moved to the
four path in upper stretch, was herded out by MISSION NORTH when that one was herded out by COME RAIN OR SHINE in mid stretch and failed to
sustain his bid. MISSION NORTH , rank early, was rank inside horses down the backstretch, checked in close quarters inside COME RAIN OR SHINE
leaving the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, was herded out in mid stretch and hung. NO FOOLIN MO raced along the inner rail the far turn and was no
factor. MORTAL SIN chased the pace outside COME RAIN OR SHINE and gave way.
