Footnotes
SITTIN ON GO fidgeted as the gates sprung and broke a step slow, recovered to advance outside of rivals four wide around the first turn, stalked the leader
tucking two wide down the backstretch, offered a bid with five sixteenths to go, vied nearing the lane before failing to keep pace with his inner counterpart in
upper stretch, yet rebroke in the final furlong, came again to rebid nearing the wire and narrowly prevailed. P H FACTOR showed the way along the inside,
met an outer challenge around the far turn, repelled that bidder in upper stretch, but was collared by that one once more in the closings stages and got
nailed at the wire. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH broke a step slow, tracked three wide before shifting four wide entering the backstretch, chased the top pair under
strong urging rom the three path around the far turn, got outkicked for show by an outer foe entering the lane, yet shifted out and sustained stride to edge
past that one and regain show at the wire. HOODLUM was held up between and behind rivals to drop to the rear entering the first turn, laid off of the pace
two wide, crept closer under urging four wide around the far turn, reached show entering the lane, then only managed to chase the top pair while flattening
out and lost show at the wire. FAITHFUL KING tracked from the two path and tired around the far turn. Q BOND checked while hard to handle inside of foes
entering the first turn, raced off of the pace along the inside but was outrun around the far turn. PER RULING ECM2024-154/ECM FROM THE KENTUCKY
RACING COMMISSION, P H FACTOR WAS DQD FROM SECOND TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
DREAMAWAY dueled for the lead with an outer rival, clung to an advantage from that one as through the long battle and narrowly prevailed. CLEVER
AGAIN dueled for the lead with an inner rival, sustained the long battle while at his counterpart's throatlatch through the lane, but missed at the wire. MO
HAIR SAM took contact from an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted out to the four path
nearing midstretch and ran on to reach show at the wire. BAYTOWN SUNDANCE chased closest to the top pair around the turn, but proved no match while
failing to keep pace with them in upper stretch, yielded and lost show at the wire. SACKETT chased along the inside, gave way turning for home, then kept
on steadily. MONEYLINE broke a bit out at the start, pursued from midpack in the four path and failed to threaten. BAYTOWN BEATLE tossed his rider out
of the back of the starting gate while waiting for rivals to load, was backed out before being cleared to go, then bobbled into an inner rival at the start, raced
well back in the three path, moved to the five path in upper stretch and failed to factor. MENDELLO was outrun.

Footnotes
SEGESTA stalked along the inside, moved outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid before kicking clear in upper stretch, drifted out multiple paths at
the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead and shifted in at the sixteenth pole as an inner rival attempted a bid, repelled that foe and held well from a
late outer challenger. TIMELESS ELEGANCE was slow into stride, settled well back along the inside, awaited racing room briefly turning for home in the two
path, advanced between horses entering the lane, shifted four wide to rally among foes in midstretch, closed in outside of the leader to offer a late bid but
was kept at bay. CLARET BERET had her hind heels clipped by a rival approaching the first turn, tracked along the inside, tipped three wide in upper stretch
after the eventual winner got a jump, rallied to take aim inside of that drifting leader in hopes of bidding entering the final sixteenth, but was turned away and
outkicked for place late. PISCIOTTA (GB) was reserved under a snug hold at the rear four wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path around that bend,
moved out of last around the far turn before swinging to the eight path entering the lane, and offered a belated rally. BIG DIG got rank and steadied inside of
rivals nearing the first turn, tugged from midpack moving off the inside around that bend, shifted to the four path entering the backstretch, inched closer
around the far turn, but shifted to the six to seven path in upper stretch and chased on her left lead. GLO GLO tracked two wide, then between horses
around the far turn, shfited to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace among foes. SPEAK UP clipped a rivals heels and bobbled at the seven
furlong pole, laid off of the pace two to three wide, floated to the seven path into upper stretch and ran on mildly. MS. LILIBET bobbled slight at the start,
prompted outside of the leader, dueled around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and weakened. STAR ANISE broke a step
slow, saved ground off of the pace to no avail. LIFE'S SAGA (IRE) showed the way inside of a prompting rival, dueled with that one around the far turn and
weakened in upper stretch. TOFFEE APPLE made little impact two wide. EXHILARATE failed to factor three to four wide.

Footnotes
SENSIBLE CHOICE pursued from midpack in the four path, got outmoved by an inner foe approaching the far turn, pursued in the five path around the bend
before regaining stride entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of the leaders along with an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, dueled with that one through the
late stages and narrowly prevailed. MATURITY DATE was bumped by an inner rival at the start laid off of the pace in the three path, advanced in the four
path into and around the far turn, sustained progress to bid along with an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, sparred with that one thereafter but missed.
EXTREMELY GRUNTLED led around the first turn, got headed by an outer presser approaching the far turn, stalked that one from the three path around
that bend, closed in gradually in midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer pair at the sixteenth pole and reclaimed show. ELLIPTIC prompted two wide, led
and cleared entering the far turn, held sway through upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong and was overhauled in the final sixteenth. GHEE FOR THE
WIN stalked along the inside, chased off of the fence around the far turn and lacked a bid. MISS HARMONIC saved ground well back, then moved up
entering the lane. NO SHOW saved ground off of the pace to no avail. QUEEN RHAENYRA lacked speed two wide and failed to factor. COLETTE'S JOY
tracked two wide then weakened between horses around the far turn. SOLVENT broke out and bumped a rival at the start, then showed little and was eased
turning for home. SONG BRIDGE pursued from midpack in the three path, but weakened between horses with a half mile to go and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
CLEAR THE AIR tracked from the two path, moved forward between horses before tipping to take aim from the four path entering the lane, bid in upper
stretch, brushed the leader while forging an advantage from that one at the furlong grounds and drove clear. DEMOLITION DUKE laid well back along the
inside, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and offered a good belated kick to reach place at the wire. SALT SPRAY (IRE) vied three wide, gained
command into the turn, led in the three path before meeting an outer challenge in upper stretch, took light contact from that bidder while getting headed at
the furlong grounds, yielded and got caught at the wire for place. DOUBLE CLUTCH pursued from midpack in the three path, shfited to the six path into
upper stretch, offered a mild kick to reach show at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked for that position shortly after. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) tracked
from the three path, shifted to the five path into upper stretch and lacked a punch. NOW THAT ICAN ROCK settled well back three wide, fanned to the
seven path into the lane before floating to the nine path in upper stretch and moved up late. JEFE DE OBRA (CHI) broke towards the rear, raced off of the
pace two wide, entered the lane in the six path before being floated to the eight path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD broke a
step slow while last away, trailed in the two path, then was blocked and stymied behind rivals through the final sixteenth. RANSOMWARE pursued from
midpack along the inside, encountered traffic in the four path in upper stretch and faded between horses. CHAPLIN led early on, got headed by a pair of
outer pressers into the turn, chased them around the bend, then weakened between horses. RIGEL laid off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor.
MACKVILLE prompted two wide and between horses early on, sustained pressure inside of his outer counterpart turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
GIRL NAMED CHARLIE stalked along the inside, pursued outside of the leader around the far turn, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, wrestled an
advantage at the furlong grounds and edged clear. BLISSFUL set a clear pace around both turns, met an outer challenge in upper stretch, got headed at
the furlong grounds and held place late. IMMENSITUDE (FR) tracked along the inside, tipped off the inner rail while pursuing the top pair into midstretch, but
only managed to chase in the final furlong and needed more to reel in place. HEAVENLY APPOINTED laid of of the pace two to three wide, shifted to the
four path nearing midstretch and chased willingly. FLATTER ME SILLY saved ground off of the pace to no avail. VALENTINA DAY hopped slightly and
broke a beat slow, trailed early on, took the far turn tow wide, moved out of last between horses in upper stretch and failed to threaten. CANISY tracked two
to three wide, but floated to the five path in midstretch and faded. WATCH THIS BIRDIE pursued from the three to four path, floated to the five to six path in
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SAFFA'S DAY tracked in the four to five path, sustained grinding progress to bid outside of the leaders at the sixteenth pole, edged past and lasted late.
LOFTY ADJUDICATOR laid off of the pace in the four to six path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, then rallied between horses with a late kick, bid inside of
the new leader nearing the wire but missed. SWOT ANALYSIS vied two wide and between horses early on, stalked rivals from the two to three path around
the turn, bid three deep in upper stretch, vied through midstretch before being bested by an outer bidder leaving the sixteenth pole, and lost place late.
MIDNIGHT ESCAPE laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly late.
CHAMPLIN vied three wide and between horses, prompted his outer counterpart while tucking to the inside into the turn, rebid inside of that one entering
the lane, dueled through midstretch but yielded with a sixteenth to go. INSOLITO prompted four deep early on, gained an advantage moving to the three
path into the turn, vied between bidders in upper stretch but weakened hanging on his left lead leaving the furlong grounds. LUDWIG was hustled forward
along the inside, prompted before checking back leaving the nine sixteenths pole, chased from the two path around the turn then gave way between horses.
READY TO POUNCE trailed in the two to four path and failed to menace. HIGHER STANDARD bumped an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the three
path, shifted inwardly entering upper stretch and failed to factor. POWERFUL laid off of the pace in the two path, checked when an outer rival shifted across
his path entering upper stretch and made little impact. BAYTOWN BEAR took simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at the start, lacked speed
along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
COCO CRUSH tracked three wide, sustained a grinding charge to close in on the clear leader in the final furlong and reeled in that one in the closing
stages. RISK THRESHOLD (IRE) set an unpressured pace, was let out to bump his margin around the far turn, but was collared in the final sixteenth and
lasted for place. STAY LOST laid off of the pace three wide, split foes in upper stretch and rallied with a belated kick, but needed more ground to reach
place. LIPOCHROME bumped an outer rival nearing the first turn, stalked along the inside and chased through the lane. SEMANTICS was bumped by an
inner rival into an outer foe approaching the first turn, saved ground in midpack, tipped three wide in upper stretch and pursued while one paced. MUNEERA
saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SISTER HONEY was bumped by an inner rival approaching the first turn, pursued from midpack two wide,
then three to four wide around the far turn and failed to factor. HAMPTON YARD made llttle impact two wide and between horses. WHY WASTE WORDS
broke a bit outwardly, trailed along the inside around both turns, shifted to the five to six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. I'M A COOKIE LOVER
stalked two wide but faded between horses turning for home.
