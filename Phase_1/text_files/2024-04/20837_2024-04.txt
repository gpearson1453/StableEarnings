Footnotes
JACKSON D prompted the pacefor tthe first half mile, rallied four wide to engage the leader turning for home and shook clear late in the lane. MIDNIGHT
HALO tracked the leaders down the backstretchm rallied four wide on the turn to duel in upper stretch, took a brief lead midwayt down the lane and was
outkicked by the winner while an obvious second best. LAST OF THE PAST reserved off the pace near the rear of the field to the final turn, made a steady
advance up the fence to the head of the lane, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly to be along for the show. SUNNY SASSICAIA stalked the
pace from two wide through the final turn, rallied to be with the leaders in upper stretch and failed to sustain the rally. MO CAN DO ducked into the gap
leaving the gate to be the trailer, raced at the rear of the field to the final bend and made a steady gain showing late interest in the stretch. JAYDE'S
BANDIT slow early to be near the back of the pack and made a belated rally in the lane. GRAND ENCORE saved ground with a rail trip to the far turn to no
avail having no impace. SEEKING A SOLDIER went one-paced. LOST MY BAG sped off to a clear lead down the backstretch and tired coming home.

CALCULATED LUV tracked the leader through the turn, cut the corner turning for home and prevailed in a hard drive up the inside. HYMN FOR CARLOS
sped to the lead shortly from the gate, opened a clear advantage on the bend and finished willingly while unable to hold off the winner. TRIPLE RED ACES
pressed the early pace down the backside, dropped off the leader in the turn and failed to close ground down the lane. EL IT went evenly failing to menace.
WICKED TOUGH was not a threat. GOTTA DEAL was outrun.

Footnotes
STEAUXLIT stalked the leaders to midway on the turn, rallied five wide nearing the quarter pole, engaged the leader midway down the lane and drew off to
the wire convincingly. STOVALL dueled on the lead from two wide to the top of the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, responded when challenged
by the winner but could not match that one late in the lane. REDDINGANDLEE unhurried for the first half mile to be near the rear of the field and made a
mild belated rally in the stretch to up for the show. COLT'S BRIM pressed the pace dueling on the lead to the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.
HAWAIIAN ARGUMENT tracked the leaders into the turn and lacked a response when called upon. JOSAN trailed throughout as a non-factor.

LEISURELY dueled on the lead from two wide to midway down the lane and pulled clear late in a determined drive. KNIGHT'S GOLD battled on the lead
from the rail to midway down the lane and could not go with the winner late. ROCKING TOBE tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied three wide to loom
in upper stretch and hung down the lane. CADILLAC BO trailed most of the way and passed a tiring rival in the stretch. BOLD AND BRASH contended early
prompting the pace from the rail and tired coming home.

Footnotes
SPOONFUL OF SUGAR set the pace under early pressure, opened a clear lead on the turn, widened the advantage in upper stretch when called upon and
drew off as much best. STRAIGHT MEADOW stalked the pace through the turn, rallied five wide down the lane and surged late to gain the place. SPECIAL
NOTE lunged at the start breaking a bit outward, tracked the leaders from the fence, tipped out while rallying nearing the quarter pole and chased the wineer
through the lane. SHE'S THE SHERIFF rated in mid-pack through the turn and lacked a closing bid in the stretch. LOCO BARN SENORITA went evenly
failing to menace. KASENS TRIBE shied away at the start to be at the pack of the field, continued well off the pace through the turn and passed weakening
rivals in the lane. QUEEN'S SOLDIER was not a threat. DUCK ROOST was never a factor. REQUITE THE EFFORT flahed speed up the rail through the
turn and came up empty turning for home.

Footnotes
A LIL PSYCHOTIC pressed the early pace on the first turn, settled off the pacesetter down the backside, rallied three wide on the turn to take command in
upper stretch and held the closers safe in the drive. SWEET ALEXIS tracked the leaders fro mthe rail to be well placed and closed well in the lane while
unable to narrow the gap to the winner. SIGNING reserved to race in mid-pack to the far turn and made a steady gain to be along for the show. CAPELLA
RED slow early to trail and made a belated rally in the lane showing some late interest. PURRING charged the gate just before the bell, was held by the
assistant starter and declared as a non-starter upon review. TROUBLE WITH SUGAR stalked the pace to upper stretch and faded down the lane. HARD
EXIT failed to menace. TAYLORS MAGIC set a pressured pace to the far turn, gave way on the bend, checked sharply from between horses on the bend to
be pulled up to the rear of the field and was galloped home. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND UPON REVIEW DECLARED
PURRING A NON-STARTER FOR NOT RECEIVING A FAIR BREAK.

Footnotes
GOTTEMINABIND settled off the pace, made an early advance three wide into the turn, engaged the leaders turning for home and pulled away in the
stretch. CRYPTO BRAVE tracked the pace to the top of the lane and made a steady rally down the stretch to be second best. BLACK ACE unhurried to be
near the rear of the field turning for home and showed good late interest with a belated rally. PINTORA pressed the pace from three wide and weakened in
the stretch. CANT ATTACK ARCH broke alertly to quickly open a clear advantage, was challenged midway on the turn and had no response flatteneing out
in the stretch. MYDEALOFTHEDAY saved ground to be well placed through the turn and lacked a closing response. BLESS D'SOUTH was not a threat.

Footnotes
BLUE CHEESE slow early to trail to the far turn, circled nine wide turning for home, closed with a rush to swallow up the leaders late in the lane to be going
away late. RIGHTANDJUST stalked the pace to the final bend, was put to a drive on the turn and kept on through the lane to be up for the place. DEVIL'S
HARVEST set a pressured early pace, opened a clear lead on the final turn and was out-finished late in the lane. EL PERFECTO tracked the leaders while
saving ground through the turn to be in striking distance at the head of the lane and failed to gain through the stretch. HOORAY AUSTIN reserved off the
pace near the rear of the field while saving ground along the fence, made up ground through the far turn while angling out four wide and lacked a closing
kick in the lane. GET THEM JUSTIN rated mid-pack while wide down the backstretch, continued to be caught wide on the turn and had no late response.
QUATERNION failed to menace. GUITAR BOY contended through the first turn, settled back between rivals down the backstretch and flattned out.
FRENCH COMPOSER pressed the pace for a half mile and gradually gave way.

Footnotes
BETONYA stalked the pace into the turn, rallied two wide to take command in upper stretch, opened a clear lead midway down the lane and held sway late.
WITH A SONG broke a step slow dropping back to be the trailer to the head of the stretch and rallied willingly to be gaining late in a good effort. MIDNIGHT
CIGARETTE tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied to threaten in upper stretch and finished evenly. QUITEGIRL reserved off the pace saving ground
along the fence, angled out turning for home and lacked a response for the drive. IDO SOLEMNLY SWEAR sped off to a clear lead on the turn and
weakened coming home`. EASY BET was not a threat. TRUTHRDAAR flashed brief speed to press the early pace and gradually gave way.
