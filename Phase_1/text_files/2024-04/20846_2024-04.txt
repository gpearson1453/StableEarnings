Footnotes
PARALLAX VIEW raced with the early pace inside, dueled for the lead toward the three eighths pole and ran clear approaching the quarter, rounded the far
turn at the rail and was steadily handled to hold on well. ABUNDANT STORY saved ground racing well off the early pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths
pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, took over second approaching the head of the lane and finished evenly. AMELIA'S DREAM stalked off the rail
the first turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and came along to recover third late. I SHALLBE
RELEASED settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened in
the lane. PALACIO hesitated at the break and raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
five path and drifted leaving the turn. FROSTY RIA raced with the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on
the far turn. MAKANI showed no speed, was not encouraged past the five sixteenths pole, was unsaddled on the clubhouse turn and appeared sore upon

Footnotes
VESELSKY rated close to the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, eased out to
come alongside SAM WHEAT entering the stretch and dug in determinedly to clear that one at the wire. The latter surged to the front approaching the three
quarter pole then angled to the rail and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on
the far turn, was met entering the stretch and dueled gamely to deep stretch before beginning to relent. ICETECA broke through the gate prior the start then
became fractious in the gate, saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn, drifted into the lane and
came along to take third the final yards. LET'S EAT settled off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the
rail and ran evenly in the lane. DENIZETTI rated close off the rail the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the five
sixteenths and faded in the three path on the far turn. FOE saved ground on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase, but showed little
response. GREEK EASTER dropped well back early on. Paynted Thunder broke through the gate prior the start, ran loose and was a late scratch.

the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. SUBJECT TO CHANGE stalked off the rail, closed to

UNISON tapered in and rated a slim lead over George, contested the edge two deep on the turn, was urged clear of that one mid-stretch and held well with
steady handling. JUBAWITHATWIST gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn and finished well while clearing second later
yards. GEORGE broke inward and made contact with RUNALDO then pressed the leader, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn,
but dropped back while flattening stride mid-stretch. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, left the
turn outside and finished evenly. GUN FACTOR chased the early pace inside, steadied then altered course leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three
path on the turn and weakened in the lane.

the turn and dug in under steady encouragement to get up the final strides. THEWITCHISGONE stalked off the rail the opening turn, took the nod into the
backstretch and came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady
handling from the head of the lane, but was caught in the final stride. MINISTRY OF MAGIC settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, moved to the outside entering the stretch and dug in to take third the final strides.
FIELDSTONE stalked from the three path the first turn, gave close chase into the backstretch but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride
later yards. DEPLANE saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened stride
inside the sixteenth pole. CAJUN JOE tapered in and took the lead passing the three quarter pole, was met leaving the first turn and gave chase from that
point, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. CALL ME GUSTO raced in the four path the first
turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
WATERLOO ROSE settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started closing from the three eighths pole, bid past the five sixteenths and raced in the
three path on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn and got up under the wire. BONNIE BLUETOOTH stalked off the rail the first turn,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to the lead two deep past the quarter pole, was steadily encouraged leaving the far turn but was
caught under the wire. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the turn, raced in the three path on the far turn and came
along to take third later yards. MAKINLIMMARGARITAS took the lead and angled to the inside to show the way, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole, was met a the rail past the quarter pole then flattened in the lane. MISS ANTIETAM raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. ONE LAS OLAS raced well back in the four path the first turn,
left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the lane. TOUGH
ENOUGH stalked the early pace inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. DORITA'S HEART rounded the
opening turn in the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the six path on the far turn. SHERIFF'S KID saved ground. BESTLA
raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
