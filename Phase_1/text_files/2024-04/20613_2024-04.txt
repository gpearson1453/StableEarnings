Footnotes
PAYNE outrun in the early going, moved closer in the two path through the turn, eased out for room entering the stretch, engaged the leader past the
furlong marker and edged clear. MAJOR BLUE behind the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, staged a mild rally up the inside to gain the place
late, no real threat to the winner. RITHM NIC broke well, set the pace toward the inside, came in the two path for the drive while still holding the advantage
into the lane, offered but brief resistance to the winner inside the furlong marker, nipped late for the place. NINJA WARRIOR pressed the issue up front
while largely in the three path, had little left for the stretch run. SPANKSTER fell back to trail after the start, raced inside, failed to menace. MACRON
forwardly placed while racing four wide, faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUMMER OF MISCHIEF broke on top, cleared to the inside soon after, showed the way into the turn in hand, shrugged off nearest pursuer when
straightened for home, opened up under a moderate hand ride then coasted home late to win ridden out. THE PRINCESS SAYS hustled away from the
gate, chased early inside, moved out turn, four wide for the drive, proved determined for the place, no threat to the winner. VOW last to leave, four wide into
the turn, three wide exiting, angled in, finished with some mild interest, not enough for the place. SHUTUP PLEASE void of speed, steered out a bit three
wide midway on the turn, improved position a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. TAKING CHARGE DESI in the second flight early, moved
closer to prompt the winner from the outside through the turn then gave way in the drive. FUNTIMEGIRL settled in mid pack while in the two path, came up
empty for the drive. SHE'S STORMING was never involved while racing three wide. NAVAGATIONALBEACON steadily faded inside.

Footnotes
CHEYENNE MOON settled off the pace and the inside, ranged up into contention three wide into the far turn, challenged from the outside soon after, edged
clear turning for home then held the runner up comfortably safe late. TWO PRACTICAL back off the early pace while outside into the first turn, moved in a
bit onto the backstretch, steered back out to be four wide into the stretch, closed with moderate energy to be slowly closing the gap on the winner late. MY
FAVORITE GIRL in the second flight while off the inside, continued in the two path out of the final bend, outkicked late for the second spot. ENIGMATIC
pressed the issue early while between foes, put a head in front after a half, showed the way into the far turn, began to weaken when headed by the winner
late in that bend. MISS CLASSIFIED prompted the pace three wide for six furlongs and weakened. MOENCHANTED narrowly showed the way into and
through the first turn closest to but not on the rail, continued to set the pace for just over a half, was headed late backstretch and gradually backed up. LADY
WOOPIG last away, angled in to save ground onto the backstretch, moved out, four wide through most of the final bend, lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BANDERA AZTECA forwardly placed on the outside in the run up the backstretch, vied four wide early turn, stretch duel, long drive, dug in late to prevail in
game fashion. DEFLATER in the second flight while racing off the inside, encountered some traffic turn, tipped to the outside for the drive, roused, late bid
while widest of the first flight at the wire, not enough. HAPPYMAC moved up to vie up front after the start, dueled through the turn, 2nd duel, stretch,
outkicked late by that rival while being caught late for the place. MEAN JAKEY back off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, mildly
through the stretch, not a serious threat to the top three. ATOMIC TONE lacked speed, raced three wide through the turn, lacked a serious response in the
drive. OLLIEMEISTER last to leave, trailed well back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BIG SWEDE vied up front three
wide early, began a steady retreat before a half. SHADY EMPIRE broke on top, set the early pace inside, dueled turn while continuing along the rail, gave
way in the drive.

Footnotes
WREAKING HAVOC outrun in the early going, moved out, four to five wide into the stretch when advancing, lost some ground to the leaders as a result, set
down, finished with good resolve down the middle of the strip to be up in time. STEALTHESPOTLIGHT in the second flight while three wide and between
horses, moved to challenge between horses turning for home, gained the advantage nearing the furlong marker, continued to lead late, nailed by the winner
in the waning strides. ALWAYS SMILING broke out, was straightened to race in mid pack, patiently handled three wide through the turn, asked into lane,
steered out with a furlong remaining, up late for the show. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN in the second flight while outside the runner up, moved with that one to
challenge turning for home, vied midstretch, lacked closing punch. CHOCTAW BLESSINGS pinched, off slowly, raced back and oft the inside, angled four
wide turning for home, improved slightly. MIRACLE SHOES shuffled early, raced well back, came four wide for the drive, improved position well out in the
strip with some belated interest. WEATHER MAP in the second flight while off the inside, continued in the two path, had little left for the drive. OH MY
GAWD off a step slow, three wide into the lane, remained always back. CATTY CRUISE failed to menace while racing off the inside. ADIOS MUCHACHAS
forwardly place along the inside, retreated. CHARLOTTES WAY broke well, cleared to the inside, set pace for a half then folded when headed.

Footnotes
MILLERS RITE last to leave, void of speed while trailing along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, rallied willingly up the rail to win going
away. MUSEUM QUALITY broke out but forwardly, with the pace from the start, dueled into and through the stretch in the two path, put that foe away inside
the furlong grounds, continued to lead late, could not contain the winner. PANCAKE HOUSE lacked early foot, inside turn, rallied through traffic, up late
toward the inside to earn the show. GLOBAL STAGE moved up the inside to vie inside, dueled through the turn and through upper stretch, faltered in the
late going to lose a couple of position. EXECUTIVE POWER floated out break, forwardly placed while three wide, continued within striking distance through
upper stretch, lacked closing punch. MEMPHIS PHAROAH broke out, settled in mid pack while off the inside, failed to muster a rally when called on for the
drive. FIREBALL BIRDIE briefly forward early toward the inside, began a steady fade before a half. LET'S GO CHAMP was finished early while racing
outside.

Footnotes
ON A SPREE allowed the pace to go early, advanced into contention far turn, challenged four wide and on the outside into the stretch, edged clear a furlong
out then continued to kick well clear under steady handling. MAGOO closest to the runaway leader for five furlongs, asked and went after that one far turn,
took over between calls into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, remained clear for the place. BEER CHASER lacked speed, closer in the two
path second turn, in some traffic late in that bend, remained toward the rail when clear upper stretch, altered course to the outside with a furlong remaining,
finished up evenly to prove best of the rest. NAMESAKE off a step slow, moved out onto the backstretch, early move four wide, challenged three wide and
inside the winner exiting the final turn, hung in the drive. MOTOWN MUSIC back off the pace and the inside, improved out of the two path into the lane,
flattened out the final furlong. KHOZY MY BOY four wide first turn when well off the pace, lacked a rally. HARD TO FATHOM forwardly placed along the
inside, began to fade after a half. CHAPEL BARN broke on top, soon clear, extended that advantage to a long lead up the backstretch, engulfed second
turn, stopped, trailed home.

Footnotes
HUSH IT HONEY unruly in the infield prior to the post parade, broke forwardly, allowed the speed to go in hand, went after that leader while moving out in
the two path to engage late turn, long, spirited duel through the lane, proved courageous late to be best. HAULIN ICE broke well, showed the way early in
hand, responded when the winner came alongside turning into the stretch, alternated up front in the run to the wire, gave ground grudgingly late. STHENIC
prompted the runner up from the outside in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, was stalled late in the turn when floated out a bit by the winner
exiting the turn, proved no match for that pair in the drive, saved the show. PRESLEYS TURN went one paced while racing off the inside, never a serious
threat. APPEALING ADDIE raced back and inside, came in the two path out of the turn, made little impact through the stretch. KAT'N CHROME broke back
and failed to menace. SUNNYANDSEVENTY broke in the air and remained back.

PISTOL broke alertly to race with the pace from the start, continued to vie while between foes through the stretch, proved game late no narrowly prevail.
TITLED LADY forwardly placed along the inside, crept closer along the rail into the stretch, battled on along the inside to the wire, narrowly missed while
gaining the nod for the place. CHOCTAW BINGO broke in good order, set or forced the pace throughout while three wide, missed by two noses. LETS
DECLARE PEACE in the second flight while off the inside, encountered some traffic late in the turn, lacked a closing response when clear for the drive to
prove no threat to the top three. MAJESTIC WAYS within striking distance off the inside, moved closer four wide turning for home, saw that progress stall
through the lane to also finish up one paced. SWEET ALYSSA last away, pulled under steadying restraint midway up the backstretch, in traffic five furlongs
out, moved out, four to five wide turning for home, also found lacking in the run to the wire. SHEZ STUCK UP lacked speed, four wide into the turn,
improved position a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. BANTERRA in mid pack and just off the inside, dropped to the inside for the drive, lacked
a bid. QUIERO DINERO broke back and was never a threat while moving out to three wide late in the turn. GATA RUNZ remained back while three wide.
MAIRSILS FIRST in mid pack early inside, shuffled back along the rail into the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
PATTON'S TIZZY broke sharp, set the pace inside, dueled through the turn, found more past the furlong marker to put that rival away and then just held the
runner up safe late to gain the nod. LANDLORD in the second flight under light restraint inside, continued to track the dueling leaders through the turn,
shifted to the outside for the drive, late bid outside the winner, missed. CHEZ WHIZ void of speed for a half, swung out widest for the drive, closed with good
energy out in the strip to be rapidly getting to the top two late. TWENTY TO PARK forwardly placed while just off the inside, loomed closer three wide
turning for home, flattened out the final furlong to finish up evenly. STRIKE RIDGE away in good order, pressed the issue winner early from the outside,
dueled through the turn and into upper stretch, first to blink past the furlong marker. GOD'S COUNTRY lacked speed, four wide exiting the turn, improved
position with some modest late interest without posing a threat. HOLUS BOLUS went one paced throughout while racing in the two path. RANCH HAND in
the second flight outside, fell back turn, not a threat through the lane. TOUCHDOWN ARKANSAS in the second flight while racing three wide, gave way in
the drive. ROCKET SANDERS remained back while racing inside.

Footnotes
KANT BELIEVE IT broke sharply, dueled up front off the inside into and through the turn, had a head in front with a furlong to run and drew clear under firm
handling. FILLY CRYSTAL also away well, alternated up front closest to the inside, yielded to the winner inside the furlong marker, clearly second best.
SWEET MOTHER MARY back off the pace inside, continued to save ground into the turn, encountered a bit of traffic midway on the bend, remained inside
and staged a mild rally up the inside to be in time for the show. MY FRIEND AMY last away, void of speed, moved widest for the drive, rallied, outkicked for
the show late. FASHION RAGE went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. MADAMOUSSEPOUSSE in mid pack while off the inside, four wide
into the stretch, lacked a closing response. PIONEER PARADE in the second group while three wide into the turn, two path exiting remained back in lacking
a rally. NEW BEAT broke out, within striking distance outside, four wide early turn, faded down the lane to trail in.
