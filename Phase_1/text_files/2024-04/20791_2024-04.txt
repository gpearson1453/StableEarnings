Footnotes
DIXIE GROOVE broke awkwardly, saved ground, bid into the stretch and edged off while kept to her task. KESTENNA (GB) trailed the initial half mile then
closed well outside for the place. NO MORE DIAMONDS prompted the pace outside, bid on the final turn then weakened. ELEVENMONTHSLATER settled
inside, held a brief lead in the two path on the final turn then faltered. AMALFI LADY lacked speed racing wide then passed fading rivals. MOONLITE IN
HEAVEN hustled to a clear advantage for half a mile then gave way. REACHING STRIDE moved close up outside to the far turn and stopped abruptly.
JOY'S PRIDE was ordered a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.

turned back a bid from the runner up and drew clear under urging. TRUE PHENOMENON was off a bit slow, tracked on the inside, chased on the turn,
angled out nearing the quarter pole, was floated wide turning for home, rallied outside and proved second best. MADE BIRDIE stalked three wide, chased
three wide on the turn and weakened. UNIVERSAL DESIGN stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and tired. SOULFUL TARA vied two wide for the
lead, dueled on the turn, chased and faded. SWEETEST MOMENT was off slowly and steadied, outrun early on the inside and did not factor.
ONTHISHARVESTMOON bobbled at the break, raced two wide and was outrun.

IFIHADACHANCE settled off pace inside, split rivals into stretch, just up. CABRA CHICA dueled four wide, led narrowly before the half and continued
gamely to the finish. JEZEBEL JADE lacked speed inside, moved wide, loomed threat but could not get by top pair. TAKE IT TO THE MAX trailed early then
finished with good energy too late. CONFIRMED GENIUS forced the pace down the backstretch, faded briefly then weakened in the lane. SNAPPY RIDE
dropped back early and never involved. MENDED WE STAND prompted the pace three wide between foes then faltered on the turn. MATTY BO earned a
narrow lead inside, dueled through the turn then gave way.
