Footnotes
SAVAGE DARLING unhurried early, closer in the two path late turn, dropped to the rail past the furlong marker, rallied up the rail to win going away. HAYEK
broke on top, set the pace inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage upper stretch, offered little resistance to the winner while drifting slightly, held sway
late for the place. TIZ SWEET CANDY behind the first flight outside, continued to stalk while four wide turn, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the runner
up late. MAMBA OUT pressed the issue up front while outside the runner up, had little left for the drive. RYE MUNNY lacked early foot, swung out to be five
wide exiting the turn, came up empty for the drive. SUBWAY SUSIE fell quickly back after the start to lag well behind, was never involved. DARE ME
forwardly placed while racing three wide for a half, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MY UNCLE LEON in some early traffic in the back of the pack, angled out steadily to be five wide in to the lane, roused for the drive, kicked down the leader
in the waning strides to be up in time. VALE in the second flight while racing outside, advanced four wide to a striking position exiting the turn, took over
nearing the marker, kicked down in the final strides, lasted for the place. WESTERN GHENT in the second group while racing three wide into the turn, two
path exiting, staged a mild rally to be closing the gap on the top pair the final sixteenth. MAHONEY ROAD back off the pace while along the inside,
continued to save ground through the turn, displayed some mild interest to improve a bit through the lane. TIRICO dueled up front in the three path for a
half, weakened. SPURRIER set or forced the pace while closest to the inside for a half and also began to weakend. GO OTTO GO well off the pace while in
the two path, tired through the stretch. RUN SMITTY RUN void of speed while inside early, steered out four wide turning for home, failed to rally.

Footnotes
LUV TO WIN broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, clear through the turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage into the lane, stayed clear while
drifting and while kept to pressure. RAYMOND behind the pace off the inside, moved closer four wide turning for home, could do little with the winner the
final furlong, drew clear of the others. SMOKIN' HOT chased the winner in the three path, could do little with that one through the stretch while failing to
contain the runner up. FULL AUTHORITY off a step slow, lacked early speed outside, four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally out in the strip to improve
position, not enough late for the show. STARBURST forwardly placed for a half along the inside, weakened steadily through the stretch. SQUARE DEAL
lacked early speed in the two path, improved a bit turning into the stretch, flattened out the final furlong. TIGER DAD in mid pack while racing three wide,
lacked a serious closing response. GET BACK GOLDIE was finished early while moving out three wide late in the turn. OTIS OTIS OTIS fell back to trail
after the start, dropped inside late turn, remained outrun,.

Footnotes
IMPECCABILITY lacked speed, advanced three wide into the stretch, late bid, proved best in a determined effort. THE HEIGHTS broke in, bothered a
couple of inner rivals, was straightened, dueled in the two path, continued to vie through the second bend, battled back late to contend, missed in a good
effort. P R CALL ME MAYBE behind the leaders inside,moved up to vie with an early rail bid before a half, stretched that advantage out in the second turn
and into the stretch, caved late to be overhauled at the wire. ROCKET NIGHT away in good order, set or forced the pace in the three path for six furlongs,
got out turning for home, trying to come back late. SAGITTARIUS crowded at the start, settled off the pace three wide, moved to the rail second turn, in
some traffic exiting that bend, went evenly to the wire. AUDEN also crowded back at the break, trailed early, made an early move to reach mid pack three
wide before a half, went evenly thereafter. JUST BE HAPPY in the main group early outside, four wide through the first turn, dropped inside for the second
bend, lacked a closing response. AMBIGUOUS fell back to trail before a half to be always outrun. DARVESH also fell back and was finished after a half,
trailed home.

Footnotes
PANDO tracked the pace from along the inside under confident handling, knifed through between horses turning for home in the two path, gained the
advantage, drew out then geared down late when comfortably in front to win ridden out. ARTWELL sprinted clear to show the way through the first turn in
the two path, continued to show the way up the backstretch, maintained the advantage through the second turn, offered brief resistance to the winner when
that one challenged into the lane, proved no match, held sway for the place. HESS forwardly placed early in the three path, fell back the middle half, came
four wide out of the final turn, late run to be getting to the runner up. CALRISSIAN in mid pack and four wide through the first turn, continued off the inside,
three wide through the second bend, went flat through the lane to finish up evenly. INTERLOCK EMPIRE last away, trailed early inside, angled 3w late
second turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. GO CATS prompted the pace while four wide early first turn, angled in while continuing to
forced the leader along up the backstretch, began to falter second turn when bothered and put in tight by the winner, continued to fade. DELUCA went one
paced throughout while racing off the inside, lacked closing kick. MAGNA TAP remained back while four wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick.
DYNAMIC SUN five wide in the first turn when with the main group, stopped after a half, far back, distanced jogged in.

CORPORAL closest to the leader, went after that rival and took over second turn, briefly clear late in that bend, headed from the outside, shrugged that foe
off inside the furlong marker and was edging clear again late. BROWNSTONE settled off the pace while three wide, patiently handled backstretch,
advanced and challenged the winner from the outside turning for home, briefly gained the advantage upper stretch, outkicked by that same rival the final
furlong. ELKO COUNTY bothered to be off slowly, raced well back for five furlongs, came four wide when advancing out of the final turn, continued willingly
to the wire to be clear for the show and closing the gap on the top two. YELL COUNTY went one paced three wide, asked along when moving slightly closer
late in the final turn, lacked a further response to finish up evenly. TORNADO ROAD brushed at the start, lacked speed inside, angled out to be four wide
turning for home, improved upper stretch then flattened out a bit the final furlong. FIRST BID off slowly, outrun early, asked along, fanned five wide turning
for home, lacked a serious closing response. MO EL GRANDE back off the pace inside early, two path second turn, continued one paced to the wire in also
lacking a closing punch. JESTER SANG in tight and bumped then steadied along the rail into the first turn, remained in the second flight the middle half and
then tired. LEAR bumped with JESTER SANG into the first turn when in tight with that one. WORLD FAIR sprinted clear soon after the start, set some quick
early fractions, stopped when headed in the far turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
CORKED dueled up front while off the inside, continued to vie into the lane, extended stretch battle, withstood a couple of rivals while between those two
late in a determined effort. AUTO DIAL behind the early leaders while just off the inside, came three wide for the drive, roused, late bid outside the winner,
denied. WITHOUT OBJECTION bumped at the start, raced forwardly placed early while toward the inside, fell back in some traffic turn, lacked clear room
from the quarter mile marker while bumped into the lane, dropped to the rail for room, finished willingly up the inside to be closing the gap. DALTON'S
RUTROW bumped start, lacked early foot out in the strip, fanned five wide into the lane, stated a mild rally to improve position while too late. BOURBON ON
FIRE within striking distance up the backstretch outside, four wide through the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. BARREL
THIEF stalked the two leaders three wide into the turn, crept a bit closer turning for home, lodged a tepid bid through upper stretch, faltered in the late going.
CADILLAC COWBOY dueled up front inside the winner, was the first to blink entering the stretch, was weakening when put in tight by WITHOUT
OBJECTION past the furlong marker, continued to weaken. STATLER jostled at the start to be away slowly, remained back. NATIVE MOONSHINE lacked
speed while well wide up the backstretch, dropped to the inside through the turn, trailed home well beaten.

Footnotes
SKELLY broke a bit back, soon cleared under mostly his own courage, set a blistering set of early fractions while under a light hold, extended advantage
late in the turn, not seriously menaced through the stretch under a brisk hand ride without feeling the whip. TEJANO TWIST last away, lagged well back
toward the inside, swung out four wide turning for home, rallied to be in time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. HAPPY IS A CHOICE in the
second flight while racing three wide, chased the winner into the lane while remaining in the three path, had nothing for that one in the run to the wire,
caught late for the runner up spot. RYVIT back off the pace just off the inside, came three wide out of the turn when moving slightly closer, flattened out in
the final furlong. JAXON TRAVELER lacked speed, in some traffic late in the turn, split foes entering the stretch, lacked a closing kick. PERFECT DUDE
closest to the winner early while three wide, gave way in the drive. I'M WIDE AWAKE in mid pack while racing along the inside, had little for the stretch run,
trailed home.

Footnotes
ALEXANDER HELIOS broke alertly, forwardly placed three wide first turn, challenged outside the winner turning for home and edged clear under steady
handling. RECKER POINT took command off the inside early, moved inside for the run up the backstretch, responded when the winner challenged into the
lane, dueled upper, then gave ground grudgingly. GAME KEEPER well back off the early pace, four wide advance second turn, could do little with the top
two in the drive, well clear of the rest. MEGAN'S HONOR off a step slow, was used to move up four wide through the first turn, continued within striking
distance second turn, three wide and in traffic into the stretch, finished up evenly to hold position late. MACKMAN forwardly placed, raced in the two path
second turn, in some traffic and in tight quarters entering the stretch, also went one paced to the wire. TRIGGER HAPPY went one paced throughout while
racing toward the inside, appeared to come out a bit in some traffic turning for home, continued evenly to the wire. . SILVER HEIST raced outside and
lacked a rally. SARA'S SHAMAN forwardly placed early along the inside, staged a steady retreat after a half. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL in mid pack into the
first turn along the inside, raced in traffic midway on that bend, fell back, encountered traffic again into the far turn, moved out, floated five wide into the lane,
remained back. ONTHESTAGE void of speed, four wide into the stretch, remained back. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF BY THE RIDER OF MACKMAN
AGAINST MEGAN'S HONOR FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
MUSIC MISTRESS in the second flight toward the inside, steered four to five wide out of the turn, closed with resolve to prove best while remaining on the
outside. MOZINGO with the early pace outside, continued to vie three wide through the turn, dueled into and through upper stretch, put a head in front past
the furlong marker as the winner came calling, outkicked by that one in the late going. MS CARROLL COUNTY away in good order, set or forced the pace
closest to the inside for five furlongs, could not match the top two late, saved the show. PUNCHY GIRL headed up the second flight while racing in the three
path, lacked a winning response through the lane. RUNNINTHESTREETS off a step slow, raced back, split foes three wide into the lane, improved position
a bit with some mild interest. HEATED ARGUMENT in mid pack and outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a significant closing response. TIMBAVATI
failed to menace while saving ground to no avail. DELTA MOON back off the pace, four wide into the stretch, also found lacking in the run through the lane.
SASSY LASS broke back and was never a factor. THE GIRL IN RED vied up front while between horses, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
ADARE MANOR away in good order, showed the way into the first turn in the two path, continued to set the pace up the backstretch while under restraint,
let out a not late in the final turn, quickly opened up and and was not threatened to the wire while being kept to task with an intermittent right handed crop.
FLYING CONNECTION last to leave when in a bit tight, continued to race devoid of any speed for six furlongs inside, swung out sharply to be six wide for
the drive, finished willingly to earn the place, not a threat to the winner. FREE LIKE A GIRL settled off the pace inside, crept a bit closer while saving ground
through the second turn, could not do anything with the winner while battling a rival for the second spot past the furlong marker, put that foe away but could
not contain the runner up in the final strides. SHOTGUN HOTTIE prompted the pace while outside, four to three wide late in the final turn when chasing the
winner past the furlong marker, weakened in the late going to lose a couple of positions. TAXED one paced while racing just off the inside, called on for run
in some traffic in a busy second flight turning for home, lacked the necessary closing response. WET PAINT void of speed along the inside, continued to
save ground second bend, steered out a bit into the two path for the drive, failed to respond. BELLAMORE settled off the pace while three wide first turn,
continued outside and was four wide through the final bend, failed to rally. MISTY VEIL made little impact while racing three to four wide. HONOR D LADY
pressed the issue up front in the three path, gave way midway on the second turn.

Footnotes
CLEAR ECHO away in good order, set a pressured pace for a half inside, disposed of that closest pursuer when straightened up for home, well clear past
the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. GREAT BARRIER in the second flight off the inside, came three wide into the lane, closed
the gap on the winner to challenge that on the outside, too late. MONEYSTRIKE pressed the winner from the outside for a half, began to gradually weaken
entering the stretch, lasted for the show. TIME ANDBEYOND bothered soon after the start in some traffic, saved ground into the turn, off the inside for the
drive, improved position with some late interest. MANDATORY MISSION off a step slow, raced back, four to five wide when advancing through the turn,
improved into the lane then flattened out a bit late. ALL GREEN LIGHTS back off the pace while angling in a bit, two to three path turn, in some traffic late in
the bend, went one paced when clear for the stretch run. SECRET HONOR checked up in some early traffic, raced well back, came in the two path for the
drive, also bettered position through the lane with some mild interest. BLESSED VISION in the second flight while racing off the inside, dropped to the rail
late in the turn and tired. STREAKIN DEACON in mid pack off the inside, three to four wide in the turn, had little left for the drive. IT'S A RAINY DAY was
finished early while racing four wide. TARPS STORM off slowly, trailed most of the way. CHANGING TIMES bothered early, moved up to race forwardly
soon after, beat a steady retreat before a half.
