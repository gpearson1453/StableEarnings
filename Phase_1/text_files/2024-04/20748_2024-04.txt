COPANELLO BAY moved up four wide to challenge in late backstretch, edged clear in the far turn and moved off under steady handling. MINISTER MAZ
contested the pace outside UNCLE SINGH to late backstretch, continued with the winner in the far turn and could not go with that one late while clearly best
of the others. MY BUDDY MEL stalked the pace three wide to bid with the winner into the far turn but could not sustain the move. UNCLE SINGH contested
the lead inside a rival and weakened in the far turn. B L'S CONCERTO was finished early.

Footnotes
GINGER RULES stalked the pace three and four wide while never far back, moved to challenge going up the backstretch, showed in front turning for home
and held safe under steady handling in the drive. OUTLAW X. moved with the winner going up the backstretch, continued well but could not produce the
needed late surge. CELERITY settled outside to rally four and five wide in the far turn then went evenly in the lane to be well clear for the show. DILLON
ROCKS made the pace on a short lead about the two path, continued to late in the far turn and came up empty. PAYNTER'S BOY saved ground in reach of
the pace, swung widest into the stretch but could not threaten. GETCHA stalked the pace from four wide and lacked a closing bid. NATE'S REVENGE
saved ground and failed to offer a bid.

place late. B T'S BAD BOY was on the pace outside a rival to upper stretch and came up empty late. BARTENDERS MISTAKE tracked the leaders three
and four wide to the far turn and lacked a final closing run. FOR REEL was in reach along the rail then steadied into the far turn, continued inside and was
blocked in traffic, swung out into the lane but could make no impact. TIZ BRIGHTER showed early speed along the inside and weakened.

FAYETTE WARRIOR was on the pace inside rivals about the two path, dug in when challenged on the far turn and repelled the big to edge clear in the lane.
HASTINGS SUNRISE forced the pace outside the winner throughout and could not handle that one late. VERRAZANO FIRST tracked the top pair four wide
and lacked the needed late rally. BIRDIE MACHINE was just off the leaders two or three wide and lacked a final closing run. SENOR JOBIM was in reach
four wide but lacked a final closing run. WEST WARPATH saved ground and lacked a rally. SISAWAY NOW was not a factor from along the inside.

LIBERTARIAN stalked the early pace three and four wide to bid in late backstretch, kicked clear in the turn then angled in through the lane while holding
safe. CHIEF TY HE was between rivals early, settled back and moved inside on the far turn, rallied back in the lane then steadied late as the winner moved
in and just held the place. The rider of CHIEF TY HE lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging interference which was not allowed. NOBLE
CONNECTION moved out heading up the backstretch, rallied three wide in the turn and continued with a mild late rally to just miss the place. BIG
HEARTED FACTOR angled four wide going up the backstretch but lacked a solid bid. STEPHEN'S ANSWER was with the early pace three or four wide and
weakened in the far turn. R T'S IRON MAN was always back. MINE MY TIME contested the early lead along the inside and weakened.

RAFAEL'S SURPRISE stalked the pace three or four wide to bid into the far turn, dueled outside OPTIMAL through that bend into the stretch and kept safe
to the end. OPTIMAL was with the early leaders to bid with the winner, dueled that one through the lane and could not get by. NO LIMITATION rallied three
wide to reel in the leaders through the lane but was too late. DOGE OF VENICE moved four and five wide to improve position in the lane but could not reach
the top ones. REVIVAL was along the inside and failed to mount a solid bid. FREE MAKER was not a threat while improving position and wide. BEHAVIN
MYSELF was not a factor. TOO LATE showed speed along the inside, checked along the rail midway of the far turn and dropped back into the lane. NASTY
EXAGGERATOR showed some early speed three wide and weakened.

TAKE CHARGE BABY dueled on the lead outside MISCHIEVOUS MISS through the opening half mile, edged clear in the far turn then drew off under hand
urging before being geared down through the closing yards. LADY MAZATLAN chased the pace three or four wide to bid through the far turn and held clear
for the place while never a threat to the winner. MASTER JANE bested the others while three wide. MISCHIEVOUS MISS dueled from inside the winner to
the far turn and had nothing left approaching the lane. RICHIE'S GAL was not a factor. SASSY MAMA was always back.

I CAME TO SHAME stalked the leaders four wide to rally in the far turn, continued outside in the lane and closed to prevail in the closing jump. GANGSTER
AMERICANO showed the most speed about the two path and could not contain the winner late. EXTRA INDY stalked the pace inside, moved out into the
lane and closed but came up short. OUR HALLIE stalked the leaders three wide but lacked a final closing run. JANIS was just off the early leader three wide
and weakened in the drive. SAENGER STAR failed to mount a bid four wide.
