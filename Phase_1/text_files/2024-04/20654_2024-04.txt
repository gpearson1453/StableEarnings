Footnotes
MALARCHUK away to the front, crossed to the inside, the rider sneaking a peek once clearing CUANDO, and was clipped behind by the rushing WELL
SCHOOLED with seven furlongs to run, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled, took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused
straightened away and went clear under a drive, then got geared down in the late stages to the finish. CUANDO chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors.
BOLT D'PLATA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to secure
the show honors. PARTY WITH SMARTY chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide
into upper stretch, weakened. SEQUENTIAL got bumped at the start by WELL SCHOOLED, who broke outwards, chased four then two wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. WELL SCHOOLED broke out a step at the start bumping SEQUENTIAL,
came under coaxing and was rushed in tandem with PARTY WITH SMARTY to his inside, had MALARCHUK cross over in front, shied in and clipped the
back of that rival bobbling heavily before regaining his footing, conceded five to six lengths of position while taken in hand before recovering stargazing
briefly before settling six furlongs from home, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing midway on the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and
trailed. There was a Stewards' Inquiry as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of WELL SCHOOLED alleging interference against MALARCHUK soon after the
start. After review the claim of foul was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
AMUNDSON stalked the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths pole, rallied outside to get the lead
in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and held under strong urging. MARKET ALERT broke out and hit the gate then was hustled, was taken in
hand when beaten to the front while against the rail entering the main-track, settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, cut the corner into
the stretch, gained under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and finished with good energy but was too late while clear for the place. BRONX BOMBER
was hustled from the gate, moved to the lead near the eleven-sixteenths, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook
clear inside the three-eighths pole, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong then
drifted out while tiring but held the show. BUSTIN SHOUT settled on the outside, was roused leaving the backstretch, went three wide while ridden along for
most of the turn then shifted to the four path outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. BIG ENGINE dropped well behind under urging,
saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved further out in the drive and failed to threaten. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS pressed the
pace on the outside, was urged along in the three path on the turn, dropped back inside the three-eighths pole, chased into upper stretch, drifted out outside
the furlong marker and came up empty.

GOOD REUNION chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping three then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. GIANT'S FIRE
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. MUAZARAH
coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader before advancing to duel with that rival through the turn taking over command
five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages
while safely preserving the show honors on the wire. SIN NOMBRE chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. BOBBY THE TANK showed the way early on along the inside before being engaged in a duel
through the turn with MUAZARAH, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to run and took the inside route into upper
stretch, then weakened in the stretch. XCELLENT MEN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung three
wide for home, weakened. DOLLY'S BANK chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before briefly tucking to the two path near the half mile
pole, went three wide through the turn under coaxing from midway, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SOLO IN PARIS chased
four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, made no impact.

Footnotes
CAPONE showed speed on the outside then moved clear near the nine-sixteenths, dropped in while dictating terms, saved ground on the turn, was asked
near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to the runner-up in upper stretch, fought back gamely in the final furlong, drifted out late and got up to
narrowly prevail. DOT'S DOLLAR was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the inside of the winner then switched out near the nine-sixteenths, chased
on the outside from that juncture, went around the turn in the three path, gained to take a short lead in upper stretch, led while battling outside the winner
into the final sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. HATCH angled out then chased the pace on the outside, dropped from the four path to the
two path early on the turn, angled out five wide into upper stretch, pursued the top two while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and willingly earned
the show. O'TROUBLE angled in while off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, came out into upper stretch and failed to rally.
CLEM LABINE was hustled from the gate but showed no speed, moved out while ridden along at the rear, lugged out some while under extra left-rein
pressure in the four path on the turn, spun six wide into upper stretch and was no factor. CAJUN CASANOVA dropped well back under urging, saved
ground on the turn, came out into upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BINGOOD TO KNOWYA chased just off the inside in aim of the leader, advanced on that foe to take command at the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and swung three then two wide into upper stretch, drifted out just outside the eighth pole and was corrected while drawing clear to the
finish to prevail. RING ME broke out at the start bumping WITHIN VIEW into UPTOMYKNEESINIT, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on safe for the place honors. WITHIN VIEW got bumped at
the start by RING ME and in turn bumped UPTOMYKNEESINIT, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SOLO RYE'D just off the inside early on, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. NEPTUNE BEACH coaxed from the start, chased along the inside early on and then two to three wide
thereafter, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. UPTOMYKNEESINIT got bumped at the start by
WITHIN VIEW due to pressure from RING ME, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths and yielded the front at that station, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. COMPUTE IT coaxed from the gate then taken up outside
the three-quarter pole, chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four wide at the head of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
SONDSLIKSOMDINIDDO broke a step slow and was last to commence, settled off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the turn, rallied seven wide
into upper stretch then made a bid, came in outside the furlong marker then bumped with a rival, took the advantage inside the eighth-pole, dueled with the
runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. JANSSEN showed early speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the
two path on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch, drifted out outside the eighth-pole, dueled with the winner in the final furlong, fought determinedly to
the finish and just missed while well clear for the place. SAVAGE SPIRIT settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn, came out six
wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. TRIPLE WORD SCORE settled on the outside, dropped back late
on the backstretch, went five wide for a majority of the turn, moved to the four then three path later on that bend, lugged in some in the stretch and improved
to just miss the show. ALPHA SONNY disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, drifted out
outside the furlong marker then bumped with the winner and tired. QOROKWE dropped well behind under urging, navigated most of the turn in the two path,
angled three then five wide late on the bend, came seven wide into upper stretch and was no factor. MALIBU MARGARITA settled off the pace, dropped
back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally then checked near the sixteenth-pole. POWER TEN broke out and was off a
half-step slow, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back four then five wide on the turn and capitulated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH
