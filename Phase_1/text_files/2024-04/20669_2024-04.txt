drive. SISTER SUPREAM sprinted clear early, raced near the inner rail and dueled through the stretch in a game effort. BOURBON WILDCAT , rated
between horses down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn and through the stretch and finished evenly. MOONSAFE , four wide around the
turn, was outrun. MATTITUDE broke in a tangle, steadied lacking room leaving the turn and failed to rally. BAD TEMPER chased the pace in the three path
to the stretch and gave way. ASHLEE'S RING , a forward factor early, raced along the inner rail and gave way.

Footnotes
MONEY ROOM , four deep tracking the early pace, ranged up in hand and engaged ARMY CADET from the outside around the far turn, vied with that one
while confidently handed around the turn, came under firmer asking into the lane, shook clear a furlong out then eagerly pulled away while kept to task.
ARMY CADET grabbed command early and set the pace off the inside while handling some inside pressure, edged clear then was joined by the winner
entering the turn, sparred inside that one to upper stretch, could not match strides in mid stretch but kept on with good effort to hold down the place.
COMMON PROSPERITY broke a bit slow, recovered and moved up behind rivals to stalk, steadied when in a bit tight between foes heading to the five
eighths, dropped back some into the turn then came back some under a ride three wide nearing the lane, gave hard chase from mid stretch but lacked a
serious finish. BRIDGE TO SUCCESS , off the pace and under a ride outside a rival mid turn, came three to four wide for the drive but failed to threaten.
GENERAL J R lagged back, saved ground into and through the lane but failed to muster up a rally. VESELSKY , three wide between runners stalking the
early pace, advanced off the rail to have aim past the three eighths, shifted out four wide with pursuit in upper stretch, failed to kick on leaving the eighth
pole and weakened. ELUSIVE IMAGE prompted the early pace to the inside of ARMY CADET, came under pressure trying to keep pace past the half then
faltered mid turn.

Footnotes
MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE brushed with an inner rival at the break, stalked between runners early, eased back a bit nearing the half then angled out, came
back under asking past the five sixteenths, bid three deep to engage the dueling leaders into the stretch, emerged in a battle outside MARTY'S MAGIC
leaving the furlong grounds, poked a head in front a sixteenth out, switched over to his left lead and dug in to prevail. MARTY'S MAGIC took over soon after
the break, denied STORMY SEAS entering the backstretch then cleared, was joined from his outside by INTREPID'S LEGACY heading into the far turn,
staved off that pressure around the turn then had to deal with the winner soon after, dueled gamely after being headed and saved the place. COSTNER
brushed with the winner leaving the gate, saved ground while within range through the backstretch run, hade the leaders get away a bit while coaxed along
past the three eighths, continued inside into the stretch while gathering steam, worked outward for the final furlong and closed willingly. STORMY SEAS ,
away alertly, moved up three wide around the first turn and prompted the pace, chased the leaders past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide into the
lane, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then faded. SILK SUIT broke slowly then steadied soon after, lagged off the pace after recovering, was under a
ride around the final turn, raced three wide in upper stretch then needed more between runners. INTREPID'S LEGACY , reluctant to load, edged up four
wide around the first turn and reached a forward spot, pulled his way forward then dropped in to engage the leader nearing the far turn, pressed, failed to
kick on between rivals past the three sixteenths then tired in the final furlong.

TATE set the pace along the inner rail under confident handling, was set down in upper stretch and drew away. EVENT PARTY , along the inner rail the first
turn, swung to the four path mid way on the far turn and gained the place. STRONG FINISH , four wide the first turn, advanced three wide entering the far
turn, chased the winner and tired. KRUG chased the winner in the two path and weakened turning for home. MOON WARRIOR was never a factor.
BAHAMA CHANNEL lost ground on the turns and was outrun. GRAND MANNER , three wide the first turn, raced along the inner rail the far turn and
retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
THE BAND RUNS ON broke slowly, quickly recovered and advanced three wide outside runners heading to the half mile marker, steadily advanced and
took aim of the leader entering the lane, moved to command a sixteenth out, responded to right handed asks and drew away. DETERMINED CANDY
prompted two wide early on, chased to the inside of the winner leaving the three eighths, dropped back a bit soon after, shifted out into the lane,
straightened and finished up with good energy to gain the place. IRISH HERO quickly went clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, kept on under
pressure past mid stretch, ceded a sixteenth out and faded late. WESTEROS , off the pace and about three wide early, bumped with an outer rival heading
to the half, was guided towards the inner rail into the turn, remained inside to advance past mid stretch, eased out a bit and churned on with some interest.
SUMMER READY stalked inside, saw the leaders get away around the turn, came out with a bit of run into the stretch, steadied as DETERMINED CANDY
was angled out, regrouped to pursue past mid stretch then came up empty. MYHEARTWILLGOON , in range four wide early on, retreated some around the
turn, circled five wide with a bit of a run in upper stretch, failed to sustain and faded in the final sixteenth. DATS MY PHARAOH was shuffled back early on,
bumped with an inner foe leaving the five eighths, was guided six wide for the drive, failed to go on and was eased late.

Footnotes
KAPADOKYA sped clear and set a rated pace towards the inside, kicked away when given her cue in upper stretch, was under a stout drive in mid stretch
and proved much the best. T C NEIGH , bumped at the break, rated off the early pace then advanced four deep mid turn, shifted out wider for the drive and
kept on with effort to gain the place. SIPPIN' TIME was nudged up early and stalked outside the winner, was under a hearty ride pursuing three wide into the
stretch, gave way grudgingly through the final furlong and saved the show. EXTRA DIRTY , to the inside of a trio of foes chasing mid turn, came up empty.
PAPERBACK EDITION broke a bit slow, accelerated to a forward spot between foes early, eased back off rivals nearing the turn, chased three wide
between runners mid turn, altered out near the sixteenth marker and kept on trying. VALLEY STAR , three wide outside a rival mid turn, lacked a serious
kick. ANY FOOLS GOLD , off last when awkward from the gate, lagged back inside, swung very wide for the drive and had belated action. BUCKIN' LUCKY
, off the pace, raced six wide into the stretch, shifted in some and failed to menace. MAXIMUM EMILY , bumped start, saved ground under asking mid turn,
remained inside for the drive and failed to generate a rally. SHARED AUTHORITY , jostled at the break, was checked when attempting to advance between
runners nearing the half, chased two wide between foes mid turn and faded. CUNDI came in at the break bumping a rival and causing a bit of a jam up, was
outrun.

Footnotes
BELLA BETTINA lacked speed, was patiently handled down the backstretch, stayed along the inner rail to the quarter pole, swung to the five path in upper
stretch, closed resolutely outside rivals and took the lead approaching the finish. FUHGEDDABOUDIT raced in the two path between horses around the turn
and rallied between rivals. CHICKIENESS sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace near the inner rail, opened up in mid stretch and weakened late.
WINKIWINKI prompted the pace outside CHICKIENESS and weakened. BABA hugged the inner rail most of the trip and lacked a rally. LADY ZETA , four
wide chasing the pace on the turn, gave way. HALEIGH B , outrun, was three deep turning for home.
