Footnotes
BACK BAYOU went to the front, drove clear, shook off a challenge by YOCKEY'S DRIVETHRU and pulled away. YOCKEY'S DRIVETHRU pressed the
pace, raced close throughout, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but was best of others. BOSTON BLITZ lacked early speed, moved up on the
outside around the turn, gained ground, but proved no match for the top two. GAME AND GORMLEY raced near the back in the beginning, made a steady
gain, but was no factor. SLEW CITY HENRY void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no threat. KEV MAN raced within striking distance, made a
mild bid at the 1/2 pole and faded. INCHHIGHATAHUNDRED lacked early speed and raced evenly in middle. SAUCER EYES raced evenly near the back
and showed little. GRAN CHICO raced within contention and dropped back. SENOR VEGAS showed brief speed and retreated to the back.

Footnotes
COFFEE COUNTY unhurried in the early going, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch, made a wide rally and proved
the best late. WOOD RIVER raced near the middle of the field, came around the second turn on the outside, dueled to the wire and was caught late.
JOEY'S LIGHTENING raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, made a bid down the home stretch, took the lead, but was outfinished by the
top two. THROWIN' SHADE broke in, racing near the back, made a steady gain and finished willingly. I DON'T VENMO void of early speed, showed late
interest, but was no real factor. PEANUT N IKE raced within striking distance, made a bid and weakened. NERVY pressed the early pace, being reserved
and faded after a half. PERRINS showed early speed and faded on the inside. RUN ON ACES always raced near the back and showed little. ANDERS
SMILE went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and dropped back.
