Footnotes
QUEEN KARIMA pressed in the three path, took the lead while under a nudge two wide midway around the turn, drew clear in upper stretch, and drifted out
in the final furlong while continuing to inch away. SHUANGXI (IRE) stumbled at the start but recovered well to lay up close while under a hold from the two
path, was roused midway around the turn, swung from the four path into the stretch, and ran on for place. SILVRETTA (GB) trailed in the five path, waited in
the four path rounding the turn, fanned widest around the ten path turning into the lane, and rallied for show. WRIGHT UP FRONT tracked in the five path,
was coaxed along in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on. HUNTINGCOCO had a slow
start, laid off the pace along the inside, steadied going into the turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, but was one paced. TICKER TAPE
HOME rated in the three path, but got stymied in the two path passing the quarter, and made no impact. THREE GIRLS stalked in the four path but flattened
from the seven path down the lane. MY LADY JAMES set the pace inside but yielded in the stretch.

BOOMCCHERO hit the starting gate, advanced inside down the backstretch, stalked from the rail around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, moved to the
front near the sixteenth pole and drew clear late. FASTEST set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, led to the sixteenth pole and
held well clear of the rest. STAR OF THE BEAST chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally and was along for the show. CALYPSO CHARLIE
pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. FRIENDS WITH FIDEL saved ground and failed to menace. KALIMAN hopped at the start, raced
off the pace two wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. FAR FROM A STAR failed to menace while racing four wide.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE GRIT showed the way in the two path, was ridden along while just off the rail rounding the turn, lost the lead before the quarter, but dug in along
the inside in upper stretch, stuck his head back in front passing the eighth pole, and held on gamely. TOXIC GRAY stalked in the five path, was cued in the
four path approaching the quarter, bid turning into the stretch, ran on while dueling with an inner pair into the final furlong, but hung for place. TURBO got
bumped by an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace in the four path, bid in the three path early around the turn, took the lead nearing the quarter, kept on
between foes from the two path into the stretch, but was edged out in the final furlong on both sides to show. BRON AND BROW tracked in the three path,
was coaxed approaching the quarter, tipped out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kicked on, but drifted out in the final furlong. SANTOS TO
WILSON broke out and bumped an outer foe, trailed in the six path early and never threatened from the eight path down the lane. BOCA BOY chased inside
but never menaced.

outkicked in the lane. DOUBLE NEAT saved ground in range, steadied midway around the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and had a mild stretch
rally. THE DOVER SPECTER broke inwardly, raced off the pace outside, was forced five wide around the clubhouse turn, raced three wide around the far
turn and was never a threat. ALRASIKH was bumped at the start, raced three wide and passed tiring rivals. GAGLIARDI pressed the pace two wide and
tired in the lane. IL SICILIANO was bumped at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. MIDNIGHT COUNCIL saved ground in midpack, swung out

RAGING FURY laid up close in the three path, bid going into the turn, took command midway around the turn, was cued passing the quarter, kicked away in
upper stretch, and held sway. BEASTLY SPEED chased in the four path, steadied just before the three-eighths, was driven in the six path around the turn,
and kept on from the seven path in the stretch for place. THREETHIRTYTHREE tracked inside, came under a ride from the two path going into the turn,
floated out to the four path entering the stretch, and finished evenly for show. SOUTHERN DREAM raced off the pace in the five path, was driven in the four
path around the turn, but flattened in the six path down the stretch. HAY HAY HARRY showed the way in the two path, but lost the lead midway around the
turn, and gaveway. APOLLO CODE had a slow start, trailed in the two path and never menaced.

Footnotes
EPONA'S HOPE set the pace in the three path, was roused while floating out to the five path in upper stretch, drew clear on his left lead, and drifted inwards
in the final furlong. QUIMICHIS rated inside, waited along the rail around the turn, angled out to the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied for place. SONG
OF NORWAY prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed along rounding the turn, and kept on in the five path down the lane for show. ARTEMIS
SOUND broke out and bumped an outer foe, chased in the three path, finished evenly from the five path in the stretch, but had to steady late. BUBBLY
CHAMPAGNE raced wellback in the two path, got stymied turning into the stretch, angled out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, but made no
impact. RIPAROUND pressed inside but faded in the stretch. BEANPOT stalked in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, but flattened in the three
path just after the eighth pole, and had to steady late. WHATTA WORLD trailed in the four path and never factored. TAPRIXIE bumped with an inner foe at
the start, raced in midpack in the four path but weakened from the eight path in the stretch. ICED COFFEE raced off the pace in the four path but never
menaced from the ten path in the stretch. DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT tracked in the three path. but steadied passing the quarter, and gaveway.

Footnotes
SCAT TU TAP rated inside, was cued from the rail midway around the far turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the stretch, rallied into the final
furlong, got bumped by an inner foe around the sixteenth, but surged to get up on the wire. SENTENZA showed the way in the two path turning into the
backstretch, was roused along the inside into the far turn, kicked on from the two path into the stretch, but drifted out in the final furlong, and was nailed at
the wire by an outer foe to place. EXERCISE OF POWER tracked in the two path, was cued in the three path midway around the far turn, floated out to the
five path at the top of the stretch, and drifted out and bumped the eventual winner around the sixteenth while keeping on for show. FLY RIGHT prompted the
pace in the three path, was coaxed while two wide midway around the far turn, and finished evenly between foes in the four path down the lane. KAKE'S
ARROW laid up close along the inside, came under a ride midway around the far turn, but was one paced from the two path in the stretch. STORM READY
chased in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the far turn, but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. PARKWAY got bumped by an
inner foe into an outer foe at the start, floated out to the six path early around the first turn, raced wellback in the five path down the backside, fanned out to
the eight path turning into the lane, and did not threaten. GALLANT MISCHIEF broke out and bumped an outer foe, was behind in the three path and never
menaced. MONEY MAGICIAN got bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack from the four path but was empty entering the lane.
BROADCASTER got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, stalked in the five path but weakened entering the stretch.
