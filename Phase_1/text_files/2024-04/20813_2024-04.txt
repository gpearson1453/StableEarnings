Footnotes
MAN FRIDAY lacked speed, began to pick up the pace entering the far turn, swung to the five path approaching the stretch, wrested command near the
eighth pole and drove clear. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) , in the two path on both turns, chased the pace in a willing effort. BIGFOOT CITY accelerated to the
early lead and was taken to the inner rail, set the pace along the rail to mid stretch and gradually weakened in the drive. FALSELY ACCUSED , a forward
factor along the inner rail around both turns, swung outside approaching the sixteenth pole and leveled off. PRIMO TOUCH , a forward factor outside horses
to the stretch, gave way. MEDIMPACT was not a factor.

WOK DON'T RUN raced outside horses, was fanned to the six path by SMOKEMONTHECLIFF leaving the turn and rallied. SMOKEMONTHECLIFF raced
slightly off the inner rail entering the turn, drifted to the five path at the head of the stretch and passed a tired foe late. WHATWASTHENISNOW set the pace
near the inner rail and gave way. POP CHART raced near the inner rail while outrun.

Footnotes
DADS ESTRELLA advanced in the two path between horses leaving the backstretch to challenge for the lead, battled inside horses through the stretch and
determinedly prevailed. CHESTERETTE , three deep leaving the backstretch, gained a short lead on the turn and was out finished. MISS UNION swung
very wide leaving the turn and rallied outside horses. TWELVE STARS , far off the rail on the turn, raced inside horses in the stretch and flattened out. GO
GO SADIE lacked speed, was very wide on the turn and failed to sustain her move. ASENA , four wide chasing the pace, gave way. GRACIE'S A TIGER
showed speed along the inner rail and gave way on the turn.
