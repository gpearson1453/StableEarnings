reserved ground down the stretch, came out four wide leaving the turn and was gaining in on the leader but it was not enough in the end and was best for
second place. PEEK FACTOR chased the leaders while four wide, then inched up on the turn to bid gamely for the lead heading into the turn but did not
have enough to catch the pace setter in the end. REASON OVER RICHES tracked the pace from the inside, came out three wide leaving the bend to bid
mildly in the stretch but it was to no avail. BLUSHING BELLE vied between rivals, was in tight and steadied back to the latter group , then made a mild bid
leaving the bend while four wide and came up empty in the lane. CITY GHOST pressed the pace while four wide and outside of rivals, then menaced from
the two path on the turn in attempt for the lead but lacked sparking in the lane. RECLUSIVE vied for the lead while three wide then continued to press the
pace on the turn and while in a strong bid before flattening out in the stretch. IZATIZ vied from the two path while in a hard drive then flattened out on the
turn.

Footnotes
DOSE'S DREAM prompted the pace from the inside before taking command momentarily at the top of the turn, then was challenged by an outer rival
heading into the lane, sparred grudgingly before kicking clear in the final yards and was up at the right time to prevail. DETECTIVE BERNARDO broke
outwardly at the start, then pressed the pace while three wide, then moved up to duel with an inner rival heading into the stretch then was out kicked in the
final furlong and was second best. JUST OKIE chased the pace from the inside, then rallied leaving the turn and needed more in the stretch. AARON'S
SPIRIT was allowed to settle along the inside and was no threat. NOOGE led the way under a brief bid while two wide, then settled back to third position on
the turn before flattening out in the lane. CROSSTIME settled back to the tail of the field and failed to rally.

NAUTICAL MOON saved ground in the early stages, then came out five wide leaving the far turn, dug in gamely and found the best stride in the late stretch
to be up at the wire. MALIBU S S pursued the pace while four wide, then vied with inner foes on the far turn, gained the lead at the eighth pole then was
caught in the final seconds and was second best. WORDS OF WISDOM was bumped at the start, was allowed to settle along the inside, then rallied in the
late stretch from the four path, bested the rest of the field and was up for the show prize. BOBBY BRINKLEY stalked the pace from the three path down the
backstretch, then menaced on the far turn and into the stretch and needed more in the end. ELUSIVE D'ORO dueled with an inner rival into the first turn and
down the early backstretch, was confronted by another rival on the outside to battle on the far turn then gave way in the late stretch. FEDERAL HILL was
allowed to settle in the two path down the backstretch, came out six wide leaving the far bend to bid in the stretch and came up empty. QUARTERBACK
DAK broke outwardly and bumped foe, stalked the pace while two wide throughout the first three quarters then rallied in the upper stretch before giving way
in the end. SEIZE THE TREASURE dueled from the inside heading into the first turn, was met with a third rival heading into the second half of the course to
battle it out on the far turn, was used up and weakened in the home stretch. TEXAS HOLDEM raced from the inside mid pack, then bid mildly on the far turn
and lacked rallying in the home stretch. There was a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of WORDS OF WISDOM claimed foul against the
rider of FEDERAL HILL for interference at the start. After reviewing the replay, no change was made.

NEW BERN pressed the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then gained command on the turn and drew clear in the stretch to prevail in the end.
CORREDOR vied briefly while three wide before settling back to conserve energy down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the turn and closed well for the
place prize in the end. MIND HUNTER chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace down the backstretch and into the turn, then rallied in the late
stretch, lacked the winning bid and was best for the show prize. MASTER OF DISGUISE chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then shifted
out the the three path to bid on the turn and into the stretch but it was to no avail. DEACON JONES chased the pace while three wide at a flat pace
throughout and needed rally. UKRAINE STRONG vied early then took command to set the pace down the late backstretch, was in a hard drive on the turn,
was overpowered by outer rivals and lost momentum in the final furlongs. THE OX trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GOOD SWIMMER saved ground in the early furlongs, then dug in gamely along the rail mid stretch and was up in time to prove best. FROM THE HEART
trailed behind the field in the early stages, circled five wide leaving the far bend and closed belatedly missing by a nose in the end. CANATLAN broke
outwardly and hindered rival, then pursued the pace while three wide down the backstretch, urged steadily on the far turn then closed willingly. BIG WAVE
JAMES tracked the pace from the inside, was in a steady drive leaving the backstretch and heading into the far turn, angled out to the four path and kept on
under a mild bid in the end. BAY BE GONE saved ground in the early stages, bid three wide on the far turn, continued to drift out five to six wide in the lane
and came up empty in the end. WITCH'S VOW led the way into the first turn, was in a long drive heading in the second turn, was depleted and faltered in
the stretch. OPTIMAL TRIP was allowed to settle along the inside down the backstretch, then bid in the stretch but it was too little too late. WHITEROSE
JEWEL was in pursuit of the pace while three wide into the backstretch, then inched up on the far turn in attempt to steal the lead under a gamely bid but
lacked the winning spark and gave way in the end. SWAMPDRAINER was no menace. CRAZY RIDGE was impeded at the start, then was forwardly placed
in the two path to stalk the pace down the backstretch, was in a hard bid on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch.
