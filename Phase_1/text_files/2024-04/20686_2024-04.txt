SWEET UNIQUE chased the pace down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the turn to make the lead in upper stretch, shook clear under right handed
urging and lasted under a strong hand ride. LADY LOTTIE stalked the pace along the inside into the turn, shifted three wide past the five sixteenth marker,
dug in through the stretch and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. SHE'S CRAFTY unhurried early, saved ground through the turn then
found her best stride late between horses. CROSSED UP failed to menace. HIGH FIRE saved ground and passed tiring rivals through deep stretch. WINE
ME UP BABY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then weakened. SERGER with the second
flight, was through after a half.

MY GIRL KEW vied for the lead three then two wide, dug in late under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. GOLD HONEY broke sharply, set
a pressured pace into the stretch, edged clear before the furlong marker and just missed hanging on. DERBY DAY KISS pressed the early pace along the
inside, dropped back a bit on the turn then went evenly. ARTISTIC LANEY failed to menace. OH GLORIOUS DAY was a forward factor into the turn then
weakened.

ALWAYSINTOMISCHIEF prompted the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, responded under left handed urging and finished full of run to win as much
the best. GUNNER GABRIEL sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace to the quarter pole then was no match for
the winner while clearly second best. EKATI'S WAY never far back, improved position through deep stretch inside rivals for a minor share. REIGNING
DREAM offered a mild bid four wide through the turn and into the stretch then leveled off. SPELLCAST failed to menace. MIDNIGHT VOYAGE moved up
three wide on the turn then came up empty. SCRIMPER had speed into the turn then wilted. SHADOWY had brief speed. GOLDEN FLAG was through
early. RUN RED RUN was always outrun.
