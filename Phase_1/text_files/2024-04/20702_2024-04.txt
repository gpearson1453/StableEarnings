Footnotes
CODE FOR SUCCESS moved up to press the issue three wide into the first turn, continued to force the issue up the backstretch, engaged the leader and
dueled through the final bend and into the stretch, disposed of that foe inside the furlong marker then had enough left to hold off the runner up. FEARLESS
KRISTIE settled off the pace and the inside, fell back while three wide into the far turn, swung out five wide turning for home when beginning to advance,
finished willingly to be in plenty of time for the place, getting the winner late to miss. GHOST BAYOU broke on top, showed the way along the inside, set a
pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled through the final bend inside the winner, continued on equal terms with that one upper stretch, first to blink inside
the furlong marker, could not contain the runner up. TYRONA within striking distance early along the inside, lost contact with the two leaders through the
second bend, went evenly through the stretch. WAR MUSIC void of early foot, pulled through the first turn three wide, continued three wide into and through
the second turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. DELPHIA four wide when with the main group first turn, three wide
through the second bend, tired. LADY COMMANDER off a step slow, moved out and raced four wide through the first turn, closer before a half then gave
way to trail home.

Footnotes
PALACE KITTEN broke with the field, raced four wide through much of the turn, set down entering the stretch, rallied with good to be up in time between
horses. WYFIRE away well, within striking distance well out in the strip, five wide through the turn, rallied outside the winner through the lane and was also
going well at the end. VERB prompted the pace three wide and between horses, ranged up to challenge late in the turn, dueled through upper stretch,
gained the advantage past the furlong marker but failed to contain the top two at the end while inside that pair. MYSTERY MAN narrowly set the pace inside
and in hand, responded when challenged late in the turn, dueled past the furlong marker then faltered the final sixteenth. DESOTO'S WAR in tight just after
the start, raced back early as a result, three wide, moved out 5w midway on the bend, improved a bit while not a serious threat. REUP in mid pack while
toward the inside, saved ground to no avail. DRILL'S LI'L MAN pressed the issue early from between horses, gave way late in the turn. WHOOPING JAY
prompted the pace while four wide into and through the turn, gave way in the drive. PULL MY CHAIN in tight early, remained always back.

Footnotes
READY FOR TROUBLE off a step slow, moved up under stout restraint inside, advanced and encountered some traffic off the rail late in the bend,
challenged four wide into the stretch, quickly well clear to win ridden out. JANUARY JUBILEE void of early foot, patiently handled while four wide through
the turn, shifted out for room behind a wall of horses in upper stretch, closed willingly down the middle of the strip to be in time for the place. SISTER ELLA
away in good order, tracked the pace under restraint along the inside, tipped out a bit entering the stretch, late bid for the place, missed. SINGSATIONAL
away a bit slowly, two to three wide, bid into the lane, offered little resistance to the winner, flattened out to lose the place late. MISS SAIPAN broke on top,
cleared to the inside, set the pace four just over a half, faltered when headed turning for home. CHIP SHORTAGE back off the early pace out in the strip,
three to five wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. SHOW ME THE CANDY fell back to trail after the start, raced five wide into the turn, dropped
inside, failed to rally. RONNIE'S DEAL chased the early leader in the two path, gave way late in the turn.

Footnotes
SEVEN NATTY PATTY broke on top, showed the way first turn in the two path, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, responded when challenged
and dueled through the second bend, shrugged that rival off when straightened for home, kicked well clear while being kept to pressure.. UNION DAME in
the second flight off the inside, moved a bit closer three wide late in the final turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, edged clear for the second
spot. MOR HAPPY HOURS moved out a bit to press the winner from the outside early in the first turn, pressured that one up the backstretch and into the far
turn, engaged from the outside soon after, dueled, also proved no match for the winner in the drive, outkicked for the place. TANDI SUE bumped at the
start, settled in mid pack, three wide into the far turn, angled out a bit midway on that bend then steered out to be three wide again into the lane, went evenly
to the wire in lacking a closing kick. RUN FOR HOME forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, fell back the next quarter, floated four wide into
the lane, lacked a late kick. LINE RUNNER lacked speed while toward the inside throughout, saved ground to no avail. PALMILLA'S BET fell back to trail
after the start, lagged well back and was not involved. SUENA bumped, off slow, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE CHAOS broke on top, vied up front early while between foes, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, shook clear when straightened for
home, enough left to hold the next two safe in the waning strides. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY in the second fight along the inside, continued inside through the
turn, finished willingly up the inside to gain the place. CACTUS vied up front outside in the run up the backstretch, dueled outside the winner turn, could not
keep up with that one in the drive, outkicked for the place. INDULGE fell back to trail after the start, raced in the two path through the turn, improved position
through the lane while too late. HUSKER BUTCH lacked speed while well off the inside, three to four wide exiting the turn when moving a bit closer,
flattened out while widest through the stretch. BALSA in mid pack and off the rail, three wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive.
SPEIGHTSVILLE remained back in lacking a closing response. CROCODILE TEARS vied up front early while between horses, gave way.

Footnotes
LOCHMOOR behind the while moving out into the three path first turn, continued outside in the second flight, advanced four wide through the second turn to
challenge into the stretch, drew steadily clear while being kept to pressure. CYBERTOWN took over soon after the start, clear in the two path first turn,
continued to show the way while just off the inside into and through the final turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, saved the place late. NAVY
SEAL raced back off the pace while four wide through the first turn, four wide again second bend, set down for the drive, slowly gaining for the second spot.
MAN IN THE CAN chased the leader in the three path for a bit over six furlongs, could not keep up with the winner when that one went by in upper stretch,
chased, weakened late to lose a couple of positions. STUCK N SNOW last to leave, raced devoid of speed while four wide onto the backstretch, four to five
wide seconds turn, improved a bit in upper stretch then flattened out. BLACK APPLE fell back to trail after the start, raced outside as well, came four wide
out of the final turn, failed to fire. DINNER AT CRUMPIES lacked speed, came three wide for the drive, remained back in also lacking a rally. AFLEET SKY
in the second flight along the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
STORMS HOME settled in the second flight along the inside, asked along late turn, altered course to the outside for room past the furlong marker, closed
with a rush to be in time while coming in late. GO THE DISTANCE dueled up front along the inside, gained a larger advantage past the furlong marker,
continued to lead late, drifted out, caught in the final strides. CAPITAL CONNECTION dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternated outside the
runner up into and through upper stretch, first to blink a furlong out, was weakening when put in tight by the top two late, held the show.
GIMMEETHREESTEPS off a step slow, raced well back while in the two path turn, late run through traffic to be gaining for the show. HAILSTORM in the
second group inside, continued to save ground turn, went largely one paced through the stretch while remaining along the rail. COACH JIMI D in the second
flight three wide and outside the winner, tired through the stretch. RONALDINHO in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn, moved a bit closer
approaching the furlong grounds, faded late. OKIE CLIPPER off the inside while back off the pace, four wide into the lane, made little impact through the
stretch. CHARBON remained back while four to five wide turn. AFTER A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TAXES with the pace on the outside after breaking in good order, vied three wide through the turn, kicked clear through upper stretch,
maintained daylight final furlong. CATHEDRAL BEACH lacked speed while outside, angled out a bit and rallied four wide, finished up willingly to be in time
for the place, not a threat to the winner. PLAUSIBLE DENILE off a step slow, raced well back for a half, split foes past the furlong marker and was also
going well at the end. MANTA REY void of speed along the inside, set down for the drive, displayed a modest amount of interest up the rail to improve
position. CODE FIVE in mid pack just off the inside,moved inside late turn, moved back off the rail for the drive and finished up evenly in lacking a closing
response. BRESLAU with the pace while along the inside for half, roused late turn, gave way. W W SCOUT'S HONOR with the pace while between horses,
weakened through the stretch. VODKA MARTINI in the second flight early along the inside, backed up after a half while three wide out of the turn. MUSICAL
MAESTRO in the main group while four wide late in the turn, also gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CAPTIVE AUDIENCE took command soon after breaking in good order, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, continued to set a pressured pace far
turn, gained a larger advantage into the stretch, edged clear late then held the runner up safe late. GET AWAY WITH IT lacked speed, moved closer four
wide late in the final turn, chased the two leaders past the furlong marker, come late interest to be slowly getting to the winner late while holding sway for the
place. EQUATE forwardly placed while on the outside first turn, continued to prompt the pace backstretch, vied three wide second, could not match the
winner in the drive while proving stubborn for the second spot. YOU'RE ON MUTE lacked early foot, angled four wide when advancing into the stretch,
continued willingly to the finish while too late. OUR HEAVENLY GIFT pressed the issue for five furlongs outside the winner, vied between horses through
the second turn then weakened gradually through the lane. PRINCE IS MY BOY broke back, lacked speed, steered five wide turning for home, improved
position in upper stretch then flattened out. MY BROTHER MIKE made little impact while racing off the inside. STRICKLAND off a step slow, raced well
back for most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. STILLBILLY forwardly placed along the inside, finished after six furlongs.
RAINBOW MAN raced three wide in mid pack, tired after six furlongs. BOOTS N BOURBON fell back, sluggish throughout to be always outrun. DEVIL'S
SHADOW steadied along the inside late in the first turn, stopped after a half, was well beaten as well.
