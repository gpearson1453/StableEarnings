clear of that one toward the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and held well with steady encouragement. The latter stalked two deep

inside the sixteenth pole. GRUMPY'S BUDDY settled in the four path, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the

Footnotes
RAISE A SPEIGHTS raced in the four path the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced two deep while between horses on the far turn, dug in
for the lead late yards and lasted well. ECLIPTICALS BEAR saved ground into the first turn then steadied leaving the turn, started his bid nearing the three
eighths pole and angled to the seven path through the far turn, left the turn widest and finished well to take second under the wire. GOLDEN APPEAL raced
in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and
finished well, but was nipped from second under the wire. SPRITZER stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and took the nod three
wide leaving the far turn, drifted outward under left hand urging mid-stretch and was nipped from third under the wire. TAPIO rated close off the rail, gave
chase from the three eighths pole and took a brief slim lead while between horses at the quarter pole, but was met leaving the far turn and flattened stride
inside the sixteenth pole. REY O REYES rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole but was met at the quarter, remained a
close factor at the rail through the far turn then flattened stride leaving the sixteenth pole. NOTION TO TAPIT settled in the three and four paths early on,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced three wide on the far turn, was making a move in the upper stretch but was shut off at the sixteenth
pole and flattened stride. THAT'S MY BUSINESS raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn at the rail, eased outward through the stretch and finished evenly. SUPERSTITIEUX settled off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the
backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and lacked a clear path in the lane. The Stewards
reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Spritzer for interference mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Notion to Tapit and disqualified the former to sixth
place for closing off the path of the latter mid-stretch.
