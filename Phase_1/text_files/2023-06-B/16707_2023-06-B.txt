Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS ANGEL broke last but one, dropped back under some urging then settled well off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung
five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside under a left-handed crop, closed strongly to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole, fought with the runner-up to the
finish and prevailed under good handling. BEER RUN went to the front, set the pace under some pressure, vied inside of a rival while along the rail on the
turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, came under a drive under heavy pressure in upper stretch, battled with FLAT TOP BOX into the final furlong, lost
the lead to the winner at the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the finish but missed while clear for the place. FLAT TOP BOX pressed the pace on the outside
then in the two path on the turn, was given his cue in the three path into the stretch, battled on even terms for the front into the final furlong, swapped leads
back and forth shortly thereafter, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened but held the show. FAST BOAT TO SKYE was rated just off the pace,
went around the turn in the three path, was roused coming to the five-sixteenths, chased four wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders under a drive into
the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead while dropping back at the sixteenth-pole and also weakened. AMERICAN KNOW HOW was hustled from
the gate then angled in, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, hit the rail nearing the half-mile pole then steadied and dropped back, saved ground
on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty. INSPECTOR POIROT (IRE) was slow into stride,
dropped well behind the rest of the field, rounded the turn in the two path and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
PHOTON bobbled at the start, recovered to race three then two wide in pursuit, took closer order on the once spurting away leader three furlongs from
home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took over command swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the
finish kept to task. STARTS NOW got bumped between foes and pinched back at the break conceding two to three lengths to the front, tracked the pace
along the inside until tipped out three wide near the three-eighths floating out BERNING HONOR four wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. BOMB SQUAD broke in at the start bumping a trio and squeezing
them back in concert with THE SPLENDID ONE, who broke outwards, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
three wide into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. NORTH END LADY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, tipped out four wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. THE SPLENDID ONE broke out at the start bumping and squeezing back a
trio in concert with BOMB SQUAD who broke inwards from outside those rivals, assumed command and spurted away in hand just off the inside opening a
commanding lead through sensible splits, had the field take closer order through the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BERNING HONOR got bumped between foes solidly and was squeezed back
at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased along the inside, tipped to the two path half a mile from home, then got carried out four wide
at the three-eighths as STARTS NOW tipped out along her inside at that station, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. STONE
OF DESTINY got bumped solidly between foes and was squeezed back at the break conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride,
chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
OH DONNA broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded, came away alertly and went straight to the
front, showed the way with company to her outside, vied inside while still inside of a foe on the turn, passed the quarter-pole under urging, shook clear under
a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker and proved best under a strong hand-ride in the final sixteenth. K D KAKES broke in and bumped with a foe,
moved up to press the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader inside the three-quarter pole, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch under urging, fought outside of the winner under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished but just held the place. HANDLE THE TRUTH was
well placed just off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained in the final furlong and finished
willingly to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. SAVE GRACE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on
the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, kept on in pursuit of the top two in the final furlong and just missed the trifecta. JOEY THE FISH bumped with a rival
at the start, dropped well behind under strong urging, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RICELLE
lugged in early, moved up inside the three-quarter pole then was taken in hand, came under urging in the three then four path on the turn, dropped to the
three path into the stretch then drifted further in and capitulated. ACCEL ROSE was hustled from the gate then settled off the pace, dropped back along the
rail under urging on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
RUSE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from the presence of ROUGH DRAFT to the outside,
remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to
prevail. ROUGH DRAFT prompted the pace of RUSE from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was ultimately repelled to the finish. PHANTOM SMOKE broke out at the start and was corrected, tucked
after the start directly in front of WHAT'S UP BRO forcing that rival to check off his heels near the six and a half, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. GHOST GIANT three then two wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. YARROW chased along the inside coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the wire. WHAT'S UP BRO broke out at the start and was
corrected, then got checked off the heels of PHANTOM SMOKE as that rival took over his lane directly in front near the six and a half furlong marker,
chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and offered no response. ME 'N SAP chased along the inside
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BAR FOURTEEN coaxed from the gate,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
DONEGAL FOREVER stumbled significantly on the third stride from the gate and had the rider lose his left iron, regained the iron just before leaving the
chute, settled comfortably off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide while asked at the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in upper
stretch, shook clear under two pops of a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker and proved much the best while eased up late. SHREVEPORT stalked
the pace on the far outside, moved in late on the backstretch, was given his cue in the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive
and just earned the place while no match for the winner. RIDE UP contested the pace while well out in the track, moved in late on the backstretch, vied in
the three path on the turn, led under urging into upper stretch then lost the advantage to the winner, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened then
lost the place while clear for the show. CLOUD FOREST was hustled from the start, moved up while extending stride near the seven-eighths pole, took the
lead inside the three-quarter pole, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.
PHELPSY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, was roused two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. MARTY'S MAGIC was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of rivals, chased along the rail on the turn and
retreated.

FRONT MAN tracked the pace along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped two then three wide through the far turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied on near even terms a furlong out before taking command near the sixteenth
marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. LANDBISCUIT tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, dug in head to head getting displaced from the front near the sixteenth pole,
ran on willingly to the finish. BE HERE stumbled at the start, raced along the inside through the first turn before chasing two then three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to latch on the top pair as they hit the finish. KLICKITAT hustled
from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside briefly headed for the front when GOLDINI pulled his way to command six and a half furlongs from
home, quickly took back the front inside that station, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch under threat, yielded
command with three-sixteenths to go, then weakened in the late stages. GOLDINI three wide through the first turn under a rating hold, pulled his way
advancing on the front when in the clear into the backstretch to take brief command six and a half furlongs from home, settled back tipped four wide to be
just off the top pair before tucking three wide five furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the midway point on the far turn and bid three wide
advancing again into contention before swinging three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. AMERICAN LINCOLN just off the inside tracking
the front, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. MOUNT TRAVERS forwardly placed just off
the inside in closest aim of the leader, was briefly relegated to be just off pair when GOLDINI advanced briefly to the front before settling back in closest aim
of KLICKITAT, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, retreated with five-sixteenths to go and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired
through to the finish.

OCEAN'S RESERVE was rated just off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased under a
right-handed crop into the final furlong, gained to make a bid inside the embattled leaders into the final sixteenth and got up under good handling to prevail.
ALWAYS CHARMING moved his head just before the gate opened and was last to commence, was rated just off the pace, went three then four wide on the
turn, was roused late on that bend, made a five wide bid into the stretch, drifted in some while battling outside of MARIACHI outside the sixteenth-pole,
fought with two foes to the finish and missed while just able to get the place. MARIACHI attended the pace on the outside, vied in the four then three path on
the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, drifted in some while dueling with ALWAYS CHARMING outside the sixteenth-pole, fought between foes to the
finish and just missed the place while clear for the show. TOMMY GUN was hustled from the gate then set a joint pace, vied inside while asked on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch under the crop, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. BRACIOLE settled off the pace, was roused four wide on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to respond. DR. MARBOOZ dropped well behind under urging then angled in, went three then two
wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
RUM RUNNER READY tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch,
tipped out when able nearing the eighth pole and rallied to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth to get up in the last jumps to the wire in a blanket
finish. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY got bumped at the start by FULIGNI, who broke outwards, raced four then three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing late and just missed at the end. CANDY MONET
dueled six paths off the inside down the backstretch with FAST COREY to her inside before darting to the three then two path into the turn, knocked heads
through the bend widening away as a pair from the rest of the field and coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out swinging three wide into
upper stretch, shook away from her main pace rival nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a host of pursuers closing to the finish and was nailed
in the final strides by a pair while just preserving the show honors on the wire. QUEENS OVER THREES chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing
in late and missed at the end. QUICK POWER NAP broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied and missed at the end. MOSTLY HARMLESS chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outfinished. SUSIE'S SAVER chased three wide until tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, made headway but was outkicked. FULIGNI broke out at the
start bumping SMOKIN' HOT KITTY, chased four wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. DEVILLY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. PREDETERMINED broke a beat slow,
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. FAST COREY dueled two to three wide down the backstretch with CANDY MONET to her outside, tucked inside through
the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded the front at that station, was in the midst of being shaken off by her main pace foe a furlong out
as rivals advanced outside her when she suddenly ducked in crashing through the temporary rail nearing the sixteenth pole and lost the rider in the process,
was apprehended by outrider and walked off under her own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on FAST COREY before the
result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.
