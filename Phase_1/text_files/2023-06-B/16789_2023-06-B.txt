Footnotes
GOLDEN BANDIT hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid
from the two path coming around the far turn and kicked clear in the lane. ONE IN VERMILLION powered to an early lead while saving ground around the
first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far bend and kept on in the stretch. WORTHINGTON saved ground early, settled in
the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and finished evenly. COFFEE CALIENTE
raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile, continued around the second turn in the four path and was outkicked in the stretch.
HAPPY DANCER raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the
far bend and made no bid.

Footnotes
SIR STERLING dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off
to the wire. THUNDERS ROCKNROLL tracked the pace setters on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late. ARTISTIC VISION raced at the back of the pack early, began to move up while racing in
the two path around the bend and kept on in the lane. SAM SEZ dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path coming
around the turn and weakened in the stretch. TAP THAT DIAL trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and passed tiring horses in
the lane. FRANZ raced off the pace on the outside through the early going, navigated the turn from the four path and showed no kick.
CHECKCASHINGCONNIE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch.
MAMASHAVNAHOTFLASH chased the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and
tired further from there.
