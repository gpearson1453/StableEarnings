Footnotes
HIGHWAY SIXTY ONE outrun in the early going toward the inside, moved closer after a half in the two path, came three wide for the drive when continuing
a steady advance, collared the leader inside the furlong grounds and drew clear late under continued pressured handling. PAYTON'S INDIAN settled off the
early pace, advanced far turn, took over into the lane, briefly clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. SWEETASBAILY
assumed command after the start, clear before a quarter, extended that advantage up the backstretch while avoiding several geese, continued to hold a
daylight advantage through the second turn, began to weaken when headed by the runner up into the straight. EASY ACES broke back, a bit keen off the
inside into the first turn, improved position the third quarter with some mild interest, flattened out the final quarter. SEEMYVALENTINE chased the leader for
five furlongs and weakened gradually. UNION GRAD broke back after being bothered slightly at the break, void of any early foot, picked off a couple of
faltering rivals after the issue had been decided. DIVERGENCE in mid pack early off the inside, had nothing for the drive. BON CHANCE BET forwardly
placed early, stopped, well back. SILVER MAID refused at the start.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PALACE in the second flight up the backstretch while three wide and between horses, advanced into contention while remaining in the three path
through the turn, challenged when straightened for home, drew clear under steady handling. LIKEN IT very reluctant to load, retacked, broke with main
group and outward, four wide advance turn, bid, no match late, held the place. WIN YA WIN came in just after the start, raced inside the top two up the
backstretch closest to the inside, picked off a tiring rival in the two path turning into the stretch, split foes with less than a furlong remaining when rallying,
getting to the runner up late. CHAPEL BARN forwardly placed, advanced to lodge a bid late in the turn, briefly dueled into the stretch and began to weaken
soon after. SCHNELL floated out by the winner at the break, fell back to trail, 5w into lane, improved position down the middle of the strip while finding best
stride too late. B W P SPECIAL remained back in mid pack in lacking a closing response. IN THE ARCH floated out then clipped heels just after the start,
remained back in failing to rally. FAREWELL TIME pressed the issue early off the inside, lodged a brief bid and dueled late in the turn, gave way through the
stretch. THE FIVE B'S broke out carrying IN THE ARCH out, was straightened to flash brief speed along the inside, stopped late in the turn. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
YAMIL broke outwardly and slowly, raced back early as a result, began to advance into the turn, lodged a late surge up the inside to be in time. JOSIE'S
PRIORITY away in good order, showed the way early along the inside, dueled into the lane then shook that foe off to be a clear a furlong out, could not
contain the winner while outside that one at the wire. GROSSE TETE IAN broke sharp, behind the first flight off the inside, was four wide turning for home,
set down, closing the gap on the runner up late. CHARLIE'S PARADE pressed the issue early from the outside,advanced and dueled with the runner up into
the lane, could not keep up the final furlong, continued to weaken to lose a couple of more positions late. INGLIS forwardly placed for three furlongs,faltered
in the drive. VALENTIN C broke back and was never a threat. A BRAVE RIDE also failed to become involved.

Footnotes
GEAUX SUGAR broke on top, cleared soon after, maintained a comfortable advantage through the turn, drew out steadily through the lane while being kept
to task. BARAHIN back off the pace and the inside, three to four wide through the turn, roused for the drive, rallied well out in the strip to be in time for the
place, not a threat to the winner. ADIEU ACES broke out, was straightened to race in the second flight outside, chased the winner three wide into the
stretch, also proved no match for that one, caught late for the place. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick, outfinished for
the show. SMART ANALYSIS failed to menace while racing off the inside. FLASHY BOY chased the winner for three furlongs toward the inside and gave
way. NOCOMET void of early foot, five wide exiting the turn, failed to produce a rally. BYATHREAD tired while saving ground to no avail.

Footnotes
LET'S GO RANDOM lacked speed while between foes for a half, angled out to be four wide turning into the stretch, set down, rallied while remaining well
out in the strip to be up in time. SILVER CHALICE forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch while outside, challenged turn, between rivals into the lane,
shrugged off his closest rival inside the furlong marker, continued to lead late, caught in the final strides. OUT MAKING TREBLE lacked speed out in the
strip, shuffled back late backstretch, moved out and raced four wide through the turn, came five wide for the drive, staged a mild rally to annex the show.
CALLEN FEELS GOOD in the second flight off the inside, three wide when under pressure into the lane, angled to the inside, finished up flatly along the rail.
BIG BROTHER void of early speed, lodged a good move three wide through the turn to reach contention, lodged a bid outside the runner up into the lane
then faltered the final furlong. CATINANDSCATIN pressed the leader early while between horses, fell back through the turn, four wide into the stretch, went
evenly to the wire. COASTAL CHAOS forwardly placed out of the chute and up the backstretch, in some traffic early in the turn, lost position then had little
for the drive. CLEVER PRINCE was never a serious threat. MR. SNOWFLAKE broke alertly, set the pace for a half then stopped when headed in the turn.
SASSI ASPEN off a step slow then trailed well back throughout.

Footnotes
SPECTROLITE took command from along the inside soon after the start, clear into the turn, maintained a daylight advantage through the turn and into the
stretch, remained clear until late, enough left to hold off the runner up outside at the one at the end, vanned off. HALF FULL back off the pace inside,
continued to save ground into the lane, cut the corner, late rally up the inside, rapidly getting to the winner late, missed. HAIL STATE void of speed for three
furlongs, came three wide out of the turn, rallied out in the course belatedly to be in time for the show. INDIA INK closest to the winner for three furlongs,
weakened gradually, caught late for the show. ELUSIVE WAR forwardly placed up the backstretch in the three path, had little left for the stretch run. MY
MAN LOUIE last to leave, never menaced. RELIC HUNTER in the second group outside, four wide into the turn, was giving way when three wide exiting,
continued to weaken stretch.

Footnotes
CUSTOM GUITAR within striking distance off the inside early, three to four wide out of the turn when idling, outside bid past the furlong marker, roused,
drove clear. SUMMER IS HOT lacked early foot in the two path, inside of traffic late in the turn, moved out a bit for room, challenged between horses past
the furlong marker, could not match the winner late, edging away for the place. SUNSHINE STAR forwardly placed outside, four wide into the turn,
challenged three wide entering the stretch, could not keep up with the top two late, remained clear of the others. MAGGIE'S RETURN chased the leader for
three furlongs off the inside, weakened through the stretch. A P HUMOR broke back, lacked speed outside, was five wide out of the turn, picked off a rival or
two to improve position slightly, no real threat down the middle of the strip. ENOUGH HEART broke in good order, cleared to the inside when clear,
continued to show the way through the turn and into upper stretch, caved in the final furlong along the inside. TRUE RED SLEW remained back in failing to
menace. CATALINA QUEEN off slow, sluggish in trailing throughout.

Footnotes
VETERANS DAY never far back up the backstretch while three wide, moved to challenge between horses in the turn, vied past the furlong marker, found
more late in digging to narrowly prevail. COMANCHE WARRIOR in the second flight outside the winner, moved with that one while four wide challenge
through the turn, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, outgamed in the late going while prevailing for the place. MO CREDO lacked early foot
outside, four wide through the turn when beginning to advance, continued to rally well out in the strip, coming late to close the gap on the top two. ZINGING
BAYOU broke on top, dueled up front while closest to the inside, continued to be one of four vying through upper stretch, weakened gradually the final
furlong, caught late for the show. MANLY DEEDS also away well, alternated up front in the two path, vied between horses and inside the winner into and
through upper stretch and also faltered in the late going. THE BOSS SOSS back off the pace, raced in the two path through the turn, displayed a mild
amount of late interest without posing a serious threat. CASH HOLIDAY devoid of early foot after breaking back, passed a few tiring rivals while also not a
serious factor. CATCHIN DRAMA last away, moved up to race in mid pack, faded through the stretch. Z'S GUITAR in the main body early, was finished
before a half. SKIPPA forwardly placed early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
ADMIRAL AFLEET lacked early speed out in the strip, made a nice move four wide into contention through the turn, took over nearing the furlong marker,
edged clear then held the runner up safe late. ONE MORE SLEEP in the second flight off the inside, three wide into the lane, shifted out in mid stretch,
finished up willingly. CHIPEEE in mid pack off the inside, three wide move turn, bid bid between, weakened late. BOSS MAN ZONG in the main group off
the inside, four wide into the lane, improved a bit without posing a serious threat. HALF CRAZY forwardly placed, bid turn, led upper, faltered final furlong.
MIDGE'S TIME broke back, lacked speed, five wide out of the turn when improving, began to flatten out in midstretch. GOLDEN CONFUSION broke out,
was straightened to race in the second flight, fell back a bit through the turn and came up empty for the drive. MINE YOUR BIZ vied up front while between
