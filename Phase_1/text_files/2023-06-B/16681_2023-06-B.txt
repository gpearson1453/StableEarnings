Footnotes
LION KINGDOM was allowed to settle trailing the pack in the early stages of the race, continued to see the field in upper stretch, quickly burst between
rivals two deep at the eighth pole and was full of run late getting up in time just a few jumps before the wire. ROCKET JOE COPPER rated kindly while well
in hand on the fence at the half behind the leaders, waited on the rail throughout the final turn waiting for a seam, took command in the four path at the
sixteenth pole and was caught nearing the wire by the fast closing winner in the end. MAYITO stalked near the back two wide at the half, was asked for
more run with three furlongs to go, angled out widest in the seven path entering the stretch and was gaining to the wire getting up in time to win the nod for
third in a three horse photo. BLUE MAX had a good spot just outside tracking the top duo down the backstretch, battled between for the front in the two path
at the top of the lane and fought on willingly to the wire holding for a minor share. MASTER SPY threw his head as the gate opened , travelled four wide into
the first turn, settled in mid pack four deep down the backside, bid four wide with three eighths remaining, poked his head in front brief turning for home and
gave way between foes in deep stretch. STOP THE HUMBUG settled on the rail near the back at the half mile pole, was on hold inside behind horses
through the far turn, was pushed out to the six path for the stretch drive and was not involved late while finishing up evenly with an eighth left to run. HIATUS
was reined back on the rail through the first turn to track the early frontrunner down the back straight, could not keep position with others midpoint on the far
turn and was not a factor running in the stretch. BIG INVESTMENT took the field into the first turn clearing to the rail by the time the field entered the
backstretch, set the fractions into the final turn, was collared by multiple rivals at the quarter pole outside and stopped on the fence at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
EL COHETE pressed just off the leader, advanced mildly three wide on the turn, took over the lead in upper stretch, moved clear by mid-stretch and held
sway while being kept to the task. FIGHTING IRISH settled in to track in behind the leaders inside foes in the second flight on or just off the rail, came out in
upper stretch for room, had aim on the leader in mid-stretch, made no significant headway but was second best. CRUMLIN LAD settled off the pace outside
a rival two to three deep on the turn, angled out seven wide in upper stretch, finished strongly outside a rival to get up for show honors. JACK exchanged a
light bump at the start, lacked early speed but soon moved up while racing near the rail to regain contact with the body of the field, saved ground all through
the turn, gradually moved out through mid-stretch and rallied five wide but missed third. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW broke inwardly and a half-step slowly, was
encouraged forward inside to the lead, set the pace with mild pressure from outside rivals just off the rail, was challenged by the eventual winner turning into
upper stretch, overtaken and lacked the needed late kick. WHERE IS ESSA exchanged a brush at the start, steadied slightly in the early going as a rival
veered out, raced in behind and between three wide on the turn, angled six wide near the three-sixteenths, flattened out. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA
exchanged light contact at the start, was guided out wide early in pursuit of the leader, stalked four wide through the turn, faltered and faded. SUNYANI
exchanged a brush at the start, pursued four wide through the turn, failed to rally. FOREST STAR lacked early speed, raced off the inside, was not a factor.

Footnotes
MASSETO (GB) had a very good inside position watching the top three contest for the front in this compact field with three furlongs from home, was nestled
behind the front threesome waiting in hand throughout the turn, shifted out two wide for the stretch drive, quickly took control at the eighth pole and was
going away when crossing the finish line. SPITE STORE settled just off the fence near the rear outside of runners at the half, shifted further outside in the
four path to be widest for clear run at the top of the lane and closed well besting the rest of the field in the end. BUSHIDO assumed control with a half left to
run, was hounded into the turn outside by a couple of runners, put away the early speed challengers in upper stretch, could not find another gear to match
strides with the winner at the furlong pole and faded inside the last sixteenth narrowly holding onto show at the wire. SILENT POET broke sharp to begin,
was content on sitting outside just off the leader down the backstretch, midpoint on the turn was asked to keep up with the others speed rivals on either side,
experienced tight quarters entering the stretch, was checked mildly with three sixteenths to go and needed more between foes in the late stages to threaten
in deep stretch. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) was away slowly, brushed inside at the start, offered an early move three wide to engage with the leaders three
furlongs from home, was still in the mix at the top of the lane and tired between foes in the four path at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
MISS MOLLY LALOU settled in the back half of the field, gradually shifted out through the turn fanning eight wide into upper stretch and outside of all, struck
the lead a furlong out and kicked clear under steady handling. GRANDE BELLA broke just a bit awkwardly, was allowed to settle into stride stalking from
outside while up close mid-pack, went five wide on the turn floating seven deep into upper stretch, was outkicked by the winner but kept on to get up for
second. FEDALINE settled off the leader inside foes, saved ground in behind on the turn riding the rail, got through late but missed second while narrowly
gaining show. ROOKIE COURT sped clear from the get-go opening up a nearly three-length lead, came back to rivals nearing the half, faced pressure into
and on the turn racing in the two path, kept on in the lane and lost show late. FAVORITE CHANNEL broke a step slowly, advanced along the rail the latter
part of the turn, faced traffic in behind runners a furlong out, weaved a bit to find room and ran on with late interest. PERFECTLY LEGAL chased between
runners going three wide on the turn, moved out a bit in the stretch, needed more. GYPSY MAGIC chased from in behind going between runners three to
four wide out of the turn and shifting to be five or six wide in upper stretch, made no late bid. SOME LIKE IT HOT broke a step slowly, was encouraged
along in the early going, raced just off the inside, came out eight wide in upper stretch and ran on. PANIC SWITCH broke a bit awkwardly, was outpaced
and made no bid. LEGAL STEPS steadied ever-so-slightly after the start but recovered quickly to gain forward position, went four wide on the turn and in
range of the leaders, began dropping back in upper stretch, was in a bit tight at the furlong marker and faded.

Footnotes
CLASSY WHISPER had a good spot behind the pacesetter at the half, was under a snug hold waiting inside on the final turn, slipped up the fence turning
for home, shifted just outside two deep at the furlong marker, burst between horses at the sixteenth pole and was edging away nearing the wire. UNDER
SURVEILLANCE sat just outside tracking the top pair down the back straight, was in range of the front runners with two furlongs left to go, battled between
foes turning for home and determinedly fought on to capture the place award. QUIET SUNDAY broke slowly at the start, was unhurried for the most part of
the race trailing until the stretch run, angled widest in the nine path to start his rally in upper stretch and closed belatedly outside to be a non threatening
third in the end. BLAST IN THE SNOW tracked the early frontrunner down the backside, confronted the leader with three eighths to the wire, assumed
command with three sixteenths from home, was headed outside in mid stretch and gave way to the line. MIDWAY MISCHIEF was fanned six wide entering
the first turn, was asked to keep up with others midpoint on the far turn, had a chance for a share of the prize six deep in upper stretch but was one paced
late to the finish. MIDNIGHT ARKLE was squeezed at the break, stalked near the back at the half inside, waited in the third flight on the rail when the field
bunched up through the far turn, finally found a seam at the furlong marker and when clear finished up willingly to the wire. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY stalked
near the rear three wide at the half mile marker, offered an early move five wide around runners with three furlongs left to run, loomed a threat six wide at
the top of the lane and stalled in the final furlong. BE LIKE CLINT settled close to the back in the beginning, put in a brief turn of foot with runners on either
side through the far turn and showed little driving to the wire. ZAKHARI travelled in the middle of the pack three wide down the backside, was shuffled
between runners at the three furlong marker losing a few positions on the far turn, lost his lane in the eight path between horses at the furlong marker and
could not make any impression running to the finish in the late stages of the race. SHAMATEUR settled in the middle of the pack inside in the beginning,
advanced through the backside to take closer order to the leaders into the far turn, was in tight between runners at the quarter pole, had no path in upper
stretch and could not factor running to the finish. WAVE BABY travelled four wide in midfield in the early stages of the race, was ridden for more at the three
furlong marker to be in the mix for a small share at the top of the lane and retreated between foes in the final eighth. SMART SKY took the field into the first
turn, continued to dictate the pace down the back straight, was collared outside with three eighths remaining and backed away through the field in mid
stretch.

Footnotes
BODACIOUS MISS got away well, was allowed to settle into stride dropping back off the leader, stalked three to four wide on the turn, came into upper
stretch five deep, bid near the furlong grounds, took the lead, drifted in a bit but kicked clear. SPARKLE SAMMY bobbled and was bumped at the start,
recovered well enough to stalk the leader two to three wide, shifted in a bit leaving the turn, bid inside near the eighth pole, was only second best. JILLI
MARIE settled off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was guided out about five to six deep by mid-stretch seeking room, finished with good late
stride. SILENT GUROO was quickly clear, set the pace, raced off the rail into upper stretch, was challenged at that juncture, weakened. HIT AND RUN
raced mostly two to three wide and went evenly. ANITA GRIGIO tracked from inside, switched out about midway on the turn to pursue the leader three wide,
put to a drive leaving that bend, lacked the needed late kick. OHEAVENS bobbled just slightly at the start, raced outside off the leaders four to five wide
through the turn, needed more. STARLIGHT RIDGE broke outwardly, bore out badly heading up the backstretch and to the far turn, came back in and
reacquired contact with the field racing at the back outside three wide on the turn, swung six wide for the drive, needed more. MONASTERY LANE bumped
a rival at the start, was outpaced racing off the inside and never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
A GAL FOR T J took command from the onset, set the fractions at the half, was let out a notch when mildly challenged on the far turn, opened up on her
rivals at the top of the stretch and comfortably came home for the victory in the end. HALLANVAARA stalked near the rear in the beginning stages of the
race, rallied splitting foes in the five path entering the stretch and found more in the last eighth to close well to capture the place share late. ALBERTA BE
MINE was keen early running under the wire for the first time, settled in midfield inside down the backstretch, followed the winner saving ground throughout
the final turn and was outfinished in the final sixteenth for second money. ZIPPITY DAY travelled in midfield four deep at the half mile marker, was ridden
three wide midway on the far turn to no avail, was shuffled back some six wide at the top of the lane and grinded to the wire under left handed urging to
finish late with energy to get a minor role in the end. REINS OF PURPLE stalked on the rail near the back of the pack, started to gain on rivals on the fence
running through the far turn, angled outside in upper stretch, shifted back towards the rail in the final furlong but could not make any headway in deep
stretch. GOLD FORESTER was in hand on the rail watching the loose leader in the early stages, put in a mild bid three furlongs from home, chased the
winner straightening out for the drive and gave way in deep stretch losing positions late. JOLENE JOLENE tracked the leader three wide down the backside,
was asked to go after the pacesetter on the far turn three eighths from home, made no gain and tired between foes at the furlong marker. TENPENNY NAIL
reared at the break to trail the field considerably down the backstretch and could not overcome the poor start to be involved in the stretch run. STEWARDS

Footnotes
DELPHIA settled off the pace racing two to three wide, exchanged minor contact with an outside foe about midway up the backstretch, advanced four wide
on the far turn in tandem with that outside foe, kicked away from that one, took the lead outside the furlong grounds, quickly moved clear and was kept busy
to the wire. THE ARCHANGEL tucked in two wide racing off the pace, was up close in behind foes midway on the far turn, tipped out three wide near the
quarter pole, rallied inside a foe in late stretch to get up for place. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB settled at the back inside, switched out heading up the
backstretch, advanced outside making minor contact with a foe, was within striking distance five wide on the far turn but could not kick on with the winner
and was outfinished for second. CYMBAL COURT pressed while being kept wide racing three to four deep, took over about the seven-sixteenths, was clear
turning for home but soon overtaken in upper stretch, weakened late. STRATEGERIZED tucked in behind the leading pair three wide heading into the first
turn, was well-positioned stalking in behind three then two wide on the far turn, failed to rally. ELLA FRANCES saved ground inside through the first turn,
switched out heading to the far turn, asked for more at the five-sixteenths while fanning five wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten.
JULIE'S MIST got away alertly, set the pace inside, faced pressure up the backstretch, was overtaken into the far turn, gave way.

Footnotes
LA PRINCESSA POLLY travelled midpack in the third flight outside at the half mile marker, smartly moved on the leaders between foes two furlongs from
home, dueled in the three path at the top of the stretch for the win and stubbornly prevailed through the stretch. FOREST VIXEN travelled all alone near the
back early on, began to pick up runners nicely down the backside, loomed boldly outside at the top of the stretch and was outkicked by the winner through
the lane. ASHLEE'S RING tracked in the second flight two deep at the half, closed in on the early leaders running on the far turn, was in the hunt three wide
when shifting in to the rail at the eighth pole and closed to finish third. FRAULEIN VICTORIA broke out to begin, lead the field inside through the first turn,
put away her fellow pace rival with three furlongs to go, had a dwindling lead at the top of the lane and faded late still holding for a small share. T'PRING
was situated on the rail in the middle of the pack down the backside, made little impression running through the far turn and showed some late interest
running to the wire. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH broke inwards brushing the gate at the start, settled near the rear inside running down the back straight,
offered a mild run inside on the far turn and angled out seven wide for the drive making little impact. HARD ROCK WARRIOR trailed the field into the first
turn, continued at the back with a half remaining, saved ground seeing rivals through the second turn and passed tiring runners in the stretch. CANDY WINE
was squeezed on the break, recovered to track the top duo inside down the backstretch, had to tap on the brakes behind a weary runner with three furlongs
to go, shifted off the fading rival at the quarter pole and levelled out in the stretch. BABA'S GIRL prompted the pace two deep in the early stages of the race,
gave way on the rail midpoint on the far turn and stopped on the fence in upper stretch. LONHRO'S GIZMO was bumped at the start, settled near the rear
down the back straight, could not get involved running on the final turn and was no a factor to the finish.
