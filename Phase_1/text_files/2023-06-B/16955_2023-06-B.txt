Footnotes
ONE MORE KELLY was well rated on the inside, moved out nearing the five sixteenths to make a three wide bid, hit the front nearing the furlong marker
and drew out smartly in the final furlong to prove best, driving. SWAN POINT was allowed to settle on the inside, shifted off the inside leaving the five
sixteenths, came three wide into the lane and rallied well to gain the place award. PERFECT HIDEAWAY vied for the early lead on the inside, rated off the
pace entering the backstretch, made a two wide bid by the five sixteenths, dueled with the winner to the furlong marker, then could not go with that rival and
weakened the final sixteenth, lost place award, bested rest. DOCTOR ABBIE broke in the air at the start, then moved up three wide, two wide on the turn
and tired. NO EASY ANSWER was three wide into the first turn, vied early and then went on to set the pace on the inside on the backstretch, gave way on
the turn. BILLIEANNE tracked the pace three wide, then was roused four wide by the five sixteenths and tired.

TUDOX OPPORTUNITY was well placed along the inside, tipped out two wide leaving the turn, made a bid when straightened and drew clear in the furlong
grounds under a mild drive. BEAR OR BULL was fractious in the gate, stalked the pace and made a three wide bid to take over leaving the quarter pole,
crossed over to the inside leaving the turn, then was headed leaving the furlong marker and could not go with the winner, second best.
ONEOFTHEGOODGUYS was off a step slow, chased the early pace, eased out and came four wide into the lane, raced greenly in the lane while besting
the rest. ROCKIN THE BANK was away alertly to be soon clear, set the pace while in the two path, then was headed inside and outside to be between rivals
by the quarter pole, bumped leaving the turn and weakened. BANJO chased the pace three wide and weakened.
