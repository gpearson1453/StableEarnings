TIME 'ER TOO prompted the issue while racing three-wide, moved up to join the leaders nearing the three-eighths pole, dueled with OWHATRUSH from
that point and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. OWHATARUSH dueled for the early lead with AMARA MIKE from along the inside, responded when
asked and just missed in a determined effort. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW was forwardly placed from the outset, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in
a mild rally. THE GOLDEN EGG was allowed to settle in stride early, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. AMARA MIKE
broke out to bump with SEVENTH HOUSE, then dueled for the lead from between horses to the stretch and tired. SEVENTH HOUSE dropped back after
being bumped by AMARA MIKE at the start and was not a factor.
