Footnotes
KO OLINA sped clear to take control, showed the way two then three wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted inward nearing the eighth pole and
remained clear to the wire. BIG NOVEL was off slow from inside, stalked the pacesetter along the inside, roused two wide into the lane, altered out from
behind the leader approaching the eighth pole, could not summon the needed late kick but proved second best. EVERLYS GIRL stalked three deep into the
turn, went four then five wide around the bend and finished evenly. FEELING GRAZEFUL got bumped leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit three wide
into the turn, spun four wide into the drive and flattened in the final furlong. FRIED ASPARAGUS broke in and bumped rival then tossed head, raced in
range widest into the turn, angled down to the three path around the bend before steering back out into the lane and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
VICENTE'S SHADOW trailed three wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, unleashed a rally through the lane and inhaled BIG
CHEDDAR late. BIG CHEDDAR sprinted clear early, led two to three wide into the stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and was run down by the
winner late. SPEEDING STYLE got shuffled back at the start, chased out of range four to five wide on the turn, rallied in the final furlong but lacked the
needed late punch to get by the top pair. QUICK INTRO coaxed along chasing outside rivals early, lost ground three then four wide on the turn, angled into
the two path leaving the bend and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. SCRATCHY APACHE was hard to load prior to the start, broke a step
slow, sat off the pace on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to menace. BIG CREEK chased two wide into the turn, remained off the rail into
the lane, split foes in a tight spot at the sixteenth pole and could not threaten. DEBT MONGER forwardly placed outside a rival, went four wide around the
bend and flattened in the drive. TIME TO ZOOM brushed the gate, raced up close early, drifted out a bit at the seven-sixteenths pole, entered the lane three
wide and weakened.

Footnotes
FACTS MATTER raced up close outside the top pair, exited the bend five wide, took over at the three-sixteenths pole, cleared inner rival with a furlong
remaining and held over the late charge from the runner-up. J T'S WATCH got bumped and lost his path at the start, chased outside a rival off the pace,
went two wide into the lane, tipped out midstretch and was gaining outside the winner to the wire. WHISKY MY GOD (ARG) bumped outer rival at the start,
took control from inside then got pressure by PEDRO PEREZ up the backstretch, cleared that rival past the five-sixteenths pole and showed the way two
wide into the drive, was overtaken by the winner at the three-sixteenths pole and kept on to hold the show. PEDRO PEREZ pressed the pace from outside,
lost touch with the leader past the five-sixteenths pole, entered the lane four wide and churned on for a minor award. DR. TROUTMAN broke a step slow
then was coaxed into range outside the top trio, drifted out and came seven wide into the lane and kept to his task but needed to find more late. AROUND
THE DIAL got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, chased from off the pace on the inside then two wide into the lane and was not a factor. PERFECTO
AMOR stumbled badly at the start, raced three deep at the back into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and was not a factor. PER RULING FROM HIWU,
FACTS MATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
