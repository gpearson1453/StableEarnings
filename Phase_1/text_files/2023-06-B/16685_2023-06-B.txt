EXAMINER brushed leaving, rated off the pace while inside, shifted outside at the head of the lane, gained the lead entering the stretch and won going
away. ONEFINEDAY showed the way through the backstretch, saw margins diminish nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner through the
stretch and finished. JUMEIRAH COAST brushed leaving, chased outside through the backstretch, rallied four wide in the stretch, and improved position
late. FLASH OF GLORY trailed early and rallied belatedly. REDNECK REMARK rated well off the pace outside, chased from the rail through the stretch,
and faded in the final furlong. LET THE BOY SING tracked the pacesetter, and came up empty for the drive.

BOOTIFUL ROSE contested the early pace inside of PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE, drew off willingly through the far turn, and was kept to task. MIDNIGHT
GARDEN was five wide in the second flight, hustled outside in the final turn, and closed well to secure a place finish. HENRY'S GAMBLE chased inside,
flattened through the stretch, and was edged out for place. SUDDENLY MISTY trailed early, lodged a bid at the quarter pole, and faded gradually.
ADDYDIDIT settled outside, and lacked a closing response. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE vied outside in the three path, was unable to move on with
BOOTIFUL ROSE leaving the backstretch and faltered into the stretch.

Footnotes
MI REYNA stalked outside through the backstretch, advanced quickly in the final turn, and edged clear deep stretch. MISSCZECH prompted the pace from
the rail, inherited the lead at the three-eighths pole, dug in gamely in the stretch, and gave way grudgingly. STEVIE WONDER GIRL saved ground inside,
and lacked the kick needed. JOY IN GRACE raced at the back of the pack in the four path and offered a late mild bid. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER raced four
to five wide leaving the chute, set a pressured pace then was overtaken leaving the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
THIS TIME SWEETIE saved ground while setting the pace, drew away willingly nearing the quarter pole, and held safely under light handling. GIMME THAT
GIRL was quickest leaving the chute, raced wide through the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader under urging, closed steadily late but was no match
for the winner. VALENTINO ROSSA trailed wide through the backstretch, circled into the lane, and was along with time for show honours. ALBERTA stalked
wide, bid four wide at the head of the lane, and was caught late. DYLAN'S SAVE settled mid-pack, rallied three-wide at the quarter pole, and went evenly in
the stretch. BEAUTIFUL CALL lagged early, and passed tiring rivals. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL stalked inside, and yielded. SHES MY DESTINY stalked four
wide, and tired early.

Footnotes
SOLO RING attended the pace while four to five wide, dueled outside of BON PRIX in the final turn, and edged clear late stretch. SLEW'S BAK chased wide
early, took closer order in the far turn, experience traffic nearing the quarter pole then waited, angled out sharply to the five path, and closed huge getting up
just in time for second. SHORTY THE SWEDE squeezed out away from the gate, saved ground at the back of the field, uncoiled an all-out rail bid, and was
outkicked for place. BON PRIX contested the pace from between rivals, dueled inside of SOLO RING, lacked the rally needed in the drive and was rundown
late. WALKTHELINE bumped repeatedly leaving, chased four wide into the lane, and finished evenly. SMART PLAY bumped leaving, pressed the early
pace from just off the rail, was unable to move on with rivals and faded gradually. THESHACK jostled away, and chased to no avail. BOSS MAN CAN raced
in close quarters early, and failed to threaten. NORTHERN DREAMIN chased outside and gave way. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducte an
inquiry into the start of the race but made no change after review.

Footnotes
ICE BOX INDY saved ground while setting the pace, kept rivals at bay in the final turn, was given his cue and drew away. NEXT JOURNEY settled outside,
raced widest entering the lane, closed steadily outside and got up in time to score place. AGENT C tracked inside, rallied inside of BEAUGATTI improving
his position through the drive and was bested in the final strides. BEAUGATTI chased five-wide through the backstretch, moved up menacingly near the
quarter pole, rallied determinedly outside of AGENT C and weakened late stretch. CHESTER SLEW lacked running room in the lane, and bid belatedly.
CARAVAN PRINCE showed some early speed and failed to rally. KEEP YOUR COOL raced four to five wide leaving the backstretch, and passed tiring foes
late. RUN ROSSCO RUN pressed the early pace from the rail, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, started to fade then steadied after losing
his path and wilted. SOMETHIN HAPPENIN sat just off the pace under a snug hold early, lost ground in the final turn, and yielded. OIL COUNTRY BOY was
not a factor.
