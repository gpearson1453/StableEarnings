Footnotes
FLY NIGHTLY raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside racing up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the
far bend and into the lane and edged clear late. DRIVEN ONE led the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, dueled from the rail around
the far bend and continued to battle back gamely in the stretch, giving way late. DYNABLUE saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and gained ground in the final furlong. IOYA AGAIN saved ground around
the first turn, raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the three path and improved position mildly in the stretch.
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn
from the three path and finished evenly while never threatening. MITZRAYIM raced in the middle of the pack on the inside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path and weakened in the lane. KRAMDEN trailed the field from the two path throughout and was
never a factor.

LOTTA ROSES was bumped by EVIE JEAN and carried out to the five path when that rival ran out headed into the first turn, settled to stalk the leaders on
the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far turn, dueled in the lane and kicked clear. SANGFROID chased the
leader on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and could
not go with the winner late but kept on to the wire. ARRINGTON saved ground early, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far
turn in the two path and improved position in the lane. TEXAS PRINCESS raced off the pace on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch,
navigated the second turn from the three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. EVIE JEAN blew the first turn, bumping with LOTTA ROSES and
carrying several rivals wide in the process, straightened out to duel on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the four path around the far
turn and faded in the lane. STRONGENOUGHSTORM was carried out to the seven path when EVIE JEAN ran out headed into the first turn, raced outside
at the back of the pack from there, came around the far turn in the three path and made no bid. VELVET SEASON saved ground around the first turn,
dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and tired in the stretch. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE
HALF MILE SPLIT FOR THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

BLACK FOREST bumped mildly with the horse to his inside at the start, led the field up the backstretch, opened up while saving ground around the turn and
continued to draw off in the lane. WILMA MANKILLER chased the leader on the inside early, raced into traffic and steadied nearing the half mile pole, came
around the bend in the three path and kept on in the lane but was no match for the winner. SWEET NELLIE veered out and bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader between horses early, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the lane. SALLY'S
SUPRISE trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn made up some ground in the stretch while never threatening
the winner. FROSHADO tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE TRAFFIC HEADED INTO THE TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF
FINISH. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE FIVE FURLONG SPLIT FOR THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

CHROME ATTACK chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
kicked clear in the lane. PEACH COBBLER dueled on the inside early, led the field while saving ground around the bend and could not go with the winner in
the stretch but chased that rival home. BLAME NELLIE raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three and four path, swung wide
entering the stretch and improved position from there. GOOD MONGOLIA raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, continued
around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. MY LADY SLEW pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the
turn and faded in the stretch. BIPARTISAN BROOKE hopped up leaving the gate and was away slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground
around the bend and made no bid. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE FIVE FURLONG SPLIT FOR THIS RACE IS HAND TIMED.
