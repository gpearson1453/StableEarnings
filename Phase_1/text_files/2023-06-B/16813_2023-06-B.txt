Footnotes
STORMY SOUL hopped and bore out soon after the break, was situated four deep in mid pack at the half, rallied five wide at the top of the lane, began to
lengthen stride with an eighth left to run, was pushed out at the sixteenth marker and determinedly got up nearing the line. HARD TO CAPTURE sat
comfortably tracking the pacesetter in the early stages, bid four wide at the three sixteenth pole, had a narrow lead between runners at the furlong marker,
drifted out under a drive nearing the sixteenth pole clinging to the lead, straightened out in deep stretch but was caught by the winner in the very late stages
of the race. SILENCE BREAKERS was the frontrunner down the back straight, continued setting the fractions on the turn, was headed outside running in
the three path turning for home, stubbornly battled inside at the eighth pole and was game to the finish losing a tight photo for second at the wire.
MAMBOINTHEFOREST had little early speed from the start to trail the field down the backside, took closer order to runners with three furlongs from the
finish, started to gain on horses inside through the turn and passed a tired in upper stretch. TRICKY MAGICIAN settled near the rear on the rail in this
compact field down the backstretch, offered a mild turn of foot inside at the three eighths marker, was scrubbed on the keep pace with rivals with a quarter
remaining and emptied out for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LOIS had a narrow lead setting the fractions on the turn, was asked in mid stretch putting away the fellow pace rival and drew off nicely winning comfortably.
FOREVER DANISH travelled in mid field all alone rating kindly at the half mile marker, put in a good move slipping up the rail at the five sixteenths marker,
had clear run inside turning for home and made a good late finish to be second best. SMOKEN CHLOE prompted the pace two wide outside down the
backside and turn, gave up the chase with an eighth remaining while drifting in and held for show in the end. CASTLETON engaged on the rail down the
backstretch, could not match strides with the leaders running on the turn, was roused at the two furlong pole and was one paced in the five path through the
stretch. FAVORITE CHANNEL stalked near the back two deep at the half, offered a mild run four wide at the quarter marker, shifted out widest in the seven
path for the drive and showed some late interest besting others to the finish. MAKAYLA had a good position inside tracking the top three in the beginning,
was coaxed between runners two furlongs from the line and made little impact running in the four path to the finish line. BELLASPINA broke in at the start,
trailed down the back straight, offered a brief rally inside midway on the turn from home, was in range for a minor share at the three sixteenth pole and
levelled off on the fence the final sixteenth. BIG BANG BLUE settled near the rear three wide at the half mile marker, could not keep pace with others
running on the turn, could see the field in upper stretch and was not a factor inside to the wire. WO DE AI REN was bumped by outside rival at the start,
tracked outside behind the top trio down the backside, was asked for more at the quarter pole, angled six wide for the drive and tired through the stretch.

Footnotes
LOADED VIXEN hopped slightly at the break, kept a close eye on the pacesetter outside down the back straight, made no gain on the loose frontrunner on
the turn, chased the pace in upper stretch outside and finally begun to wear the leader in deep stretch getting up just before the wire. JILL took control from
the onset, increased the advantage up front while going easily running on the turn, still was on top at the sixteenth pole and was just caught in the last
couple of strides before the wire. GREEN GABLES settled on the rail behind the pacesetter watching things unfold down the backstretch, rallied on the rail
at the three sixteenth pole to be in the hunt straightening for the drive and stalled on the fence in the final furlong. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH had a slow start
trailing this compact field down the backstretch, took closer order to the pack outside at the top of the lane to be in the mix of things but offered little
throughout the stretch drive. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
KILLARY was pushed out on the break, could see the field with a half mile remaining, was unhurried while well in hand running on the turn, angled out
widest in the seven path at the top of the lane, was full of run to take command at the eighth pole and was going away in the end. ARAMOS stalked near the
rear in the beginning stages of the race, waited between runners in the third flight three furlongs from the finish, found room in the five path two furlongs
from the prize and put in a good stretch kick besting the rest at the finish line. FLAWLESS RULER settled in mid pack inside, was nudged on keeping pace
with rivals on the rail running through the turn, was shuffled back to last turning for home, weaved between horses at the furlong pole and ran on late to be a
clear third crossing the wire. ARNIE P was under a good hold outside on the turn in mid-pack, loomed four wide straightening out for the drive, drifted in
slightly under right handed urging in upper stretch, briefly was on top with three sixteenths to the wire and faded in the final eighth. C R HOT SHOT tracked
with runners on either side in the second flight early on, found running room three deep turning for home, was bounced around nearing the three sixteenths
marker and could not regroup to threaten on the rail. YORKVILLE had a poor start to begin trailing early, was urged right handed with five sixteenths to go,
shifted out in the six path for the drive to be involved for a small share of the prize in upper stretch and stalled at the furlong marker. SING DIXIE had a good
position behind the engaging duo early, was on hold on the rail three furlongs from home, had no path straightening out for the drive, found a seam in mid
stretch but offered no run when clear. ERNIE'S MARTINI broke out on the break, dueled two wide outside on the turn, had a brief lead in the two path at the
quarter pole, was bumped outside nearing the three sixteenth marker and offered little in the final eighth. IGNITE THE STORM broke out to begin, contested
the pace inside down the backside through to the top of the lane and retreated on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GREAT KATE trailed the field on the rail into the first turn, shifted off the fence between foes at the rear down the backstretch, put in a strong move circling
runners midpoint on the final turn to lead in the four path at the top of the lane, drifted in under right handed urging at the sixteenth pole and recovered to
edge away nearing the wire for the win. DREAMS AND SCHEMES tracked between horses two deep in the early stages, forced things to quicken up three
wide at the three furlong marker, battled with runners on either side straightening out for the stretch drive and was outrun by the winner in the final furlong.
LIAM'S AWESOME took the field on the fence into the first turn, continued to dictate the soft pace down the backside, was collared outside by rivals at the
two furlong marker, could not match strides with the top pair in upper stretch but had enough left through the lane to hold for show money. MISS
WATERLOO tracked behind the leader on the rail in the beginning, settled on the fence in midfield at the half, was shuffled to last inside with five sixteenths
remaining, shifted out to the three path for the run to the wire and passed tiring foes for a minor share. SPEEDY JOHNY pressed three wide for the front in
the early going, was content to lay off the pace just outside the leader down the back straight, lost positioning in the early part of the last turn, was roused at
the quarter pole and weakened on the rail in upper stretch. SANDY GRACE stalked near the back three deep into the first turn, continued three wide at the
back running on the final turn, angled out five wide outside horses for the drive and could not get into contention down the stretch.

Footnotes
PLUS POWER moved straight to the fore dueling inside a rival just off the fence, edged clear of that rival about the four- and one-half, was challenged again
entering the far turn, shook clear yet again coming into upper stretch, extended the margin then held safe. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY bumped with a rival at
the start, moved forward to contest the pace, dueled outside the eventual winner two to three wide, lost ground on that one about four- and one-half furlongs
from home, came again to press nearing the three-eighths, could not kick on with that one turning into upper stretch and was no match but held the place.
MACHINA was bumped and squeezed back at the start then angled in settling off the pace and saving ground early, moved out two to three deep racing
mid-pack into the far turn, came to the top of the stretch four wide and finished with late interest to improve position. TARA LUNA settled in behind early,
altered outside a rival into the first turn as that one checked and moved from three to five wide, was unhurried at the rear racing outside, continued four to
five wide on the far turn, tipped out seven to eight wide for the drive and ran on mildly. TOTAL BETTY settled off the dueling leaders saving ground inside,
came out in the stretch and ran on evenly. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN shifted in two to three wide outside a foe racing off the duel, had good position mid-pack
stalking up the backstretch, went three to four deep on the far turn, came out six to seven wide in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. CHROME'S
ANGEL steadied on heels soon after the start, was keen to go on and a bit rank then was taken up sharply heading into the first turn racing in behind a foe,
settled down at that juncture between runners toward the back, continued two to three wide on the far turn, failed to rally. FOREST MAIDEN settled outside
toward the back four wide on the first turn, continued at the rear three to four wide on the far turn, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTE'S SILVER was steadied sharply three furlongs from home, quickly recovered to circle rivals at the quarter pole, bid eight wide outside of
horses at the top of the lane, drifted inwards briefly in mid stretch, was straightened out when urged left handed to the wire and prevailed under a patient
ride in a eventful race. ASHBURY was shuffled on the rail to last when the field bunched up going into the turn, stayed on the fence looking for running room
through the turn, shifted inwards from the three path to the rail in mid stretch and burst up the fence late to make it close at the finish. SMART BIRD
travelled two deep in the second flight four furlongs from the prize, was on hold waiting behind the contesting leaders throughout the turn, finally had clear
running room at the eighth pole in the four path and gamely finished up to capture third in an solid effort. IRONY stalked near the back of the pack after the
start, advanced between foes entering the turn, angled out six deep three sixteenths from home, was steadied nearing the eighth pole and regrouped in
deep stretch to be gaining on the leaders to the finish. CELTIC REVIVAL had a narrow lead four wide at the half, still battled up front between runners when
they straightened out for the drive and gave way inside at the furlong marker. SPRING HIGH was allowed to settle at the back outside trailing down the
backstretch, started to commence a run six deep with seven sixteenths from the finish, was in tight quarters in the seven path turning for home, checked
briefly in upper stretch and showed some late energy to pass some horses running to the wire. BLACK TAFFY tracked in the second flight five deep down
the backside, bid three wide outside foes at the quarter pole, was contesting on the front end between rivals in the five path turning for home and levelled
out in the final sixteenth. STOLE THE RING lost some action trying to keep position nearing the three furlong marker in a tight pack, was near the back of
the field behind rivals at the top of the lane still not that far off from the leading group, shifted out in the seven path inside the eighth pole for clear room and
ran evenly to the finish. GOLDEN TRAIN prompted the issue up front running inside early on, was ridden on the fence to keep up with challengers at the
quarter pole, yielded at the furlong marker, lost her path fading on the rail and galloped to the finish. STEWARDS GENERAL INQUIRY GOING INTO AND
COMING OUT OF THE TURN RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
