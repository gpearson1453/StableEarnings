Footnotes
OX DOC showed good early foot to the early pace and drew off to be well clear under steady handling. BOX OF JOE chased the pace from the outside,
moved up five deep near the three sixteenths pole, came in near the eighth pole, forced Brit's Candyman to check sharply and finished willingly to the wire.
Jockey of Brit's Candyman claimed objection against Box of Joe and stewards disqualified and placed Box of Joe fourth for interference in the stretch run.
MIZZEN MAN chased the pace from the inside, continued a rail bid in the drive and moved up to improve position. BRIT'S CANDYMAN coaxed along early,
checked sharply near the eighth pole, angled out and kept on the wire. SPOOKY ONE chased the early leader two deep from the outside and weakened the
final eighth of a mile. SUNSHINE JACK was off slowly, raced off the early going and never was a factor. TAP EM stumbled at the break and trailed
throughout.

ROSES FROM HEAVEN showed good early speed from the outside racing two deep and edge clear late under strong handling. STARSHIP REINA was
bumped soundly at the start, pressed the early lead from the inside and kept on gamely to the wire. PRINCESS KAIRA was shuffled back at the break,
moved up three deep near the quarter pole to challenge and finished willingly to the wire. FIVE DAYS IN MAY bumped soundly at the break, inside nearing
the three eighths pole, angled out through the far turn, raced from the far outside in the stretch and gained ground late. JACK'S LILLY settled off the early
going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. HAY BUCK stalked the top pair early on and weakened while racing two to three wide.

Footnotes
HERE'S WALDO sent clear from the outside and held gamely in the drive to be well clear under strong encouragement. FACTOTUM tracked the early
leader from the outside two deep, raced three to four wide in the stretch drive and finished willingly to the wire. DEVOTED KITTEN settled off the early pace,
raced along the inside past the quarter pole, took aim into the upper stretch, shifted out three wide and flattened out. SHANGHAI CANDY settled off the
early going, raced four wide past the quarter pole and raced evenly with no closing run. UNCLE YUDI was unhurried early on, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and lacked a rally racing from the outside. HOLD THE IRISH stalked the pace three deep from the outside foes and faded.

the lead and kept on gamely to the wire. MISCHIEF WARRIOR tracked the early leader racing two deep, raced two wide between rivals in the drive and
kept on willingly to the wire. WHISKIED UP sprinted clear early on, met mid just past the three eighths pole and weakened a bit in the final stages. MARY'S
