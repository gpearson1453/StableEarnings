Footnotes
TONY'S BABE away cleanly, vied for lead with three others, ended up two wide right on the leaders flank, continued two wide on the turn, entered lane with
the lead, lugged in upper stretch, kept to task and edged away. GLITTER LAKE pressed pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the
turn, took aim in the four path in the lane and failed to catch the leader while just managing to hold on for second. TRUTH PREVAILS chased inside, asked
for run throughout, continued saving ground on the turn, had a wide path in the lane and gradually gained ground to just miss second. MY SWEET MARY
pressed pace four wide on the backstretch, continued wide on the turn, and weakened in upper stretch when prompted. CHARMING ALEXIS managed to
get lead and keep the rail in a highly contested pace, continued to lead entering the turn, headed entering the lane and failed to respond when asked in
upper stretch. PLEASE NOTE, DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, RACE WAS HAND TIMED
