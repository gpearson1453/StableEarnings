IRISH LUNA hopped at the start, but recovered quickly and tracked the pacesetter into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, maintained her
tracking trip through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, assumed command entering the
lane, and inched clear late to prove best. ZETAMARIE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final
turn, eased off the rail entering the lane, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. SILK STILETTOS away
well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch,
maintained her advantage into the final turn, was collared and quickly overtaken entering the lane, and just failed to hold the place. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS
broke sharply, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, but needed more when called on in an even effort. QUEEN OF LOVE away alertly, but was taken in hand and
allowed to settle off the early pace, dropped back to trail entering the final turn, and failed to respond when called upon.

AZOV SEA broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of MY MAN STAN in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide
through the final turn and into the stretch, and prevailed over that determined rival following a stretch long battle. MY MAN STAN away well and raced to a
narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and just missed
following a stretch long battled. ENGLISH BAY TEDDY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, commenced his bid
three wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. BARBERRY BANDIT hopped at the start to get away
slowly and trailed the field into the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious
late bid. SHOWMAN away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final
turn, but faded over the final furlong. UNION MAN tracked the dueling leaders while racing from between rivals entering the backstretch, maintained a

Footnotes
KOALA away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of ALOBRA entering the backstretch, began to get the better of her pace rival midway down the
backside, opened a clear lead entering the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. BELLAROO settled off the early pace while saving ground at
the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get the place.
QUEEN OF ATTITUDE hesitated at the start, and broke inwards at the start causing her rider to briefly lose his inside iron, trailed the field into the
backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, while steadying off heels throughout the turn, found clear sailing three wide entering
the lane, and closed with a rush to garner a share. LASTING LIGHT broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing three
wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, was carried five wide entering the lane, and finished evenly four out from
the rail in the drive. ALOBRAH away well and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressure pace from along the rail
into the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival in the run to the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. NINE OCLOCK CEASER tracked
the leaders into the backstretch while briefly steadying while in tight quarters, rallied two wide entering the final turn, drifted wide leaving the turn while
carrying LASTING LIGHT out with her, and had little to offer late.

DRILL BABY DRILL stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly one out from the rail through the final turn,
assumed command entering the lane, and inched clear late while drifting four wide in deep stretch. STRIKING VALUE was off a step slow, and settled off
the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly one out from the
rail in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides. SHE'S ON FIRE away well and stalked the leader into the backside while racing two out from the
rail, continued three wide into the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. BEST ONE YET settled off the early pace while racing
four wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest six wide in the drive. LILSISTERLEE away alertly
and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was collared leaving
the turn, and faded in the stretch drive. BETTER WITH TIME broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied three wide entering the final turn while struggling to hold her position, checked slightly leaving the turn, and had little to offer late.

TEXAS HUMOR away well and stalked the early pacesetters while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed steadily
four wide in the lane to get up in time. PERFECT PENNY stalked the dueling leaders into the backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to just miss. THESKYISTHELIMIT raced to the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of GWEN entering the backside, took command midway down the backstretch and opened a clear
advantage into the final turn, maintained her lead into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late while holding on for a share. ROSE OF TEXAS broke sharply
and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three out from the rail, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and improved her
position in the late stages while finishing four wide in the drive. GWEN pressed the pace from the outside of THESKYISTHELIMIT entering the backstretch,
was unable to match strides with her pace rival in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the final turn, but needed more in the late going. STAR
FINALITY away alertly and eased into a stalking trip while racing one out from the rail through the first turn, maintained a stalking trip from between rivals in
the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY settled well off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, continued to save ground into the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon.
LIL'MISS INTAGLIO dwelt at the start, to get away poorly, trailed well behind the field entering the backstretch, and wasn't persevered with over the final
furlong while hopelessly beat. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race, in particular to LIL'MISS
INTAGLIO. After review it was deemed that all horses received a fair start, and that LIL"MISS INTAGLIO caused her own problems at the gate, and no
change was made to the original order of finish.
