Footnotes
MAVILUS angled in on the first turn about the six-and-one-half after being caught four wide, unhurriedly brought up the rear and saved ground the
remainder of that bend, began to advance on the far turn while being guided out late to bid four wide, took command in upper stretch, kicked clear and was
geared down nearing the wire once safely in front. SILVER GLEN moved forward under mild early coaxing and shifted in a bit then back out to avoid an
inside foe, stalked three then four deep edging closer nearing the far turn and pressing from between runners racing nearer the rail two wide, bid mildly at
the five-sixteenths, kept on in the stretch to secure the place. OUR FANTASY stalked from just outside and off the leader being forced to move out from
three to five wide through the first turn, took closer order outside heading into the far turn, bid taking a narrow lead about the five-sixteenths, could not
sustain the effort and flattened out in the lane. TIZ HERSELF was in a bit tight racing inside into the first turn and tapped on the brakes, lacked room
tracking from in behind racing just off the rail, moved out further for the run up the backstretch, began to lose ground heading to the far turn and was ridden
along outside the three-eighths marker, swung five wide turning for home racing well off the leaders and failed to rally. BONITA LASSIE was urged to the
lead and clear, shifted in entering the first turn to set the pace but racing two then three paths removed from the fence, faced outside pressure leaving the
backstretch, moved to the rail entering the far turn, was overtaken by the midpoint of that bend, gave way.

Footnotes
SIR SMOAK settled mid-pack off the leading pair inside, saved ground early on the turn, moved out three wide leaving that bend while gaining willingly,
struck the lead at the eighth pole and put to stronger urged, responded to forge clear. SEEING RED stalked the early leader then moved nearer to press
from outside entering the turn, took over the lead by the quarter pole, was in turn overtaken nearing the furlong grounds, proved no match for the winner but
held the place from BIG ROWDY DAN, who was bumped at the break, settled at the back racing outside, raced four to five wide on the turn, floated six wide
into upper stretch, drifted in a bit while finishing up strongly but too late and missed second. SILVER R broke awkwardly and bumped with a rival, was
thereupon ridden to move forward between runners, chased three to four wide on the turn, drifted five wide into the stretch and came up empty. EDMUND
FITZGERALD moved clear, set the pace inside, was challenged on the turn, weakened in the stretch. I KNOW YOU LOVE ME was outpaced and not a
factor.

SPORTS EDITOR brushed a rival lightly at the start, moved out and continued to drift six to seven deep heading into the first turn, moved back in and raced
about mid-pack still wide and outside foes, fanned six wide into the stretch, drifted in once in upper- to mid-stretch bumping a rival, dueled late to prevail.
MISSION MAN was lightly bumped at the start, angled in and saved ground on the first turn, advanced on the leaders on the far turn while being guided out
late on that bend, bid in between runners in upper stretch, was bumped between foes, dueled late and was outfinished. PHOTO COPY angled in after the
start, settled tracking inside up close, switched out and went two wide into the far turn, moved out four deep, was in contention in upper stretch, bumped and
steadied by mid-stretch and ran on for show. DIZZY KITTY prompted the pace from outside going three wide, drifted in at the gap in mid-stretch, lacked the
needed late kick. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE settled in the back half of the field angling in early, saved ground on the far turn, advanced inside foes on the
far turn, came out a bit in the stretch and ran on evenly. REBEL JOKE raced mid-pack outside foes into the first turn three wide, continued racing mid-pack
moving out from two to four wide on the far turn, ran on evenly and needed more. GHOST OF KHOZAN was reluctant to load, broke well and vied inside,
could not kick on from upper stretch, was forced in a bit in mid-stretch at the gap, faded. FACTUM LOVE STYLE angled in and was unhurried at the rear
early, came out for the stretch run and passed foes. THE FIRE WITHIN raced toward the rear two to three wide, needed more. MINTENON was
forwardly-positioned between runners, forced the pace up the backstretch, retreated. EMOTIONAL RESCUE bumped the outer foe and steadied at the start,
was forwardly-positioned stalking just off the leading trio two to three wide, dropped back and tired. MR. COWBOY BRADLEY was lightly brushed at the
start, gained forward position in pursuit of the leaders tucking in two to three wide into the first turn, dropped back from the three-eighths and faded.
FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MISSION MAN AGAINST SPORTS EDITOR AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
PHOTO COPY AGAINST BOTH OF THE FORMER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, SPORTS EDITOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND PLACED THIRD BEHIND PHOTO COPY FOR INTERFERING WITH THAT RIVAL AND MISSION MAN IN A CHAIN REACTION OF BUMPS
IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
BACK RING LUCK forced the pace from outside a rival in an early duel, moved clear of that foe to dictate terms up the backstretch, put to urging by the top
of the stretch, was kept busy through the lane and held safe. MYSTERY MO angled inside the leaders but still off the inside early on the first turn to track in
behind, came out on the far turn three then four wide, was gaining steadily through the stretch but could only close the gap. OUTLIER dueled for the lead in
the early going inside the eventual winner, was outsprinted by that one and switched out late on the first turn to stalk, was able to range up along that one's
flank to press late up the backstretch but could not kick on. YOU MUST CHILL broke outwardly and a half-step slowly, raced outside at the rear, was ridden
along three furlongs out but failed to respond, was not persevered with in the stretch.

Footnotes
ALVY forced the early pace from between runners then stalked inside foes off the leader and off the rail, edged closer to apply pressure by the five-eighths
putting a short head in front from between runners, tussled a bit then took command at the seven-sixteenths making a bid, was clear into upper stretch,
eased up late. BETWEEN THE COVERS eased off the leading group and shifted in from five to three wide entering the first turn to stalk in behind, moved
out a bit up the backstretch before angling back in three deep entering the far turn, fanned out five wide out of that bend commencing a rally, was no match
for the winner but held second. LYING JEFF settled at the rear racing off the inside in the four to six path, advanced past foes from outside on the far turn
five to six deep, ran on and missed place. NOBLE FISH was caught outside four wide through the first turn just off the leader, was closer heading into the far
turn racing outside three to four deep and asked for more three furlongs from home, had no extra to give for the drive. STARDUST ZIGGY was caught six
wide into the first turn, dropped back off the leading group and shifted in a few paths, stalked off the pace from outside, continued about four wide on the far
turn, improved position. JOE BRAINS took back and angled in heading into the first turn racing in the two path, continued in behind close up to the leaders
two wide on the far turn, shifted nearer the rail leaving that bend after passing the tiring pacesetter, lacked a late bid. COUNTRY CHARLIE was
forwardly-placed three wide and between runners early, steadily retreated. HAY ROOM forced the pace inside multiple horses heading into the first turn,
moved clear to dictate terms, soon faced outside pressure late up the backstretch, gave way. OUT OF TOWNER raced at the back off the inside, was
outrun, eased through the stretch, walked off.

Footnotes
CLOUD MUSIC broke well and quickly moved clear shifting in a bit to set the pace near but off the rail, was asked for a bit more while coming out turning
into upper stretch, drifted out a bit further, held safe. PARADISE VALLEY switched out in pursuit of the leading trio going three then four wide on the turn,
was carried out six wide into upper stretch, closed on the winner but was only second best. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN settled mid-pack, saved ground early
on the turn racing inside, angled out two to three deep coming to the quarter then guided out further at the top of the stretch, ran on but needed more.
ALPHA WHISKEY stalked the winner from outside a rival, went three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MIKES MYTH chased the eventual
winner from inside a rival in behind on or just off the rail, dropped back and faded in the stretch. MY HANDSOME MAN lacked early speed and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY JACK was outpaced early bringing up the rear, saved ground early on the turn, was encouraged soon after, angled seven wide into the stretch
with aim on the new leader in mid-stretch and drove past late. TRULY MISCHIEF tracked from mid-pack inside, saved ground early on the turn, fanned six
wide turning for home, struck the lead near the furlong marker, was outfinished but second best. SWIFTY DEVIL got away alertly, set the pace facing
outside pressure, drifted out a couple paths leaving the turn, had no extra for the drive. SIX WHIPS pressed the pacesetter going three wide on the turn,
was floated five wide leaving that bend, weakened. SALOON chased from outside off the leading pair, faded.

Footnotes
BERMONDSEY dueled inside a foe to the first turn, edged away from that one to set the pace in the two path, was clear early up the backstretch, shook off
that competitor for good leaving the far turn, extended the margin in upper- to mid-stretch and held safe. WHATA GUY settled off the leaders inside saving
ground through the first turn, switched out and went two to three deep on the far turn, improved position to get up for place inside a rival. COSMIC
TREASURE dueled outside the winner to the first turn, eased off that one to stalk three wide, applied mild pressure leaving the backstretch, had no extra for
the drive. MELINA'S DREAM settled outside at the rear three to four wide, continued two to three deep on the far turn and passed tired foes in the stretch.
THE ANGRY MAN raced outside mid-pack thee to four wide early, went three to four deep on the far turn encouraged along drifting five wide into upper
stretch, lacked the needed late kick. THE EXCEPTION lacked early speed racing inside at the rear, was never near enough to threaten. MONDAY'S WITH
MIKE was caught three to four deep entering the first turn, shifted in to the two path about the seven-eighths tracking in behind the leading pair, was
encouraged along racing nearer the rail coming to the three-eighths, faded in the stretch.
