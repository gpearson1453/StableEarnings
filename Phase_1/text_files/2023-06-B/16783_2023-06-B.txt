HASHTAG NO WONDER trailed far behind, circled his field on the final turn, bid very wide into the stretch, closed strongly and was up late. CLASSY
AMERICAN controlled the pace, repelled challenges then was caught in the final sixteenth by the winner. DALTON angled inside early, bid on the final turn
then weakened. SOVEREIGN CHANGE raced off the leaders inside, loomed a threat then flattened out. HOMETOWN HERO lagged well behind then
advanced inside without menacing. MR. EINSTEIN lacked speed, moved very wide on the final turn and faded. AUCTION KINGDOM chased three wide off
the pace and lacked a response. MARATHONER prompted the pacesetter outside to the final turn and gave way. ET'S MAGIC MAN was urged close up for
half a mile then stopped. MEGA CHARLIE raced in midpack then stopped abruptly losing contact with his field. PER RULING EAD2023-18 CLASSY
AMERICAN WAS DQD FROM SECOND TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

SMOOTH AS GLASS raced close up outside, angled inside in the stretch and was up following a long drive. BOCA ROYALTY came out slightly into the far
turn, was taken up sharply inside, recovered and split rivals in deep stretch. SEAMIALAUGH stalked the pace three wide, continued well but was
outfinished. GAVICHI hustled to the front inside then was finished by the quarter pole. LULINDA'S HEART was taken up sharply into the far turn when
bothered by fallen rival, recovered and closed well wide. ANGINETTI prompted the pace between rivals, led to midstretch and tired. SHINY PENNY was
taken up sharply into the far turn avoiding the spill losing all chance and was eased. MRS. CREWS was bumped from the inside into the far turn, bobbled
badly and lost her rider. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident at the far turn and BOCA ROYALTY was disqualified from second and placed last.

COUSIN ANDREW stalked the pacesetter outside, bid inside rival into the lane and drew off eagerly. MISCHIEVOUS JONES settled behind the
pacesetters, faded on the turn then came again to earn the place. JOKEMEISTER set a clear pace, widened briefly on the turn, drifted wide and tired.
LUCKY AS A SEVEN broke sluggishly, rushed to contention then came up empty. VERO SUN lagged far behind and was always outrun. DON'T RECALL
dropped far behind and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
ONE SLICK START rated inside, angled out on the turn, led at the eighth pole and continued gamely. JUST A THOUGHT vied outside, shook off rival,
challenged again and continued well. SOPHOS fractious in the gate prior to start, advanced turn then flattened. CATCH MY VIBE dueled along the inside
then faded through the stretch. STAY HYDRATED prompted pace three wide for half a mile and gave way. NINE TOE JOHNNY chased off the leaders,
drifted very wide on the turn and stretch.

SOVEREIGN WARRIOR raced in midpack,bid briefly closer on the final turn then faltered. BE YOURSELF trailed far behind and was never a factor.
DRAMATIZED prompted the pace for half a mile and gave way. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE moved close up outside then was finished by the final turn.
