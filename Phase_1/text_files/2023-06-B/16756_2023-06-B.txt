SHOTSHELL lead the way into the first turn and into the second turn, was in a long drive entering the home stretch was kept to task to prevail wire to wire.
BOUGIE JOE rushed along the inside into the first turn to stalk the pace down the backstretch, inched closer to the leader throughout the far turn, dug in
gamely in the early stretch but was no match in the end. GOLDEN FLASH chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, gained the third position
heading into the far turn and held on throughout and was always best for the show prize in the end. RANSAM PAYNTER raced in the middle of the pack
while two wide, bid on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch and was no threat. KENTUCKY ICE stalked the pace while two wide, then faded heading
into the second turn and had no final bid in the end. DR VINNIE BOOMBATZ settle along the inside throughout and showed little. NORBERT settled in the

Footnotes
SWEET TAPIN MORO pressed the pace from two wide, overtook the pacesetter in mid-stretch and held off the closer in a drive to the line. WITT AMERICA
stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, cut the corner turning for home and closed well from the inside to just miss. SMARTY RIDGE slow early to
be at the back of the field, swung out turning for home and rallied belatedly in the stretch. MALORIE'S BIG BOY took the lead shortly from the gate, set a
well measured pace while in hand and lacked a response when called upon at the top of the lane. TEXAS HOLDEM tracked the leaders from the rail, was
set to an early drive and flattened out. FANDO chased the pace from two wide in the turn and faded down the stretch.

PERFECT WISH moved up throughout the first turn to press the pace down the backstretch, then gained command at the top of the far turn and held sway
down the home stretch to succeed in the end. SUNNY SAN LEON was well rated while tracking the pace from the inside throughout the first three quarters,
then closed belatedly in the stretch to be up for the place prize. ALMOST DIALED OUT lead the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch,
then was headed at the top of the far bend by an outer rival, continued to bid gamely in the stretch and was out finished for the place prize. WIKI LIO stalked
the pace from the inside under a steady hand ride, then bid on the far turn to rally gamely in the stretch and was closing well. LUCKY DEPUTY chased the
pace while two wide, was urging on the far turn to rally in the early stretch then continued to close well in the end. SCARLETTA stalked the pace from the
two path down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the far turn then weakened in the stretch. SWEET SLEW trailed behind the field and was no factor.

CATHOLIC GUILT unhurried for the first three-quarters, angled out five wide turning for home and closed with a rush to be up in time in a determined effort.
DEVAMANI (FR) well placed down the backside saving ground along the fence, cut the corner at the top of the lane, rallied along the inside to lead briefly in
deep stretch but was caught late by the charging winner. EASTER SNAP taken in hand in the first turn to settle into a stalking position down the backstretch,
rallied midway on the final bend to loom boldly at the head of the lane and was out-finished late in the drive. MAGIC MOSCO sped to the lead down the lane
the first time, set a pressured pace throughout, drifted out in the final bend and weakened inside the final sixteenth. MIDAS CAT slow early to trail the field,
commenced a long drive in the final turn and made up ground in the stretch. DARE TO BE WILD circled three wide in the first turn to challenge the leader
down the backstretch and came up empty after three-quarters. BLING'S BELLWETHER showed brief speed and was through early.

Footnotes
MAZI tracked the pace under a steady hand ride throughout the first four furlongs, then dug in gamely in the early stretch, took command mid stretch then
held on grudgingly to prove best. MUMBLEBEE stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn, then
surged down the home stretch and just missed victory in the end. SIMPLE PLEASURE chased the pace from the inside throughout the first half and into the
far turn, then rallied in the upper stretch from the three path and was closing willingly. MATH MYSTERY angled in to set the pace into the first turn, was in a
long drive heading into the home stretch then faltered in the end. CATO'S LADY chased the pace while two wide then dropped back heading into the far
turn and was through early. NORA'S LEGACY settled along the inside and was no threat. GRAN MANNA was off slowly, then raced towards the back of the
pack while three wide and needed more in the end.

Footnotes
ROUGHNECK sped to a clear lead shortly from the gate while in hand, opened his advantage in the turn without being asked, came under mild urging in
mid-stretch when kept to task and was geared down nearing the wire as much the best. COASTAL BRINK chased the pacesetter from the fence throughout
and finished willingly down the lane to be second best. DEACON JONES well placed to track the pace, failed to gain on the top pair but kept on in the
stretch to take the show. GREYDINI stalked the pace from three wide and lacked a closing response when called upon. CAT STORM reserved near the rear
of the main body to the turn and showed late interest gaining ground. DELTA FRONT went evenly posing no threat. MACHO GRANDE raced wide down the
backside and through the turn and was never a factor. WINDY O K C flashed speed for a half and tired. THE OX trailed as a non-factor.

Footnotes
SPARRA broke sharply and crossed over much of the field quickly, settled to press the pace through the turn, took command in upper stretch and drew off
to the wire. TEXAS CLUBMAN sped to the lead from the fence, was under constant pressure from the winner, could not keep up with that one but finished
willingly as second best. MORO BEARD rated between horses in mid-pack early, rallied in the turn and kept on for the show. FLYING IN HOT raced near
the rear of the field well off the early pace and showed interest making up some ground in the stretch. HOLIDAY HOAX went evenly never posing a threat.
DADA BOOM RIDGE slow early to be at the back and was never a factor. CAJUN FIRE up close to be prominent along the rail to the turn and faded coming
home.

Footnotes
VIVACIOUSLY dueled throughout the first three quarters with an outer rival, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to task to win easily in the end. MISS
LONG LEGS chased the pace under a steady drive while four wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, and was closing well but it wasn't enough.
OCCURRENCE chased the pace while three wide, was in a hard drive throughout the far turn then closed well for the show prize. HAUNTED DREAM
veered out and bumped rival at the start, then was unhurried early, rallied from the three path on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. NUBILITY
was bumped on both sides at the start, then settled in the back of the pack, bid from the two path on the far turn, was in tight then steadied, angled out four
wide in the stretch to rebid but came up empty. A LITTLE GOOD NEWS chased the pace from the inside, made a mild bid on the far turn then flattened out
in the stretch. NICAMINE was bumped at the start, then settled along the inside throughout and showed little. GILDED GHOST chased the pace while three
wide down the backstretch, then dropped back at the top of the far turn and had no final bid. SAN MATEO KAT dueled for the lead while two wide, was in a
long drive heading into the second turn then weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
D'ORO STREET sped up the fence to take control shortly from the gate, set a well measured pace while under constant pressure, shook clear at the head
of the lane, opened a clear advantage in mid-stretch and held in convincing fashion not having been threatened in the lane. LOANA tracked the pace in the
clear several lengths back, dropped to the rail into the turn, saved all the ground cutting the corner and rallied well in the stretch for the place.
ACCELERATE JUDY initially pressed the early pace from between horses, took back to settle in a stalking position, made a three wide bid turning for home
to threaten but finished evenly down the lane. HIGINIA unhurried to be at the back of the main body of the field and rallied belatedly down the stretch to be
gaining ground late. MAGNOLIA MAE well placed along the rail to the turn and flattened out approaching the quarter pole. MASTER SOM moved up three
wide after the first eighth to press the pacesetter from three wide, dueled with the winner through the turn and gave way down the lane. MY BUTTERFLY
raced mid-pack through the turn and faded. SASSY CHASSIE trailed throughout as a non-factor.
