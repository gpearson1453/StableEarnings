Footnotes
HALO LOVE stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, bid three wide nearing the eighth pole, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and
inched up. BIG CITY HEAT steadied soon after the start to shift to the outside of the pacesetter, pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the
lane, led with an eighth to go then was outfinished late. STAR REVIEW was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, was
slowly gaining late then benefitted a couple of spots when two rivals lost ground late. COMMANDO JOE raced in the two path through the turn while behind
several, was boxed in looking for a path through the lane, shifted to the four path then back to the two path, went for a hole inside the sixteenth pole, was in
tight and checked late. LUCKIES JOY ridden hard early to clear for the lead before the first call, was under pressure through mid-turn and into the lane, lost
the lead inside the eighth pole, remained on the rail when another came over and put him in tight to the rail, was taken up late. DISTORTED NOTION trailed
throughout while in the two or three path. A FTER A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #4 LUCKIES JOY AGAINST THE
RIDER OF #3 BID CITY HEAT FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN ORDER.

SIMPLICITY raced in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack then weakened after coming into the lane from the three path. NOBLE PRIZE settled
into the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the six path and never factored. TIZ ABBY was in the five to the four path through the first
turn, moved closer to the inside through late turn and never made an impact. STORMY WAGER chased the two rival duel through the far turn when in the
two or three path and was done nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SPOKE vied three wide early, dueled outside of a rival, went clear in the stretch, then lasted under mild urging. VICTOR'S DEAL was unrushed early,
angled five wide in the stretch and rallied belatedly. BRUSTER JUSTICE vied between rivals, was no match on the turn, but held the show spot. FOLLOW
THE MONEY was unrushed, then rallied belatedly inside. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY vied inside, dueled inside in the stretch and then faded late.
HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE pressed the early pace in the six path but faded in the stretch. BOLD BIZNESS raced six wide, then lacked a late bid. MACHO
ALEGRE saved ground to no avail. GIMMEFUELGIMMEFIRE was not a factor.
