placed while widest into the far turn, was roused five then four wide nearing the top of the lane, took a narrow lead on MOONSHINE CAT nearing the furlong
pole, kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and proved best in the final stages. MOONSHINE CAT stalked the early pace while four wide into the
first turn, was well placed while outside of rivals through the backstretch run, vied for the lead while four then three wide along the far turn, matched strides
with CALIFORNIA GIGI to the furlong pole, was outfinished in the final stages and was well clear of the rest for second. DANGEROUS ILLUSION settled off
of the early pace and raced outside of rivals into the first turn, was carried out six to seven wide heading into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace
to the far turn, slipped to the inside nearing the quarter marker, chased the top pair into the stretch, lacked the needed response in the final stages and was
clear in the end for third. MANY MARKETS assumed command leaving the break and dictated terms early on, set moderate fractions while under mild
pressure to the far turn, was confronted nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken into upper stretch and faded through the drive. LUCKY LOCKETT was

the far turn, was asked for run three wide into the drive, confronted ST HELENA in upper stretch, battled that stubborn rival to mid-stretch, took command
into the final furlong, was flagged the crop through deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. BLUSHING BAY was unhurried through the
early stages, traveled in the two path while settling through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, finished
well in the final furlong, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and won the nod on the wire for second. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) settled just off of the
early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the far turn, came in a bit tight nearing the quarter marker, split rivals
leaving the quarter pole and angled four wide in upper stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch,
was edged in the final strides for second and just held at the wire for third. ST HELENA was sent to be prominent in the early running, contested the pace
while widest into the first turn and assumed command into the backstretch run, set moderate fractions to the half-mile pole and showed the way to the
quarter marker, met the bid of CLASS CODE in upper stretch and fought back against that rival in the drive, weakened in the final stages and was just
edged for the minor awards. GOING TO SHABOOMS broke alertly and was forwardly placed into the first turn, took back to prompt the moderate fractions
into the backstretch run, attended to the pace from the inside approaching the far turn, lost ground in the stretch drive and tired in the final stages. HARBOR

along the rail on the far turn and confronted SGT POWELL approaching the top of the stretch, battled with SGT POWELL to the furlong marker, was turned
away by the winner heading to the final sixteenth and ran on in the final stages to best the rest. VINNIEBOB settled just off of the early pace while widest
into the first turn, tracked outside of rivals while well placed through the backstretch run, raced four wide while within aim along the far turn, lost ground into
upper stretch, lacked the needed late response and finished evenly in the drive, while well clear in the end for third. RAYS REGAL settled off of the early
pace, was coaxed along three wide into the backstretch run, was steered to the rail along the far turn, trailed into the stretch and did not offer a late rally.
ANTHONY'S BEST showed early speed and was prominent into the first turn, prompted the pace from the four path into the backstretch run, kept close
attendance to the pacesetter through the backstretch run, lost position while three then two wide along the far turn, could not keep pace into the drive and
tired.

Footnotes
HONOS MAN was unhurried in the early running, settled off of the moderate pace and maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run, gained ground
approaching the half-mile marker, was roused along the rail on the far turn and loomed into upper stretch, vied for the lead at mid-stretch, shook free from
WINDRIBBON inside of the furlong marker, responded to steady urging into deep stretch and held safely in the final stages over the oncoming runner-up.
ZIMBA WARRIOR settled off of the early pace, gained ground along the backstretch run, chased while outside of rivals along the far turn, rallied five wide
into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and outfinished WINDRIBBON in the final stages to
secure second. WINDRIBBON broke alertly and was prominent into the first turn, contested the early pace with HEY MATE then took back to stalk that rival
through the backstretch run, attended to the moderate fractions to the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker,
could not match strides with HONOS MAN in the final furlong, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for
third. HEY MATE bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, contested the pace into the backstretch
run then assumed command and set moderate fractions to the half-mile pole, showed the way to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, could
not keep pace approaching the furlong grounds and weakened. GALLANT WARREN was allowed to settle while outside of rivals into the first turn, trailed
while not far back through the backstretch run, chased two wide along the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. KODIACTION was
prominent into the first turn and stalked the pace from a three then two wide path into the backstretch run, was well placed heading to the half-mile pole, lost
ground while four wide along the far turn, was outrun into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BABY KRISTEN broke sharply then sprinted clear down the backstretch, maintained the lead through the turn, began to shorten strides passing the eighth
pole, was confronted in deep stretch by BLUE WILDCAT but had enough to hold on by a desperate nose. BLUE WILDCAT broke well and chased the
leader close up and to the outside, rallied under a brisk hand ride from the quarter pole and was not making up much ground on the winner until the final
furlong, then closed the gap between the two, ultimately coming up just short and besting the rest. AUSTRIAN NAVY outrun early, started a sustained rally
from the turn that carried wide into the stretch and ended up in the middle of the race track, closed willingly but was never a serious threat to the top two.
NAVY QUEEN was close up through the first quarter mile then began to lose ground on the leader through the turn and was done before the stretch.

Footnotes
TWO TWELVE broke well, cleared the field then angled in to the three path, opened up a two length lead in the first quarter mile then held the field at bay
through the turn, responded to strong handling in the stretch to out-finish a pair of challengers and was widening a bit at the end. PRETTY THIRSTY
stumbled badly at the start then recovered quickly to race in the four or five bath down the backstretch in a close tracking position behind the lone
pacesetter, started an extended rally with three furlongs to run and ran on well but could do no better than chase the winner to the wire. CRY ME A
RUNNER stumbled start then was pressed to go forward towards the leaders, was able to get over to the two path and came under a drive from the quarter
pole with clear run at the leader, ran on gamely in the stretch but tired past the sixteenth pole was outfinished for second. KERRYGOLD LADY hustled from
the inside after the early leader, saved ground racing towards the inside, turned into the stretch with a chance but had trouble changing leads and could do
no better than to finish even paced while well clear of the next horse. SHEZA QUEEN BEE lacked any early speed from the break despite the best efforts of
the rider, fell well behind early, raced three wide through the turn and made a mild late rally to improve a couple of positions. ENGEE OMBEE broke in a bit
at the start and steadied briefly, was outrun from that point racing between a trio of horses trailing the field, came under a ride from the half mile pole and
never found another gear, finishing one-paced to the wire. JERSEY BIRD was outrun from the break, lost ground through the turn and was never a threat.
JERSEY STAR fell behind after the break, never mustered up a rally and trailed the field throughout.
