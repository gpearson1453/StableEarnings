Footnotes
GOOD AND STOUT in the second flight early, asked for some turn turn, carved into the leader's advantage entering the stretch, collared that foe under
pressure with less than a furlong remaining, drew out steadily late while being kept to task. HYMN FOR CARLOS broke through the gate prior to the start,
broke on top despite being a bit rank, quickly clear, maintained a sizable advantage through the turn, had little for the winner when that one came alongside
inside the furlong grounds, no match. STRONG DIAMOND outside the winner early, fell back off that one into the turn, no threat through the stretch to trail
home.

Footnotes
CHARLIE G outrun early while saving ground, continued to race toward the inside up the backstretch, asked along and began to advance from between
horses midway on the second bend, came four wide for the drive, took over, inside the furlong marker and edged clear. EYE DEE KAY in mid pack while
also racing along the inside, bobbled far turn, continued to save ground into the lane, turned in a gutty effort along the rail to garner the place spot. GET
THEM JUSTIN forwardly placed while three wide, continued to stalk the middle half in the three path, mildly challenged inside the furlong grounds, outkicked
late for the runner up spot. ENTERTAINMENT broke in to tighten up NATE'S ATTACK just after the start, was straightened to clear before a quarter,
continued to show the way into and through the second turn, allowed the the runner up the rail as he was being headed by the winner late, caved in to lose
a couple of more positions in the waning strides. NATE'S ATTACK squeezed just after the start, fell back to race in mid pack, came four wide for the drive,
displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve a bit. STANDING MAN lacked speed, between horses into the far turn, improved a bit in the drive without
posing a serious threat. JACI'S ROYALTY remained back in lacking a serious closing response. RIPITTOTHERIGHT pressed the issue up front for six
furlongs in the two path, had little left for the stretch drive. COLONIST last away, was never a threat. UNFATHOMED in mid pack outside, was four to five
wide turning for home, tired.

Footnotes
BATTLE OF WITS dueled up front outside, continued to alternate through the turn, held a slight advantage past the furlong marker, edging clear late.
ZIPPING MOLLY broke on top, dueled up front while along the inside, continued on equal terms into and through upper stretch, failed to match strides with
the winner late, clearly second best. ABBY DABBY in the second flight outside, finished up best of the rest in lacking a closing response. MS. PRIESTLY
broke out, bumped SHOTGUN ANNIE, settled in the second flight toward the inside, went evenly throughout in also lacking a closing bid. KASENS TRIBE
fell back to trail after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SHOTGUN ANNIE bumped at the break, raced back
throughout and failed to menace. LACEY'S STAR off a step slow, moved up a bit early, steadily backed up through the stretch to be well beaten at the end.

Footnotes
TSURIS void of early while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide again into the second bend when beginning to advance, outside bid
approaching the furlong marker, drew clear late under steady handling. CATINANDSCATIN dueled early along the inside, allowed the other speed to go
after a quarter, rebid on the outside of that rival far turn, vied into and through upper stretch between foes, proved no match for the winner late, held sway
for the place. SABER STORM in the second flight early, fell back the middle half, four wide into the lane, along for the show late. CHIEF KIMOSABI in the
second flight off the inside, advanced and lodged a bid between horses past the furlong marker, failed to sustain that effort to the wire. UNBRIDLED PULPIT
went one paced throughout in lacking a closing punch. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER dueled up front early in the two path, clear after a quarter, faltered when
headed by the runner up turning for home. WILDCARD GOLD never menaced in remaining back throughout. BARNEY'S PASSION in mid pack early,
stopped after a half, distanced after losing contact with the field stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
TACTICAL VISION away in good order, allowed to settle off the pace inside, continued to save ground onto the backstretch, tipped out three wide turning for
home, challenged in upper straight, kicked well clear the final furlong under firm handling. EASY EDDIE A unhurried early, moved outside, came three wide
and behind the winner turning for home, unable to keep up with that one the final furling, still displayed good resolve to be up late for part of the place.
BUCK'S GLORY back off the early pace, asked along outside the winner far turn, idled into the lane well out in the course, late push to be up a share of the
second spot. UNCLE HUTCH sprinted clear the opening quarter, set the pace inside, briefly responded when challenged when straightened for home,
weakened final furlong. BLEEP BLEEP chased the leader for six furlongs, challenged turning for home, vied past the furlong marker between horses,
faltered late. ASTROLOGY WONOWON raced within striking distance for five furlongs, came up empty for the drive. ALL TOGETHER broke back and failed
to menace. POWER MASTER also a bit slow away, moved up to race in mid pack early and tired. CREOLE REB restless in the gate then was unprepared
for the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FORGED IN STEEL in the second flight off the inside, moved closer in the three path turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker then kicked clear
late. R T'S D'ORO pressed the early leader, engaged that one before a half, dueled then salted that rival away midway on the final turn, responded when
the winner came alongside entering the stretch, could not match strides with that one late, clearly second best. C. F. CONGRESS settled off the pace and
the inside, proved no match for the top two in the drive, finished up best of the rest. MULETRAIN four wide first turn, mid pack while remaining off the inside,
roused three wide and behind the winner turning for home, chased the top pair past the furlong marker, went evenly to the wire to be caught for the show.
DARK MATTER lacked early foot, came five wide out of the final turn, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. K V TARGET had nothing for the
stretch run. INSPECTOR ED moved up to show the way first turn inside, dueled into the far turn inside the runner up and gave way. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT off
slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HOLY BAYOU with the pace from the start, vied three wide into the turn, into the stretch two path, came in past the gap with less that a furlong remaining to
float WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRN inward, came out in the final strides and crossed first in a determined effort. TACTICAL PRIORITY also raced with the
pace from the start, vied inside into the turn, dueled into the lane, continued on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker, floated in a bit into the
gap, continued to battle on to the finish, missed. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU contested the early pace between the top two, fell back off that pair late in the
turn, moved outside, was coming again late while outside that same two rivals. M AND M'S CUSTOM broke back, lacked speed, dropped to the inside turn,
improved position by splitting foes late, not a threat to top three. HALF OURS N STORMY in the second flight off the inside, came in the two path for the
drive, lacked a closing punch. COMANCHE WARRIOR in mid pack off the inside, came three wide when roused turning for home, also went one paced late.
WIN WON DOBBS off the pace while racing outside, four wide through the turn, went evenly to the wire as well. MAD GOLD lacked a response in the drive.
F T W SLAM last away, failed to menace. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG failed to threaten while racing outside. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
FLASHY BOY broke with the leaders, vied four wide early, between foes into the lane, drove clear nearing midstretch and held a daylight advantage to the
wire. OURPERFECTPRINCE behind the pace, off the inside, roused four wide into the stretch, finished willingly to be in time for the place.
ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE in the second group out of the gate, moved closer four wide into the turn, chased the winner through upper stretch, had little for
that foe the final furlong, caught late for the second spot. RAZZ lacked early foot, moved out widest for the drive, displayed some belated interest to be
gaining for the show spot. FLASHY BOY GOES in mid pack while toward the inside, came up empty for the drive. GOLDUSTER in a bit tight at the break,
one paced through the stretch in failing to rally. CUSTOM PRAYER flashed some early foot along the inside, faded. COLT'S BRIM remained back, failed to
respond. D T'S DREAM fell back to trail after the start and was always outrun.
