NITRO TIME chased the pace through the turn vying all out four then five wide down the lane drawing even late getting a nose down on the wire. BUTTON
BOX broke sharply to the lead posting quick splits to upper stretch digging in from the two path there continuing to respond late just missing in a gutty effort.
RESCUE FIVE went evenly through the turn racing inside to upper stretch finishing well near the rail. AW ITE tracked evenly through the turn extending into
upper stretch needing a bit more at the end. SHOSHA a step slow through the turn gave an even finish. UNBRIDLEDSELECTION raced evenly in mid pack
failing to menace from mid track down the lane. HONKY TONK HERO was not involved racing eight wide down the lane. OMEGA GOLD and MON CAMO

SEVEN AND SEVEN sent clear was rated on pace moving between horses in upper stretch digging in to outside pressure in the closing strides holding on
at the wire. TAMANRASSETT steadied into the first turn stalked the pace chasing to upper stretch appearing to be hanging in mid stretch finding a late
surge on the outside just missing at the wire. HOLY TRUTH raced evenly through the far turn angling out to upper stretch gaining late in the six path.
KNOWN unhurried early would save ground waiting for room into the far turn angling out in upper stretch finding best stride too late at mid track. PAISANO
tracked the pace cutting the corner to vie boldly from the rail in upper stretch before weakening the final sixteenth. UNCLE JEROME was not involved.
