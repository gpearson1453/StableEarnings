Footnotes
MISS BOBBIT was allowed to settle at the back on the rail the early going, slowly began to advance on her rivals through the turn saving ground, found a
seam in the three path at the furlong marker, burst between horses inside the sixteenth pole and got up in the last jump in a well timed late rally. TALL
WATER broke a step slow to begin, was roused three wide circling runners midway on the turn, shifted out widest at the top of the lane in the five path for
the drive and found his best stride late just missing losing a tight photo for the win. STRIKING HEIR had a good tracking trip two deep sitting off the early co
leaders at the half, took closer order to the leaders midpoint on the turn outside, bid four deep at the top of the stretch, poked his nose in front in mid stretch
but could not hold off late challengers on either side nearing the wire. ROYAL MAHOGANY pressed just outside down the backside for the lead, assumed
command three furlongs from home, fought on between rivals up front at the top of the lane and finished evenly inside the eighth pole settling for a minor
share. BEND IN THE RIVER had a good position behind the top pair while comfortably in hand at the half, continued to be on hold throughout the turn, was
shuffled to be near the back two furlongs from home and could not get involved finishing to the wire. BOUND LUCKY had the early lead on the rail down the
backstretch, relinquished the front running inside entering the turn, battled back on the fence in upper stretch to be in the mix at the eighth pole and yielded
in deep stretch.

Footnotes
HEKLA'S AURA was coaxed forward setting the pace between runners, edged clear by the three-eighths, drew off in the stretch as the rider pleased and
was not urged along late. EYE GOT IT GOOD settled off the pace, saved ground just off the rail on the turn, was no match for the winner but got the place.
TAMANA broke awkwardly and slowly, was coaxed along to regain contact with the main body of the field, went four wide on the turn racing outside, swung
ten deep into upper stretch, finished well to just get up for show honors. SPIRIT BELLE stalked the winner from outside three to four wide, came out six wide
in the stretch, needed more. INFINITE PASSION shifted in early up the backstretch, saved ground through the first part of the turn, moved out three to four
wide on that bend, swung seven deep into upper stretch, ran on mildly. MISS BIKINI broke inwardly bumping a rival but had good forward position pressing
from inside, considered the pursuit in behind shifting out near the five-sixteenths, faded in the stretch. TEXAS DANA broke awkwardly, was bumped and
checked at the start, trailed while racing inside, was never a threat.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE tracked just outside in the second flight down the backside, began to lengthen stride three wide at the back of this tight pack
entering the far turn, contested for the front in the three path at the quarter pole and determinedly wore down his lone rival through the stretch to edge away
nearing the wire for the gritty victory. GIANT ONE assumed the lead inside into the first turn, was content to sit just off the frontrunner on the rail down the
backstretch, took over at the three furlong pole, braced for a new challenger outside at the top of the lane and stubbornly fought to the finish just losing the
battle nearing the wire. MOMENT OF PEACE pressed the issue just off the fence entering the first turn, narrowly has his head in front down the back
straight, could not match strides with the leaders on either side at the three eighths marker and was one paced in the stretch settling for a clear third in the
end. BET N WIN was on the rail tracking in the second flight in the beginning, trailed this compact bunch between horses with four furlongs from home, was
ridden for more between runners in the two path at the quarter marker, checked briefly, angled out four wide for the stretch run and made little impact to the
finish. GLENHOLME was unhurried to trail the pack in the early going inside, continued to see the field on the rail sitting just behind the leaders in this
compact bunch at the half mile marker, was asked for more run midway on the final turn, could not make any gains on rivals and made little impression
through the stretch drive.

Footnotes
PEDIGEEK shifted in settling off the pace two to three wide in the early going, moved out and advanced four to five wide on the far turn, struck the lead a
furlong out and held. BLACKDIAMOND DINNY settled last but one racing inside, moved out gradually through the far turn fanning six wide into upper
stretch, was gaining steadily but missed. SECRETARYOFTHENILE set the pace racing just off the rail, kept on in the stretch but was outfinished. MILAGRE
DO SOL settled inside off the leaders, angled out five deep in upper stretch then a few more paths in late stretch for room, was gaining outside but too late.
LADY XI stalked from outside four wide early, continued three to four deep on the far turn in behind the leaders, ran on evenly. BIJOU BABY stalked the
early pace three wide before applying more pressure up the backstretch, put to urging about the five-sixteenths but lacked the needed late response. ANITA
MARGARITA tracked the pacesetter from inside, put to urging by the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. CHAMPAGNE KRISTA veered in at the
start, raced at the rear inside saving ground, swung six wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten. JOKES UP shifted in two to three wide
heading into the first turn, tracked from mid-pack, faded in the lane.

Footnotes
C C'S KINGDOM was floated out five wide into the first turn, tracked four deep in midfiled down the backstretch, circled runners easily four wide with five
sixteenths to go, took control outside turning for home and was drawing away comfortably crossing the line. COLEYVILLE settled in midpack on the rail in
the beginning, advanced smartly on the fence at the half to be sitting just behind the leaders into the far turn, was ridden inside at the quarter pole, angled
out to the four path at the furlong marker and chased the winner in vain in deep stretch. CANYOUHEARMENOW was headstrong behind runners
throughout the first turn, travelled between the leaders under a strong hold down the backside, bid for the lead with rivals on either side at the three furlong
pole, continued to battle up front turning for home, drifted inwards briefly in mid stretch and re rallied late to come again capturing third at the finish. STAR
SIGN cleared the field to lead on the rail into the beginning turn, continued to be the pacesetter down the backstretch and final turn, was collared outside at
the top of the lane and battled for the show award to the wire settling for a small share in the end. LION'S GOLDENHEART prompted the pace two wide into
the first turn, kept a close eye on the leader three abreast down the backstretch, engaged outside midpoint on the far turn for the lead but retreated three
wide at the top of the stretch. SHANGASSAH settled near the rear running down the backside, was scrubbed on two wide outside rivals commencing a mild
run at the three eighths pole and passed tired foes in stretch. FLAT OUT VIXEN stalked close to the back at the half mile marker, made little headway on
the rail through the final turn and could not get involved in the stretch drive. HIT THE POINT settled at the back of the field into the first turn, could not gain
on runners down the backside and was never a presence running through the stretch.

Footnotes
DANCING DUCHESS moved quickly to the fore, set a pressured pace inside, moved clear into upper stretch and held sway. STORMCAST stalked three to
four wide through the turn, drifted five deep into upper stretch, was clearly second best. PARTY pressed the eventual winner from outside racing between
runners at times, lacked the needed late kick. AIROSA stalked from outside four to five wide, came into upper stretch six deep and weakened. MAGIC
TOKEN saved ground through the turn racing well back of the leaders, came out in upper stretch and kicked on with mild late interest. TWISTING PISTONS
raced mid-pack outside a foe two to three wide, went evenly and made on bid. KEEP THE BLOOM broke a half-step slowly, saved ground on the turn, was
never a threat. SANCERRE broke a half-step slowly, was ridden along racing outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was never a threat. UNDER
BUDGET raced at the back off the inside two to three wide, failed to rally. BOSTON MABEL was a bit reluctant to load, saved ground into and on the turn,
faded.

Footnotes
BATYAH travelled five wide from the outside post on the first turn, rated kindly in the middle of the pack through the backstretch, started to go by horses at
the three eights pole, loomed four wide in upper stretch and never gave in down the lane to get up in the final jump. LADY BREW tracked three wide on the
first turn, had a good spot outside runners three deep watching the contesting pair at the half, bid for the lead three wide straightening for the drive, opened
up at the furlong marker and determinedly ran to the wire just getting caught at the line. NOW IS A BREEZE hounded the early pacesetter just outside down
the back straight, assumed command entering the stretch in the two path, was quickly headed outside in upper stretch and needed more late to threaten the
top two at the finish. KITTEN'S ROMANCE bumped outside foe at the start, had a good spot between runners in the second flight two deep down the
backstretch, started to move on the leaders inside on the far turn, was looking for a seam behind rivals at the three sixteenth marker, found clear running
room in the four path at the furlong marker but could not make any gain in deep stretch. LOVE TO RUN dictated the pace from the onset, continued to lead
them all through the far turn, was collared inside two furlongs from home and faded on the fence in mid-stretch. FRANKIE'S GIRL was situated in mid-field
three wide on the first turn, settled in between foes in the third flight two deep at the half, was roused at the three furlong marker and continued to keep pace
with foes showing interest to the finish. BUTTERED TOAST trailed the field until the half mile pole, started to get into gear inside with three furlongs
remaining, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and willingly finished up passing tired foes to the wire. ARRIVISTE saved ground into the first turn,
settled close to the rear down the backside, offered a mild run around foes midpoint on the final turn, angled out six wide turning for home and was one
paced to the finish. KERICS BEAUTY travelled near the rear at the half mile marker, offered a brief run between horses at the three eighths pole and
showed little interest running down the stretch. TEMPEREYA broke in and bumped rival at the start, travelled inside in the middle of the pack at the half,
was on hold briefly behind a tiring runner on the final turn, shifted out two wide but could not get involved running inside through the stretch. ERASMO'S
GIRL was situated near the back in the early stages, could not find more under urging on the far turn and was a non factor to the finish. BINSKY settled
behind the leader on the rail in the first turn, was hard ridden on the fence to keep up with runners at the three furlong marker and backed away through the
field on the final turn.

Footnotes
SIX SENSE tracked from inside with forward position just off the leader, moved out at the top of the stretch for room, took aim, edged past late. SCOTTISH
SYMPHONY got away alertly, set the pace racing just off the inside, was a bit nearer the rail on the turn, clear into upper stretch, outfinished but clearly
second best. PEMBERLEY lacked early speed, swung eight to nine deep turning for home, got up for show honors. WEEHAWKEN stalked with forward
position in behind the leader, went three to four wide on the turn, floated six wide into upper stretch, kept on evenly. CURLIN CANDY raced outside foes
four to five wide through the turn, floated seven to eight deep into upper stretch and ran on evenly. COLLECT DATTT pressed the early pace from outside,
went two to three wide on the turn, drifted out five deep entering upper stretch then drifted in a bit late. SWEET NOLA bumped a rival at the start, raced
inside early then two wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. EGBERT J was bumped at the start, raced mostly two to three wide at the back,
was not a threat.

Footnotes
READY LADY tracked on the rail in the second flight down the backside, waited behind the co-leaders running on the turn, found a seam on the fence at the
three sixteenth marker, shot on through take control at the eighth pole and was kept to the task holding the outside closer at bay in deep stretch. PERHAPS
TONIGHT (IRE) travelled in mid-pack under a good hold rating on the rail through the turn, was on hold behind rivals at the five sixteenths pole, had clear
run in the five path at the three sixteenth marker, finished up well but could not catch the winner late and settled for second best. MY GIRL SKY had a slim
lead on the rail setting mild fractions early on, dueled on the lead between foes in upper stretch, drifted in on the drive to the line at the eighth pole and held
show money crossing the wire. WHIMSICAL DANCE stalked near the back in the beginning, angled out to the eight path in this compact field at the quarter
pole to commence her run, was willingly in the final furlong and closed best to win the battle for the minors in the end. MISS MARIE was situated in the
middle of the pack just off the fence in the early going, shifted out for the drive in the six path to have a chance for a share of the prize in upper stretch and
could only offer an even finish in the last eighth. TOERIS tracked just outside in the second flight throughout the turn, angled out four wide turning for home,
was well in range of the leaders to have a chance for the prize in early stretch and stalled between horses with three sixteenths to run. LADY MOONSHINE
was content sitting outside off the flank of the frontrunner in the early soft pace, battled up front with runners on either side until mid-stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. AMAZIN QUEEN was void of speed early to trail down the backside and throughout the turn, angled out widest in the nine path taking close
order to the leaders at the top of the lane, was in the mix for a share in upper stretch but tired in the late stages of the race.

Footnotes
GIVE ME THE BOOTS was quick to the lead, set the tempo racing off the inside in the two to three path, drew off when roused. CHERRY GARDENS was
bumped at the start, switched outside a foe early racing off the rail, moved out four wide turning for home, was second best. SWEEPING PASSION chased
the leaders racing mid-pack and outside, encouraged along three furlongs out going four to five wide on the turn, lugged out a path past the quarter pole,
kept on to secure show honors. MRS. C settled at the rear between runners, advanced some five to six wide on the turn, was forced out a bit past the
quarter pole, kept on evenly. SHEZ A SEALY bumped a foe just lightly at the start, was forwardly-positioned mid-pack racing two to three wide on the turn,
asked for more by the quarter pole, kept on inside late to improve. JO MARCH was forwardly-placed tracking, moved closer to press briefly from inside at
the seven-sixteenths, weakened in the stretch. SOCIAL DRINKER settled at the back inside, saved ground early on the turn moving out three wide by the
quarter pole, angled nine deep abruptly at the top of the stretch, ran on with mild late interest. DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE bumped a rival at the start, was
well-placed just off the leaders inside, moved out late on the turn coming three deep past the quarter pole and five wide at the top of the stretch, faltered and
faded. IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE raced outside at the rear going four to six wide on the turn, was forced out ten wide leaving that bend by a rival, failed to rally.
CRUMLIN BEAST was just lightly bumped at the start, raced between runners at the back, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, was never near
enough to threaten. MISS BRIANNA got away well, pressed the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, drifted six wide into upper stretch, faltered
and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MRS. C AGAINST SWEEPING PASSION ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.
