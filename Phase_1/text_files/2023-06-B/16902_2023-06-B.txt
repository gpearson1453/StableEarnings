ANA L broke sharply from the gate and dropped back quickly, moved up on the two path and angled four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the
stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. SHE'D RATHER DANCE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off inside the furlong marker,
then was no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. BETHPAGE well placed, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide
into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. ORPHAN EXCHANGE rated inside, raced boxed through the turn, waited, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch and weakened the final furlong. LUMI tracked the pace in the early going, moved up to stalk that one through the turn, bid outside into the stretch
and weakened the final furlong. LILLI ROSE bumped and steadied at the start, looped to position three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and was empty. CAIRO WINNER was no factor. PAULIES ANGEL was never involved.

Footnotes
LAWN DART rated close up, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged
ahead inside the furlong marker and lasted. ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, then made a steady gain and missed. ODD GAL allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
angled out for clear racing room, was blocked late, split rivals and missed. SO MOXIE mid pack, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and weakened late. PLATINUM SKY mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and evened
out. PEEP'S DAY allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled in and passed tiring rivals.
DANCE OR STROLL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and flattened out. EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted
to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded late. UP IN ARMS was no factor, widest. SONG OF INDY well
placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.
