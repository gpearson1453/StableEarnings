Footnotes
TOSKA'S RULER vied inside of TIN BADGE in early stages, shook free from rival late on the backstretch, held clear still unleashed around the turn, saved
ground entering the lane, roused for more in upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve, quickly widened advantage, stayed inside and kept to task under a
mild drive. WAR RON tracked the top pair up the backstretch, hustled along three wide midway around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and secured
second best. SHIP BOSS sat back just off the pace in early stages, hustled along four wide around the turn, kept on into the lane and captured show.
SECRET BLARNEY raced in the last flight through early stages, launched a three to four wide bid around the turn, continued to chase in range through the
stretch run but needed more for late impact. TIN BADGE vied outside of the eventual winner in early stages, remained up close around the turn then gave
way mid-stretch. SCRUTINIZER raced in range along the inside around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, lacked response when called upon and
steadily weakened.

Footnotes
KINGSWOOD was off to a good start and vied outside of GOLDEN LUNA with rival holding a slight edge up the backstretch, was ridden along to continue
matching strides around the turn, continued to battle with GOLDEN LUNA down the stretch run, dug in determinedly, refused to be denied and edged away
in final strides. GOLDEN LUNA came away in good order and vied inside of KINGSWOOD up the backstretch, held a slight edge over rival around the turn,
raced shoulders apart in the final furlong, fought on gamely but got edged out in final strides. CHARMING CHARLIE was unhurried out of the gate and
angled inside to save ground, remained well off the pace up the backstretch, began to pick up the tempo late on the far turn, swung three to four wide into
the lane and finished with response. WHEELER DEALER tracked the embattled pair three wide up the backstretch, urged along the inside around the far
turn, saved ground entering the lane and came up empty mid-stretch.

Footnotes
SURPRISE ROAD TRIP roused forward to take a slim lead leaving the backstretch, vied inside of DAWSON'S STORM around the turn, shook free entering
the lane, cleared command in upper stretch and held firm under steady encouragement. DAWSON'S STORM advanced to challenge for the lead leaving the
backstretch, vied with the eventual winner around the turn, could not maintain equal terms entering the head of the lane but sustained a solid bid and
cleared second best. KISSED A CADET raced off the early leaders, swung five wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer and captured show. LIL
SCREECHER briefly held the lead then came under pressure and steadied slightly along the inside nearing the three eighths pole, weakened then launched
an inside rebid entering the lane, moved up closer to the eighth pole then evened out late and lost show. SPECIALSORTASTORM came away awkward
and slow at the start, hustled up into contention midway around the turn, swung four wide into the lane then tired in the final furlong. STROLLER BOY was
off slow at the start, moved into range around the turn then lacked a needed rally in the lane. JUPITER MISSION lacked speed, raced in the back and failed
to move into contention.

lead midway around the far turn, took over a slim lead at the head of the lane, continued with a narrow advantage, came under right handed pressure,
responded gamely, dug in and kicked clear. WOKE UP IN LOVE saved ground around the first turn and settled off the early pace, picked up the tempo

second best. MAHOMES set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with SIR WALLY WALLY around the far turn, fought back to the eighth
pole then flattened out and just lasted for show. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND was well reserved racing in the back, swung five wide into the lane and improved
position. SHIPS ON FIRE raced near midpack through early stages, hustled along three wide around the far turn, edged up closer near the eighth pole then
gave way. LATE FOR LUNCH settled along the inside early on, saved ground around the far turn, urged up the inside but failed to move on. MR. SOLO

Footnotes
BLAZE AWAY N HIDE broke on top then conceded position to SHEMEANSBUISNESS soon after the start, was well placed tracking three to four wide just
off the top trio, let out a notch midway around the far turn, loomed up closer at the quarter pole, got carried out five wide entering the lane, shifted in a
couple paths, took over the lead, widened advantage and kept to task under confident handling. MY GOLDEN DAY was allowed to settle off the pace up the
backstretch, picked up the tempo late on the far turn, got carried out wide, shifted in three wide and finished with good response. SAMIRA rated off the top
flight in early stages, saved ground around the far turn, cut the corner and given cue along the rail, moved up into closer contention and captured show.
SHEMEANSBIZNESS took over a slim lead soon after the start and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, continued under pressure around the far turn,
got collared by eventual winner in upper stretch, flattened in late stages and got nipped for show. INTERSTELLA was unhurried and saved ground through
early stages, launched a rail bid in upper stretch, showed interest but needed more for serious impact. MISS PEACH raced off the early pace, swung four to
five wide into the lane, improved position but lacked a needed rally to threaten. FLAT OUT STORMIN rated near midpack up the backstretch, hustled along
two wide around the turn, stayed in the mix to the furlong marker then flattened out. BOSSY MOMENT raced off the pace, swung wide into the lane and
failed to rally. KELA'S TURN raced in range two to three wide up the backstretch, flattened out midway around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
ANGEL'S MELODY pressed the pace two wide up the backstretch, remained up close around the far turn then came up empty in the final furlong.
