Footnotes
JUBA'S NOTION rated a short lead inside, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, raced clear at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady
stretch encouragement and just lasted. NAPA VALLEY was strung five wide on the opening turn, left the turn outside and bid leaving the three eighths pole,
raced close in the four path on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second while gaining on the winner. SPUNMAN saved ground, bid leaving the
three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. VIOLENT ROCK stalked four wide on the first turn, left the
turn toward the outside and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. MACHEN'S
RIDGE became a bit edgy in the gate then stalked two deep, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, altered course from
the heels of rivals mid-stretch but flattened the remaining sixteenth. FEARNOUGHT raced three wide on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. RUN TO DAYLIGHT was strung six wide into the first turn, moved in a bit leaving
the turn but showed little response through the backstretch.

SMALL PAW bobbled then exchanged contact with Jubay leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and challenged J. WICK leaving the turn,
dug in determinedly through the final furlong and eked out the nod in later yards. The latter set a pressured pace, contested the rail on the turn, dug in
gamely leaving the turn but relented the nod through later yards. JUBAY exchanged contact with Small Paw leaving the gate then picked up the chase
outside, raced in the five path on the turn and came along for third later yards. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the
three path on the turn then flattened later yards. WINDSOR'S STAR pressured the early pace, raced off the rail on the turn then weakened the final
sixteenth. BOO TOO pressured the pace inside but dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and weakened in the lane. KING KJARTAN saved ground.
The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of J. Wick for alleged interference on the turn, lodged by the rider of Windsor's Star.

JUBA'S PARADE raced with the pace two deep and moved to even terms into the backstretch and kept the edge over SHEWEARSSTILETTOS from that
point, drew clear past the quarter pole, was urged away at the rail on the far turn then steadily handled in the lane. The latter rated a slim lead inside, was
met into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, dropped back past the quarter pole and had to settle for second best. MEGEEZER ducked out
leaving the gate then rated close in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed
little in the lane. LIME STAR rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed
little more. WOODEN SHIPS rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

C R'S MANDATE rated a slim lead off the rail, contested even terms at the rail on the second turn, was met into the backstretch and stalked from that point,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, was carried out entering the stretch, dug in to recover the advantage past the
eighth pole, raced clear mid-stretch and held on well. WHAT DOES IT TAKE settled just off the pace in the three and four paths, took the nod three wide
past the half mile pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn, was caught past the eighth pole and relented the final sixteenth.
NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES lunged at the break then stalked from the two and three paths, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail, dueled through the stretch and just lasted for third. CHROME HEIR settled back off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole,
improved in the three path on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and ran evenly through the stretch. ROYAL PAIN rated close to the early pace inside,
eased out leaving the second turn and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. LOKOYA ROAD
was not a factor. ARISTOCAT had a brief early lead then stayed with the early pace, raced at even terms two deep on the second turn but faded through the
backstretch.

Footnotes
UNUSUALLY LUCKY got loose in the post parade and came away awkwardly, rounded the opening turn about the four path, started a bid into the
backstretch and steadily improved, raced in the four path on the far turn and dug in to get up the final yards. FAR MORE raced in the six path the first turn,
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, dueled to a brief late lead but was caught the final yards. XTENDED
STREAK took the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, widened through the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in under steady
handling leaving the turn but was caught flattening stride inside the sixteenth pole. CANDY LOVES HONEY was shuffled back early and rounded the
opening turn off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. UNALTERED
moved to the inside past the five eighths pole and stalked into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail past
the five sixteenths. VIESTE rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. WORM
raced off the pace inside on the first turn then faded through the backstretch.
