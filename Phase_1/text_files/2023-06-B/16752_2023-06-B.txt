Footnotes
GROVELAND was rated along the inside, advanced on the turn while saving, tipped out two wide leaving the turn for aim of the front runner, made a bid and
drew clear late under a mild drive. DANCE SOME MO set the pace on the inside and was well handled, was clear off the turn but was caught late, second
best. STAR NATION was void of early speed, came five wide into the lane and had a late rally on the outside to gain the show award. PATH TO SUCCESS
was off slowly, reserved and four wide on the backstretch, then was four wide by the quarter pole and had a mild gain to just miss the show award.
MCMONEY was settled two wide, advanced on the turn two wide, then dropped to the inside off the turn and weakened. BLAME SHIFTER was reserved
early and failed to menace. SLAVA UKRAINI stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but tired in the lane.
