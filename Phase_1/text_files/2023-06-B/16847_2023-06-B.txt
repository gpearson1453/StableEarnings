YOUONLYLIVETWICE saved ground stalking the pace, angled out two-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught BELLS AND WHISTLES to take the lead
nearing the sixteenth pole and won drawing clear. BELLS AND WHISTLES opened a clear lead shortly after the start, saved ground setting the pace,
responded when challenged and while unable to resist the winner held on gamely for the place. SASSY EINSTEIN was unhurried early, came five-wide into
the stretch and finished in a mild rally. YELLEN saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out for the drive but lacked a rally. GOLD ROSE
was forwardly placed for a half mile while two-wide and weakened. LAKER JET was prominently placed for three furlongs while three-wide, gave way badly
and was pulled up nearing the wire and walked off following the race.

STAND TO prompted the pace set by THE THIRD RING while racing two-wide, took the lead from that one leaving the quarter pole and then was fully
extended to prevail narrowly. PISTOL POWER saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, rallied three-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to
just miss. WESTPHAL was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. THE THIRD RING saved ground setting the pace for
a half mile and weakened. MARCH ON LINCH broke in the air to get away behind his field, raced three-wide on the turn and lacked a rally. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CANDIED LUTE saved ground stalking ROUSING RUBBLE, angled to the outside of that one nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead approaching the
eighth pole and gradually drew clear. ROUSING RUBBLE saved ground setting the pace, was unable to resist the winner during the drive but continued on
well for the place. HULA KING saved ground while being forwardly placed but lacked a rally. ARTHUR SPOONER stumbled at the start, then moved up
between horses on the turn, was four-wide entering the stretch and improved his position. BENNY THE JET was reserved off the early pace while saving
ground and went evenly. DEMOCRAT was prominently placed early while racing three-wide and weeakened. SENOR FABULOSO dropped back early and
was not a factor.

GOAT ROCKS opened clear early, saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. CHROME'S BEST COPY saved ground chasing the
winner, angled out for the drive and finished well for the place in a steady effot. CLASSY CANDY was prominently placed while saving ground and finished
in a mild rally. GOIN' COASTAL was unhurried early, rallied along the inside into the stretch, angled out nearing the eighth pole and was gaining slightly
late. RAVEN'S QUEST broke out then was forwardly placed while racing two-wide and weakened. SHORT JOURNEY was off a step slow and failed to
seriously menace. DISTINCTIVE DEB broke in, then showed brief speed racing three-wide and gave way after three furlongs. MALICE TOWARD NONE
settled in the middle of the field but lacked a rally. EISEN was pinched back from between horses shortly after the start and failed to threaten.

MARY WALKER dueled with MISS ACCELERATE for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear.
SCATALICIOUS was forwardly placed from the start, came three-wide into the stretch and finished well for second in a steady effort. MISS ACCELERATE
dueled for the lead from along the outside, could not stay with the winner late but held on for the show. SHE SAID MY WAY saved ground while being
unhurried, angled out for room nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining late. LASSIE CAT settled in the middle of the field, came three-wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. I AM YOURS was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LUCINDA RELLA prompted the issue
while racing three-wide but lacked a response. SIGNATURE COLORS was close up early racing along the inside and gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
ROYAL CANDY vied with SPARKS FLYIN for the lead from along the outside, shook that one off nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. SPARKS
FLYIN dueled with the winner into the stretch, was no match for that one but was clearly second best. CASH'S CAT saved ground chased the leaders,
angled out for the drive and while unable to threaten the top two finished willingly for the show. CRAWLINGBACKTOYOU was allowed to settle in stride,
came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. GOOD DANNY broke out sharply then dropped well back and failed to menace.
