SALUTE THE KID stalked the pace four wide down the backstretch, rallied three wide into the turn, made the lead at the five sixteenths pole, set the
balance of the pace and drew off under left handed urging. KAT TRAX sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set the pace until midway
on the turn, kept pressure into the stretch and held on for second. SECRETS UNTOLD offered a mild bid two wide into the stretch then leveled off.
BEAUTIFUL LASS unhurried early, swung wide and closed some ground late in the middle of the racetrack. CRIMSON LEGION slow early, found her best
stride late along the rail. I'M JAC'D failed to menace. TITEBLUEJEANS was no threat. KISS VALENTINA pressed the early pace three then two wide and
was through after half. FRIENDLY MERGER had brief speed, stopped and was eased to the wire. VILLAGE CAT pressed the early pace two wide, stopped
on the turn and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
EXCITEMENT stalked the pace through the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead past the furlong marker and drew off under right handed urging. FLAG
RAISER away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. CASUAL ATTIRE unhurried early, had a
mild late rally three wide. CHOCOLATE RABBIT well placed, went evenly. PROSECUTOR pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and weakened late.
PRECIOUS JULES was no factor. MARCH MAGIC was through early. ORLEANS STORM reared at the start, was never close, lost contact with his field
and was distanced. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW TOOK NO ACTION.
