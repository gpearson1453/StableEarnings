Footnotes
FIRST TO LAST set the pace on the inside, was pressed along on the backside, responded when asked on the far turn, shook free from DAGDA, drew off,
widened in the lane, was ridden out and in hand late. DAGDA stalked early on, pressed the pacesetter on the backside, chased that rival on the far turn,
was no match and then well clear for place honors. SOCIAL JOE trailed the field, closed belatedly and earned the show spot. SETTE STELLE raced off the
pace inside, chased on the far turn and failed to threaten. SEAX settled off the leaders, chased those rivals on the far turn, lacked a response and tired.
LUNAR GHOST raced two wide off the pace, three wide at the half mile marker and gave way. DEPUTY DONNIE raced off the pace inside, then two wide
and gave way.
