the stretch and ran on for place spot while no match. GIGGLIN KATE lunged at the start, raced back to turn while running on willingly for the show spot.
JUST ZOEY pressed from inside briefly, leveled off with no late response in the stretch run. LATE DATE stumbled badly at the start, lost best chance and
never factored thereafter. RUBY LAYNE inside speed from the gate, led to the stretch but stopped readily in the final furlong with a bad sted and returned
bleeding from the nostrils and walked off on her own. GIMME CLEARANCE bottled up badly from the gate and never menaced throughout.
