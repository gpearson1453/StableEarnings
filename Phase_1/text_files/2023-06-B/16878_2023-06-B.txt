Footnotes
CHANGEORDERSONNY stalked in the four path, bid between foes rounding the far turn, was driven from the four path into the lane, sustained that bid and
dueled with the inner leader down the lane, and was up in the final strides. ARAK popped the gate open during the load, but broke well and travelled up
close under a hold along the inside around the first turn, tipped out to the three path into the backstretch, bid between foes into the far turn, led into the final
quarter, dug in to hold on to the lead and dueled with an outer foe from the three path down the stretch, but was worn down and caught in the final strides to
place. COOL MEMORY set the pace around the two path, was put to a ride entering the far turn, lost the lead approaching the quarter, but fought on along
the inside down the stretch to hold show. VANISHING INTEREST chased into the two path, was roused into the far turn, angled out to the five path in upper
stretch, and was gaining late. MUFRIH brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path, ranged up in the five path around the far turn, tipped
out to the six path into the lane, but flattened. ENSIGN SKIP brushed with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, advanced while tipping to the rail
into the far turn, but weakened into the stretch. GUSTAVOR always trailed around the four and five paths.

GENTLE BREEZE set the pace in the two path, drew off under minimal urging, continued on the left lead to the midstretch then widened handily. NO
PROBLEM JOE veered in at start, saved ground off the early pace, moved up between rival around the turn, lugged in nearing the eighth pole and stayed
on to be clearly second best. TISHA raced off the pace three wide, lacked a rally and was along for the show. Z RACES prompted the winner in the three
path and faltered in the stretch. KINGY was in tight soon after the start, saved ground in range and had no response. WE GOT THIS had only brief speed
four wide.

Footnotes
DIVINE EXCHANGE trailed in the three path early, circled inner foes in the five path around the far turn, commenced a rally from said position into the lane,
and was driven past the inner leader in the final sixteenth to win. MORNING COLORS set an open pace in the four path, went out to the five path down the
backside, tipped in the two path and was roused early around the far turn, received a right handed cue from the three path at the top of the lane, began to
shorten stride to be caught passing the sixteenth pole, and held place. TAPPLE CIDER chased in the four path, was coaxed in the three path early around
the far turn, swung out to the six path for the stretch run, and was up for show. DOMINEERING was held up along the inside of rivals early, put to a nudge
into the far turn, but flattened along the inside down the lane. HARDLY SOCIAL tracked between foes in the two path but made no impact. ALA TURKA
rated in the three path early but failed to menace.

Footnotes
TWIRLING GRACE set the pace along the rail, dueled inside of PROVACATIVA around the turn, shook clear from that foe in upper stretch, drifted out a bit
late and held safe under a drive. DISCO QUEEN stalked the pace three wide, couldn't quite keep pace around the turn, stayed on outside and was gaining
fast in the final yards. PROVOCATIVA raced a bit off the early pace between foes, reached near even terms near the half-mile marker, dueled outside of the
winner from there to upper stretch then weakened. MUDSHAFT angled out and bumped KATIESDREAMGIRL near the three-quarters pole, chase the pace
two wide two wide and was one-paced through the lane. REYNA DE VERANO was outrun inside. SWEET ACTRESS raced in range four wide and came up
empty in the lane. KATIESDREAMGIRL was bumped and checked near the six-furlong marker, raced five wide around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CHAOS set the pace in the two path, was driven around the turn, floated out to the four path into the lane, opened slightly passing the eighth
pole, began to shorten stride late, but held on. CAN'T BE BROKEN tracked in the three path, was cued while swinging out to the eight path into the stretch,
and ran on for place. LOVE SPELL prompted the pace in the four path, bid into the turn, was roused nearing the quarter, but finished evenly from the six
path down the lane to show. BERNARDO'S LEGACY stalked inside, but lost ground around the turn, and was one paced. LUSCIOUS DANCER chased in
the four path but made no impact around the six path down the lane. ADIOS YOUR HONOR steadied passing the five-eighths, raced off the pace in the two
path but did not threaten. DOUBLE DOWN DENNIS was wellback in the three path but never menaced. JUSTICE TIME brushed the side of the gate, trailed
in the five path, lost the whip midway around the turn, and was no factor.

Footnotes
CAPE TRAFALGAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, gradually advanced to take the lead from the two path passing the five-eighths pole, tipped to the
rail and was nudged along early around the turn, opened up from the two path in upper stretch, and was driven out. SEDONA RED prompted the pace
between foes in the three path, bid rounding the turn, but was repelled from the five path in upper stretch to place. ALEXANDER HELIOS chased in the five
path, was pushed along into the stretch, and was along for show. BLACK FURY led in the five path early, was overtaken by an inner foe passing the
five-eighths and pressed from there, received a right handed cue rounding the turn, but flattened while floating out to the eight path in upper stretch.
STRAPPED bumped with an outer foe at the start, then tipped outward and trailed from the six path into the turn, was under a drive in the three path around
the turn, and did not threaten from the five path down the lane. ACQUISITIVE tracked between in the four path, was in the two path around the turn, but
came up empty in the stretch. RIVERBOAT RICHIE was held up along the inside early but never menaced.

Footnotes
DREAMSTER settled off the pace outside, made good progress four wide around the turn, swept to the front in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
ONE OF ONE dueled inside to upper stretch, could not match strides with winner but fended off of the rest to hold the place. MILLIE (CHI) had early speed
three wide, dropped back under urging around the turn, angled widest in upper stretch and kept on to gain the show. QUALY dueled three wide to upper
stretch and weakened. SIMPLIFY (ARG) had her head turned at the start, advanced between foes down the backstretch, dueled two wide between around
the turn and tired in the stretch. JOYA DEL SUR trailed inside.

Footnotes
JAN'S GIRL was unhurried in the two path, waited for room early around the far turn, was coaxed between foes passing the quarter and bid while being
carried out to the seven path into the lane, and inched past an inner rival passing the eighth pole. TOWSER stalked in the three path, bid between foes
around the far turn, led passing the quarter, was cued while drifting out to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on, but was caught passing the eighth
pole to place. ON ALERT rated in the three path, was driven in the four path around the far turn, cued from the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on
between foes for show. PRINCIPIA tracked in the four path, was ridden around the far turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch, and flattened.
DAMASO prompted the pace in the two path, bid from the rail around the far turn, but faded down the lane. ROMAN FLAME was sent to set the pace in the
four path, ridden from the two path into the far turn, and yielded passing the quarter.
