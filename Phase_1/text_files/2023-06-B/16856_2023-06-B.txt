Footnotes
BROTHER CONWAY , three wide chasing the duel around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, went clear in mid stretch, drifted in slightly near the
sixteenth pole and lasted. GRAND ESCAPE dueled outside MOCEPHUS around the turn, steadied on the heels of the winner when drifting out near the
sixteenth pole, altered farther out and closed late. LORD UHTRED saved ground on the turn while well off the duel, swung to the four path in upper stretch
and lacked the needed rally. DESPITE ODDS , no factor, swung to the five path turning for home. MOCEPHUS showed speed along the inner rail, dueled to
upper stretch, faltered and was eased. An objection by the rider of GRAND ESCAPE against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch drive was not
allowed.

Footnotes
SUMMER SILENCE vied three deep under rating, shook clear leaving the three eighths pole, widened a bit entering the lane, kept on under solid asks past
mid stretch, turned away a threat to the inside past the sixteenth marker, edged back away and held firm to the wire. BAIL OUT rated inside while not far off
a three pronged pace scrum, edged up into the far turn, eased out to advance between rivals near the five sixteenths, dropped back in soon into the lane,
challenged inside the winner near mid stretch, kept on willingly and saved the place. MOON SIGN , taken to rate towards the rail soon after the break, raced
in the clear into the backstretch then angled out to advance past the five eighths, gained between runners approaching the quarter pole, angled out five
wide in upper stretch and closed steadily. LIGHTNING LAD settled off the pace while saving some ground, worked between foes in the drive and churned
on. TIZ TACT TOE , forwardly placed between rivals, edged up to have aim three wide into the stretch but one paced through the final furlong. BOFFO KID
vied between rivals from the first turn to the far turn, shifted in to pursue leaving the three eighths and faded in the final furlong. THE THINKER lagged back
while saving ground, angled three wide leaving the far turn, gained a bit into the stretch, swung out wider past mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain.
SHEER ELEMENT , three deep stalking, drifted wider under pressure past the three eighths and gave way. MARCUS JUNIUS got engaged in a duel inside
rivals soon after the start, stayed on to the far turn then steadied when beginning a retreat. ESPRESSO LUNGO dropped well off the pace early on, saved
ground and was outrun.

DANCER'S MELODY showed speed along the inner rail, dueled around the turn, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and lasted. DULCE KIARA saved
ground around the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the three path in upper stretch and rallied. MISS CASEY circled foes on the turn, was four deep
entering the stretch, floated further out in upper stretch and had a mild gain. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY , three wide chasing the pace to the stretch, failed to
rally. MY JUBA disputed the pace outside the winner and weakened the final furlong. CARTWHEEL , sluggish early, raced in the two path on the turn while
outrun. KATY THE CAT hugged the inner rail around the turn while outrun. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL , four deep on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
BOURBON READY tracked the dueling leaders while saving ground, eased out a bit into the lane, edged up under solid asks leaving mid stretch, shifted out
further for the final sixteenth, sustained under steady handling and forged ahead late. SHARP RED EAGLE , keen to go, took command and secured the
inside, was joined by ROAN BURGUNDY in the opening furlong, sparred under rating, shook clear in upper stretch, remained clear under a drive past mid
stretch, wandered outward in the final seventy yards, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner's charge. IMAGINE IT ALL broke inward
tightening foes, corrected and settled in the clear and off the embattled leaders, gathered momentum mid turn and circled four wide, ranged up in mid
stretch to loom and continued on with effort to the wire. ROAN BURGUNDY joined SHARP RED EAGLE from the outside soon after the break, disputed the
pace to upper stretch, wandered outward with pursuit past mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. QUINCANNON , bumped and steadied when in tight at the
break, raced between foes heading to the turn, angled out for the drive but failed to menace. GOLQUIST , off the duel and outside a rival, moved up some
between foes nearing the lane then came up empty. MUNGO MAGIC , bumped and steadied at the break, saved ground off the pace and failed to threaten.
CELTIC SEA was outrun.

Footnotes
CHARGE TO VICTORY saved ground around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, gained the lead outside horses in mid stretch and was under
mostly hand urging. RIDICULOUS lacked speed, came into the stretch in the four path, floated out in mid stretch and rallied outside rivals. ALBERTANO
lacked speed along the inner rail around the turn, moved to the two path in upper stretch, raced inside horses and passed tired ones. FREE SQUARE , keen
to go down the backstretch, was kept well off the inner rail around the turn and in the stretch and tired. HOT N SPICY LOVE lacked speed, raced in the two
path on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. MUCHACHO MACHO , three wide on the turn, chased the pace to mid
stretch and gave way. SPOTTED BULL , along the inner rail throughout, was well placed turning for home and gave way. SAVOY , four deep on the turn,
faltered.

Footnotes
TUFANI , patiently handled while saving ground in mid pack, took closer order into the lane, responded to repeated right handed asks leaving the three
sixteenths, surged to the inside of TEQUILERA to take command leaving the sixteenth marker then drew clear under a steady hand ride. TEQUILERA
cleared early and set a rated pace towards the inside, met an outside challenge from THISNAMEISOKAY around the far turn, kept that one at bay till the
quarter pole, kicked away after being set down in upper stretch, wandered outward in mid stretch, corrected and was joined nearing the sixteenth pole then
kept on with good effort to be second best. THISNAMEISOKAY prompted the pace outside the leader, moved to engage around the far turn, pressed the
pace into the lane then gave way grudgingly. DANCING TIL DUSK settled off the pace while saving ground, worked outward for the final furlong and had
belated action. DAILY PLANET , unhurried early while saving ground, cut the corner following the winner into the lane and past mid stretch, could not go
with that one but kept on with some interest. CONTINENTALCONGRES , in the clear stalking the leaders, had aim three wide under coaxing into the
stretch, was laying in some near mid stretch and faded. CHELICHNA , in a bit tight into the first turn, saved ground off the pace, stayed inside into the lane
but lacked a serious rally. GALILEI , three to four wide, failed to respond. CECILITA rated off heels early, lost ground four wide into the first turn, was
pushed along past the five eighths and failed to rally. NICOLAR lagged back off the pace, came five wide for the drive and lacked a punch.

Footnotes
LUIGI'S SPIRIT , rated behind horses around the turn, eased out to the five path at the head of the stretch, was floated to the eight path near the eighth
pole, closed and led late. SEA TRIDENT set the pace two wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and impeded TRASH TALKING LARRY when drifting
out near the sixteenth pole. AWARD NOMINATED , well placed in the two path on the turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch and rallied between
horses. BRILLIANT ICE , always along the inner rail, was in striking position in mid stretch but failed to rally in an even effort. TRASH TALKIN LARRY
circled the turn three deep, floated to the four path turning for home and flattened out after being carried out and struck on the face with the whip of SEA
TRIDENT's rider near the sixteenth pole. STEADY JOHN saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and came up empty. SEA GHOST
lacked speed, circled turn three wide, angled to the eight path for room near the eighth pole and passed tired foes. UNION FLEET bumped with NEW YORK
PANTHER at the start, entered the stretch in the four path, raced between horses and failed to rally. NEW YORK PANTHER bumped at the start, moved up
four deep into the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of TRASH TALKIIN
LARRY, SEA TRIDENT was disqualified and placed fifth.

Footnotes
DOCTOR JEFF , nudged to the front, was nicely rated towards the inside, handled outside pressure past the three eighths, spurted away after being set
down two wide in upper stretch, kept on under right handed asks through the final furlong and held firm. STREET COPPER stalked the pace outside rivals,
circled four wide advancing into the lane, gave game chase from there and slowly bridged the gap. ROCK THE BOAT had speed to the inside of the winner,
rated back off that one then steadied briefly around the far turn, tracked while saving ground into the lane and continued on with effort. MAYA PRINCE
broke a step slow, steadied off foes nearing the turn, rated outside a rival mid turn, shifted out some and made mild progress past mid stretch, switched over
to his left lead with a sixteenth remaining and flattened out. HUNTER JOE saved ground, worked outward through the final furlong and had a mild response.
MINISTER FOR MAGIC prompted the pace outside the winner, saw that one get away leaving the quarter pole, chased between foes in mid stretch and
faded.

Footnotes
THE LAST SCIP stalked the pace along the inner rail, steadied in tight quarters approaching the stretch, angled off the rail in mid stretch, split foes and
drove clear. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE stalked the pace racing near the inner rail, remained inside horses in upper stretch, swung to the five path approaching
the eighth pole and rallied outside the winner. SEVILLE ROW lacked speed, was well off the rail on the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and
rallied outside horses. SMITTEN ENOUGH chased the pace outside AESTHETICALLY, gained a short lead in mid stretch and weakened. BODE LYNX
lacked speed, raced inside horses to the stretch, swung very wide in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. AESTHETICALLY , clear soon after the break,
set the pace near the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. PRINCE OF CAPS , three wide the first turn, moved to the rail leaving the far turn and was
checked lacking room near the sixteenth pole. TITRATE , four wide the first turn, offered a mild, four wide advance on the far turn then faded. PRINCE OF
PORTLAND , three wide both turns, chased the pace and weakened. HONOR MY WORLD dwelt when acting up at the break then trailed. There was a
stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.
