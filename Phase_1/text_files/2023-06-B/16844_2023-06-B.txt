Footnotes
DUBLSHOTOFCOURAGE was quick to begin to set the early pace, raced well clear near the eighth pole and prevailed late under strong pressure. JOEY
TICKLES chased the early leader, surged in the final stages and just missed in a game effort while racing from the outside. LUIS ALBERTO chased the
pace from the outside to race well off the inside and had not enough in the drive for the top pair. LEE ALEJANDRO was hustled along from the inside and
never was a factor. LINE BY LINE was coaxed along from the inside and lacked a bid. A B C YA was coaxed along and tired readily.

SACRED UNION stalked the pace from the outside of rivals, made a three wide bid near the three eighths pole, raced off the inside in the stretch and held
gamely to prove best under strong handling. SEIVER was off a step slow, dropped back early on to race near the back of the pack, moved up to improve
position through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch, shifted in deep stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. REACHING STRIDE settled off
the early going, advanced near the quarter pole from the inside, moved up in the stretch run near the rail and improved position. OJITOS BELLOS stalked
the pace from the outside of rivals, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly late with no closing run. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS was
off a step slow, raced six wide past the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. BOHEMIA BABE pressed the pace from the outside of foe and faded.

LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT showed good early foot from the inside to set the pace and drew off late to be clear under strong pressure. DAILY BRIEFING
settled off the early going, moved up through the far turn from the outside of rivals, angled widest through the stretch run and rallied for the place position.
SOME IS NINE chased the pace three deep early on, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, angled out and flattened in the drive with no closing run
in the stretch. ROSY APPLE pressed the early leader from the outside and weakened in the stretch run while racing off the inside. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL
dropped back early and failed to respond.

MINEOLA MIKE showed good early foot to set the early pace between rivals into the backstretch, took command near the five sixteenths pole and drew off
to be well clear under steady handling. DOUBLE O OTTO prompt the pace from the outside of rivals, took aim into the far turn, kept on but was no match for
the winner. LOGAN'S RUNNER raced in tight quarters early on, was along the inside down the backstretch, shifted out to race six wide into the upper
stretch and raced evenly late. FOREVER SAUCY race five wide around the first turn, stalked pace from the outside and tired. FLEETS BAY prompt the
pace from the inside and tired. MAYBE IT'S TIME pressed the early pace and tired readily.

RAGTIME BELLE was off slowly, rated along the inside under a firm hold, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole to challenge for the lead and kept
strongly to prevail under steady handling. GYPSY QUEEN rated two wide from the outside of rivals, led through the far turn, dug in through the stretch drive
to come on again and just missed in a game effort. DETERMINED EMPIRE sowed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and weakened in
the drive. MOST DIVINE dropped back off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. KOBE'S SMILE stalked the pace from the
outside, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.
