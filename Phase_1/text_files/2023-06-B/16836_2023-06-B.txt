Footnotes
KNOW HOW (GB) got away well then settled in to stalk off the leader racing outside, went three to four wide on the turn and was niggled along past the
five-sixteenths, put to more stout urging at the top of the stretch, gained steadily taking the lead seventy yards out and cleared. DIXIE MORNING was
unhurried at the rear but not too far off the pace, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, asked for more coming past the quarter pole, gained late to
get up for second but needed more. SPEEDY RIVER bobbled slightly at the start but quickly recovered and moved clear willingly, dictated terms racing off
the rail while under a hold from the rider, asked to kick on reaching upper stretch, faltered and faded late. EXECUTIVE EFFECT tracked from inside, came
out a bit late on the turn then back to the rail in upper stretch, finished up with interest along the rail. WAR'S END KISS stalked in behind and between
runners, went two to three wide on the turn and stretch, failed to rally. SO BREANNA tracked in behind two wide early, moved nearer the rail late on the
turn, had no rally.

Footnotes
DE ONLY SOLUTION tracked four wide on the first turn, was reined in off the three horse pace scenario at the half mile marker, burst between runners in
the four path straightening out for the drive and finished best accelerating away under mild urging in deep stretch. SPEEDY LYNN stalked near the back of
the pack down the backstretch, began to pick up horses with five sixteenths to go outside, loomed six wide for the stretch drive but was outrun in deep
stretch by the winner. TWISTED PATH travelled three wide in the middle of the pack in the beginning, was in the mix between runners for the front at the
half, bid three wide outside rivals two furlongs from home, had a brief lead in upper stretch, could not hold off the outside closers at the eighth pole and still
battled on to hold for the show award in the end. BLOCKBUSTER took this field on the rail into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow lead down the
back straight, continued up front but was hounded outside on the final turn and faded on the fence at the furlong marker to settle for a minor share.
KITTEN'S BOY trailed the field in the early stages, saved ground inside into the far turn, angled out widest in the seven path seeing the field turning for
home and was one paced to the wire. PAPA'S PLACE had a good position nestled behind the pacesetter down the backside, shifted off the fence midway
on the final turn, could not quicken with others four deep at the top of the stretch and tired in the final furlong. FIFTH SEASON stalked four wide into the first
turn, offered an early move pressing for the lead three deep at the half, began to give way up front between runners at the quarter pole and retreated in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
CRASH THE CREASE was well-placed tracking near the hedge in behind the leaders mid-pack, was bumped lightly up the backstretch, bided time in
behind runners turning for home, moved nearer the rail in upper stretch, bid inside past the furlong marker, moved clear and held. WAHRER SCHATZ broke
a step slowly, moved up to race outside the trailing group, went four to five wide on the turn shifting six deep into upper stretch and gaining on the leaders,
drifted out a bit then back in through upper stretch, took the lead nearing the furlong marker, was soon overtaken and outkicked but second best. HIGH
TREASON settled three to four deep in the early going racing at the back, eased back and shifted in heading into the turn, saved ground on that bend
trailing the field, came out four wide in upper stretch, faced traffic and steadied slightly past the furlong marker, managed to split rivals past the sixteenth
pole and secured show honors. BLONDE DYNAMO moved forward to press the pace inside the leader but still off the hedge racing in the two path coming
to the six- and one-half, took the lead by the five- and one-half, was pressured through the turn still racing off the inside, drifted out and in a bit through the
stretch while weakening. TURF AND SURF broke inwardly and awkwardly, was in tight along the inside early so switched out and advanced between
runners but faced traffic, exchanged some light bumps and was in tight near the six- and one-half marker, lacked room through much of the turn in between
and behind runners, came out in the stretch six wide for room and ran on but with too much to do. DANISH DYNAMITE stalked, advanced four wide on the
turn, struck the lead past the quarter but could not sustain the effort, flattened out. NAVY BLUE ANGEL set the early tempo racing well removed from the
hedge, was pressured by an inside foe racing three wide into the turn, faded in the stretch while in a bit tight at times due to a drifting rival.

Footnotes
ALLEN DIGGS took command from the onset, repelled an early outside challenge by the five sixteenths pole, opened up on rivals straightening out for the
finish, kept to the task to the wire and held clear crossing the line. WALTER ME LAD was near the rear tracking the leader four wide at the three furlong
marker, rallied around horses at the quarter pole, bid six wide at the top of the lane, could not gain on the winner throughout the stretch and settled for the
runner up position in the end. MR NARCISSISTIC was bumped inside on the break, settled three wide in mid pack tracking in the second flight down the
backstretch, was ridden for more four deep two furlongs from home, was in the hunt between in upper stretch and determinedly battled on to the wire dead
heating for third in the end. PRINCE SUSSEX was unhurried early getting to the inside trailing the field down the backside, offered a bold move on the fence
midway on the far turn, had clear run up the rail with three sixteenths to go but needed more late finishing on the wrong lead to the wire. MENDELJOHN
(IRE) had a good spot on the rail watching the co-leaders with a half mile remaining, was ridden three wide at the quarter marker to be in range turning for
home but stalled in the final sixteenth. LUV TO WIN broke out at the start, was under a snug hold tracking between rivals four furlongs from home, showed
little interest when roused three furlongs from the finish and made no impact through the stretch. ROLLING HILLS made an early move pressing for the lead
three wide at the half, could not keep up with the winner midpoint on the turn and stopped with horses on either side at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND LIFE moved quickly to the lead facing moderate early pressure from outside, moved clear by the half, widened into upper stretch, held safe.
MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN settled off the pace, circled past a trio of rivals five wide turning into upper stretch, had aim on the winner but could only close the gap
while second best. BOSS HOLIDAY got away well, pressed the early pace, continued to chase two to three wide on the turn, was no match for the top pair
but best of the rest. MIA AND ME was fractious in the gate, brushed lightly with a rival at the start, raced at the back off the rail in the two to three path into
and on the turn, came out in late stretch brushing another rival late. JAMIESTA was urged at the break, chased from outside going three to four wide on the
turn, drifted out a bit late, lacked the needed late kick. CANDY STREET raced outside a rival at the back, went three then four wide on the turn, came out in
the stretch a bit more, was brushed late and needed more. AMBER LIGHT was lightly bumped at the start, chased from inside on or just off the rail, ridden
along on the turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
HELLO FRIENDS broke sharp with the pack, was allowed to relax inside trailing the field at the half mile marker, shifted off the rail gaining momentum from
last to be eight wide turning for home, was full of run on the outside down the lane and got up for the victory in a well timed stretch rally. IMA BEAST had a
nice position tracking the leader outside on the turn, was in the hunt four deep at the top of the lane, stubbornly battled between foes to the wire and just
missed in a game effort. TAKOTA had a good trip nestled behind the frontrunner into the turn, slipped up the fence with five sixteenths to go, assumed the
front at the top of the stretch, opened up a touch with an eighth remaining but could not hold off the fast charge of the winner from the outside in the late
stages. ISHIYAYA travelled near the back of the pack outside rivals in the third flight, shifted out some more to be in the six path between foes at the top of
the lane and showed some interest to the wire passing tired runners for a minor share. SPANISH BEAUTY took command from the outside leading the field
down the backstretch, surrendered the lead when getting out nearing the quarter pole and weakened between runners while not switching leads to the
finish. DREAMING OF AUDREY settled near the back on the rail early on, was ridden to go on inside two furlongs from the wire, had little response and
could not be a factor through the stretch. FOXY LADY stalked in the two path between rivals in the third flight, was asked for more run at the quarter pole,
no run was offered and made little impression to the finish line. SILVER TUNES made an early run from last outside to track the leader three deep at the
three furlong marker, angled out in the seven path for the stretch run, could not sustain the rally and backed away in upper stretch.

Footnotes
INDIAN MUSIC was urged clear, set the pace racing off the rail, urged in upper stretch, held safe. MO TOURING bumped a rival at the start, was in pursuit
of the eventual winner from outside and off that one three wide early, ridden along nearing the quarter pole, came into upper stretch four to five deep, asked
for yet more by mid-stretch, closed the gap with solid late stride but was only second best. SILVER BULLET LADY broke a half-step slowly and was
thereupon urged forward inside to gain contact just off the flank of the leader, settled into stride at that juncture tracking mid-pack and easing off the leaders
and moving off the rail just a bid, saved ground near the inside on the turn, kept on evenly inside in the lane. THATSITTHATSALL was bumped into a rival at
the start, settled at the back, fanned six wide into upper stretch, was unable to menace. KATCHY NAME was bumped at the start, raced outside a foe two to
three wide on the turn, was never a threat.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME KNIGHT battled on the rail for the lead down the backside, put away the two outside speed rivals midpoint on the turn, had something left in
reserve to fend off the closing challenge at the furlong pole and prevailed in a well rated front end victory. CALL MY BANKER travelled in mid field just off
the fence, was nudged on through the turn advancing between horses with five sixteenths to go, waited behind runners turning for home, finally got clear six
wide at the eighth pole and closed in to capture second money nearing the finish. STYLISH GENT settled behind the engaging front trio on the rail running
on the turn, found a seam with three sixteenths remaining in the two path, battled through the stretch fighting for the place share inside and had to settle for
third money in a gutsy stretch effort. BOXER BRIEF watched the front threesome battle four deep tracking outside runners, took closer order four wide two
furlongs from home, loomed the main threat turning for home in the five path and stalled in the final sixteenth losing placings late. SOUPER RIVER stalked
on the rail near the back of the pack in the beginning, saved ground throughout the turn making little progress, stayed on the fence for the drive to the finish
and was one paced to the wire. BIG WARDEN pressed the issue three wide outside running through the turn, was in with a chance for a small piece of the
prize four deep at the top of the lane and levelled out in the final eighth. SUPREMEACTION settled near the rear three deep at the half, was roused entering
the turn, could not make any headway on other rivals and was not a factor in the stretch drive. COMMANDER TOM trailed the field down the back straight,
could not get involved three wide running on the turn, angled out widest in the six path for the drive and passed a straggler to the wire. HIGHLAND
SOCIETY prompted the pace with rivals on either side running on the turn, began to weaken at the quarter pole, stopped at the furlong marker and was not
persevered with to the finish line.
