Footnotes
IRON N STEEL with the leaders out of the chute after breaking in good order, fell back to stalk that lead pack up the backstretch off the inside, advanced
into a striking position four to five wide turning for home, wore down rival while drifting in. PARTY LITTLE BOY vied up front while three wide, showed the
way into the stretch inside the winner in the four path, dueled past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to that rival to the end while being floated in
and brushed. EASY EDDIE A back off the pace outside, raced three wide through the turn, proved no match for the top two through the lane, well clear of
the others. ASTROLOGY WONOWON broke alertly, narrowly showed the way out of the chute while between horses, continued to hold a narrow advantage
between rivals into and through much of the turn then began to weaken when headed. MIDNIGHT CROWN with the pace along the inside, also weakened
when the real running begin turning into the stretch. SAUCY ARGUMENT broke back, failed to menace while saving ground to no avail. LORD HELP ME
last away, remained back throughout and was also not a factor. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF PARTY LITTLE BOY AGAINST
IRON N STEEL FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
ENTERTAINMENT broke on top, got clear to show the way into the first turn, continued to set the pace while rating along the inside up the backstretch,
remained clear through the final turn, drew way to increase advantage late under steady handling. STANDING MAN settled in the third flight off rail, rallied
three wide through the lane to gain the place, no real threat to the winner. HOT LE ROY away with the winner, tracked that one along the inside, continued
to pursue that one into the straight, no threat to that same foe as well, caught late for the second spot. AFLEET ASCENT in the second flight outside off the
inside, had little left fore the second spot late. SMOKY TOPAZ went one paced throughout to also be found lacking in the late going. EAST LEX raced in mid
pack and also failed to muster a closing response. STEALING APRIORITY four wide and well off the pace, also failed to rally. COLONIST remained back in
failing to threaten. SPHEROID broke back and was never a factor. QUANA DUDE last to leave, trailed to be always outrun.

Footnotes
CATCAKE void of speed for a half, moved out a bit for the drive, rallied, finished up willingly between horses to be in time. SWEET VIDALIA off the pace
while racing well out in the strip, came five wide for the drive, rallied while remaining widest and outside the winner, outkicked late. DEBBIES PASSAGE
broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, shrugged off the other speed nearing the furlong marker to be clear, caught late while salvaging the show.
SUMMERJUSTBET HER dueled up front closest to the inside for over four furlongs, first to blink in upper stretch. LA TRESS GRAY closest to the dueling
leaders for a half, four wide exiting the turn, weakened through the stretch. BEYOND D'ORO was never a factor. FOUR PRINCESSES last away, more and
more sluggish, pulled up out of the turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
WENDY WILECAT in mid pack while well wide early, advanced to a forward position four wide through the turn, challenged outside the leader when
straightened for home, drove clear late. BIND ON EARTH set the pace off the inside, continued to hold the advantage in the two path exiting the turn,
responded when the winner came alongside soon after, could not match strides with that one late, clearly second best. MARY JACK in the second flight
early, moved toward the inside turn, saved ground into the lane, went evenly the final furlong to prove best of the others. LAURIEANN pressed the issue
three wide, weakened through the stretch. SHE'S MY PRIORITY in tight at the start, in mid pack while off the inside, lacked a serious closing response.
SASSY EMMA within striking distance well out in the strip, six wide turning for home, failed to muster a closing rally. STORM BREACH off a step slow,
moved outside, also was six wide exiting the turn, went evenly through the lane. COUNTRY DREAM broke back, trailed early, improved five wide turn,
flattened out through the stretch. TAPIT'S LADY broke out to tighten up a couple of outer rivals, made little other impact. MISS CHARLIE GRAS broke in
slightly to help tighten up a pair of rivals, was straightened to race forward early, gave way in the turn. SUMMERTIME BANDIT in tight break, was finished
early.

Footnotes
DOLLY'S GUITAR broke back, moved closer through the turn, just off the inside, dropped to the rail late in the bend, cut the corner into the lane to reach
contention, took over inside the furlong marker, held the runner up at bay in a game effort. COPPER MOON behind the early leaders, chased the leader
through the midway point on the turn, challenged on the outside into the lane, outgamed by the winner late. SHESABEAUTYDANCER broke alertly, showed
the way up the backstretch along the inside, continued to hold the advantage into the stretch while off the rail, allowed the winner the inside with a furlong to
run, weakened from between the top two, saved the show. BRAVE CITY GIRL in the main body into the turn along the inside, moved off the rail late in the
turn, displayed some mild late interest. CAJUN GUMBOW chased the leader off the inside, came five wide out of the turn and weakened in the run to the
wire. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE main group, shuffled back late backstretch, passed tiring rivals while not a threat. JANISTHEBEAUTY in mid pack early, fell
back before three furlongs, not a threat stretch. APRIORITY MAGIC last to leave, raced back, improved a bit into the lane, flattened out.
MYDEALOFTHEDAY was finished after three furlongs.

Footnotes
TSURIS unhurried in the early going while three wide through the first turn, four wide backstretch, continued in the four path when beginning to advance
second turn, roused when straightened for home, quickly reeled in the pacesetter to win going away. JANET'S DEVIL broke on top, cleared toward the
inside early in the first turn, enjoyed a long lead the middle half, continued to hold a significant advantage with a furlong to run, proved no match for the
winner late, remained clear of the others. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY lacked early foot, moved closer before a half, chased the runner up through the final turn
and upper stretch, could do little with that one late while also proving not a match for the winner, saved the show. TALK TO TOKEY four wide through the
first turn, raced in the second flight, lacked a serious closing response. MAGAZINE STREET void of speed, improved position without posing a serious
threat. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER broke with the lead group despite stumbling, settled in mid pack early, had little for the drive. MR ELVIN also had little for the
stretch run. XIETELEHUAS last away, remained always back. STONE ALLIANCE chased early, stopped after a half, distanced after losing contact with the
field, jogged in.

Footnotes
CZAR'S BALLERINA unhurried early toward the inside, moved closer under her own courage after a half, continued to be patiently handled through the
second bend, steered out when straightened for home, outside bid, kicked clear under steady handling. FOLLOW THE SAINT broke in good order,
pressured the leader in the two path, bid turning into the lane, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, finished well clear for the place. MADISON'S
SCREEN broke on top, set the pace inside, headed into the lane by the runner up, weakened but managed to save the show. LOVERS NEVER SAY
second flight early, fell back to trail, continued to lag into the lane, some belated interest to be gaining for the show, no threat to the top pair. K V SQUARED
settled off the pace and the inside, lacked a response when called on for the drive. SKY HIGH SUSAN broke out and steadied be last away, raced outside
early while a bit keen, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
FOLLOW THROUGH broke alertly, soon clear, set all the pace, drew out through the lane while being kept to task. SUM CHARM bothered at the start,
quickly recovered to race closest to the winner, continued to chase that one into the stretch, proved no match for that one in the drive, remained clear for the
place. GRACE'S SOLDIER raced within striking distance off the inside, lacked a closing punch, narrowly gained the nod for the show. MS. PRIESTLY
lacked speed, five wide into the lane, improved position with some late interest, missed the show. TERRI GOT A FRIEND broke in at the break to bother
inner rivals, raced in mid pack off the inside, dropped to the rail entering the stretch, finished up evenly. ABBY DABBY settled off the pace inside, saved
ground to no avail through the turn in lacking a closing response. KASENS TRIBE void of speed, was four wide out of the turn, improved position a bit while
never a serious threat. CHARMING KAT within striking distance for a half off the inside, backed up through the lane. NIKLAUSIA bore out at the break to
bother a couple of outer rivals, four wide out of the turn, failed to rally. SPARKLE CITY bothered at the break, in some traffic into the turn, remained back.
SHOTGUN ANNIE bothered at the break but broke with the leaders, quickly fell back, failed to menace. SHE'S THE SHERIFF bothered at the start, moved
up to race in mid pack, began a steady retreat just before a half. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.
