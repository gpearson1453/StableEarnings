TWO YEAR CONTRACT set the pace, took command on the turn and was much the best. NO MORE was away alertly and was roused on the turn but from
the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. TIMMINS tracked the leader and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top
of the stretch needed more. BIG BROWN BREWSKII settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
was all out. SANTIAGO SALSA showed no speed, chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
DOT'S VISION set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. JACK BEANSTALK
was in touch, raced evenly on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. ROCKET JOE COPPER was unhurried
early and moved up on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. GLITTER BAY was off the pace, in tight on the far turn and
from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no rally. CHAIRMAN BOB was in range and a factor on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch was empty. HIATUS broke awkwardly, chased on the far turn and was eased to the wire. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON GLITTER BAY
AGAINST ROCKET JOE COOPER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.
