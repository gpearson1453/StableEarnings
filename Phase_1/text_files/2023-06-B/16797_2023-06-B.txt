RETWEET rated three wide, bid to the front at the five sixteenths pole, was collared by the winner in the stretch and continued gamely. DISTURBED saved
ground early, forced the pace in the two path then weakened late. CAPT COMPLICATED chased four wide under a hold down the backstretch and gave
way. STORMY FIRE sprinted clear inside, dueled through the final turn then stopped. FLORIANOPOLIS steadied along on the first turn, raced between
rivals and faded. TWIRLING CHARLIE trailed early inside and was always far behind.

WAGON BOSS went after the leaders three wide on the turn, took over at the quarter pole and pulled away under moderate urging. BOURBON BAY stalked
the dueling pacesetters and finished well while no threat to the winner. SPLITZVILLE trailed far behind then offered late energy narrowing the gap wide.
PRINCE FILIP dueled along the inside to the stretch and weakened slightly. NICK THE CARDSHARK lacked speed inside, moved out in the stretch but was
no threat. JARLIAN chased wide, bid briefly closer on the turn then faltered. SUPER GARNER pressed the pace in the two path for half a mile and stopped.

RUSH CENTER reserved in the two path, bid to the front into the stretch then won the head bob in a tight photo. OCCASIONAL MOON settled close up
inside, angled out advancing in the stretch, rallied and just missed. LAYTOWN forced the pace outside, led at the quarter pole then weakened slightly in the
stretch. MODERN ERA stumbled badly at the start, trailed far back then offered late energy. SON OF A BUCK dropped far behind and was always outrun.
TATUM hustled to the front inside, dueled for five furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
BOOK MARKER dropped back in the two path, moved wider in the stretch and was just up following a long drive. MASADIRO dueled three wide, led in
midstretch, continued willingly, but was nailed at the wire. BUBBY PAPERMAKER broke sluggishly, rushed up inside and finished gamely. BIG POPPER
broke very slowly then advanced well inside through the stretch. UPTOWN SHOES broke a step slowly, moved up to duel inside then weakened late.
BEFRIENDTHEENEMY dropped back early and was never a factor. THE BOATMAN lacked speed wide down the backstretch and faltered. LITTLE HENRY
earned a narrow lead in the two path then stopped in the stretch.
