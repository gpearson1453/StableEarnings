Footnotes
SUSIE'S KID unhurried early, closed willingly outside to engage the leader in upper stretch, was bumped repeatedly by that one and forced out through the
final furlong and proved best by a narrow margin. BLAZING BURROUGHS was bumped hard at the start into VICTORY DIVISION, rallied four then three
wide to make the lead past the quarter pole, drifted out under left handed urging bumping the winner repeatedly and just missed hanging on. STUNT MAN
stalked the pace four then three wide and finished determinedly in the path. HOPPY GILMORE vied for the lead along the inside and lacked the needed
response. VICTORY DIVISION was bumped at the start then failed to menace. HITE pressed the pace three wide into the turn the. ELLIOT THE DRAGON
bore in at the start bumping hard with BLAZING BURROUGHS, moved up three wide into the turn then came up empty. TEAM LEYENDECKER was outrun.
COWTOWN BOSS was sent to the lead soon after the start, set the pace for a half, had speed into the stretch then stopped in the final furlong.

FAIR AND SQUARE broke in front, set all the pace while nicely rated, widened into the stretch under right handed urging and won as much the best under a
hand ride. TROJAN TALE pressured the winner two wide into the stretch, drifted to the five path and held on for second. RETURNONINVESTMENT allowed
to settle, had a mild late rally outside in the five path and just missed getting up for second. NEED TO KNOW BASIS drifted in soon after the start forcing
rivals to his inside to be in tight, was well placed then went evenly. HEY EUGENE was in tight shortly after the start, moved up three then two wide through
the far turn and failed to sustain that bid. K KID vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch then gave way. RED COMET also in tight soon after the
start, was outrun. PAINT THE TOWN close up early, was through after half.

five path under left handed urging. INTERSTATEDAYDREAM trailed early, advanced steadily outside rivals, swung wide and got up for second in the six
path. SIXTYTHREECALIBER stalked the early pace two then three wide, surged into the far turn then was outfinished. MISTY VEIL close up from the start,
offered a strong bid four wide on the second turn then weakened late. RED HOT LASS away alertly, set the pace off the rail in the four path past the quarter
pole then gave way late. SOUL OF AN ANGEL allowed to settle, drew closer along the rail into the far turn then came up empty. MARKET SUCCESS was
hung five wide into the clubhouse turn then was no factor. MALICED chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then weakened. CANDY ISLAND
broke outward and had brief speed. GRAY ROYALITY was through early.

Footnotes
TWO PHIL'S stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the far turn to make the lead near the quarter pole, quickly opened a clear advantage, was
struck once left handed near the furlong marker and drew off through deep stretch to win easily. BISHOPS BAY was carried out to the six path entering the
clubhouse turn by the leader, pressured that one for six furlongs, made the lead, set the pace to the quarter pole then was no match for the winner. HAYES
STRIKE void of early speed, found his best stride late in the four path. LORD MILES went evenly. HENRY Q was put to right handed urging from the start,
guided out to the five path nearing the first turn, set the pace for six furlongs off the rail and gave way in the stretch. TIMESATAPPIN was outrun.
AGNELLO'S DREAM close along along the inside, gave way on the far turn. LAST COOKIE failed to menace.
