Footnotes
INDYETTA tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, assumed command
leaving the turn, and held sway under confident handling. TAM TRICKY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated
the pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied from the inside of INDYETTA entering the final turn, and battled gamely on from along the
rail in the drive to prove second best. TOBESUNNY broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two
wide through the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to seriously threaten the top pair in the late stages. JUST MISTY was held at the
start to get away poorly, raced into a stalking trip from along the rail entering the first turn, maintained her position into the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race, in particular in regards to JUST MISTY. Following a review the stewards ordered a full
refund on JUST MISTY, as it was deemed she did not receive a fair start.

Footnotes
BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the
drive to get up in the final strides. DEPUTY'S DANCER broke sharply and was taken in hand and allowed to settle at the back of the pack entering the
backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush three wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. MONTE away
alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the backstretch, maintained his lead
through the final turn and into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late. SELF SERVING lagged well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the
run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in deep stretch without having racing
room late. EARS TO US away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, continued two wide into the final turn, but
had little to offer in the late going.

HARLAN'S ANGEL tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing out from the rail, forced the issue two wide from the outside of ANIMA,
chased that rival through the final turn, and wore her pace rival down in the final strides to prevail. ANIMA away alertly and dueled for the lead from the
outside of BAKZONE through the stretch the first time, controlled the pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, held
a narrow advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. DONE THAT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly two wide from between
rivals entering the final turn, and closed willingly five wide in the drive to garner a share. CERTIFIABLE broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide into the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BAKZONE away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first
time eased herself into a tracking trip entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

ARUNDEL CASTLE away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the backside,
was briefly overtaken entering the final turn, battled back from along the rail through the turn and took the narrowest of advantages into the lane, and inched
clear late. CHI CHI'S SONG away alertly, but was content to assume a tracking trip one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, maintained her
position entering the backstretch, took a narrow advantage entering the final turn, was unable to dispose of the pacesetter through the turn, and finished
three wide in the drive to hold the place. ELLAMEISTER broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the
rail, continued from a stalking trip into the backside, collared the leader three wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly three out from the rail in the
drive to just miss the place. HONOR THE QUEEN trailed a compact field into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, began to lose touch
with her rivals in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong. The final sixteenth of a mile in this race was HAND TIMED.

and in the run down the backside, continued to battle from the inside of SLOOP JOHN B through the final turn and into the stretch, and inched clear late.
SLOOP JOHN B broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run
down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival entering the lane, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to
prove clearly second best. BETTER TONE rushed up along the rail through the first turn and was forced to steady off heels leaving the turn and entering the
stretch the first time, was taken up off heels again both entering and leaving the second turn while continuing to track the leaders, rallied two wide entering
the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. TRAPALIS tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out
from the rail, continued with a three wide trip in the run down the backstretch while maintaining his position, rallied two out from the rail entering the final
turn, but was outfinished late while finishing four wide in the drive. TEX TONIC stalked the leaders at the back of a compact field entering the stretch the first
time, continued to trail the field in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid.

Footnotes
PURSUE stalked the early pace into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, advanced smartly three wide midway down the backstretch and
assumed command entering the final turn, and drew clear late as much the best. BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT broke sharply and raced to the lead while racing one
out from the rail entering the backstretch, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, was quickly overtaken entering the final turn, rallied two wide
through the turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove easily second best. DESIRED OUTCOME settled well off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed with late interest three wide in the
drive to get up for a share. HE'S A SAINT tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, but was outfinished in deep stretch for the show position. GROOVIN' IS BAK away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground
at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the stretch drive. BLACKSTONE away alertly and tracked
the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when
called upon. TEXAS MOONSHINE lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, was always well back and failed to
make his presence felt. MOUNT LOKI unhurried early while racing greenly in the opening strides, trailed well behind the field entering the backstretch, and
was never a factor.
