Footnotes
TRIPLE ELVIS tracking leaders to far turn, ranged up dueled, took over and cleared while ridden out. DEVILS RED good position to turn outside kept on
outside for place spot. FAST FELIX no speed from gate, far back to stretch good late run for show. HASTY STRIKE troubled from the gate, far back to
stretch, improved position. FAST FALL saved ground while well back to the turn with no late kick. A. P. AVATAR tried to keep up, pushed on hard into turn
with no response. ALL ABOUT CROGE flashed speed to the half, gave way readily and backed up. FINGERS quick speed from inside to the quarter pole
but retreated quickly from inside through the stretch.
