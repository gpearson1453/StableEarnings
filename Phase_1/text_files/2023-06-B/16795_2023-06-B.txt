Footnotes
C V SCENIC LEGACY was bumped at the start then hustled up to vie for the lead two wide and in the three path, continued to duel for the lead through the
turn, floated rival into the six path entering the lane, drifted in after right-handed urging, continued to drift in ending near the rail and just lasting for the win.
FOREVER BLESSED stepped in at the start bumping a forcing rival inward, raced near the back through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane
with momentum while angling into the five or six path and nearly reeled in the leader. SIX J STARLET was off a step slow, raced in the three path through
the turn, was gaining momentum and attempting to split rivals near the eighth pole when shut off, checked sharply, angled to the inside and was gaining to
the end. LUCKY LINDA W was in the two path through the turn when not hurried, came into the lane from the two path, was steadied when another drifted
in then continued to offer a mild gain. SAHARAN FLEECE was put in tight at the start, raced in the back into the lane, angled into the seven path and gained
from mid-track. DESIRED LEGACY vied for the lead from the two path through the turn, was closest to the winner with an eighth to go, brushed soon after
the eighth pole and faded. MAE BEE RIGHT vied for the lead along the inside early then steadily faded. SALTY SUE vied three wide and in the four path
through the turn then was empty turning into the lane. BEAUTIFUL BLOSSOM was in the five to the four path through the turn and was empty through the
lane. AFTER AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #8 SALTY SUE AGAINST THE RIDER OF #4 C V SECENIC LEGACY FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR
THE EIGHTH POLE, #4 C V SCENIC LEGACY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1ST AND PLACED 3RD.

Footnotes
AKAMAI set the pace while near the inside and under pressure from the outside, continued with a short lead into the lane, repelled challenger into the lane
but was joined by another, dueled with that one to the wire and maintained the short advantage. INDOCUMENTADO chased the pace from the three path
into the far turn, bid three wide through late turn, swung five wide into the lane, joined the winner inside the eighth pole then could not get past while
finishing second best. SILENT SONATA saved ground through the turns and into the lane and moved up through the final eighth. BASSCOAT was near the
rail through the far turn, came into the lane from the inside and moved up with good energy late. GOLDDIGGENDEVIL raced near the rail into the far turn,
angled sharply off the inside in late turn, bid with the runner-up and four wide into the lane, loomed serious threat then could not sustain the effort. LOOKIN
AT JUSTICE chased the dueling leaders while in the two or three path, bid three path into the lane then weakened and subsequently experienced heat
exhaustion after the race, recovered and walked back. MAMALA KAMALA was taken back early while off the inside, raced in the three path when near the
back into the far turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and lacked a closing bid. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL pressed the pace while two wide
through the far turn then was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
GREAT COOLNESS chased the pacesetters through into the far turn while in the two path, continued just off the inside into the lane, split the former leaders
after the eighth pole and drew away. TRICOLOUR unhurried while off the inside, raced in the four path into the far turn, was asked for more in late turn,
swung into the lane from the five or six path and was finished with good energy while unable to get to the winner. CHANNEL Z raced in the two path through
the turn, was passed when wider rivals made their bid, came into the lane from the four path and moved up to be best of the rest. BAYOU CHROME raced
three wide through the first turn, continued in the three path when near the back, came into the lane from the three or four path and just got up for the fourth
spot while outfinishing several. DRAMA CRITIC chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the four path, had aim and
appeared to be a serious threat with an eighth to travel then weakened. THE MOTTO pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane then
gave way. CONRAD THE RED was well back while off the inside, angled into the eight path for the drive and improved position while not a factor. HILTON
HEAD set the pace along the inside through the far turn then gave way near the eighth pole. LOLAS BEAU never a factor while off the inside. ROYAL
DECADENCE was in the four path through the far turn and into the lane and was empty. TAKE A DIP raced along the inside into the far turn and was empty
in mid-turn.

Footnotes
RUN AWAY ROJO chased the pace while near the inside, continued along the into the turn, moved to the two path to pass a tiring one, bid into the lane
while near the inside, spurted clear straightening into the lane, was all out late while drifting out from left handed urging in the final twenty yards. KING ICE
was unhurried early and allowed to trailed the field into the far turn, raced in the three path through mid-turn, came into the lane five wide with good
momentum, rallied from mid-track, was brushed late when closing in and just missed while 2nd best. BAD BOY GEIST chased the pace from the three path
through the far turn, bid into the lane from the two path, was closest to the winner with an eighth to go, could not gain on that one but finished clear for the
show spot. DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE was without speed into the far turn, moved through the three path in mid-turn, came into the lane from the six path and
moved up while drifting in a couple paths. WIN ME OVER raced in the four path when never far back, continued four wide into the lane and weakened late.
ZAPPINIT set the pace while under pressure through the turn then gave way. SECRET RENDEZVOUS saved ground into the turn, angled into the eight
path for the drive and never was a factor. CHISEL pressed the pace two wide through mid-turn then was empty in late turn. SPOTONJUSTICE raced in the
two path through the far turn when near the back and tired. ANCHOR MANNE chased the pace from the three or four path through the far turn, was still a
contender into the lane then was empty the final eighth. MONUMENTALJUSTICE raced four wide through the first turn, continued off the inside through the
far turn and never factored. GOOD FOREVER raced near the rail while near mid-pack, was done entering the lane, was eased late and walked off.
