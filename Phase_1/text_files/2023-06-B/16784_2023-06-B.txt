Footnotes
MARTINKELLY was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, drew out on the turn and then was clear by the furlong marker, then held sway late to prove
best, driving. COOL COMEDIAN tracked the pace on the inside, ridden along on the turn and tipped out three wide leaving the turn, closed well but could
not get to the winner, second best. ODDS ON was rated early on the inside, came three wide into the lane and had a mild late rally to gain the show award.
CARGO SHIP prompted the early pace two wide, dropped back on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, lugged out leaving the turn and
weakened, lost show award. ECLIPTICALS ELLIOT stumbled at the start, chased the pace three wide, two wide by the quarter pole and weakened.
HASHTAG WINNING was outrun early and failed to menace.

SCYNTZ was settled early on the outside of a trio, three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, shifted out to the far outside and closed well to get
up in time to prove best under a drive. LOOKIN BACK LUCKY tracked the early pace two wide, made a four wide bid of the turn, then was bumped by the
pace setter by the three sixteenths and shifted out, then hit the front in the furlong grounds and led late but was denied on the wire to just miss. DANCIN IN
DUBAI was settled early in between rivals at the half mile marker, angled in leaving the turn and finished well on the inside to gain the show award. ABHAR
was away alertly to set the pace while clear and off the inside, came three wide off the turn and then drifted out sharply but corrected, then faded the final
furlong, lost the show award. GORUN was reserved early on the inside, came three wide into the lane and had a late rally. CONNECTING was reserved
early, came four wide into the lane and angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. NOTORIOUS REY was settled early on the inside and dropped back.

Footnotes
MINE TO HOLD prompted the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to go on even terms for command by the quarter pole, then had a long drive with
SPIN CYCLE and prevailed late, driving. SPIN CYCLE set the pace from the inside, was headed by the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the drive and just
missed. VITESSE was settled back on the inside, saved ground on the turn, shifted off the inside in the lane and finished well, bested rest. GUSHING OIL
tracked the pace on the inside, eased out mid way on the turn and came five wide into the lane and weakened. TAINO chased the pace three wide, four
wide on the turn and weakened. ITGOT GRANDMA was three wide into then first turn, settled early, dropped to the inside at the half mile marker and
stopped. LAVERY was settled back early, wide on the backstretch, then was eased to the wire, walked off.
