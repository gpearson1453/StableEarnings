OPENING NIGHT stalked outside of the pace setter, required firm urging to sustain pressure in the four path into the far turn, yet kept on and bid nearing
the lane before drawing off. MEMPHIS CASH QUEEN was void of any early speed, saved ground until the turn, angled out in early stretch, passed tired
rivals, no match and finished second best. CLOUDY BAY set a clear early pace, raced three wide into the turn, couldn't hold off the winner and weakened.
MILLION DOLLAR CAT was allowed to settle early from the inside, angled out out and offered no rally. BEL ARIA was reserved early, went four wide into
the turn and never fired.

DASH ATTACK followed the early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, move up with BIG BLUE LINE through the turn, dueled with that rival to late
stretch and edged clear for the win. BIG BLUE LINE tracked the early pace, ranged up four wide into the home turn, dueled with the winner to late stretch,
couldn't sustain the run and finished second best. SANTOS DUMONT was in a little tight at the start, quickly set a clear pace from off the rail and weakened
late. FOUNDER was void of any early speed, raced three wide into the turn, was eased and walked off.

ROUTE RUNNER was allowed to settle early, loomed five wide through the second turn, took the lead, met the bid of SURFACE TO AIR, shook clear from
that rival and edged clear late. SURFACE TO AIR set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail through the first turn, fell back off the pace, angled out to the
six path through the second turn, loomed up to bid, flattened out late stretch and finished second best. ILLEGAL tracked the early pace, ranged up to make
a four wide bid through the second turn and weakened late. SOYBEAN MAN pressed the early pace, went three wide into the first turn, angled in through
the second turn and flattened out. OSCARGOT was reserved off the leaders, saved ground throughout and offered no late rally, then was vanned off.
