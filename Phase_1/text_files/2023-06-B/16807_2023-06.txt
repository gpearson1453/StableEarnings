late. ANIPPE bumped at the start, was rated close up, gained position and a short lead on the two path through the second turn, then was no match for the
winner, while clearly best of the rest. SAINT FOXY mid pack and outside, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch, drifted in and closed for the show. BABY BLUE broke out at the start, bumping a rival, looped two and three wide through the second turn, then
faded tiring rivals in the lane. OUT OF PAYNT mid pack and inside, faded through the second turn. CEREAL I D sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start,
stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded in the lane.

GOLDEN OAK well placed and inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, shook
clear inside the furlong marker and held. MAGIC WIZARD unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest heading the
winner into the stretch, then was no match for that one in the late going and held the place. RISEN SAVIOR unsettled in the gate, was rated off the rail,
gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened the final furlong. EL DUQUE mid pack and
inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed for a share. SUMMER BOSS sprinted away from the field,
drew off down the backstretch, then faded the final furlong. RAPA NUI was never involved.

TACTICAL PAJAMAS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. I
RECALL never far back, saved ground through the turn, angled to the two path into the stretch, came through on that path, then angled out in the stretch
and edged up for the place. FORGOTTEN PEACE stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. DANA'S BEAUTY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. SINGLE LADY was no factor.

MONEY AND HONEY tracked the pace rating, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled in for clear
racing room, made a steady gain, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. MONGOLIAN MISSION unhurried, moved up inside through the turn,
came three wide into the stretch, then closed fast late and missed. AMAZON LIZZIE well placed, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and evened out the final furlong. ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. THE TWO NANCY'S mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
angled out and flattened out. WILD LOOKER mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and had no rally.
HIPNOTIZADA set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. LADY MARVEL vied for the early lead on
the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
LEGIO tracked the pace well back, gained position inside through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader, gaining a short lead into the
stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. SILVER TOKEN mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain and edged up for the place. PUNX mid pack, gained position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, then
lacked the needed late kick and was outfinished for the place. GYPSY KITTEN allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the lane and closed well for a share. GET ALONG allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and passed tiring rivals. REALLY RED well placed and outside, faded through the turn. FACTORINO chased the pace off the rail, moved up three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. PLEASE SIT DOWN showed little, inside. SMARTY JOHN sprinted away from
the field early, then faded in the stretch.
