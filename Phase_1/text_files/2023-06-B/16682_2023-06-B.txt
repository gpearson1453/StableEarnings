Footnotes
HIGHER QUALITY was hustled from the start, moved up under urging then was rated off the pace, came back under urging near the five-eighths pole,
moved closer while four then five wide on the turn, chased the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late, took the lead three
strides from the finish and won the head-bob on the line to narrowly prevail. ALCOOLS went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside
to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then responded well when put to a right-handed crop, had the rider switch the crop to his left
hand near the eighth-pole but didn't use it on that side then quickly went back to a right-handed crop, led desperately into the final sixteenth, was headed by
the winner three wide strides from the finish then was out-nodded and denied while well clear for the place. TRUCULENT settled off the pace, raced inside
early on the turn, angled three then five wide around the seven-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the
rest. MUSICAL HEART was taken up shortly after the start, tossed his head while taken up again outside the seven-eighths then altered out over heels,
tracked outside from that point, was asked in the three to four path on the turn, made a bid near the three-eighths, dropped back into upper stretch and
weakened. FOREVER WICKED dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. MUCHO SUNSHINE was hustled
from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside then inside of a foe, chased in the two to three path early on the turn, moved to the four path while dropping
back later on that bend, floated six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. ROYAL REALM angled to the outside early then was urged well back in the
field, went five wide on the turn, was carried seven wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SKIMS (GB) rated two to three wide just off the pace, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to split rivals a
furlong out seizing command just inside that station, then edged clear to the finish. ATOMIC BLONDE (GER) was under a rating hold tracking the front from
near the rear of the compact group, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out
inside the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. CANISY rated two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, pulled her way to
latch on that rival five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when MISE EN SCENE advanced inside, swung four wide into upper
stretch issuing a challenge for command, dug in under a drive taking over the front narrowly and briefly before being headed by the eventual winner, then
ran on to preserve the show honors. MISE EN SCENE (GB) tracked the pace along the inside in hand, got given a nudge at the three-eighths and advanced
inside to bid for command with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner on even terms for the front scraping the paint, dug in under a drive among a quartet
latched on to the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. STAR DEVINE (IRE) away well, raced three wide into the first turn showing the way, tucked
to the two path through that bend before tipping back three wide down the backstretch, held a safe advantage through sensible splits unhurried and
uncontested, had CANISY advance outside pulling her way to be heads apart five furlongs from home but still faced little pressure as that rival remained on
hold as well, came under challenge for the initial time just past the midway point on the far turn as MISE EN SCENE advanced inside, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole now under threat from flanking challengers, spun just off the inside into upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in and was collared
nearing the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. PHAROAH'S HEART tracked the pace along the inside until tipped to the two path five
furlongs from home, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TOP GUN GIRL switched to the outside of the leader near the five-eighths then tracked the pace, stalked in the three path on the turn, was given her cue
near the five-sixteenths, pursued the leader into upper stretch, gained the advantage nearing the furlong marker, responded well under one tap of a
right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under a strong hand-ride to the finish. BREEZE EASY (GB) was taken up while last away and spotted
the front a few lengths, angled in while taken under a snug hold at the rear, moved closer while inside to the two path on the turn, had room to the outside at
the five-sixteenths but remained in behind two foes and waited, continued on hold to the quarter-pole then was roused in upper stretch, was guided in for
room at the eighth-pole then bobbled, rallied along the rail in the final furlong and finished with good courage for the place. LADY MILAGRO broke in front
then came inward just after the start, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for the
show. VIOLENT VIXEN was taken up just after the start and spotted the front a few lengths, settled off the pace, was roused while two to three wide on the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. DERRYNANE settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused
near the quarter-pole and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PLENTITUDE broke a half-step slow, was rated under a tight hold, drafted in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide while asked at the quarter-pole,
chased the leader while inside of a foe into the final furlong, brushed with that opponent shortly thereafter, gained on the pacesetter late and got up under
strong handling to narrowly prevail. Z FIRST was taken under a tight hold then stalked the pace on the outside, rounded the turn in the four path, was asked
five wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong, brushed with the winner shortly thereafter and finished willingly to get the place.
SHOOTOUTTHELIGHTS was bumped at the start and forced out, went to the front while in hand then attended the pace under a tight hold, raced in the
three path on the turn, regained the advantage at the quarter-pole then was put to a drive in upper stretch, led determinedly into the final sixteenth but was
overtaken then lost the place while able to get the show. CANDLE broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, drafted in the three path going
around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, droppped in while asked for her best near the three-sixteenths, pursued the vanguard in the final furlong
and lacked the needed kick. PALACE GOSSIP showed speed while in hand, took the lead near the nine-sixteenths, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the
advantage nearing the quarter-pole then spun three wide into the stretch and gave way. GAME THEORY broke in the air and was off a bit slow, settled at
the rear, traveled three wide on the turn and was no factor. AWILLAWAY settled towards the back, saved ground on the turn, was roused near the
quarter-pole and failed to respond.

rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker then kicked clear and proved best under steady urging. MIM chased the pace on the outside then in the four
path on the turn, pursued the leader in the stretch and was outfinished while able to get the place. NOLITA was bumped at the start then a bit slow into
stride, raced towards the back under urging, moved out on the turn, reached the five path before the five-sixteenths, gained into upper stretch and was
along for the show. BON ADIEU broke out and bumped with a rival, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path going around the turn,
was carried out in upper stretch and weakened. SHAMAN PRINCESS quickly sped clear, remained well clear while inside to the two path on the turn,
shortened stride in upper stretch, was collared outside the furlong marker and tired. BIG HAZEL was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn
and lacked the needed response. ECHO IN ETERNITY broke a step slow, moved out early, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and
