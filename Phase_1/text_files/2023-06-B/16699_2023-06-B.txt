Footnotes
MUSICAL CAT was four wide into the first turn, pressed the pace three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn, slowly edged away in the lane to prove
best, driving. WILL TAKE ROSES set a pressured pace along the inside and was headed on the turn, fought gamely but could not go with the winner late,
second best. EARLY FROST was reserved early, three wide on the turn and came four wide into the drive and had a mild late rally, bested rest. PSYCHE
was well placed two wide and weakened. DALLAS steadied after the start, outrun early and lacked a rally. FAVORITE DOLL went bad nearing the six
furlong marker and was pulled up on the backstretch, vanned off. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, MUSICAL CAT HAS
BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SHORTY MAC vied for the early lead on the inside, then rated on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn and drew clear in the furlong grounds, then
maintained a safe margin to the wire. WISE CHOICE was rated early on the inside, split rivals leaving the furlong marker and finished well, second best.
WEST ABBOTT stalked the pace three wide and was floated out four wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed winning bid. SENSIBLE MARRIAGE was
settled early, split rivals by the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and had no kick. KAZ MUSIC was reserved early, came wide into the lane and had a late
rally. UPTOWN SERAPHINA vied for the lead three wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn two wide, then floated out leaving the turn and weakened the
final furlong. BIG SIS NIC chased the pace three wide and weakened. TRAJEC HOLIDAY checked after the start and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HOLY MOLY MOSES moved up the inside to get good position, then rated on the turn while saving ground, cut corner and when straightened rider was
attempting to give a right handed pop with his crop but lost crop nearing the furlong marker, forced to a vigorous hand ride looked to split rivals nearing the
sixteenth marker, but switched back to the inside when pacesetter drifted slightly, closed up the inside to get up in time to win the bob to prove best..
RUNAHOLIC pressed the pace and made a three wide bid in the lane to gain a short advantage late but was denied late to just miss. WARRIOR'S CAUSE
set a pressured pace two wide and then shook clear leaving the turn but faded late, held show award. CITY OF GOD chased the pace and was two wide on
the turn, angled out in the lane and had a late rally. ALWAYS THERE had a belated rally. WHAT'S HIS NAME failed to menace. SENSE OF IRELAND was
not a factor. FINE FINE was close up early two wide, steadied on the turn and stopped.

STRONG GEM was three wide into the first turn, pulled two wide, then dropped to the inside on the turn, slipped through leaving the turn and assumed
command, drew off smartly to prove best under a couple right handed pops with the riding crop. SASSY MARTINI chased the pace three wide, then was
four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane amd ra;llied well to get the bob for the place award. KLAYTON'S KANDY pressed the pace three wide
and came four wide into the lane but faded in the lane, missed place award. MELODIA was reserved early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally.
TEACHER DRAMA set a pressured pace two wide and weakened in the drive. DRIVEN BY SPEED was settled early, between rivals by the quarter pole but
lacked a late rally. POLISHED GAL was well placed on the inside and weakened. HIGHWAY QUEEN threw head at the start, then was on the inside on the
turn and was not a threat. GLOSSY MADRINA was settled early, then had a five wide pursuit on the backstretch but tired.

Footnotes
PATTY'S BOY was settled early, advanced up the inside on the turn, eased off the inside and came three wide into the lane and made a bid, hit the front at
the furlong marker and drew clear to prove best under mild handling. C C'S WARRIOR set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the backstretch,
then was headed by the winner by the furlong marker and could not go with that rival late, second best. EDICT was four wide on both turns, chased the
pace three wide and had no kick in the lane, bested rest. THE GREAT CASBY passed the tiring rivals. BERHANU was five wide into the first turn, settled
and failed to menace. FLAT OUT FLASHY pressed the pace two wide early and then tracked the pace and tired. DIGGERS DIAMOND chased the pace
three wide and stopped.
