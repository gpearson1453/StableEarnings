Footnotes
WHITAKER settled in hand to track the pace from the rear of the field, ranged up three wide in the final bend, engaged the leader in upper stretch, assumed
command and drew clear. STOCKPILER reared as the gate opened losing several length, pulled up into close contention along the rail in the first turn,
continued to stalk from there to the top of the lane, cut the corner and closed willingly through the stretch. I'M CRENSHAW took the lead from the gate, set a
well rated pace under constant pressure and flattened out in the lane lacking a late response. KING KONGO pressed the pace from the start, continued to
duel on the lead to midway on the far turn and weakened dropping out to the rear.

Footnotes
COLOR FAST saved ground along the inside the first half of the course, was moving up to split rivals on the far turn, fanned out five wide in the upper
stretch, then rushed down the lane to be up at the wire. CLIFF DIVER raced in the middle of the field while being well rated along the inside, then was in a
hard drive on the far turn, rallied gamely in the early stretch to battle for the lead in the last sixteenth but was out finished while closing gamely. WHOOPING
JAY set the pace into the first turn, was in a steady drive heading into the far turn, was headed by an outer foe entering the home stretch, then vied to gain
the lead again in the final furlong but was out finished in end. SIMPLY WICKED pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, gained command
at the top of the far turn, then vied to keep the the lead with inner rivals but gave way grudgingly in the end. TED chased the pace while two wide while
holding third position down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to menace in the stretch but came up empty. MAU MAU settled in the two path and
between horses throughout the backstretch, then swung six wide leaving the far bend to rally in the late stretch but came up empty. RESOLVE NOW
chased the pace along the inside in the middle of the group in the early backstretch, then faded slowly and was through after the far turn. MOUNT KENYA
settled behind the pack out side of two inner rivals, then made a mild bid on the far turn and was no threat.

Footnotes
FLY'N SEXY reserved off the early pace racing four wide in the first turn, steadily made up ground down the backside, circled three wide in the final turn to
loom boldly, failed to overtake the pacesetter in upper stretch, dropped to the inside of that one and surged late to be up in time. ASTA LAVISTA HONEY
broke alertly to take control from the gate, set a well measured pace to the top of the lane, responded when challenged turning for home to maintain a clear
advantage to mid-stretch but was caught in the final strides. VICTOR VALENTINO tracked the leaders down the backstretch, circled three wide in the turn
only to be carried wider by a rival and continued on grinding down the lane to take the show. CAPTAINS COVE pressed the pace from the onset, rallied
turning for home and drifted out through the lane and kept on willingly without closing ground. RED DRAW bobbled a step away from the gate, was gathered
up and settled into a stalking position on the fence and lacked a response when called upon in the final turn. RICHARD'S TX BLING rank in the early going
fighting the rider in the first turn while trying to get out, settled down the backside and went evenly. SLIM JIMMY tossed his head at the start losing several
lengths and trailed throughout as a non-factor.

STAYED IN FOR HALF bid for the lead early along the inside, then settled back to chase the dueling pair into the turn, was urging strongly throughout,
came out three wide in the early stretch then surged down the lane to be up at the wire just in time to prevail. JACKMAN'S RIDE broke outwardly at the
start, then angled in to the two path to duel with in inner rival into the turn, gained the lead in the early stretch, continued to bid gamely but was out finished
by an outer rival in the end and was second best. HE'S A BOMB vied for the lead early between rivals, then pulled away to duel gamely with an outer rival
throughout the bend and into the early stretch then gave way in the end. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY raced behind the pack in the two path into the turn, then
rallied in the late stretch from the five path but it was too little to late. FAR FROM FINAL vied for the lead early with an inner trio, then settled back to chase
the pace from the two into the turn, rallied in the stretch but came up empty. UNION DATA raced along the inside behind the field and showed little.

ground on the winner while a clear second best. GRACEOFCAROLINE pressed the pace from two wide shortly from the gate to the head of the stretch, was
set down for the drive but failed to keep up with the to pair. IN A MINESHAFT tracked the pace from four wide in striking distance and flattened out in the
drive. HAULIN HAY trailed for a half mile and showed some interest closing late. KOLLYNS JULIE went evenly failing to menace. MOON RIDGE bumped
rival leaving the gate, showed early foot to be in contention and dropped back turning for home having never threatened. STORMY'S REVENGE squeezed
at the start to be off-stride and at the rear, rushed up with a middle move to be threatening at the quarter pole and came up empty in the stretch. THE

TIZ BODHI BOY was rated along the inside in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, then bid on the turn, split rivals to rally in the early stretch, was
bumped by an inner rival, continued to duel with the same rival down the lane and was up at the wire to prove best. HYPERION NORTH stalked the pace
from the inside into the turn, then angled out to the two path, bumped rival, then dueled gamely with that rival in the final furlong and hung in the end.
TEXAN FARMER tracked the pace towards the back of the pack from the two path, was urging steadily on the turn from the four path to menace in the
stretch and was closing well in the end. TI CAILLOU saved ground throughout the backstretch from the inside, then bid from the three path on the turn,
shifted out to the five path and was closing well but it was too little too late. BLINGO vied for the lead from the inside, was in a hard drive to gain command
leaving the bend, was used up and weakened in late stretch. VALDINA DREAMS chased the pace while three wide, then settled back in late back stretch,
bid on the turn and was no threat. HARPER HOUSE vied for the lead between rivals into the turn, continued to rally gamely, brushed an outer in the early
stretch then gave way in the end. BINDING HEART chased the pace while two wide down the early backstretch, then settled back and continued to flatten
out throughout the turn. SIR LANCELOT RIDGE settled in the two path behind the field and needed rally. NATURAL HIGH vied for the lead while three
wide, was rallying gamely on the turn, was in tight in the early stretch and gave way in the end.

Footnotes
MEDIMPACT pressed the pace from two wide to upper stretch, engaged the front runner in a duel down the lane and inched away determinedly. WOODY'S
CHOICE sped to the lead quickly away from the gate, was constantly under pressure from the winner, dug-in gamely when put to a drive in the lane but was
out-finished in deep stretch. FREEPORT chased the leaders throughout and finished willingly to be best of the rest. DUSTINS DENILE broke a step tardy
while seemingly off balance, raced up four wide in the clear down the backside, dove to the fence entering the turn to make a strong middle move and
flattened out in the stretch. EL SMOOCH unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and found his best stride late in the lane surging near the wire.
MINISTER MAZ tracked the leaders from four wide in the turn and never mounted a challenge. CHANGING TIMES was difficult to load, flashed brief speed
for a quarter mile and was through early. COOL BLUE broke slow and never threatened. MORE THAN EASY was never a factor.
