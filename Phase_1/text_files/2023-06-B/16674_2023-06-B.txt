TWO ANGELS forced the pace issue as the widest of four abreast along the backstretch and around the bend, headed the front runner at upper stretch, and
bested that rival in final sixteenth for the score. GENUINE DRAFT broke alertly, established the inside line and saved ground around the bend, led the field
in concert at upper stretch, but was outdueled in final strides. MISS TYRO rushed from outset and gained first command, led the field into the turn while
trekking three wide, rated close up and between rivals at upper stretch, but failed to sustain the bid in closing stages. OUTWORKTHEOKIEGIRL trailed from
outset, passed tiring rival, and failed to menace. LYNN'S FOLLY was hustled along the backstretch, rated close up and two wide at the head of the turn,
was shuffled back mid turn, and rapidly faded in the homestretch.

Footnotes
LAMENTABLE JARIN was unhurried through the opening bend, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch, swung five wide through the closing turn,
had command at upper stretch, and finished under a stiff drive to be inching away at the end. MS. MORENA showed reserve in the early going, steadily
advanced on the front runners along the backstretch, trekked three wide around the final turn, and finished with strong strides to secure the place.
DIAMOND GAL rushed from the break and established a ground saving stance, maintained that line into the final turn, was in tight nearing the eighth pole,
and rallied mildly to earn the show. COMPUTER VIRUS flashed early foot and led the field through the opening half while saving ground, was headed
midway through the final bend, and failed to sustain the bid in final furlong. YOUNEEDTOCALMDOWN came up empty after pressing the pace from a four
wide pose.

MY GOLDEN PRIZE shared early command as the outer rival of three abreast, gained command along the backstretch, tucked to save ground through the
closing bend, and just held off the rallying rival in late strides to procure the victory. BROOKE'S ALL IN settled into mid pack and savid ground in early
stages before rallying strongly two wide at upper stretch to be nosed out and just miss the score. BRYANS SONG gave chase from a trailing stance through
the opening half, rated three wide at upper stretch and earned the show with a late gain. NITRO NINA pressed the early pace as the widest rival in the early
stages, rated two deep and within striking distance at upper stretch, but failed to produce a rally in closing strides. GOTOTHEWINDOW flashed early foot,
led the field at first call, and steadily faded thereafter.

EXCITING stalked the pacesetter from a three wide pose around the opening bend, circled foes near the quarter pole, led the field at upper streth, and
finished under a stiff drive for the score. HOODOO BROWN was unhurried through the opening half while trekking an inside line, angled out at upper
stretch, and was gaining on leaders at finish. LIMBO'S PROMISE broke alertly, shared command through the opening half while saving ground, but couldnt
match strides with eventual winner in final sixteenth. RONALD DALE showed reserve and trailed the field through the opening half before closing with a rush
to improve placing. REMEMBER ME TONY came up empty after pressing the early pace from a two path stance and swinging four deep at upper stretch.

WILBERT gained first command, trekked the inside, and never relished for a wire to wire score. NEEDABETTERJOCK settled in behind the pacesetter,
travelled the two path as the lone rival in second flight, but couldnt catch the leader in the end. MONET'S DEVIL saved ground to no avail. MAJOR GRIFFIN
trekked the three path, gave chase from a back rated stance, and failed to threaten the leader. LITTLE SOLDIER BOY trailed from outset and was no
menace.

Footnotes
SARA'S SAPPHIRE established an inside pose shortly after the start, set the pace in tandem through the opening half, was headed near the eighth pole,
latched into a stretch duel and showed courage in final sixteenth for the score. MO ARETHA staked the pacesetting trio around the first bend, gained
command near the eighth pole, locked into a stretch duel, but was outdueled in losing strides. SCRAPPY PATCH showed reserve and rated three wide in a
back rated flight through the opening half before closing fast and improving placing in the late going. FREYAS CATZ was unhurried and settled into the back
rated flight between rivals, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch, and was gaining on leaders at finish. MUSTANGMAGNA flashed early foot and
rated between rivals around the first turn and along the backstretch before tiring in the crucial portion of contest. JOSIES SCORE settled into the back rated
flight through the opening half, trekked the inside line and was no threat. SHE'S A PLAYER was hurried from outset and pressed the pace as the outer rival
of three abreast through the opening half before retreating rapidly in the closing stages.

Footnotes
MEGA BOND rallied along the rail for the score after looming on the heels of the pacesetters through the opening half. SHIPMAN'S SONG rushed from
outset, set the pace while trekking the two path, led the field into the homestretch, but couldnt fend off the rallying rival in closing strides. WHIP pressed the
early pace as the widest rival of all through the opening turn, rated close up at upper stretch, but was outfinished by top pair in final sixteenth. OUR
CORNERSTONE settled into mid pack, travelled wide early, and was best of rest but could not catch top trio in the end. CATALE STORM gave chase from
a three path stance and finished evenly. CHARING CROSS was unhurried and trailed the field through the opening call before improving placing with strong
late interest. HUNTER'S LEGACY lost ground to front runners with a wide journey. OKIE UNION faded rapidly in the latter portion of contest after flashing
early speed and disputing the pace from a three path pose.
