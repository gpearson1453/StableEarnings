Footnotes
DRUNK TEXT took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and
was kept alert through the stretch. UNCLE PRESS stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close off
the rail on the far turn but proved no match in the stretch. COMEONTURNMELOOSE stalked from the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly to take third late stretch. CALLISTO'S BRIGADE stalked off the rail, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. I SEE NOTHING saved ground, gave chase approaching the
three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. KING OF LUCK rounded the opening turn in the five path, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. SENZA STRIKE hesitated at least a full length leaving the gate
then saved ground. Meetmarysman became fractious in the gate and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
MUAD'DIB stalked inside, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased around HERO'S MAN entering the stretch and
dug in to get up the final yards. The latter took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole and maintained
a clear advantage at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but gave up the lead in the final yards. FANCY CONCHO rated
close off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened the final sixteenth.
COMMAND THE CAT rated close two deep, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but flattened inside the eighth pole. BUBBA GRUMP was
unprepared for the start and broke in the air, settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, entered the far turn near the rail
but angled to the six path toward the head of the lane and showed little more. BOASTER saved ground. SHAMELESS RISK rated close in the four path the
first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn.

Footnotes
LITTLE BIT OF THAT took the lead leaving the chute and set a clear pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was kept alert through the stretch.
FORTES gave chase through the backstretch, improved at the rail on the turn and cleared second past the eighth pole. INCLUDE THE BEAST chased,
raced two deep on the turn, angled to the six path entering the stretch and came along for third later yards. SISTER'S DUTY chased through the
backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. THUNDER PUNCH gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and showed
little in the lane. CAPTAIN SAM chased toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five and six paths then weakened. SCARLET TANAGER was never a
factor. SALTY SAUL was not a factor. SUPER WILDCAT became anxious in the gate then saved ground.

widened at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. DIAL HER raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid past the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the five path, dug in leaving the turn and got up for second the final strides. SKYFLY saved ground close to the pace, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was nipped from second in the final strides. MIDNIGHT REGRET settled close two deep,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. HELLUVA LADY saved ground, picked up the
chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. BONNIE BLUETOOTH raced in the four path the
first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and weakened in the lane. ANATH saved ground on
the first turn and faded through the backstretch. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY came away awkwardly, raced in the three path the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch.

about the three path and showed little in the lane. COMIDA COMIDA pressured the early pace and took a brief lead at the five sixteenths pole, but dropped
back toward the quarter pole, rounded the turn three wide then flattened inside the eighth pole. HOV LANE chased, raced off the rail on the turn and showed
little in the lane. BALLYMENA set a pressured early pace, was met a the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn but was caught nearing the head
