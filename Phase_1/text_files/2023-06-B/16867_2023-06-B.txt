Footnotes
COURTINGCOURTNEY settled near the back three wide around the first turn, advanced smartly three deep outside horses down the backstretch, rallied in
the same path midway on the far turn to take control at the top of the lane and kept to the task late to hold safe at the finish. SILENT LUCIDITY took
command on the rail into the first turn, relaxed behind the pacesetter on the fence down the back straight, started to move between foes in the three path
turning for home, posed the only danger in upper stretch but could not threaten the winner at the wire. GRAND GIZMO threw his head on the break to have
a poor start, went from three wide into the first turn to lead on the rail down the backside in an soft opening pace, continued to set the fractions on the far
turn, was headed by the winner at the top of the stretch and finished up on the fence to hold for third at the end. ROCKLAND EXPRESS prompted the pace
just outside early on, was content to track outside off the frontrunner with a half mile to run, was ridden between horses midpoint on the final turn, could not
match strides with the closing runners on either side but still had enough left to save a minor placing in the end. SOCIAL JUSTICE trailed the field in the first
turn, was unhurried at the back with a half mile remaining, began to find stride three wide at the quarter marker, angled six deep for the stretch run and
passed weary foes in the stretch. I AM RESILIENT stalked near the rear in the two path down the back straight, was roused at the three eighths pole, made
little impact and was not a factor running to the wire. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) travelled on the rail in mid pack in the early stages of the race, made little
impression inside through the far turn and was not involved to the drive to the finish line.

Footnotes
GALLOPING D'ORO was forwardly-positioned chasing the leader from between runners early while encouraged along some, dropped back coming past the
half, went three to four wide on the turn, moved out six wide at the top of the stretch, came again with late stride to drive past nearing the wire. TOWN'S
WARRIOR switched off the inside early and moved forward stalking from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, came out another path into upper stretch,
ground on to bid about seventy yards from the wire but was outfinished. ROYAL QUALITY veered in a bit just after the start then quickly moved clear to
dictate terms, extended the advantage some late on the turn racing off the rail, had no extra in deep stretch. KID MARVELOUS was a bit reluctant to load,
bobbled just slightly at the start, stalked from off the inside before shifting to the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, ran on evenly
inside but was too late for show honors. CELENTANO tracked from inside foes off the leader racing just off the rail on the turn, came out four wide in upper
stretch and ran on. PROUD RONIN broke a half-step slowly, lacked early speed racing inside, swung seven wide into the stretch, needed more. CADFAEL
was forwardly-positioned stalking outside, moved in a bit going three wide on the turn, failed to rally. ITS JUST MONEY broke a step slowly, raced outside a
foe at the back, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
THE ARCADIAN WAY took control from the onset, opened up on rivals at the five sixteenth pole, had a comfortable advantage at the top of the lane and
was ridden out through the stretch to hold off the closing runner at bay in the final furlong. I'M INTO MISCHIEF travelled three wide outside horses down the
backside, commenced a run around foes three furlongs from home, loomed the threat running in the four path turning for home and could not really narrow
the gap to the finish besting the rest in the end. WINGS FROM ABOVE chased the frontrunning winner inside at the beginning, was then reined back at the
half shifting outside in the two path entering the turn, was nudged on the go after the loose leader at the quarter pole and could not make gains running
evenly in the stretch while holding onto show. ADORA travelled at the back with runners on either side in this compact field with a half remaining, offered a
mild run outside midpoint on the turn and could not be a contender running to the finish. POPNFIZZ settled on the rail near the rear in hand behind foes into
the turn, was shuffled inside to see the field into the stretch, could not really get interested in the drive to the wire, did not switch leads but was not that far
beaten for third money at the finish.

Footnotes
CLEOMENES settled toward the back, went four wide on the turn beginning to pick it up, quickened in the lane to drive past late. SYSTEMATIC set the
pace off the rail while hounded early by an outside foe, edged away from that one on the turn, was clear leaving the bend and into upper stretch where put
to urging, shortened stride late and was caught. AMERICAN GAMBLE hounded the pacesetter early from outside racing two to three wide, lost ground on
the turn and even more by upper stretch but kept on willingly late. WINYAH BAY settled off the pace, moved out from three to five wide late on the turn and
a bit wider for the drive, improved position. OLD SECRETS broke a bit awkwardly and a step slowly, settled inside advancing some to maintain contact with
the trailers, saved ground on the turn, angled four wide turning for home, ran on. FANTAIL (GB) had forward position stalking the leading pair three to four
wide early, came up empty. SONET'S NAME bobbled just slightly while breaking a step slowly, was guided forward advancing inside, saved ground on the
turn just off the leader, dropped back and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
JOYA DE ORO took control after the first sixteenth, comfortably set the fractions on the turn, opened up on rivals when asked in mid stretch and kept on
going to hold off rivals at the finish. LEGS LIKE FLATTER broke sharp to lead after the start, tracked the winner at the half mile marker, was hard ridden
between foes two furlongs from the finish, looked to be the only threat running between horses at the top of the stretch and determinedly continued to chase
the winner at the finish. MAGICAL TRICK had a good spot behind the top two down the backstretch on the rail, lost ground on the leaders throughout the
turn, was roused for more run at the quarter pole and showed good late energy to close in and just win the nod capturing third. DIXIERIBSY stumbled soon
after the break, recovered to track outside three wide in the third flight, advanced smartly around foes on the turn to be in the hunt five wide at the top of the
lane and ran greenly through the stretch just missing holding onto third money at the finish line. DYNA'S FLATTER had no early speed settling near the rear
in the beginning, could not get involved through the turn inside and passed a couple of runners at the top of the lane. SCORED was unhurried to trail the
field outside down the backstretch, could not reach contention running on the turn and finished up evenly to the wire. IMPRESSIVE STYLE was urged
between runners two deep in midfield at the half trying to keep position, could not make any headway on rivals running throughout the turn and retreated in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
MISS SPEEDY shadowed the pacesetter from outside in the early going, went three wide on the turn, edged closer taking command outside the
three-sixteenths, quickly kicked clear and held sway. GAMBLE'S SILVER settled mid-pack racing outside, advanced to be with the second group late on the
turn racing four wide, was no match for the winner but second best. TALK TO YA LATER was reserved inside at the rear, came out a bit turning for home,
angled out further in upper stretch for room, kicked into high gear and was finishing best of all to get up for show but too late to threaten the top pair. OL'
BLONDIE got away alertly, set the pace racing well off the rail shadowed by the eventual winner, was guided in to the two path entering the turn, was
overtaken by that one at the top of the stretch, fought on gamely but simply had no extra and just got the nod for fourth. SOUPER FLASHY angled in
heading up the backstretch, advanced inside at the half to race just off the leaders in behind, saved ground on the turn and ridden by the quarter pole, came
out about three wide past the furlong marker, kept on evenly and just missed the nod to round out the super. SOUPER PECAN chased but was outsprinted
early, moved out from three to five wide on the turn swinging six to seven deep by upper stretch, ran on. DIAMOND CRUSH was in just a hair tight at the
start, settled at the back, advanced outside foes four to six wide on the turn, swung out seven to nine wide for the drive, ran on. ARTIE'S PRINCESS stalked
from between runners in the second flight on the turn racing close up and in behind the leading pair, faded in the stretch. PLEASURE'S GOLD raced
between foes at the back going two to four wide, failed to rally. SACRED DANCER was in just a bit tight along the rail early, was not a threat.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN LAD was situated outside horses four deep down the backstretch, went around rivals four wide while in hand with three eighths to go, had a
comfortable lead at the top of the lane and cruised home for an impressive victory. ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN tracked in mid pack with runners on either
side with a half remaining, was shuffled back some in the turn, between foes was on hold at the quarter pole, had running room four wide with three
sixteenths from home and closed well to be second best crossing the line. COLONEL MUSTARD settled in the middle of the pack in the beginning, waited
inside behind the engaging foursome on the turn, was blocked behind horses at the top of the stretch, found room at the furlong pole and closed well to
capture third money. AGILE DANCER trailed the field down the back straight, started to run angling outside at the quarter marker, shifted out pushing his
way through to the six path turning for home and was one paced through the stretch to the finish. ROCK BULLET travelled near the back just off the fence
down the backside, begun to rally outside horses at the two furlong pole, was floated out in the seven path for the drive and needed more late to be involved
at the wire. MIAH SAID stalked at the back in the beginning, offered an early move boldly going around foes at the five sixteenth pole, was in with a chance
five wide at the top of the lane and stalled in the final sixteenth. HUNGRY WOLF lead the field after the start, hounded the leader just sitting outside at the
half mile marker, bid between runners for the top spot midpoint on the turn and weakened inside in mid stretch to not be a factor late. SOCIETY'S
THUNDER prompted the pace three deep down the backside, poked his head in front battling with three others for the lead midway on the turn and tired in
the three path in upper stretch. LEGS LIKE GIZMO pressed the pace inside at the start, took over the lead under a good hold on the fence at the half,
battled inside for the front entering the turn, was swallowed up by many outside runners at the five sixteenths pole, lost his rail path in mid stretch, was
steadied sharply and galloped to the finish.

TRADING BAY settled off the leaders outside, went four wide into the turn, moved out five wide turning for home making a bid at the top of the stretch,
dueled gamely and prevailed under urging over. BEYOND MYBUDGET , who got away just a hair slowly then was encouraged forward, stalked the
pacesetter three wide into the turn, bid at the top of the stretch in conjunction with the winner, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, fought on but was outfinished.
OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE ran up keenly on heels of a rival nearing the four and one-half and stepped on the brakes switching out two wide, tracked in behind
two to three wide on the turn, came out nearing the sixteenth for room and kept on. HELL N WILD shifted in tracking the pace from inside, saved ground,
lacked the needed late kick. HAI BOBBI settled at the rear near the inside, angled out six wide in the stretch, ran on. MIMI'S GOLDEN RING moved clear
and shifted in to the two path setting the pace from off the rail, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
LUZ DE LA LUNA was pinched back leaving the chute, travelled outside in the middle of the pack down the back straight, rallied three wide gaining on foes
midway through the turn, bid four deep at the top of the stretch and began to edge clear in the final sixteenth. WOODBINE WAY tracked just outside at the
half, continued to hound the pacesetter going around the turn, stubbornly dueled with foes on either side at the furlong marker but could not hold off the
closing winner late and had to settle for second best. CANADIANSWEETHEART cleared from the outside to take the field down the backside, had a narrow
advantage inside running on the turn, was headed outside by horses at the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly late to settle for third. KAVALA stalked near
the back on the rail in the beginning, took closer order to be behind the leading pack into the turn, was shuffled back at the three furlong marker, regrouped
angled out six wide for the drive and found her best stride late closing in deep stretch. BILLYJANE settled inside behind the leader down the backside, lost
ground not keeping pace to the leaders and could not find another gear on the fence to be involved at the finish. GABBY SQUARED was void of early speed
to trail down the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and finished up with some interest passing a rival down the lane. GOGO SHOES was on hold in
between rivals near the back entering the turn, was ridden for more at the three furlong marker, offered a mild run until the eighth pole and weakened in the
late stages of the race.
