Footnotes
KING ALFREDO was away a bit slow at the start, had good position outside in mid pack down the back straight, loomed the threat two furlongs from the
wire, took control at the furlong marker and stubbornly prevailed by a head at the finish. THREEFIFTYSEVEN was nestled behind the frontrunner early on,
rated kindly inside on the turn waiting to pounce behind the leader, had no room and was blocked straightening out for the stretch run, pushed through at the
eighth pole and was full of run but unfortunately lost the nod in a photo at the wire. NEWPORT AGENT was on the rail near the back down the backstretch,
continued on the rail making some gains on the leaders at the top of the lane, was behind horses at the quarter pole, shifted out to the five path finding a
seam with three sixteenths to run and closed well late to be involved at the wire for the win but settling for a clear third in the end. GENDRAGON trailed the
field just outside down the backside, saved ground through the turn, still could see the field in the five path at the furlong marker and passed tired rivals late
for a minor share. FROSTED ICING settled near the back three deep in the early going, angled out six wide for the stretch drive to be have clear run and
was not involved late running evenly to the finish. JIBARO took command from the start, set the fractions comfortably on the front end, was collared running
on the rail at the three sixteenths marker by runners and stopped in the final sixteenth of a mile. SMALL TALK prompted the pace outside in the two path
keeping a close eye on the pacesetter throughout the turn, was in the hunt turning for home between runners two deep, gave way at the furlong marker and
tired in deep stretch.

Footnotes
YACHT BOY broke in at the start, took control soon afterwards leading the field at the half, dictated the pace well in hand running on the turn, opened up
when roused in mid stretch and cruised home at the wire. FOREST WOODSMAN chased the leader outside down the backside, was hard ridden to go after
the loose frontrunner at the quarter pole, posed the only threat at the top of the lane, could not find another gear to threaten the winner late but bested the
rest at the finish. SIESTA BEACH settled near the rear two deep at the half mile marker, kept pace with running between rivals at the three furlong pole and
offered a good closing finish to capture third money in the end. JUMBOTRON broke inwards to begin, stalked near the rear four deep down the backstretch,
offered a strong run around horses at the three eighths marker closing the gap on the leaders to be in range of the top two turning for home but stalled at the
furlong marker. HATMAKER GIZMO was pushed in at the break, settled between rivals three deep down the backside near the rear, was shuffled back
entering the turn and showed some late interest outside horses in deep stretch. ZIPPY GIZMO was squeezed at the start trailing down the backstretch, took
closer order on runners through the turn but could still see the field turning for home and finished up with some energy to be involved for the minors at the
end. COMPUTER HACKER was brushed outside at the start, had a good spot on the rail watching the top two at the half, was ridden for more inside
midway on the turn, could not keep up with others and retreated on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RON'S GIZMO moved to the lead after the opening sixteenth and was quickly clear, dictated terms racing in the two path, met the bid of a rival in upper
stretch and moved clear again then held safe to the wire. SPIRIT ANIMAL settled in the back half of the field early, shifted in racing about two wide into the
turn saving some ground, angled seven to eight wide turning for home, was gaining outside but too late. SALVATOR MUNDI was bumped just lightly at the
start, rated mid-pack off the leading group, was allowed to go on and advanced four to five wide three furlongs out, bid for the lead at the three-sixteenths
but evened out thereafter. DRAGON'S BREW broke best of all but ceded the lead content to stalk from outside, was within range three to four wide on the
turn, drifted in a bit and evened out in the stretch. LAPOCHKA settled off the leaders racing outside, went five to six wide on the turn edging closer coming
to the top of the stretch, kicked on evenly. DECIMATOR angled in early bringing up the rear racing just off the rail, swung seven wide into the stretch,
passed tired rivals. RACE FOR PINKS bumped a rival lightly at the start, tracked the leader from between runners two to three wide, faded in the lane. H C
HOLIDAY tracked from inside on or just off the rail, faded. CANADIAN PHAROAH raced outside toward the back, went three to four wide on the turn
swinging eight deep into upper stretch, failed to menace. SAILOR'S PASSION moved forward inside under some early coaxing, was just a bit boxed in
entering the turn, failed to rally.

ARMS was allowed to settle trailing the field down the backside, shifted off the rail three wide going around runners smartly with five sixteenths remaining,
angled out five deep turning for home and wore down the leaders through the stretch to get up in the last jump. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI settled in midfield
outside rivals in the four path down the back straight, took up the chase midpoint on the turn, quickly closing the gap on the contesting leaders to bid four
wide at the top of the lane, took command at the furlong marker briefly but could not hold off the closing outside winner in deep stretch. GOLD MAGIC broke
sharp leading in the beginning , was content hounded the pace at the half mile marker, engaged outside to duel up front for the lead, began to edge away
from the early pace rival two furlongs from the wire, braced for the closers outside at the top of the lane, could not find more to hold them off and gave way
grudgingly in the final sixteenth. UNCAPTURED MOMENT was off slow to begin, settled near the rear down the backstretch, was scrubbed on the rail at the
three furlong pole, made little headway on rivals throughout the turn and passed tired runners in the stretch drive. MUSICAL SPELL was headstrong while
being throttled down in mid pack three wide tracking the contesting duo at the half, was then hard ridden with five sixteenths remaining, offered no response
and stopped at the quarter pole. CLASSIC DANCER pressed inside for the lead leaving the chute, poked his head in front entering the turn, battled inside
with three furlongs to go, was roused to keep up at the quarter marker and yielded on the fence at the eighth pole.

COTTON moved to the lead just after the start, set the pace racing off the rail, dug in through the lane and held the lone challenger at bay. NIAGARA
SKYLINE rated inside tracking the eventual winner, came out at the three-sixteenths with aim on that one, could make no headway but was second best.
BEAU GUEST settled mid-pack racing near the inside into the turn, came out gradually through the stretch seeking room, kept on to get up for show honors.
LENNY K lacked early speed, angled in early, saved ground on the turn racing well back of the leaders, improved position inside late. FOUR ACES HIGH
stalked the eventual winner while kept quite wide early, moved in three deep entering the turn, could not kick on and drifted out a bit in late stretch.
PRICELESS WILL raced mid-pack inside a foe going three to four wide on the turn, moved out past the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch seven to
eight deep and ran on. GALVASTON settled at the back racing outside, went three to four wide on the turn, angled eight to nine deep in upper stretch, was
never near enough to threaten. U S ARMY CORPS raced off the inside at the back going two to three wide on the turn, came out eight wide turning into
upper stretch, failed to menace. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE advanced outside foes five wide on the turn reaching striking distance nearing the top of the
stretch, faltered and faded.

INSCRUTABLE rated kindly under a snug hold on the rail four furlongs from the finish, rallied on the fence at the three eighths pole, bid four wide at the top
of the lane and drew off in the late stages of the race. SARAH'S DANCER hesitated at the start, settled mid pack between horses down the backside, split
foes midpoint on the far turn starting to rally, was full of run in the final furlong and closed well to be second best. BRIEF was unhurried trailing the field in
the early stages of the race, still could see the field five wide at the top of the stretch, found her best stride late and closed in the be a solid third at the wire.
LIPLOCK was in a good spot on the rail watching the top duo down at the half, started to rally three wide with seven sixteenths to the wire, was in the hunt
five wide turning for home and finished evenly for a minor share. MAP took command from the start, set the fractions down the backside, was headed
outside two furlongs from the finish, could not find another gear to fend off the closers in upper stretch and faded on the rail. SENSATIONAL SARAH
prompted the pace two wide in the first turn, was content to sit behind the frontrunner down the back straight, assumed the lead outside at the quarter pole,
was collared with a furlong to go and tired in the final sixteenth. KNOTTY AND NICE travelled five wide into the first turn, stalked outside three deep in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch, made little impact outside runners on the final turn and was not a presence through the stretch run. TELLTALE
had a good position tracking two wide into the first turn, could not natch strides with runners at the three furlong marker and backed away midpoint on the far

Footnotes
MOHAWK TRAIL broke sharply then settled into stride tracking the pace between runners two to three wide into the turn, came into upper stretch four deep,
found room between to bid and take command near the furlong marker, quickly kicked clear and held under steady handling. UP AND DOWN shifted in
early with forward position tracking the pace, saved ground biding time through the turn, bid inside foes up the rail in mid-stretch, got the nod for second.
LAST CALL settled at the back outside a foe, moved out leaving the turn fanning six wide into the stretch, gained to reach contention by the eighth pole,
missed the place. RYDER RYDER RYDER pressed the pace from outside racing three to five wide, edged closer willingly taking the lead by the quarter
pole, drifted in a few paths in upper stretch, was overtaken by mid-stretch and outkicked. SECRET MONEY switched off the hedge in the early going as a
rival moved in, keenly moved forward but lacked room at the five- and one-half, continued at the back inside and behind runners through the turn, shifted out
a bit turning into upper stretch then angled eight deep near the furlong grounds, finished well but too late. FEARLESS ANGEL rated off the pace in the early
going, went three to four wide on the turn coming into upper stretch five deep and within striking distance, lacked the needed late kick. COLLECTING
FLATTER moved forward from between runners to take the early led, set the pace racing just off the rail, drifted out a bit turning into the stretch, was soon
overtaken, checked when in tight between runners at the three-sixteenths and continued to weaken thereafter.

Footnotes
LOYALTY had a perfect trip in this small field watching the dueling leaders down the backstretch, waited to push to button until the quarter pole when
cruising by the contesting early leaders three wide, opened up easily turning for home and won comfortably finishing on the wrong lead to the wire.
AMBASSADOR LUNA hopped at the start spotting the field, was unhurried on the rail trailing runners down the backstretch, started to gather in horses two
furlongs from home, burst between rivals in the three path at the top of the lane and closed in to be a non threatening second best at the finish. HARD
EDGE battled on the rail for the front down the backside, continued to be hounded outside will narrowly on top throughout the turn, was headed by the
winner at the quarter pole, stubbornly fought on inside at the top of the lane and held for show in the end. IMAGERY was a little eager fighting the rider at
the half mile pole, was relaxed near the rear three wide stalking the top three horses into the turn, offered a mild run midway on the turn until straightening
out for the drive and levelled off five wide in the final furlong. FOREST DRIFT dueled for the lead with outside foe in the early going, was the first to give way
with runners on either side two furlongs from the finish and stopped in upper stretch.

mid-stretch four wide and taking the lead by the furlong marker, drifted about a bit then edged clear late. ZANA got away alertly, chased the leader in behind
racing near but just off the inside, came out three wide in the stretch, gained the place but was no match for the winner. THE NIIGON FACTOR was bumped
hard at the start into an outside rival then sent by the rider to take the lead and clear coming to the five-eighths, shifted in to dictate terms just off the rail,
was outkicked late. JUST ON TIME got away well while coming in a bit at the start, had the early lead briefly, steadily dropped back inside early on the turn,
came out in the stretch several paths and kept on under urging to garner the minor award. NEOLITHIC NATION bumped a rival at the start, moved forward
between foes on the turn three then four wide and in range of the lead, evened out in the stretch while drifting out a bit. YORKSHIRE pursued from mid-pack
racing two to three wide through the turn, came out just a bit in the stretch, needed more. CRYSTAL THE PISTOL raced mid-pack outside, moved out from
three to six wide by the end of the turn, ran on evenly in the lane. GET OUT THE VOTE angled in abruptly about the four- and one-half to the two to three
path, continued near but off the inside through the turn, ran on evenly. VICTORIOUS TAPIT was outpaced early, raced outside three to four wide on the
turn, came out seven to eight deep turning into upper stretch, went evenly and made no bid. DANZIGQUEEN was forced in a bit at the start, raced inside
early, came out for the stretch run, was never near enough to threaten. CANTHO was bumped lightly at the start, moved forward to stalk up close and
outside four to five wide on the turn, steadily weakened in the stretch. SHAYSTOWN hopped slightly at the start, raced off the pace going two to three wide
on the turn, came out six wide turning for home, failed to rally. DELAWANA PRINCESS raced outside four to five wide through the turn, failed to menace.
