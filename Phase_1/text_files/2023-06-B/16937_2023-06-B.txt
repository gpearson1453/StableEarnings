Footnotes
HOBNOBIN GENERAL trailed while along the inside into the far turn, angled four wide approaching the quarter pole, gained on the compact field into the
lane, caught the leader near the eighth pole and quickly cleared. CORONA GRANDE raced near the inside through the turn when never far back, bid into
the lane from the two path, split rivals late and was up for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. BRIGHT BRIAN set the pace along the inside into
the turn, was put under pressure from multiple rivals through the turn and into the lane, was no match for the closing winner then grudgingly gave ground
late to the place rival. JUANCHO stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, bid from the three or four path into the lane, was moving to the lead
just outside the eighth pole when collared by the winner then weakened. FRUITCAKE was two wide through the turn when never far back, came into the
lane from the four path and lacked a closing response. ROCK THE RED chased the pace from the two path through the turn then faded through the lane.
OVERTHETOPJUSTICE was three wide through the turn when never far back then tired through the final eighth.

COTIA led inside of horses in the two path, dueled through the stretch and prevailed under steady urging. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE pressed the pace
between foes to the stretch, dueled outside of the winner late and was outfinished. MRS. NUSHI pressed the pace in the four path, then gave way late.
MEDWAY QUEEN was off awkwardly, stalked the pace inside, then yielded in the stretch. INDAWIN stalked the pace in the five path, then faded.
HOPPESTRY was not a factor. The Stewards disallowed an objection by the rider of MRS. NUSHI against INCREDIBLE JUSTICE.

Footnotes
KAMIKAZE UMAGI was unhurried while along the inside, shifted from the two to the five path inside the eighth pole, angled in late, split rivals and was up in
time. YOU'RE KITTEN ME raced in the three path through the far turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path, loomed a serious threat with
an eighth to go then was outfinished by the winner. GOLD DEL MAR was in the two or three path through the far turn when unhurried, angled into the five
path for the drive and finished with good energy. HONOR CAT chased the pacesetters from the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane with
aim on the leaders and in the four path, appeared a serious menace with an eighth to go then weakened. MAIREAD set the pace while in the two path into
the far turn, cleared in mid-turn and into the lane then gave way. BOSSY JEANS was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the
five path, was put in tight soon after the eighth pole then was done. AFFECTIONATE pressed the pace along the inside into mid-turn then was empty for the
drive. SAKURA BLOSSOM moved up down the backstretch and into the turn while in the four path, continued in the five path into the lane when losing
momentum, drifted in and finished tired. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #6 BOSSY JEANS AGAINST THE RIDER OF #1 KAMIKAZE UMAGI FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STETCH RUN WAS DISALLOWED. THE FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
HOTHEADED PRINCESS was in the three path into the far turn when never far back, was asked for more in late turn, came into the lane from the four path,
caught the leader soon inside the eighth pole then edged clear. PENUMBRAS MAKER stepped out at the start bothering outside rival, saved ground down
the backstretch and into the far turn, bid two wide into the lane, led outside the eighth pole, stayed with the winner to inside the sixteenth pole then yielded to
that one while clear for the place spot. GUNS N' LILIES stepped in at the start, moved to set the lead into the first turn, continued on a clear lead through the
turn and into the lane, could not go with the top two while far clear of the next rival. SPRING LILACS was shut off at the start when rivals from inside and
outside squeezed her back, raced in the back while near the inside and was never a factor. CASH 'EM IN chased the pace from the two path through the
turn then faded through the lane. AGENT chased the pace from the three path into the far turn then was empty nearing the quarter pole.

the pace in the four path, bid in early stretch, led late but couldn't hold off the winner. CLOSER TOTHE TRUTH pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid
in early stretch but faltered. ANAITA raced in the seven path and bid belatedly. OUT OF PROMISES stumbled badly at the start, was back six lengths, bid
inside at the quarter pole and closed in the stretch. B FLAT OUT broke inward, raced in the three path, then faded. PANTALONES ENFUEGO was not a

Footnotes
PRINCE SHIM dropped in at the start, moved to the lead before the turn, cleared into the backstretch, continued on a clear lead down the backstretch and
into the turn while slowly increasing the advantage, well clear into the lane and slowly widened to the end. TOUR THE MOON was unhurried while off the
inside, continued in the three or four path into the far turn, bid four wide in late turn, came into the lane from the three or four path to get closest to the
winner, could not gain on that one while staying on to be clearly second best. BROKEN JUSTICE was in the four path through the far turn, came into the
lane from the five path and moved up to be best of the rest. INDIGO RICH stalked the winner while in the two path into the far turn, stayed close to the
inside into the lane and was empty. FOR MAMA chased the pace from the four path into the far turn, bid in mid-turn to get nearest the winner then was done
after entering the lane. COG was close up early through the turn and into the backstretch then began to lose ground after going a half.
SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN was forced in at the start, hustled up to chase the pace from the three path down the backstretch, continued in the three path
through the turn and was empty into the lane. GOODTIMEJUSTICE bobbled and was shut off at the start, raced up along the inside into the first turn and
was done soon after entering the backstretch.
