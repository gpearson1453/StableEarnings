Footnotes
PRINCE OF ROSES pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, bid in mid-turn, gained a short lead into the lane, kept the runner-up at bay through the
lane, cleared approaching the sixteenth pole, jumped gate tracks with seventy yards to go and maintained. BREAKOUT STAR stalked the duel into the far
turn, bid three wide in mid-turn, moved to the side of the winner into the lane, was floated into the five path entering the lane, continued with contact with the
winner to near the sixteenth pole and could not keep up. HINDOSTAIN FALLS vied for the lead along the inside through mid-turn, could not keep up with the
top two but stayed on to be best of the rest. FREAKY FRESH was in the two or three path through the turn while in mid-pack, shuffled back a bit into the
lane then moved up late while not a threat. SUPER LIAISON chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path
and lacked a bid. CIVILRIGHTSLEGEND never a factor while in the two path. MR. YASUDA never made an impact while racing near the inside.
GJALLARHORN saved ground through the turns and tired through the lane.

HOT LITTLE THING hopped slightly at the start, stalked the pace behind horses in the three path, split rivals to go to the rail at the top of the stretch, rallied
and was ridden out for the win. TRAFALGAR SHORE was unrushed in the three path, angled to the rail at the top of the stretch, rallied and gained the
place. CACTUS FLOWER dueled early in the two path, then couldn't hold off the closers. MISS LUV SHACK stalked the early pace in the three path, bid at
the three-eighths pole, then vied three wide briefly in the stretch. IMAGE RUN stalked early in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole and gave way in
the stretch. ROYAL TO BE dueled inside before fading at the top of the stretch. BREWSKY was not a factor.

Footnotes
FOREVER HOME stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, bid in late turn while still in the three path, gained the lead in upper stretch then
drew away while being ridden out then geared down late. MONTGOMERY PARK set the pace from the two path while under pressure from the inside early,
cleared in the turn while off the inside, was no match for the winner after straightening in the lane then stayed on to last for the place spot. JOAN'S WAY
was in the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path, could not gain on the leader and just missed the place spot.
SMOOTH LIKE ICE was in the two path through the turn, raced in the three path through the lane while offering a mild gain and moved up. BLOW SUM
SMOKE chased the pace from the four path through the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. MAMA LOU never a factor while in the three path
through the turn. EASYONMYEYES no factor while in the three to the two path through the turn. MISS BETTE LUTE was fractious in the gate and had to be
removed and reloaded, raced in the back while two wide and made no impact. SHAPE OF YOU pressed the early pace from the inside, chased through the
turn then faded along the rail.

Footnotes
HAVILDAR pressed the pace in the three path before drawing off in the stretch under steady urging. EL CERRITO led inside but was no match in the
stretch. MIDNIGHT WEST pressed the pace between rivals before giving way. QUIET RIDE saved ground, angled four wide at the quarter pole, then faded.
CHANCE stalked the early pace in the early path, then faded in the stretch. AUGUSTUS BLUE was not a factor. DANCERS PHAROAH stalked the pace for
a half mile in the four path and gave way.

KISSES SO SWEET vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, shook clear into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then held. Z ZS RED chased
the pace along the inside through the turn, cut the corner into the lane, came off the rail outside the eighth pole and was slowly gaining to the end but had to
settle for second best. LOVE DRUNK raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and offered a belated gain for the show
spot. SWEEPINJUSTICE trailed for half while off the inside, angled into the eight path for the drive and showed interest too late. SHARP JUSTICE raced in
the three path through the turn, shifted into the five path near the eighth pole, moved to a menacing position while three wide then weakened. NO DRAMA
MOMMA vied then settled just off to press the pace three wide into the turn, continued as a serious contender into late turn then faded. CORSIDAT led early
while dueling between rivals, continued to vie for the lead while two wide into the lane then faded. MAGNIFICENTREVENGE never a factor while in the two
or three path through the turn. CHINATOWN NANCY raced along the inside when well back and tired through the lane.
