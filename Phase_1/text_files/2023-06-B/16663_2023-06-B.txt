PUTTHEGLASSDOWN saved ground throughout, raced close up then wore down the pacesetters through the final furlong. LITTLE HARBOUR broke alertly
and was sent to the lead, shook loose in midstretch but was nailed nearing the wire. MACH TRIAL prompted the pace outside and continued gamely to the
finish. AHSAD settled three wide just off the pace then faded after half a mile. MAGNETRON dropped back early near the inside and was always outrun.
MANAHAWKIN lacked speed outside and weakened steadily.

pace outside, led in midstretch and continued gamely to the finish. PINE VALLEY hustled to the front inside and battled throughout in solid effort. LOOSE
GOOSE lacked speed outside then made a gradual late gain in the stretch. SMARTEN UP raced well off the dueling leaders then flattened out in the
stretch. LONG LEGGED BOY chased wide throughout and was never in contention. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE dropped back early and trailed throughout.

BACK TO D' FUTURE settled outside, bid on the turn, led into the stretch and pulled away while kept to her task. BET ON DRAMA close up outside, moved
with the winner on the turn then lasted for the place. PARADIGM SHIFT forced the pace three wide, rallied clear at the quarter pole and finished willingly.
SWEETEST MOMENT dropped far behind then offered some late energy. FIVE STAR FRAN held a narrow lead between rivals in the opening quarter and
faded. BIONIC KAT prompted the pace three then two wide and proved empty in the stretch. WILD KEYLIMAR flashed speed inside then steadied
retreating on the turn. GLADIATORA trailed early and was always outrun. BAHAMIAN SKY stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
PRAETORIAN GUARD trailed far behind, circled his field rallying on the turn then surged late to get up in time. FINALLY CAPTURED angled inside on the
turn, moved clear briefly in midstretch but was caught nearing the wire. MCCRAKENS GHOST outrun early, swung very wide into the stretch rallying. BLUE
ROYAL saved ground, was bumped and forced out in midstretch and lacked a further response. NAVY RULES set a clear pace for half a mile, came out in
the stretch bumping and crowding foes and tired. UNCLE DAR prompted the pace outside then was bothered tiring in the stretch. AMUSING MISCHIEF
forced the pace three wide to the stretch and stopped. Following a stewards inquiry into the stretch run and claims of foul by the trainer of UNCLE DAR
against the fourth and fifth finishers, NAVY RULES was disqualified and placed sixth for interference in the stretch.
