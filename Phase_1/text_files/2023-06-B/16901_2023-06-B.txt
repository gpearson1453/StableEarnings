Footnotes
SAY IT NICELY broke on top and quickly took on the challenge of GONE WITH THE FINN soon after the start, vied for the lead two wide into the turn,
began to edge away then took on the challenge of the inside running SHUT UP MAN near the quarter pole, battled on through the lane, SHUT UP MAN held
a slight edge a furlong out, dug in determinedly and edged by approaching the wire. SHUT UP MAN was well placed stalking the top pair into the turn,
moved up along the rail leaving the quarter pole and challenged SAY IN NICELY for the lead, dueled gamely along the inside down the lane, held the edge
a furlong out then got denied in final strides. DISCREET INVASION tracked the top trio in early stages and remained unleashed around the turn, swung four
wide into the lane, gathered strong momentum under firm handling, finished gamely and closed fast on the top pair. COLORFUL NATIVE raced off the early
pace, saved ground around the turn, remianed inside and failed to move on. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE raced off the pace, hustled along two wide around
the turn and failed to move into contention. GONE WITH THE FINN dueled with SAY IT NICELY strides out of the gate and battled on into the turn, could
not match strides with eventual winner past the five sixteenth pole and steadily retreated.

BIG BAD DIVA raced three wide into the first turn and settled nicely tracking the early leaders, edged closer late on the far turn, given cue four wide entering
the stretch run, dueled for command down the lane, dug in gamely and edged by CLAY"S MOON STONE in final stages. CLAY'S MOON STONE was
forwardly placed two wide around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, let out a notch and engaged ELUSIVE AMELIA for the lead with
three furlongs left to run, dueled around the far turn and continued to battle down the lane with the added challenge of BIG BAD DIVA, dueled heads apart
into late stages then lacked a closing kick. MOLLY'S ANGEL saved ground around the first turn, stalked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along the
rail in the far turn then shifted out a path turning for home, moved up into striking distance a furlong out, stayed on with response but could not get by the top
pair. ELUSIVE AMELIA sprinted to the lead out of the gate and led the way around the first turn, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, took on the
challenge of CLAYS MOONSTONE with three furlongs left to run, dueled along the inside into the lane, took on the added challenge of BIG BAD DIVA in
upper stretch, battled on to the sixteenth pole then gave way. SWEET LAURA trailed the field and never reached contention.

ALPINE ASH raced in contention and saved ground along the inside entering the turn, tipped out three wide entering the head of the lane, roused forward
into closer contention, took command past the sixteenth pole and held late over oncoming runner up. SHE'S NOT A JOKE veered inward and steadied at
the start, raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane, gained position and ran on evenly past the furlong marker, found more in reserve in deep
stretch, finished willingly and closed fast on the winner. RUN WITH PRIDE sped to the lead soon after the start, held a slim lead around the turn, dug in and
widened advantage in upper stretch then got outkicked approaching the final sixteenth. X RAY VISION was off to a good start and raced in striking distance
of the early leader, remained forwardly placed two wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane then flattened out near mid-stretch. CONVALIDATION
was not far back in the early going, hustled up around the turn, swung three wide into the lane and failed to kick on. FORGOT THE ROSES raced off the
pace, was ridden along three wide into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. NO COST showed response in early stages, flattened around the turn and
continued to tire in the drive.

BLOW TORCH was forwardly placed between rivals in the opening quarter, hustled along two wide into the lane, angled to the rail approaching the furlong
marker, dueled with PENETRATOR into late stages then edged ahead to a slim lead and held gamely. PENETRATOR was well rated sitting just off the
early leaders, moved up to challenge for command approaching the quarter pole, hustled along into the lane, gained a slim lead a furlong from home,
continued to battle holding a slight edge then got denied in final strides. REPLETE rated just off the early leaders, advanced along the rail entering the turn,
briefly held the lead then took on a trio of rivals at the quarter pole, came out a path in upper stretch, got collared for the lead at the eighth pole but
continued to put in a good effort. ABUNDANT tracked the early pace, loomed up three wide at the quarter pole, flattened in upper stretch then showed
response in closing stages. FEROCITY chased up close in early stages, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. UNBOWED led the way
up the backstretch, came up empty around the turn and steadily retreated.

gaining on the lead, cleared command a furlong out and pulled away. ANNUAL BUDGET pressed the pace in early stages then weakened upon entering

wide around the turn, continued in striking distance in upper stretch then evened out late. ROWDY RAY raced off the early pace, hustled up along the
outside around the turn, swung six wide into the lane, finished with response in the final stages and just missed show. DOT COM DREAMIN tracked the top
flight along the inside, steadied leaving the backstretch and quickly weakened, launched a two wide rebid in upper stretch and had a mild improve. C R
INSTA GATOR raced up close in early stages, launched a bid at the quarter pole, vied in upper stretch, remained in contention into the final furlong then
gave way. AIN'T SO BAD broke on top and quickly came under pressure, vied for the lead up the backstretch, battled back around the turn and into upper
stretch then came up empty in the final furlong. LANCELOT N ELAINE vied for the early lead along the inside, continued to battle for command around the
turn, fought on into upper stretch then came up empty approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
HE'S A SHOWBOAT veered outward at the start and hustled up along the outside to race in early contention, moved up to challenge HIGGAM for the lead
midway around the turn, dueled along the outside into the lane, battled on gamely, poked a head in front at the sixteenth pole and edged away. HIGGAM
sprinted out to the lead in opening strides and continued to lead the way up the backstretch, took on the challenge of HE'S A SHOWBOAT midway around
the turn, dueled for command into the lane, fought back gamely from the inside but could not fend off the winner in final stages. ONE SOCK BILLY chased
the pace along the inside, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, tipped out three wide for the drive, sustained a steady bid and
captured show in final stride. BABYS TIME TO SING got in a bit tight between rivals soon after the start and raced off the early pace, gained closer
contention three wide around the turn, ran on into the lane and got nipped for show. POE MANS RIDE was in a bit tight racing two wide in early stages,
raced off the pace and saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide a furlong out and lacked a needed rally. SARAH'S BOY BLUE hustled along in early
stages and raced in contention, chased the top pair two wide around the turn then gave way. DAY MONEY raced off the pace, was ridden along three wide
around the turn and failed to respond. TAIL OF SAMSON showed response in opening stages then failed to keep pace and steadily retreated.
