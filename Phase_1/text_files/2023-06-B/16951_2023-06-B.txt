Footnotes
TROTTING GEAR tracked the early leader two deep, took command through the upper stretch and drew off to be well clear late under steady pressure.
SUBTLE FAITH rated along under a hold early on, moved up along the inside through the far turn, shifted out to race four deep through the stretch and got
up for the place position. MOON ROSE stalked the top pair from the outside, moved up five wide to take aim near the three sixteenths pole and flattened
out. SECRET OF SARATOGA showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and gave way in the drive. QUICKSTYLE was off slowly, raced
three to four wide through the stretch and never threatened. SHILOH was off a step slow, coaxed along early and lacked a bid. SHOW ME LOVE dropped
back early on, lost ground to race far back and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
HARRINGTON settled off the early going, made a strong three wide bid nearing the quarter pole and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. LYTE
CRUDE pressed the early pace three wide from the outside of foe, led briefly through the far turn, kept on but was no match for the winner. HIGH STAKES
rated along the inside, angled four wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late with no closing run. TWIRLING EXPRESS was in tight, shuffled back in
the early stages, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CHROME GHOST showed good early foot while racing between rivals early
and faded in the drive. MAKE DECISIONS was void of early speed, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.

Footnotes
SHE'S OUTTA HERE stalked the early pair, raced three to four wide in the lane and surged up late under strong pressure racing three to four wide.
RASMALAI quick to begin to set the early pace, was well clear near the eighth pole but was wore down in the latter stages to finish second best. SHALL
RETURN was off a step slow, moved up four past the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire. MABEE LUCKYNWILD settled off the early going, raced
three to four wide in the drive and moved up to improve position. CHECK THE GRADE coaxed along two deep to chase the early leader and weakened.
SUMMER HOME was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. SAMMY'S
TOWN was pulled up into the upper stretch and had to vanned off. RAW HONEY dropped back early, ran up the heels of a pullling up Sammy's Town in the
upper stretch, fell unseating his jockey, galloped across the wire and walked off the track under his own power.

Footnotes
FROSTY THE SOLDIER settled off the early going along the inside, angled six wide into the upper stretch finished strongly to get up under steady handling.
GREEN MILLENNIUM rated under a firm hold early, made a bold four wide near the quarter pole, led near the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner in
the latter stages to finish second best. SKY KATZ was off a step slow, raced off the early going, moved up four to five wide stretch run and kept on to the
wire. DONTKISSDAMINISTER was off a step slow, raced six wide into the upper stretch, angled in through the drive and improved position. EMERGENCY
RESPONSE tracked the top pair down the backstretch three deep and weakened through the drive. NORFIE prompt the early pace two deep from the
outside and gave way through the stretch run. NYQUEST NIX showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside and faltered in the drive.
FEROCIOUS BEAST raced six wide around the first turn, forwardly placed from the outside, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.
