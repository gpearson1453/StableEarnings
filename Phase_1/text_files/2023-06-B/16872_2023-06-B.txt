SIGNOFTHECROSS raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the
turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. FREDONIAN led the way from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
dueled while saving ground around the far bend, couldn't go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival to the wire. MISHKO saved ground early,
settled in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and finished evenly. CHEST CANDY
raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, navigated the far turn still in the four path and improved position mildly
in the stretch. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in the three
path and was outkicked in the lane. MAY WE ALL raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up
the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and faded from there. BIG LEAGUE BENNY raced in the two path early, trailed the field up
