Footnotes
PASSIONFORJUSTICE vied for the lead down the backstretch while between rivals, continued to vie for the lead through the far turn, shook clear into the
lane, widened to the sixteenth pole then geared down very late. TRIP CHARGE was in the four path through the first turn, continued off the inside through
the far turn when never far back, bid into the lane to get nearest the winner then stayed on while not a serious threat to the top one. NEW YEAR'S DELIGHT
was brushed at the start, raced off the rail through the first turn, settled to the back down the backstretch, was in the three path through the far turn, was
asked for more in late turn then improved position while not a serious menace. EULALIA vied for the lead three wide throughout, was still a serious threat in
mid-turn then faded. LUSH BE A LADY trailed into the turn while in the two path, shifted into the four or five path into the lane and never was a factor.
LIZZSAIDNO vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn and was done in mid-turn. SHES MY TREASURE raced on the two path through the far turn
and tired.

Footnotes
HAYTHERE JOGEEGIRL was clear early between rivals, was challenged at the top of the stretch and came back under steady urging. BALLOT INITIATIVE
was unrushed early, bid four wide at the top of the stretch and closed late outside, only to miss. SHE BE SHEEHAN broke sharply inside, bid at the quarter
pole and had a head in front briefly and was then outfinished. DALTON'S LOVE raced four wide with a mild late bid outside. TAYA ALLDAYA pressed the
pace in the three path before giving way in the stretch. SHE RANUP THE AMEX stalked the pace between rivals, then faded on the far turn.
WRAPPINJUSTICE was not a factor.

C F V BULLET set the pace while in the two path, repelled challenger into the turn, continued with a clear lead into the lane, was challenged by another near
the eighth pole, brushed with that one soon after then drew away. FORREST CITY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid in late turn,
moved closest with an eighth to go, was brushed just inside the eighth pole then could not keep up while staying on to be second best. FIRE BABY was in
the three path through the turn when not far back, asked for more in late turn and into the lane then lacked the needed response. AUTO GLIDE stalked the
winner into the turn while along the inside, was asked for more into the turn, got within a half length then was done after mid-turn. CHARLIES MEDAL was
brushed at the start, raced in the two path through the far turn and never was a factor. INSIGNIS was along the inside throughout and was empty into the
lane.

the far turn. AMAZING GAL stalked the pace in the two path, then gained the fourth spot. CHELSEA'S STRENGTH was unrushed early, then improved
position late inside. QUICK AND EASY stalked the pace inside before giving way in the stretch. EVERYTHING'S ROSY raced in the four path and then

Footnotes
MORE THAN A DIVA chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, moved to near even terms with an eighth to go then edged up.
FANCY CABER NEIGH set the pace on a clear lead through the turn, was joined by the winner outside the eighth pole, dueled to inside the sixteenth pole
and yielded while being second best. LA CREMA was two wide and between rivals through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path, drifted in
nearing the sixteenth pole, straightened and just got up for the show spot. CATCHA LATER MO was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the
lane from the three path, lacked the needed closing kick and just lost the show spot at the wire. MS. LILIBET trailed into the lane while near the inside,
straightened in the lane from the four path, split rivals inside the eighth pole and offered a belated gain. RATIFIED never a menace while saving ground
throughout. MARKET PROFILE was three wide through the turn, swung into the lane from the seven path and never was a threat. MAGGIE E showed
speed along the inside into the turn, continued near the rail into the lane then was empty.

Footnotes
AZAMANA EMPIRE saved ground through the turn, tipped into the lane from the two path, caught the leader outside the eighth pole, gained a clear lead
with an eighth to go and was never challenged to the end while being kept to the task. RAZZALUNA stepped out at the start bothering rival, saved ground
into the far turn when unhurried, angled into the seven path into the lane when gaining momentum, continued with good energy through the lane and was
clearly second best. BRISBANE ROAD chased the pace along the inside through the far turn, bid into the lane from the three path and needed more.
BAMBEROOSKI raced off to a substantial lead while near the inside, continued clear through the turn, could not go with the winner then finished on even
terms for the super share. LA VILLAGE LUMIERE chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response.
FLURR was unhurried while in the two path through the far turn, continued in the two or three path through the lane and steadied late when running up on
rivals. MRS. SPEAKER chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane near the inside and faded. SEVENTEENSEVITYSIX was
bumped and forced out into rival at the start, raced in the two path through the far turn and never was a factor. SAY SAYONARA was in the four path
through the first turn, continued off the inside into the far turn and was never in it. VOGELSANG was tight at the start, raced in the four or five path through
the first turn, came into the lane from the seven path and tired. ENGLISH ROSE was done after going a half from the inside.
