Footnotes
ESTIFRAAD assumed the lead in the sixth path, drew away nearing the quarter pole, was kept to task through the stretch, rider peered under his arm and
was geared down. MOHAMAD tracked inside through the backstretch, chased the leader through the stretch but was no match and held for the place.
ESCROW STYLE raced wide through the backstretch, gained closer order outside in the final turn, and closed well. PULL THE PIN stalked from the three
path, was brushed leaving the backstretch, and faded gradually. LIGHTENING ANNA brushed PULL THE PIN leaving the backstretch while in close
quarters, and lacked a bid. MAKE'N TRACKS never reached contention.

Footnotes
ADDYDIDIT was reserved off the early pacesetters, dropped back in the far turn, was asked to quicken nearing the quarter pole, drove between rivals
capturing the lead, and was kept to task under a strong hand ride. COUNT ON IT chased four to five wide, rallied five wide at the head of the stretch, and
was outkicked. TAKE CHARGE GWEN saved ground inside, moved up alongside LOAD ABROAD to challenge the lead after the three-sixteenth pole, and
weakened in the stretch. CHATTY GAL vied outside for the early lead, settled in striking distance leaving the backstretch, raced in close quarters entering
the stretch, and finished evenly. LOAD ABROAD showed the way through the backstretch under a stronghold, was under attack entering the stretch and
yielded. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY chased wide and tired early. TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the trainer of TAKE CHARGE GWEN against
the rider of ADDYDIDIT alleging interference at the top of the stretch was not allowed.

AMUSING WAY broke alertly then vied outside of NORTHERN DREAMIN for the early lead, sat just off the pace leaving the backstretch, overtook the lead
willingly nearing the quarter pole, responded to a looming threat from DOUSEAWHATISEA, and stayed clear under light handling. ALL RUN lacked a clear
path leaving, trailed the field, and closed determinedly getting up just in time for place honors. DOUSEAWHATISEA broke awkwardly, chased three to four
wide, loomed at the head of the stretch then drifted in, was no match for the winner, and was run down late. PADDYS ROCKET chased in the second flight
from the three path, and closed late. MIDNITE CHILL tracked outside, roused at the three-sixteenth marker, and came up empty for the drive. NORTHERN
DREAMIN vied for the early lead, gained the advantage in the far turn, and faltered in the stretch.

BIG AL'S VISION saved ground early, circled the field in the final turn, rallied outside, dug in the final yards and prevailed. FROBISHER BAY trailed the field
early, drove inside nearing the stretch, rallied determinedly from the rail, and was out finished. PERDITION brushed away, chased early, lost path just after
the three-sixteenth pole, angled out sharply, came under steady urging from the four path, and missed. ONEFINEDAY assumed the lead, angled to the two
path when leaving the backstretch, was showing signs of tiring and then flattened out. DREADNAUGHT hurried inside, was never far back and lacked the
kick that was needed. LET THE BOY SING hustled away, settled in the four path in striking range, came under encouragement at the head of the lane, and
was unable to make much of an impact through the stretch. REDNECK REMARK saved ground, and passed tiring rival. YORKTOWN stalked from the rail,
and gave way.

Footnotes
BORKAN contested the pace inside of COMMON KNOWLEDGE, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, and opened up to win easily. SMARTY RIVER
PANTS lacked running room in the far turn, bid inside nearing the stretch, and held firm for second. SCHOCHOH sat in range while five wide, fanned four
wide in the far turn, was roused at the quarter pole then went in pursuit of the leader, was no match in the stretch and was outkicked for place. SHARP
DRESSED BEAU raced from the back of the pack, circled into the lane, and closed gradually. COMMON KNOWLEDGE showed early speed but was
outsprinted to the turn, and lacked a response when called upon. HARD TO COME HOME attended the pace from the four path, was unable to keep pace
with the field and wilted.

BON PRIX contested the pace racing four wide into the far turn, gained a short advantage entering the lane, was unchallenged in the stretch and was ridden
out. BACKSTREET BOBBY set the early pace inside, was overtaken in the far turn, came under heaving urging from along the rail, was no match for the
winner and finished well for second. RAILWAY brushed ARGENTINA CRIES in the backstretch, hustled outside in the final turn, and closed gradually under
steady urging. LINCHPIN STORM sat in range while wide, rallied outside of RAILWAY through the stretch, and improved late. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE)
was brushed in the backstretch, fanned three-wide in the far turn, chased through the stretch, and gave way. TUCKER TIME chased inside, and rallied
belatedly. ABOVE AND BEYOND attended the early pace, and came up empty in the drive. IMPACTO showed little.

Footnotes
ROCKTILLYOUDROP saved ground in the second flight while four wide through the backstretch, took closer order in the final turn, grabbed the lead shortly
afterward, and drew clear. WAR GIANT reserved well off the pace, drove five to six wide at the head of the lane, rallied inside of FATHER O'FLAHERTY
and held on for second. FATHER O'FLAHERTY raced from the back of the field, advanced quickly while wide through the final turn, match strides through
the stretch outside of WAR GIANT but was unable to get by. ZICATELA dueled outside SMART PLAY for the lead, failed to respond to the challenge from
ROCKTILLYOUDROP at the head of the lane, and weakened. WALKTHELINE saved to no avail. SMART PLAY disputed the early lead inside of
ZICATELA, was unable to move on with rival, and yielded.

Footnotes
VANTASTICCANAVERAL contested the pace outside, responded to challengers into the stretch, rival took a slim lead but refused to go down without a
fight, dug in gamely in the final strides to narrowly prevail. H K RAPPER settled into a stalking position from along the rail, lacked running room nearing the
three-sixteenth pole, saw running room inside then drove up grabbing the lead, matched strides in the final sixteenth inside of VANTASTICCANAVERAL,
and was nailed before the wire. BARAK stalked the early pacesetters, drove five wide at the top of the lane, rallied mildly through the stretch, and was along
late for the show. ADIOS Y GRACIAS opted to settle well off the pace, swung outside in the final turn, and closed gradually. REAL JUSTICE lodged a rail
bid nearing the quarter pole, and flattened in the drive. FROSTEDBIRD brushed leaving, contested the early pace inside of VANTASTICCANAVERAL, was
unable to move on with rival near the three-sixteenth marker, and gave way. KAPTAIN KOWBOY away well but lacked the early speed needed, circled into
the lane, and failed to threaten. NIGHTFALL chased wide and offered a late mild bid. CAROSWAY brushed rival leaving, chased five wide, and was unable
to keep pace with his field. RAUSTY TREASURE never reached contention.
