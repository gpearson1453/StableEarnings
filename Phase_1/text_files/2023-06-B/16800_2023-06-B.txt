Footnotes
BACOPA BAY broke outward bumping LADYBUGGIN into CRYPTONIS CATWALK at the start, sped to the lead, set all the pace and widened through the
stretch under mild left handed urging to win as much the best. BUSYBEING FABULOUS pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match
while well clear for second. LADYBUGGIN was fractious in the gate, bumped between horses at the start, stumbled and passed a tiring rival late.
WELLOILEDCAT failed to menace. CRYPTONIC CATWALK bumped at the start, stalked the pace near the inside into the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
AUJARA settled six wide down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch, shook clear under right handed
urging and lasted under strong handling. WORTHERWEIGHTNGOLD had good early speed, dropped back a bit before the turn, lacked racing room behind
rivals causing her rider to steady midway on the turn, shifted out the five path and came on again late. QUARANTINA went evenly. INDY PRINCESS KOKO
trailed until deep stretch and passed tiring rivals in the six path. WHOVILLE pressed the pace three then two wide for a half and weakened in the stretch.
FLOWZANO broke sharply, set a pressured pace along the inside for a half then was used up.

MEET THE BEAUTY broke in front, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under confident handling. ALSANAH trailed early, closed willingly
along the inside and finished second best. LEWD pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. FIONA moved up three wide after a
half, drew closer to the winner two wide nearing the quarter pole then faded late. PEARLINTHEROUGH stalked the early pace along the inside and lacked
the needed response. MAY BEAU offered a mild bid between horses two wide nearing the half mile marker then came up empty.
