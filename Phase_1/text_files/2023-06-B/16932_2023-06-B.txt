MARKET STREET set the pace racing slightly off the rail and gradually increased his advantage while hanging on his left lead. GOTTANEEDFORSPEED
saved ground chasing MARKET STREET, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole, couldn't reach the winner but finished well for the place in a steady
effort. CAN GROUP was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. OZONE was off a step slow to get away behind the field,
moved up three-wide on the turn, offered a bid nearing the stretch and then flattened out. THANKS FRANK steadied in tight along the inside nearing the
turn, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out four-wide nearing the stretch and failed to factor. MAGICAL MONARCH dropped back early, came
six-wide into the stretch but failed to threaten.

PADDINGTON saved ground setting the pace while racing in hand and drew off to win as the rider pleased. GO CATS was prominently placed while racing
behind the winner, could not threaten that one but finished well for the place. LUNA VIEJA was close up from the start racing between horses but lacked the
needed late response. SANT' ANTIMO prompted the issue racing three-wide for five furlongs and gave way.

PRETTY PROVOCATIVE was never far back while saving ground, moved through inside of SRI LANKA, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually
edged clear late. SRI LANKA set the pace racing slightly off the rail, responded when headed nearing the eighth pole and remained clear of show.
SOUTHAMPTON DOCK prompted the issue while racing three-wide and held on well for the show. DIXIE SUPREME was brushed at the start by SPUN
OATS, then racing three-wide while being unhurried and failed to menace. SPUN OATS broke in to brush with DIXIE SUPREME, then was forwardly placed
to nearing the stretch while three-wide and tired. ROBIN SAGE was prominently placed for three furlongs racing along the outside and gave way.

Footnotes
APPEAL DENIED saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded to pressure and was fully extended to
prevail. RAM was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished strongly. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS was unhurried early, rallied five-wide the final
quarter and finished full of run. MIDASWELLRUN saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole
and finished willingly despite being in tight late. AMANI'S EAGLE prompted the issue while racing two-wide nut lacked the needed late response.
EMPERADOR steadied from between horses shortly after the start and failed to threaten while saving ground.

FOWLER BLUE prompted IDRATHERBEBLESSED, took the lead from that one nearing the three-eighths pole, responded when challenged and drew clear
late. O CAPTAIN saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bold bid but was unable to
match strides with the winner late. IDRATHERBEBLESSED saved ground setting the pace for nearly a mile and weakened. JARREAU was unhurried early,
raced four-wide on the backstretch but lacked a rally. ALWAYS ABOVE saved ground while being reserved off the pace and failed to seriously threaten. EL
AHIJADO settled in the middle of the pack early while racing three-wide and gave way.

CAN'T HUSH THIS saved ground setting the early pace, drifted off during the drive and maintained a safe advantage. DEPUTY CONNECT saved ground
while being forwardly placed, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished well to earn the place. WHAT'S UP DOC dropped back early while
saving ground, slipped through entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SECRET POCKET was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and
was making up some ground late. JUDO prompted the ussie racing two-wide and weakened late. I RUN was allowed to settle in stride while racing between
horses but lacked a rally when asked. DUAL MONARCHY was prominent early while racing three-wide and tired.

Footnotes
SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY vied with BRU NA BOINNE for the lead to the stretch, shook that one off and increased her advantage. BRU NA BOINNE vied with
the winner to the stretch, was no match for that one but held on well for the place. PEAK POPULARITY was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide
into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SHOPLIFTER was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled in to come
three-wide into the stretch, came in nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly. MUSTANG LADY saved ground while being forwardly placed but lacked a
rally. MAGIC BUBBLES was prominently placed while racing two-wide, steadied from between horses nearing the eighth pole and tired. NOMADIC PRIDE
hopped in the air at the start, was four-wide entering the stretch and failed to threaten. UNSTABLE PRINCESS settled in stride early, came three-wide into
the stretch and failed to menace. EMBRACE ME bobbled at the start to get away behind the field and was unable to recover. DEMI was unhurried while
racing three-wide and was not a factor. TITUBA was prominent while racing three-wide and tired. DESERT TEMPEST settled in the middle of the pack for
six furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
ANNA'S ARABESQUE dueled with RUBY TAP for the lead to the eighth pole and gradually drew clear late. PROUD MARY was off a step slow, moved up
along the inside on the turn, angled out to be three-wide in the stretch and finished strongly. RUBY TAP dueled for the lead into the stretch, was unable to
match strides with the winner but held on fairly well for the show. SWEET CURALINA was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining
slightly late. SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL saved ground while racing in the middle of the field but lacked a rally. STEEL RACER raced two-wide and failed to
threaten. GOLD TICKET dropped back early and was not a factor.
