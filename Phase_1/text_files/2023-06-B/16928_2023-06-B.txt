Footnotes
ELI perfect position throughout while well handled with a steady run to far turn, ran on the final sixteenth, edged clear. CACAHUETE chased leader to far
turn, angled in late going and all out to hold the place spot on the wire. LUCKYINKENTUCKY between horses first turn, raced back to far turn with a run into
the stretch while coming on too late. FEELING IT sent to the front, led to deep stretch, drifted out a bit in late going while tiring. GOTSOMEMOJO never
menaced throughout. HONDO GUSTO always back with no response throughout. CONGRATS THIS good position from inside to the half with nothing left.
