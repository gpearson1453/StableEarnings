Footnotes
UNDERTOW saved ground around the first turn, opened up on the field racing up the backstretch and around the far bend and drew off in the lane, much
the best. REJECTION HURTS saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch. KAL EL raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and finished evenly. MR INSENSITIVE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the three
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far bend in the two and three path and showed no kick.
FOUND JORDAN bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the
run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and made no bid. LL'S CLASSY DUDE bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced
in the three path around the first bend, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn and
was empty in the stretch.

PASSING TIME led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the lane. SILENT SAILOR chased the leader
between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and kept on in the lane while proving to be no match for the
winner. RING TAILED TOOTER tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the
stretch. RED'S MR Z raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, continued around the bend in the three path and showed no kick. BOYD RAM
broke slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. BURN BOSS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside
through the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path and faded in the lane.

the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path, swung wider still into the stretch and flattened out from there. ALQWANI raced in the four path
around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the three path and tired in the stretch. COMPETITIVE SPIRIT raced
