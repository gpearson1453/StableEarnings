denied in the final strides. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY set the pace on the inside, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely on the rail in the lane nd held third.
ROB THE TREASURE tracked on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. LOST
LUGGAGE raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and closed belatedly outside. RAINOUT trailed the field on the inside,
angled out in the stretch and gained belatedly. SMART RED raced two wide off the pace, chased between rivals on the far turn and tired. CRYSTAL ORB
raced off the pace inside and did not factor. MYSTIC DREAMS had a three wide trip racing off the pace and tired.

chased on the turn and tired. BOSS LADY KIM was bumped at the start, chased close up three wide, bid between rivals on the turn and tired. CHARLOTTE
