Footnotes
PRIDDIS set the pace from the inside and into the far turn, was challenged for the lead entering the stretch but was able to hold on grudgingly down the lane
proving best gate to wire. SET THE PACE was rated in the two path in the middle of the group down the backstretch, then was gaining ground leaving the
far bend, angled in along the rail to close fast down the lane but it wasn't enough in the end. CARLOS LOVES TEE pressed the pace down the backstretch
and into the far turn from the two path, was in a long drive entering the early stretch, rallied gamely while drifting out late but could never catch the leader
and was out finished for place. A WISH FOR MADELYN settled along the inside, then circled five wide on the far turn to close well in the late stretch but it
wasn't enough. CARRY ON settled in the two path on the backstretch, then bid on the far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. FROSTY FLIRT chased
the pace from the inside in the middle of the pack in the first half then flattened out in the second half of the course.

Footnotes
HARD GOLD broke alertly and settled to prompt the pace, ranged up turning for home, took command in mid-stretch, lugged in causing the runner-up to
check in deep stretch and pulled clear to the wire. ZAVALA sped to the lead from the rail shortly away from the gate, set a well measured pace while clear,
responded when challenged in upper stretch, could not go with the winner, was caused to take up inside the final sixteenth when the winner lugged-in, and
kept on to the line as second best. NIGHTWIND chased the leaders through the turn, was set to a drive but could not close ground on the top pair. MORO'S
BULL CREEK went evenly and never threatened. SHANGHAI GOLD was never a factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE ACTIONS
OF THE WINNER IN DEEP STRETCH AND THE RIDER OF ZAVALA CLAIMED FOUL AS WELL, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS RULED THERE
WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
POETIC UNION unhurried in the early going, commenced a four wide rally leaving the three-eighths pole, swept up to challenge in mid-stretch and closed
well to gain the victory. SUMMEROSA reserved to be at the back of the main body of the field, started a long grinding rally into the turn and finished
willingly. CRIMSON LADY stalked the pace of the clear leader, rallied turning for home to take a brief lead in mid-stretch but was out-finished by the top pair.
SHEZA CAT hesitated at the start giving the field five lengths, made steady gains to make up considerable ground but had lost all chance at the start.
MARTIQUE MISS tracked the pace for a half mile and flattened out. BACK IN CHARGE well placed for the first half and weakened. LIL MISS SUNSHINE
sped off to a clear lead while racing very wide down the backstretch, dropped in several paths in the turn at the rider's urging, drifted back out wide in the
lane and tired in the final eighth.

JAN'S TURN TO WIN chased the pace from the inside into the turn, was denied room heading into the stretch, angled out to the four path and surged down
the late stretch to be up in the final strides. JUST PUSH SEND vied for the lead from the inside, was in a long drive heading into the early stretch to gain
command, was holding on grudgingly down the late stretch but was out finished in the end and was second best. TAY TAY'S BABY chased the pace while
three wide, then settled back along the inside throughout the turn to rally in the early stretch and was closing belatedly in the end. FOR FUN raced towards
the back of the field while four wide, was moving up on the turn to rally in the upper stretch and was closing strongly down the lane. SWEET ADELINE vied
for the lead with an inner rival into the turn, then gave way in the early stretch. TUDELA raced towards the back of the pack while three wide, made a mild
bid on the turn to rally in the late stretch but came up empty. CAMARADERIE was moving up while four wide to bid gamely leaving the bend and into the
early stretch then gave way in the end. BECKY'S TATTOO settled in the two path, then bid from the three path in the stretch and was no threat.
MISSISZIPPY BLING chased the pace from the two path early, then settled back along the inside and continued to flatten out throughout the final furlongs.
BLUEBERRY EYES was no menace.

Footnotes
CUCINA broke slowly to be at the back, quickly recovered, circled four wide in a big sweeping middle move to engage the leaders through the turn, took a
short lead in upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and got the nod at the line. FLIP THE COIN JAN prompted the pace from three wide into
the turn, rallied with the winner to challenge the pacesetter at the quarter pole from between horses, battled through the lane with the winner and lost the
bob in a good effort. KENTUCKY PEERLESS unhurried in the early going to trail, angled wide at the top of the stretch and made a good belated rally to gain
the show. SR. BI BI well placed from three wide within striking distance but lacked a closing response when called upon. ROCK N JUNE BUG tracked the
pace early on, dropped back through the turn and finished evenly. SALADO sped to a clear lead for the first quarter, dueled through the turn and came up
empty when headed.

TAKE FLIGHT was rated in the two path in the middle of the field, was urging on the turn, split rivals, then dug in gamely to battle for the lead with an outer
foe in late stretch and was up at the wire to prove best. STASIS vied for the lead while three wide down the backstretch, then inched away from the inner
rivals leaving the bend to gain command in the early stretch, then dueled with an inner rival in late stretch and hung in the end. SMOKEY STORY saved
ground throughout the backstretch while racing behind the field, then came out four wide to rally in late stretch and was closing willingly. PUNCTUALITY
raced in the three path, then angled in along the rail to chase the pace throughout the turn, rallied in the upper stretch and was closing well in the end.
LOOK SHARP was in a hard drive to vie for the lead between rivals, was used up after leaving the turn and gave way in the end. LIVINGSTON was
unhurried early and no menace. LONG COOL vied for the lead with two outer foes down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the turn, was used up and

COSMIC SOUL sped to the early lead up the fence, opened a well measured lead through the far turn, opened a clear lead when called upon turning for
home and remained a clear, unchallenged winner in a well handled ride. FROM THE HEART tracked the pace from the rail the entire way, saved all the
ground and rallied well up the inside to be second best. RONIC reserved off the leaders to be rated in mid-pack along the fence, tipped out two wide at the
head of the lane and finished well in a steady drive. CAJUN EDDIE stalked the pacesetter from three wide, loomed in the far turn and hung through the lane.
FLASH OF GENIUS well placed in striking position into the lane and failed to gain ground late. TAPADINE unhurried to be near the back of the field and
showed some late interest closing ground in the stretch. TEAM LEADER prompted the pace for three quarters of a mile and faded in the lane. GOLD PRIZE
trailed most of the trip and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. AMAVI went evenly as a non-factor. ROCKET J. tracked the pace from four wide to the
backside and came up empty.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF ANGEL reserved off the early pace in mid-pack, rallied in the turn splitting rivals and working through traffic, was set down in a drive at the head
of the lane in the clear, collared the pacesetter in deep stretch and drew off. TALKATIVE saved ground while in behind horses down the backside, worked
around the tiring early pacesetter at the quarter pole and rallied well up the fence in the lane. MENDI'S GIRL pressed the pace from between horses,
overtook the leader in the turn, opened a clear lead in upper stretch but weakened deep in the drive. VALLEY VERDE slow early to be well off the main
body, closed ground headed to the turn to engage the field, circled six wide and continued to gain down the lane. CONTEMPO GRAY unhurried early at the
back of the main field, circled five wide in the turn and finished evenly. MISS CARMEN CIBO pressed the pace from three wide to the top of the lane and
faded coming home. BERING'S SPECIAL raced one pace throughout never menacing. TEQUILA EMPIRE flashed speed for a quarter and weakened
through the turn giving way. BOBBIE O went evenly and never threatened. MOVE FORWARD ESSIE stalked the pace from four wide through the turn and
tired. SHE'S SPELLBOUND stumbled leaving the gate to be at the back and could never make contact with the field.

Footnotes
WHITEROSE JEWEL was well rated while stalking the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then dueled with the pace setter leaving the far turn
and into the early stretch, then kicked clear late stretch and held on gamely till the end to prevail. PROJECTION chased the pace from the inside while
reserving ground down the backstretch and into the far turn, then dug in gamely in the early stretch to battle for the place prize and was up at the wire.
OLCZYK chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn then rallied in the early stretch to close belatedly while dueling for
the place position just missing in the end. RAIL TOWN set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive heading into the far turn, then battled with an outer
foe throughout the far turn and into the early stretch before giving way in the end. FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER chased the pace while three wide in the first half,
then rallied on the far turn and into the stretch to close well but it wasn't enough. NERKY ROSE was unhurried early, then bid from the inside on the far turn,
angled out four wide mid stretch and was closing fast in the final sixteenth. ANOTHER JOURNEY chased the pace from the three path under a steady drive
throughout then gave way in the home stretch. BENISSIMO raced in the middle of the pack while four wide, then bid on the far turn from the two path and
was no threat. TOP COP was unhurried early then made a mild bid from the inside on the far turn and was no threat. PROSPECTOR'S POINT was
unhurried early and no menace. PRINCE CURLIN was no factor.
