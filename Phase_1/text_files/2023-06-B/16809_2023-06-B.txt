Footnotes
LOADED SNIPER closed to the lead leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace, was urged away from the five sixteenths, raced near the rail on
the turn and held on under steady handling. PAPA TONY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path, dug in for second mid-stretch
and finished well while gaining on the winner. HEY CONGRATS chased inside but steadied at the rail off the inside flank of Loaded Sniper at the seven
sixteenths pole, altered course and quickly recovered stride, rounded the turn at the rail and ran evenly down the lane. STRETCH THE TRUTH chased,
raced in the five path on the turn but showed little in the lane. GRAND FIBER had brief early lead then gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced
off the rail on the turn and flattened the final sixteenth. MOJAC KAT gave chase while saving ground. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed a claim of foul
against the rider of Loaded Sniper, for alleged interference in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole, lodged by the rider of Papa Tony.

GILDED QUEST veered out leaving the gate then closed to contention and stalked two deep, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod
toward the three eighths and dueled from that point, dew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. SOMEBODY LOVES ME was
pinched back leaving the gate then saved ground racing well back from early contention, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path, dueled for second mid-stretch and finished well. LINDA'S TAJ veered out leaving the gate then rated the pace inside, came under
pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was met and gave chase toward the three eighths but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and
flattened in the stretch. MARQUET CLASSIC settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and weakened in the lane. RAINBOW RHYTHM stalked through the front stretch but faded on the first turn. TOUGH GAME rounded the opening turn in the

HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS became anxious in the gate, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, angled five wide through the turn and dug in under steady
encouragement to take over and draw clear later yards. MANAGED MISCHIEF set a pressured pace, rounded the turn near the rail, drifted leaving the turn,
dug in under steady encouragement but was caught in later yards. GREAT DEVOTION chased through the backstretch, raced close at the rail on the turn
and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. QUEEN OF KANTHAROS pressured the pace through the backstretch, raced close off the rail on the
turn, was carried out leaving the turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening. TAKE CHARGE LISA chased, raced close four wide on the turn then
flattened mid-stretch. AMERICAN BOUND became anxious in the gate then gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn but showed little in the lane.
SHAKE IT GIRL became a bit edgy in the gate and saved ground. FLAT OUT COOL was not a factor.

pace in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the six path of the far turn then dueled through the stretch for
second. MR MAJESTIC saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in tight at the rail toward the head of the lane and was
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. MIMS SECOND CHANCE had a brief early lead then stalked, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole,
raced close in the three path of the far turn but flattened inside the eighth pole. GAMMA SQUEEZE saved ground racing well back on the opening turn, gave
chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced blocked at the rail approaching the head of the lane but finished evenly. A THOUSAND IDOLS bobbled a stride
from the gate and settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the three path and

Footnotes
WINDSOR'S TRACKER was crowded leaving the gate and raced off the rail on the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced close
off the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over the game stretch effort of ORANGEBURG, who came outward leaving the gate
then stalked off the rail, challenged approaching the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, took the nod toward the five sixteenths,
contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely through the lane before relenting the final yards. AIR MEDAL was crowded leaving the
gate then saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and came along for third the final yards.
SIENTE EL AMOR closed to the lead while tapering inward and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and dueled at even
terms, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened mid-stretch. MR CHANCE ROMANCE came in after the start, rounded the first turn
about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the three path on the far turn. CHASE LIL ME was crowded leaving
the gate then saved ground well back, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn, left the turn outside and passed some
rivals. GET OFF MY CLOUD showed little response through the backstretch. BLUE N GOLD rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Air Medal for alleged
interference leaving the gate, lodged by the rider of Chase Lil Me.

SUPER JORDAN chased inside and took the lead at the rail midway on the turn, dug in under steady stretch handling and held on. ALLEN CAN DO IT
chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four and five paths, dueled for second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. FIBER STRONG
gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and dug in to take third later yards. ATLANTIC VAQUERO chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path
on the turn, drifted toward the head of the lane then flattened later yards. JEFFERSON NATIVE became a little unsettled in the gate and was unprepared for
the break, lacked a clear early path but was eased outward and gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the five path and ran
evenly in the lane. FIFTY FIFTY took a quick lead and set the early pace while tapering in, was met while two deep midway on the turn, dropped back
toward the head of the lane and weakened leaving the eighth pole. BODYSLAM was never a factor. ALWAYS HOPEFUL gave chase then faded at the rail
on the turn. HELL'S KITTEN was not a factor.

Footnotes
HIS ROYAL G stalked from the three and four paths the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, dug in for the
lead mid-stretch and inched clear under the wire. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE took the lead leaving the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under
pressure toward the quarter pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. MISS YOU AJAX
stalked toward the inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then dueled through
the stretch for third. EISELE steadied in tight at the rail midway on the first turn and settled off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. ROCK FILE saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the five
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and passed rivals. BOP MARLEY rounded the first turn about the five path, entered the backstretch
outside and picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. BOSEY raced in the
four path on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened in the lane. EL TOLU saved
ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. A FAREWELL YODEL was never a factor. BRIGHT
DAWN rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn.
