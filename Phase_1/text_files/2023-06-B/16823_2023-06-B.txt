Footnotes
ZIPPY TOGA firm restraint, forwardly placed early along the inside, continued to save ground behind the leaders into the far turn, called on for some run
midway on that bend, angled four wide turning for home, challenged outside, dueled final furlong, proved best. NEPHI just off the early pace outside, moved
up to duel the middle half mile, vied between rivals and inside the winner exiting the final turn, dueled with that one past the furlong marker and to the wire,
proved stubborn to the end. FLYING CAROLINA in the second flight while between foes, moved toward the inside second turn, steered back out three wide
exiting that bend, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top two late. FREE FALLING NATE shuffled back and rank early, moved outside while
still slow to settle first turn, four wide into the far turn, three wide into the straight, improved position through traffic with some belated interest. SPICE OF MY
LIFE last to leave, continued to lack speed for a half, steadily advanced three wide the third quarter, flattened out a bit in the drive while continuing to
improve position. DEPUTY KNIGHT within striking distance outside, three wide second turn, came up empty for the drive. APRIORITY ROCKET broke on
top, set or forced the pace along the inside for six furlongs, faltered in the drive. SACRED NATION broke back, lacked speed, remained back while lugging
in a bit in upper stretch, finished up evenly after being straightened. CAMEO TRICK raced back off the pace and failed to rally. COLE'S SENSATION behind
the pace, stopped far turn, distanced after losing contact with the field stretch, jogged in. SEVEN FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FLASHY BOY GOES with the pace from the start closest to the inside, narrowly showed the way into the turn, dueled into the stretch while continuing
inside, dug in late to prevail in determined fashion. CORN SOUP broke on top, also contested the issue up front from the beginning, dueled outside the
winner into and through the stretch, outkicked in the late going. ROLL ON OUT with the lead flight while four wide up the backstretch and into the turn,
remained well outside while losing contact with the top two entering the stretch, proved no match for that pair to the wire, saved the show. DOUBLE BOGEY
bumped lightly at the break, raced back off the pace and the inside, came five wide for the drive, improved a bit in the drive, not enough for the show. G E H
GIANTS WAY vied up front while three wide and between rivals for three furlongs, weakened for the drive. PETEY broke out and steadied twice just after
the start, trailed most of the way in failing to threaten. LAST NATIVE CAT last away, chased the lead pack early, faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
PICKIN ANA GRINNIN broke on top, soon well clear, rated in the run up the backstretch, extended that advantage into the stretch under light
encouragement, continued to drew off to win ridden out. TOLATETOOWAIT moved up to race closest to the winner through the first turn, continued to chase
that rival in vain, proved no match in the drive, remained clear for the place. CALIFORNIA CALI broke back, lacked speed, improved position while slowly
getting to the runner up late. REINA ACES settled off the pace, saved ground through the final turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing
response. JULIO CHOICE went one paced throughout in lacking a rally. OVERLY SWEET reared badly at the start to spot the field several lengths,
remained well back to never pose a threat. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR was finished early, well back.

Footnotes
MARIAH'S CANDY raced behind the leaders while along the inside, continued to save ground turn, traffic, steadied and rank entering the stretch, gathered,
closed full of run to be going away at the end while along the inside. MALIBU TOAST away in good order,narrowly showed the way along the inside, shook
clear approaching the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner at the end while outside that one at the wire. GRACIE DIAMOND with the pace three
wide and between foes, could not keep pace with the runner up through the lane nor contain the winner, saved the show. CAVE CREEK last away, trailed
for three furlongs, asked along late turn, three wide into the lane, dropped inside, late run up the rail to improve position. TAPIT RIGHT lacked speed while
off the inside, fell back to trail turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late while not a serious threat. MISS G G vied up front while between rivals for three
furlongs and gave way. FIRE VISION contested the issue up front four wide, tired through the stretch.

Footnotes
NOSY BANKER prompted the pace for a half outside, four wide into the turn, dueled into the lane in the three path, drove steadily clear the final furlong.
CHEROKEE TAKEOVER last to leave, void of speed up the backstretch off the inside, dropped to the rail late in the turn, improved inside of several rivals
entering the stretch, continued to advance to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. FOOLISH DREAMS back off the pace and the inside, fanned
five wide into the stretch, along for the show late. GIMMEASOUND close up between horses out of the chute, vied three wide and inside the winner into the
turn, dueled with that one into the stretch, failed to match that one past the furlong marker, faltered the final sixteenth to lose a couple of more positions.
EASY TO MISS with the early pace, vied between horses into the turn, fell back a bit, angled out four wide into the stretch, came up empty for the drive.
CRUSADER EXPRESS showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, began to weaken when headed early in the turn, continued to fade through the
stretch. TRAELEE broke back, lacked speed, passed tiring rivals. SUCH was never a threat while four wide into the stretch. IRISH EXPECTATIONS in mid
pack while outside, fanned six wide into the stretch and tired. MIND ON MY MONEY in the second flight early, began a steady retreat before a half.

MISCHIEF'S MACHINE behind the pace inside, steered out three wide turning for home, idled past the furlong marker despite put to pressure, late run to
finish up well and be in time. DRIFTER broke back, lacked speed, came in the two path for the drive, finished up willingly to be up late for the place between
horses. CREEKMORE broke on top, dueled up front while racing in the two path, continued to alternate through the turn and into the stretch, weakened a bit
late while still getting up for the show. NO PEDIGREE also away well, narrowly set the early pace, dueled through the turn along the inside, continued to
hold a slight advantage late, also faltered in the late going. FLASHY PREMO forwardly placed while racing outside, had little left for the drive. MUFFIN
NUTS lacked speed, four wide into the turn, lacked a response through the stretch. COACH KENNY never a threat. SPECIAL OPERATOR last to leave,
used early to advance into the second flight, checked repeatedly with just under four furlongs remaining, gave way late in the turn.

Footnotes
FOURALIVIA forwardly placed along the inside early, waited briefly along the rail early in the turn, accelerated through along the inside to take control soon
after, drove steadily clear through the lane. SWEET ALEXIS back off the lead pack off the inside, roused three wide turning for home, displayed some late
interest to be up at the wire for the place, not a threat to the winner. MISS ST. CLAIRE broke out, vied early, dueled outside the winner into the lane, proved
no match for that one, nipped late for the runner up spot. QUEEN OF THE MOON last away, lacked early foot, four wide exiting the turn when advancing,
brushed late stretch, continued with some interest to improve a bit more in the final strides. PORTO DEL ACE in mid pack for a half, three wide out of the
turn, exchanged brushes with QUEEN OF THE MOON with a sixteenth remaining, altered course to the inside in the final strides. LUYV bumped at the start,
raced behind the pace, lacked a response in the drive. FITTS N STARTS void of speed, four wide exiting the turn, improved position slightly without posing
a serious threat. LAKE BALI remained back in lacking a rally. TIME TO CLOSE was finished early. JAX'S STARRY BRIDE moved up to show the way late
backstretch, stopped in the far turn, fell quickly back, jogged in well back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH
DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
COSMIC TRAIN last away, void of speed while saving ground through the first turn, continued to trail backstretch, began to creep forward in the far turn,
picked way through some traffic late in that bend under clever handling, four wide bid past the furlong marker, strongly clear. TOUCHDOWN JOE dueled up
front along the inside, rated through some legit fractions, continued to do battle through the second bend under increased pressure, held a slight advantage
a furlong out, could not match strides with the winner late while stubbornly holding onto the place. SCORING DRIVE lacked early foot, closer along the rail
late backstretch and far turn, patiently handled into the stretch, challenged inside the furlong out, outkicked by that rival for the second spot. CALCULATED
dueled up front outside the runner up, three path stretch, weakened a bit late while angling in the final strides. PLAY MO settled off the pace and the inside,
asked along and moved a bit closer four wide turning for home, flattened out in the late going. HOME VISIT raced in mid pack while also out in the course,
came five wide out of the final turn, lacked a closing kick. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE prompted the dueling leaders for six furlongs, faltered in the drive. VENN
four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide again into the second turn, gave way soon after, trailed home.

Footnotes
GONE SOLUTION broke sharp, prompted the pace three wide, outside bid into the stretch, drove clear. UNCLE CHAN in mid pack while off the inside,
encouraged into the stretch off the inside, shifted out for room nearing midstretch, closed with good resolve to gain the nod for the place. PALLATON with
the pace while racing closest to the inside, proved no match for the winner the final furling, nipped late for the second spot. RED ON THE HEAD in mid pack
inside, asked along into the lane, between foes after improving slight, flattened out a bit in the late going along the inside, bobbled after the wire.
WILDCATS'S MEOW broke out, bumped RED ON THE HEAD, lacked speed, continued to lag into the lane, displayed some belated interest in traffic.
MARVINS' WARRIOR in the second flight early, moved closer under pressure four wide late in the turn, flattened out in the drive. MEAN MEISTER came
out early to bother AWESOME CLAIM just after the start, was never dangerous. AWESOME CAJUN bothered just after the break, remained back in failing
to menace. TRUVY'S BANDIT last away, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BLUE LEG JOHN steadily faded. REGINALD
AURELIUS vied early inside the winner and between foes, shook clear turn, stopped through the stretch.
