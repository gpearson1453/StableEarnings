BEYOND PROPER dropped inside on the first turn, advanced along the rail into the second turn, awaited room, bid between horses entering the stretch,
closed steadily and wore down SHIE'S WANDAFUL and inched clear late. SHE'S WANDAFUL sprinted clear to set the pace to deep stretch and was
outclosed in a good effort. WAY TOO SMARTE settled off the pace in a good position, rallied into the turn to challenge for the lead, swung out entering the
stretch, fell back, went evenly late and settled for show. MIZZEN ASH advanced along the rail on the backstretch, fell back entering the turn, bid along the
rail entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. EMBARRASSING was unhurried early, trailed the field, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid
only. EMITYAAZ was rated back at the start, raced inside, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back.

VITALE was crowded at the start, raced close to the pace along the inside, shifted out in tight quarters into the turn, bid three wide, dueled for the lead and
inched clear late to prove best. MAN ON ATTACK pressed the pace, challenged inside into the turn, dueled to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly.
COMING UP ACES dropped inside on the backstretch, bid along the rail on the turn, lacked the needed late response and was all out for show.
KINGSBURRY ATTACK was unhurried early and trailed the field, advanced inside on the turn, angled out for the drive and found his best stride late. JUST
BLAZE broke in, bumped into the second turn, rallied four wide to get within range and came up empty late. DASTARDLY DEEDS stumbled at the start,
raced in close between horses, bumped into the turn and dropped back. DEMAND RANSOM set the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped.

SHACKLEFORD STRONG raced mid pack, angled out for the drive, closed steadily, wore down his rivals to get up late ande drew clear. TIMEHASCOME
set the pace, drew off for a clear lead, led to deep stretch, was outclosed and all out for place. TWO WORLDS chased the pace, went willingly to the wire
and was gaining late. TRY TRY AGAIN lagged early, swung wide entering the stretch and finished well. TIME HEIST broke slowly, dropped inside along the
backstretch to save ground, bid willingly, had little left and hung late. ANDREW THE GIANT was void of early speed, put in an even effort and passed a
tiring rival. SOUPER FORTUNE showed speed to the turn, fell back, was carried out a bit entering the stretch and stopped.

AALIYAH EZRI set the pace and just lasted at the wire. JOURNEYIST stalked the pace along the inside, closed steadily, was gaining late and was
outnodded to just miss. WANDA STRONG was crowded at the start, never far off the pace, bid five wide, closed well and earned show. LEA RO saved
ground, shifted out for the drive, bid and hung. TAPERINEA was restrained and in traffic to the backstretch, raced inside to the turn, angled out, closed well
but didn't have enough late. I OWE UNCLE MO raced close to the pace, lacked a stretch rally and failed to menace. KINGSBURY DREAM trailed the field,
swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
GUN RUSH vied two across to the second turn, inched away briefly, drew clear entering the stretch and held well. JEFF THE LION was unhurried early,
saved ground, angled out into the turn and closed willingly to get up for place. MOMENT was in tight and steadied entering the first turn, continued to vie for
the lead along the inside, was in tight entering the second turn, was taken back, shifted out and challenged again two wide, fell back entering the stretch,
continued to close, didn't have enough late and was caught for second. FIRST MASAMUNE saved ground mid pack, angled out into the turn, bid six wide
and didn't have enough late. PINEDALE broke slowly, trailed the field, went widest in the drive and passed tiring rivals. BOURBON DELIGHT raced mid
pack, tired into the turn and dropped back steadily. COMFORT ME NOW was not a factor. The rider of MOMENT claimed foul against the rider of GUN
RUSH for alleged interference entering the first turn. No change was made.
