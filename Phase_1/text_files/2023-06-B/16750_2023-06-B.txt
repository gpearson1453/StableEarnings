Footnotes
IMPETUOUS SOUL settled off the early pace while racing four wide, cruised up to the lead four wide around the far turn, drew off under a drive in upper
stretch, drifted in a bit in midstretch and widened under mild urging. NOTARY SOJAC was bumped soon after the start, pressed the pace in the three path,
could not match strides with the winner from the five-sixteenths marker, angled in nearing the eighth pole and won the place duel. STRAIGHT TIME stalked
the pace two wide, tipped three wide near the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner, battled outside of NOTARY SOJAC through the stretch for
the place and just missed. ON THE RUNWAY broke outwardly and bumped foes at the start, raced off the pace five wide, steadied late on the first turn,
edged closer four wide around the far turn but never threatened. RULE IT failed to menace while racing two wide. TUMIGA was bumped between foes at
the start, raced two and three wide in midpack and lacked a clsoing bid. DUNKLE hit the starting gate, saved ground and made little impact. KING ZAM
bumped soon after the start, set the pace along the rail and faltered around the far turn. FUN AMERICAN raced three wide in midpack, steadied late on the
first turn, went four wide around the far turn and never factored. PARADISE DRIVE was bumped at the start and always far back inside. BALTIC PRINCE
hesitated at the start and was outrun inside. DRAMA'S GOLD chased the pace four wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
STARSHIP WIZARD chased in the four path, ranged up in the three path around the far turn, bid from the four path at the top of the lane, took the lead just
before the eighth pole, and was driven clear. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK rated in the four path, was ridden between foes in the three path rounding the far
turn, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. T VILLE was unhurried in the five path early, circled inner foes under a drive around the
far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, and kept on for show. CUPID'S DUDE tracked in the two path, was roused from the rail into the far turn,
shifted out to the three path into the stretch, and finished evenly. FORTY FLASH set a loose pace in the two path, was cued midway around the far turn, but
faded along the inside down the lane. EUPHORIA STAR was wellback in the two path and never factored while tipping outward in the stretch. LUNAR
ROCKET stalked in the three path but backed up between foes turning into the stretch. STRONG AGAIN never menaced from off the pace along the inside.

Footnotes
DOMO ARIGATOU came in and bumped at the start, raced off the pace five wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up in the
final strides. MYSTIC SUNRISE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide between foes rounding the far turn, reeled in the
pacesetter near the eighth pole and led until the final strides. CHAINA set the pace in the two path, led to midstretch and fought on inside of the top two.
QUEEN DEYMAR broke awkwardly, was bumped on both sides soon after, raced off the pace two wide and ran on for a minor share. CHARLESTON WAY
was bumped at the start, raced in range four wide and weakened in the lane. LUCKY IN LOVE raced up close inside and tired in the stretch. NO WASABI
FOR ME lacked early speed while racing four wide around the first turn, angled to the rail early on the backstretch and made little impact. STARSHIP
DYNASTY stalked the pace three wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
R ROSE' ALL DAY settled off the pace while racing four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, swept to the front near the eighth pole, drew off under
a drive and continued on widen under minimal urging in the final sixteenth. ZISISIT (IRE) saved ground in range, angled four wide near the eighth pole and
ran on for the place. WICKLOW GAL stalked the pace two wide, dueled two wide around the far turn, vied to midstretch and held well enough to save the
save. HOPE OVER FEAR set the pace in the three path around the first turn, dueled inside around the far turn and through midstretch then weakened.
SHEMIGHTDANCESALSA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. VIVA LA RED played no factor while racing two wide. EXTRA INDY never
threatened while racing three and four wide. BIG BEE chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. RECONNECTING was outrun
while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
VOLCANIC set the pace in the two path, lost the lead along the inside and was under a drive turning into the stretch, tipped out to the three path in upper
stretch, and re-rallied in the final furlong to nail an inner foe on the wire. EMPIRE ATTRACTION prompted the pace in the four path, bid into the far turn,
took command and opened slightly while shifting to the rail into the stretch, but shortened stride inside the final furlong, and was nailed by an outer foe on
the wire to place. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE rated in the four path, was roused from the five path turning into the lane, bumped with an inner foe multiple
times thru the lane, and kept on for show. STRIDE brushed the outer part of the gate, tracked between foes in the three path, was driven from the four path
into the stretch, bumped with an outer foe twice down the stretch, and stayed on. MUTAAWID broke out at the start and dropped well behind around the four
path early, angled out to the eight path into the lane, and made no impact. MO VANISHING stalked in the two path but backed up turning into the stretch.
STARSHIP TANGO was held up in the five path rounding the first turn and angled to the rail while racing off the pace into the backstretch, but never
menaced.

Footnotes
MO TOWN MADISON stalked the pace five wide, took over in upper stretch and held firm under a steady drive. MOONLIGHT VISION was a bit slow into
stride, advanced six wide around the turn, rallied widest and was gaining late. ACTING prompted the pace two wide between foes, bid in upper stretch, was
no match for the top two but stayed on for the show. STARSHIP GIZMO lacked speed in the three path, shifted further out in upper stretch and passed tiring
rivals. BIOTECHNOLOGY dueled in the two path and weakened through the final furlong. GHOST FORCE chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing
bid. UNCAPTURED SKEET dueled in the three path and tired in the drive. POLITICAL ASTRAY chased the pace from the rail, hit the rail in upper stretch
and had no further bids.
