Footnotes
WICKED MIAH was unhurried early outside near the rear, began to inch closer three deep around rivals at the three furlong pole, cruised to the lead at the
two furlong marker to open up in upper stretch and was unchallenged crossing the finish line LITTLE FIRE settled in mid pack with runners on either side
with four furlongs remaining, was hard ridden between foes at the five sixteenths marker, angled four wide for the stretch drive and closed well for the place
share at the wire. PHIL IN ECHO off a bit slow to trail this compact field at the half, shifted out three deep midway on the turn rallying around foes, was in
the hunt for the place share in the five path at the top of the stretch but could not find more and had to settle for a clear third in the end. CALL ME BROOKE
hounded the leader early on just outside, continued to be a part of the speed scenario down the backstretch,, was content prompting the pace into the turn,
could not match strides with the circling winner running between horses at the quarter pole and was one paced to the wire holding for a minor share. WAKE
UP MAGGIE waited behind the engaging leaders down the backside on the rail, was urged but could not keep up to rivals inside through the turn and
passed a tired runner at the top of the lane. STORMY SUZIE had a narrow lead after the start inside, contested for the front end down the backside,
resurged with three eighths remaining to have a head in front again, was collared outside by runners midpoint on the turn and retreated on the fence in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT GUROO quickly moved clear to set the pace while shifting in, dictated terms just off the rail, asked for run outside the three-sixteenths, responded
by the extending the advantaging while being kept to the task. OHEAVENS shifted in racing mid-pack two to three wide into the turn, got room to move into
second in the stretch and held the place. ENDORPHIN RUSH was lightly bumped at the start, settled toward the back, entered the turn two wide and inside
a foe moving out a bit coming out of that bend, angled seven deep for room passing the three-sixteenths, ran on well to get up for show. AIRY FAIRY
stalked in behind, shifted to the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, evened out in the lane and lacked the needed late kick. PINO IN A
PURSE stalked the eventual winner going three wide on the turn, failed to rally. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD raced off the pace three to four wide and between
runners on the turn, swung out five to six wide for the drive, had no rally. SIMPLE SOUVENIR broke a step slowly, raced at the rear, was outside foes three
wide into the turn and moving out a bit later on that bend, was never a threat. PLUIE D'AVRIL faced just a bit of traffic early while lacking speed, raced in
behind and outside runners, went four to five wide on the turn swinging even to eight wide for the drive, failed to menace. OLYMPIC FENCER bumped a
rival lightly at the start, chased briefly, dropped back inside.

Footnotes
TAMANA bore out at the beginning, travelled in midfield four deep down the backstretch, started to pick up the bit four wide midpoint on the turn, loomed six
wide in upper stretch and was kept to the task through the stretch to finally inch away for the victory nearing the finish line. T'PRING was nestled behind the
early frontrunner on the rail into the turn, shifted just off the fence two furlongs to go, was in the mix four deep at the top of the lane and finished up gamely
to be second best in the end. FIRE EMOJI tracked three wide down the backstretch, rallied four deep two furlongs from the line, was in range of the leaders
straightening out for the finish and lacked a serious bid in the final eighth. MY ASSISTANT took command from the onset, opened up on the field at the
quarter pole, was collared outside by runners turning for home and was one paced in deep stretch settling for a small share. SOCIAL DRINKER was
brushed at the break, trailed down the backside, offered a mild run two wide with five sixteenths from home, shifted out to the seven path for clear run in the
stretch and offered little finish to the wire. FEDALINE chased just outside down the backstretch, was hard ridden with runners on either side but was making
no gains midway on the turn and was empty for the stretch run. MOET MONET was checked between rivals leaving the chute, steadied mildly outside foes
at the seven sixteenths pole to trail the field at the top of the lane and could not reach contention driving to the finish. SIXTOFIVE stumbled slightly at the
break, settled near the rear on the rail at the half, made little impact inside throughout the turn and was not a presence running to the finish.

Footnotes
MACHISIMA moved to the fore after the opening three-sixteenths, set the pace racing off the rail, faced pressure midway up the backstretch, turned back a
challenger at the five-sixteenths, met another challenger in mid-stretch while drifting out, held that one at bay under steady handling. CHEEKY PINT
bumped lightly at the start, raced off the pace in about the two path into the first turn, advanced inside on the far turn, angled four wide leaving the quarter
pole, bid in upper- to mid-stretch, was carried out, couldn't get past the winner but was second best. LADY MAEVE (IRE) exchanged light contact at the
start, moved forward and shifted in, ceding the lead to others and content to track inside mid-division, advanced on the far turn still saving ground, came out
a few paths seeking room at the top of the stretch then angled back in as the leader began to drift out, evened out late. ERASMO'S GIRL lacked early speed
racing at the rear and saving ground inside, asked to keep pace at the seven-sixteenths, moved out on the far turn fanning six wide into upper stretch, ran
on under urging to get up and round out the super. TEXT ME UP switched off the inside in the early going racing two to three wide and advancing on the
leader early up the backstretch to press from outside, bid at the three-eighths drawing nearly even, could not keep pace, altered outside the leaders in upper
stretch and continued to weaken. TRISH THE DISH was caught outside three to four wide through the first turn racing off the leader, went two to three deep
on the far turn further back of the leaders and failed to rally. NADIABIZNIZ moved to the front shortly after the start, had the early lead briefly while shifting
in, dropped back and faded. LOOKIN TO FLY moved out from three to five wide leaving the first turn, was ridden along coming to the half, had no response.

Footnotes
UPTOWN LIGHTS settled on the rail near the rear four furlongs from home, smartly advanced on the fence in the early part of the turn, shifted outside four
wide when straightening out for the drive and drew away convincingly when roused at the furlong marker. JACK travelled in the middle of the pack four deep
down the back straight, took closer order to the leaders into the turn, pressed the issue up front with five sixteenths remaining, battled between rivals at the
top of the lane, could not match strides with the winner in mid stretch and settled for the runner up position at the finish. RAGING BEAR took control from
the beginning, continued to dictate the pace inside running on the turn, was clinging to the lead inside at the top of the stretch and faded late from the top
two while still comfortably holding for the show award at the wire. SEATTLE POINT tracked the top pair in the early going, offered a mild turn of foot around
runners two furlongs from the prize and showed some late interest to garner a minor role at the finish. GLENHOLME was allowed to settle after the break
trailing down the backside, was roused three deep at the three eighths marker, offered some run but could not reach contention through the stretch.
UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE) prompted the pace outside at the half, could not maintain position into the turn and weakened between runners at the
quarter pole. BROTHER BELEN stalked near the rear down the backstretch, offered a brief run at the seven sixteenths markers, lost ground to challengers
throughout the turn to trail at the top of the lane and galloped on the rail to the finish line.

LION KINGDOM was unhurried at the rear, picked it up on the far turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to get up in time. SOLAR was
forwardly-positioned tracking the pace from inside a rival but off the fence, shifted out five wide leaving the far turn then drifted out just a bit further, rallied to
bid late from between runners but was outfinished. JACK THE CAT broke a step slowly and was urged along, raced in the back half of the field two to three
wide into the first turn, shifted in early up the backstretch then advanced rapidly beginning at the nine-sixteenths to reach the inside flank of the leader at the
three-eighths, dropped back a bit at that point, continued to save ground on the turn, bid up the rail moving clear by mid-stretch but was outfinished while
drifting out. SEGUIMI stalked the pace three to four wide early, was within range throughout but could only run on evenly. BET raced off the pace inside foes
but off the rail, swung six wide into upper stretch, failed to menace and ran on evenly. MAD DOG N JOE moved clear and set the pace in hand racing just
off the rail while the saddle slipped forward, continued to dictate terms up the backstretch facing challenges into the far turn and with the saddle slipping
further, gave way in the stretch. COLEYVILLE was caught outside foes four to five wide early, was never near enough to threaten. NATIVE PRINCE raced
three to four wide through the first turn mid-pack, faded.

Footnotes
MERITAMEN hopped at the start, was content sitting off the pacesetter on the turn, assumed command two wide at the quarter pole, opened up in mid
stretch and held safe in the late stages for the victory. WANNA PLAY travelled between rivals in the mid field down the backside, was hard ridden to go after
the leaders five sixteenths from the wire but started to gain momentum, angled for wide for the stretch drive and determinedly chased the winner to the
finish. EYE GOT IT GOOD had a good position rating kindly in hand on the fence at the half mile marker, shifted three wide rallying at the quarter pole, was
in range of the leaders turning for home but could not find more to pose a threat in deep stretch. SPIRIT BELLE took this field down the backstretch,
continued to set the fractions through the turn, was headed by the winner outside two furlongs from home, battled on in upper stretch and yielded on the
fence in the final sixteenth. SMART IRENE stalked near the rear down the back straight, put in a mild run inside midpoint on the turn and ran evenly on the
rail to the finish line. ALWAY'S ROSIE settled in mid field at the half, was asked for more run at the three furlong pole, offered little response and could not
reach contention driving to the finish. CAUGHT AN EDGE was void of early speed to trail down the backside, could not make anything happen running
throughout the turn and was a non factor down the stretch.
