and was kept to the task. R GIRL FAITH unhurried, saved ground through the turns, angled out to come four wide into the stretch, then closed well for the
place. OMIKAMI stumbled badly at the start, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for the show.

the backstretch, drew off through the second turn, then faded in the lane. SAILOR'S SALUTE well placed and outside, was through after a half.

Footnotes
TOOLCAT rated early, moved up into the second turn, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and drew off the final sixteenth. ANOINT unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, was blocked, angled out brushing the winner, then angled out further, made a steady gain and edged for the place in the final strides.
STARSHIP BELMONT set the early pace on the inside, stayed on when loosing the lead down the backstretch and tracked the leader through the second
turn, angled out to bid three wide outside of that one, then lacked the needed late kick and held the show. MALDIVES MODEL well placed and off the rail,
moved up while angling out through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. LENTEN ROSE stalked the early pace through the
first turn, shook clear down the backstretch, then weakened the final furlong. PHAROAH'S SONG ran evenly. HAPPY BEE was a brief factor.

Footnotes
GREAT BLAKE tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, angled out and made room three
wide in the stretch, then made a steady gain and drove clear late. MASTEROFTHEHOUNDS chased the pace, gained position two and three wide through
the turn, came three wide into the stretch, was brushed by the winner making room, then was no match for that one and held the place. HENRY'S WORLD
rushed up to set the pace inside, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. WORBOTHOR allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide
through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and edged up for a share. SAMURAI LEGACY broke sharply from the gate to lead in the early going, vied
outside the leader through the turn, bid outside of that one into the stretch, then faded late. HE'S ON THE FLY well placed and outside, held position three
and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. MYSTIC POINT was never involved. BIG CHICKEN MAN showed little.

Footnotes
SAINT GOAR rated back early, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up late. THE
SINNER IS YOU mid pack and inside, raced boxed through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled four wide, made a steady gain
and lacked the needed late kick. STRANGE ARRANGE set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then weakened late
and held the show. GINS AND TINS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, then drifted in and weakened late.
C'MON MAN unhurried, moved up three wide through the turn, angled out in the stretch and improved his position. WHERE YOU WAS passed tiring rivals.
LIFE MISSION well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. RIO ABAJO vied
for the early lead on the outside, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
