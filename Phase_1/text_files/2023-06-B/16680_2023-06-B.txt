EMPIRE'S FIRE always within striking distance, moved up steadily three wide through the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch, was put to right
handed pressure and drew off to win in hand. AUGER chased the pace into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead two wide at the quarter pole then was
no match for the winner but held on for second. AUTHENTIC COWTOWN vied for the lead along the inside for a half, altered course to the five path then
finished determinedly. DOCTOR WU failed to menace. DUKE OF DARKNESS away alertly, set the pace for a half then weakened. FIRST HOMESTEAD
