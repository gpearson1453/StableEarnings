Footnotes
GOLDEN AGAIN tracked two wide outside a rival early, rounded the far turn three deep, chased the leader into the final sixteenth, put in a late bid three
deep and won the photo. SOMMER DAISY (FR) sat in mid-pack two wide in the early going, moved closer in the middle stages, got boxed in around the far
turn while in the two path, roused at the top of the lane but lacked room again in upper stretch, gained a clear path and surged late inside the top pair and
just missed. ICE QUEEN took control early and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear under right-handed urging into deep stretch and got
run down from both sides. DENDERA hopped leaving the gate and trailed early, trailed three wide into the far turn, angled five wide while advancing outside
rivals around the bend and moved to within striking range but lacked the needed late punch in the final sixteenth. BUILT DIFFERENT raced on the inside
then two wide towards the ear early, inched closer up the backstretch, gained while steering out to the four path on the far turn and finished evenly in the
furlong grounds. AWESOME TAYLOR was closest in pursuit in the two path, continued to give chase two wide through the far turn and flattened in the
stretch run. ROSE BARTON (IRE) rated along the rail, tugged closer in the middle stages but had to put the breaks on when lacking room behind the
pacesetter at the seven-sixteenths pole, remained along the fence through the far turn and flattened in the drive. KEEN LADY settled inside and saved
ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane and lacked further response. PER RULING FROM HIWU, ICE QUEEN WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
KYTHIRA was closest early then applied pressure briefly into the turn, chased the leader two wide to the stretch, headed the leader with a furlong
remaining, took over and drove clear and remained strong to the wire. THEY ARE FOR SALE brushed with outer rival at the start, chased three deep into
the turn, remained three wide into the lane, finished willingly and gained the place honors. BRUNCH WITH AMY took a bump in the beginning, sat off the
pace on the inside into the turn, eased out around the bend and came three wide into the drive, summoned a mild rally but needed more to earn second.
WHISKEY WILD sped clear and crossed over, showed the way along the inside to the stretch, headed by the winner at the eight pole, relinquished the lead
shortly after and flattened to fourth. SHE'S MY NIECE stalked between foes into the turn, rounded the bend two wide outside a rival and lacked a rally when
called upon. COCKTAIL CUTIE broke in and bumped rival, stalked inside a pair of runners into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and could not offer the
needed response. AUTUMN CHILL stumbled and brushed inner rival at the start, trailed four wide into the turn, moved into the three path then exited the
bend four wide and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
NOBLE REFLECTION took control quickly, showed the way along the inside to the stretch, remained unchallenged nearing the sixteenth pole and held well
over the late pressure from the runner-up. SEE THROUGH IT chased along along the rail to the lane, moved out in upper stretch, put in a mild late bid
outside the winner but was held at bay. EARLS ROCK (IRE) traveled two wide outside a rival at the back into the turn, angled out leaving the bend, put in a
belated rally and gained the show. TURN ON THE JETS (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, had to take up when losing his path shortly after, shifted ground at
the nine-sixteenths pole, steadied off heels into the turn, chased two wide around the bend then angled to the rail, put in a mild bid along the fence with a
sixteenth to go but lacked the needed late punch in the end. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN broke a step slow, steered to the inside trailing the field, saved
ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane then further out entering deep stretch, put in a late run but was needed to find more. CHASIN MUNNY stalked
between foes into and around the turn, moved out in the drive and weakened. BURNIN TURF broke well then took a stalking position outside a pair of rivals,
remained three wide to the stretch and weakened.

KID CORLEONE hopped at the start to lose a step but recovered quickly and cleared the field before crossing over to the inside, set the pace under
pressure into the turn, met the bids from outside pair around the bend, maintained a narrow lead approaching the eighth pole, then inched away from outer
rivals in the final furlong. ESCAPE ROUTE chased early then went up to apply pressure nearing the half-mile pole, challenged between rivals around the
turn and into the lane, dueled to midstretch and got outkicked in the final sixteenth. DISCO BALL raced up close outside the top pair early, vied three deep
around the bend, stayed on to the eighth pole, then flattened in the late stages. CYBERVIKING chased the top trio along the rail to the stretch and
weakened. AMERICAN THEOREM chased from outside, ridden along on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BELLA BABY set the pace under pressure, held a short lead over DANCING MO into the lane, fought through the stretch run and held gamely. DANCING
MO stalked two wide into the turn, bid between foes around the bend, pressured BELLA BABY through the drive, dug in nearing the wire but was too late.
SWEET MOTHER MARY pressed the pace from outside and three wide into the turn, traveled three deep around the bend, drifted out in upper stretch while
unable to stay with the top pair but kept on to best the rest. SIDE BY SIDE stalked from outside to the turn, chased four deep around the bend, got floated
out by SWEET MOTHER MARY in upper stretch and flattened out. MAGAZINE was off slow to begin, trailed three to five wide around the bend, moved
inward in the lane and lacked further response. LIL TOWN SIS settled early, navigated the turn two then three wide and could not rally.

Footnotes
HARPER'S GALLOP was closest in pursuit from the two path while in hand early, challenged from outside with three furlongs remaining, inched ahead
approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear into the lane, urged right and left-handed in the lane and held gamely in the end. SENSIBLE MOVE traveled in
mid-pack on the inside early, moved into range in the middle stages, tipped out to chase between rivals at the quarter pole and two wide into the stretch,
finished gamely outside the winner late but could not get by. SHE'S A JOKER settled outside a rival in the two path, moved inside on the back straight,
swung out into the lane and summoned a mild rally to earn the show honors. COURT SNORT saved ground near the back, had the rider lose the whip in
upper stretch, angled out and kept on under hand urging for a minor award. GHOSTEM stepped to the front and steered to the inside, set the pace to the far
turn, challenged around the bend and relinquished the lead to the winner, chased that rival into the lane and weakened. TIMELY LUCK tucked inside early,
moved into the two path on the backstretch, chased three deep into the lane and flattened out. SHEZMISBEHAVING broke a step slow on the outside and
dropped back, trailed on the inside then two wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.

POND around the turn, battled to midstretch but yielded in the final sixteenth while clearly second best. STRANGE ADDICTION stalked three deep into the
turn, spun four wide into the drive, could not make an impact on the top pair but held the show. BOLD CHOICE raced up close then had to steady between
at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two then three wide around the turn and got edged for the show. C HER BEAUTY broke a step slow, raced near the
back early, got blocked behind a rival early on the turn, moved out to a clear path around the bend and improved position. RYDER'S CANDY chased along
the rail into the turn, two wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and could not rally. JUST IS broke a step slow, traveled in mid-pack up the
backstretch off the rail, angled to the inside on the turn and failed to menace. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY came in and bumped WORK N FLIRT early,
raced in range four deep into the turn, lost ground around the bend while moving out to the five path and lacked a rally in the drive. COPPER BO TEN
pressed the pace from inside early, chased into and around the bend and retreated in the stretch run. WORK N FLIRT got bumped and forced in early,
chased three wide into the turn, came five wide into the lane and could not make an impact. THE MUSIC WE MAKE was off slow in the beginning, trailed
two wide then along the rail on the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
CORNELIA FORT stalked along the rail, started to move but had to pause behind the leader midway around the far turn, tipped out into the clear while
closest in pursuit, chased into the final sixteenth then surged by KATERINI late. KATERINI sped clear and took control of the rail, set all the pace to the
stretch, showed the way clear into the final sixteenth but got run down by the winner. SLAM DIEGO was off a bit slow then bumped with outer rival into the
first turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied three deep late and finished a game third. ANNAGHLASA (IRE) raced up close from outside early,
chased two wide through the far turn and weakened in the lane. TRAVEL SMART stalked three deep around both turns and also weakened. DOLLY MAY
(IRE) got bumped chasing three deep at the back into the first turn, traveled three then two wide into the lane and could not rally. POINT AND SHOOT got
bumped between rivals into the clubhouse turn, continued with rivals on both sides to the far turn, fell back to last and moved over to the rail around the
bend and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CLEARLY UNHINGED went up to duel from inside early, coaxed along to keep up with PLEASANT into the turn, fought along the rail through the turn and
into the lane, made light contact while battling down the stretch and dug in under left-handed urging to edge the runner-up. PLEASANT dueled from outside
then four deep early, roused to clear inner rivals at the half-mile pole and inched ahead, fought with CLEARLY UNHINGED two wide through the turn,
battled down the lane while brushing with the winner but was bested in the end while clearly second best. DELITEFULL HART broke in and bumped rival,
chased at the back off the inside, traveled four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, three wide outside HOME COOKING into the stretch and bested the rest.
HOME COOKING tried to rate early but pulled the rider forward and had to put the brakes on near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the
turn, lost ground around the bend, drifted into the lane and weakened. R SWIRVIN GIRVIN chased the top pair early then went up between to challenge
before bumping with outer rival at the half-mile pole, chased two wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend and came up empty.
DAZZLINGDOMINIKA stalked three deep early then put in a early bid between rivals and bumped at the half-mile pole, chased three wide into the turn,
dropped back around the turn and tired.

TOM AND JAZZY stalked in the two path outside a rival to the far turn, took aim around the bend and drew alongside the leader past the quarter pole, took
over in upper stretch, cleared briefly in the final sixteenth and lasted over the late rush from the runner-up. BROTHER REID settled inside near the back
then moved into the two path for the first turn, traveled three deep up the backstretch, angled out on the far turn and came five wide into the lane, moved
into range then unleashed a late surge only to miss. MISCHIEVOUS PATH traveled along the inside near the back, moved out and was coaxed along in the
middle stages between rivals, got boxed in from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths marker, angled out into the clear and was driven five wide
into the lane, put in a late run and got up for third. FROST ALERT cleared and angled over to the set the pace on the inside, was challenged from outside
past the quarter pole, lost command n upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages. NUMERO DIX (GB) had his path taken at the start, tucked inside
at the back, got boxed in at the three-eighths pole, tipped out past the five-sixteenths pole, altered out in upper stretch and kept on to improve position.
RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) tracked along the rail, got blocked and had to check behind a trouble rival at the three-eighths pole, tipped two wide between rivals
around the bend and could not rally. KO SAMUI (IRE) unhurried in the early going a bit off the rail, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, lacked room
in upper stretch and could not threaten in the late stages. TANGLEDUPINGREY had to steady when losing his path prior to the first turn, tracked outside a
rival to the second bend, was ridden along two then three wide, asked left-handed in the lane and failed to respond. FIREMAN DAN sat three wide off the
pace early, outside a rival in the middle stages, asked three then four wide on the second bend and could not rally. TRUSTY RUSTY stalked the leader from
inside, shifted in and hit the rail at the three-eighths pole and faded out of contention. WEGOTBEERONICE broke out then got brushed with outer rival early,
traveled in mid-pack along the two path, paused when cautious behind trouble rivals along the inside into the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and came
up empty.
