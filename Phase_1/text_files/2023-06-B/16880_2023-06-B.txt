of foes and surged clear under a strong hand ride. RISKY BOY settled off the early going moved up three to four wide in the stretch run racing between
rivals and finished willingly to the wire. MUD ISLAND stalked the early pace setters, took aim to split rivals near the three sixteenths three deep and was
outkicked late to hold the show position. GREELEYS ICE dropped back early on, swung six to seven wide into the upper stretch to take aim and flattened
out in the drive. WINGING WAYS showed good foot to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way in the stretch run. CHOPPER pressed the early

MADELYN BELLE was sent a long from the outside, took control early on to set the early pace and drew off to be well clear in the stretch run under a mild
hand ride. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY tracked the early leader from the inside and kept on to hold the place position. TU ROYAL stalked the early pace, raced
four wide around the far turn, raced along for third as he was no match for the top pair. NAPABIT was bumped at the break, raced mid pack early, raced
three to four wide in the drive and was even with no closing run. LADY WHITE SOX dropped back early off the early pace, raced five deep into the upper
stretch and lacked a rally. FEATURED POWER was slow early and never threatened. DILLYDILLY DIAMOND was bumped at the start, saved ground
around the far turn and was eased up on in the stretch run.

to improve position. UNCLE NICK stalked the pace along the inside and weakened. POWERFUL MAN tracked the early leader from the outside and faded.

Footnotes
ACT A FOOL set his own pace to race in hand on clear early lead and kept a clear margin through the stretch run while being kept to pressure. REALLY
GOOD raced in tight quarters early on while racing near the inside, angled out near the quarter pole to race four wide and rallied for the place position late.
OUT OF DEDUCTIONS was off a step slow, stalked the pace racing three deep down the backstretch, chased the early leader through the far turn and
weakened a bit off the top pair in the stretch drive. WOLF HUNTER tracked the early leader from the inside and was empty in the drive. RUSSIAN
HAMMER stalked the pace and tired while racing three to four wide. MONEY AGENT was off slowly, swung six wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened.

ELI'S PROMISE was off slowly, settled off the early going after the poor start, raced near the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch, angled
four wide through the stretch run and just got up in his final stride under strong handling. LOOKIN FOR BALA showed good early foot to set a pressured
early pace two deep from the outside of foe, was clear inside the eighth pole and just missed while being caught on the wire. RIVZONAROLL pressed the
early leader from the inside and kept on willingly to the wire. SHARP AZ NAILS was off slowly, raced off the early going, swung wide into the upper stretch
and lacked a rally. CALL ME ICE MAN stalked the top pair and faded in the drive. SNOWMOBILE settled off the early going and failed to respond.

COMMAND CENTRAL showed good early speed from the outside to cross over from the outside to set the early pace and held gamely in the drive to
remain clear under strong handling. SIMPLE LOGIC rated under a firm hold two deep down the backstretch, asked through the far turn, raced four wide into
the upper stretch to take aim but couldn't get by the winner in a game effort. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD settled off the early going, advanced into the far turn
and moved up to improve position while racing four to five wide. BAKENEKO tracked the early leader two deep, challenged near the quarter pole and
weakened through the stretch drive. SON OF GRACE was slow early on, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. BEN
DREAMING stalked the pace along the inside and faded. STRIKE PRICE raced mid pack early on, was near the rail past the quarter pole and had no
response. BEEALEA dropped back early on, raced six deep in the stretch and lacked a bid. FAMILY TRADITION settled off the early going and failed to
respond. The photo finish margins estimated by equibase staff due to photo finish malfunction.

Footnotes
MAD DRAGON showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and held gamely to prove best under steady pressure. UNCAPTURED
DREAM stalked the pace, moved up four to five wide into the upper stretch and slowly closed in on the winner late in a willing effort. CHERRY ORCHARD
dropped back off the early pace, moved up from the far outside in the stretch and closed in belatedly. STAN THE CAMERAMAN chased the early pace,
raced three to four wide in the stretch and raced evenly late with no closing run. BLACK RUSSIAN was off slowly, raced two to three wide in the drive and
lacked a bid. DEVLISH HOUR tracked the early leader two deep and faltered in the drive. ADDIE'S PEACHES dropped back early, raced near the rail
around the far turn and had no response.
