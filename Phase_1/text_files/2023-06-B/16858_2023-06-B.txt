Footnotes
ZIPSTER unhurried early to be at the rear of the field, steadily gained ground into the turn while racing up the fence, cut the corner at the head of the lane
and closed willingly to draw clear. EAGLEFORD stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, eased up to assume command at the quarter pole, finished
well as second best having been outkicked by the winner. LOST GOLD tracked the pace from four wide into the turn, rallied to threaten at the quarter pole
and finished evenly. DEVITO rated off the early pace, was taken off the rail to be in the three path down the backside, was called upon midway in the turn
and lacked any response. GHURAIR'S WARRIOR pressed the pace for the first three eighths and steadily faded. WINNY'SSPECIALSTAR was sent to the
lead shortly from the gate, set the pace for a half mile and tired.

Footnotes
COGBURN reared at the start hitting the gate giving the field several lengths, was gathered together finding stride at the rear of the field, angled out at the
head of the lane and commenced a furious, determined drive to pass the field down the stretch and be up in the final strides. BIG CHOPPER unhurried early
to be at the back of the field with the exception of the winner, found his best stride turning for home and closed with a rush to overtake the pacesetter but be
out-nodded on the line in a good effort. ATRAS broke alertly to spring to a clear lead shortly away from the gate, maintained that advantage to mid-stretch,
dug-in gamely down the lane but could not hold off the two fast closing rivals. EXCESS MAGIC prompted the pace from three wide through the turn looming
boldly in upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. REBEL POSSE raced up between horses to press the early pace, dropped back on the turn and faded
in the stretch. CHESS MASTER well placed in the early going to stalk the leaders, moved up the fence to mount a challenging rally at the quarter pole and
failed to gain ground down the lane.

Footnotes
BURNINHUNKOFLOVE set the pressured pace along the inside, then slowly inched away down the late backstretch and into the turn, then drew off in the
early stretch and was ridden out to the end to prove best. AMERICAN SMOOTH pressed the pace while four wide down the early furlongs, was moving up
on the turn to gain the place position entering the home stretch but was no match for the leader in the end. DUDE PERFECTA settled behind the field down
the backstretch, was gaining on the turn from the three path then raced evenly throughout the stretch drive. TEXAS BAD BOY settled back along the inside
down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the turn and was no threat. BOLD N WILD bid for the lead early, then settled back behind most of the field and
was no menace. EASY BIG BOY pressed the pace while three wide down the backstretch then flattened out throughout the turn and had no final bid. SAINT
PIO pressed the pace from the two path in a hard drive down the backstretch, was used up and stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
GLENALL (IRE) settled to stalk the pace in hand through the first turn and down the backside, tipped out nearing the quarter pole to engage the pacesetter
from two wide turning for home, battled that one through upper stretch and pulled away half way down the lane to be a convincing winner. TIPSY GAL sped
to the lead without encouragement from the gates, opened a clear lead in the first turn, maintained her advantage to the final turn, responded gamely when
engaged midway on the final bend, dueled with the winner to mid-stretch and was out-kicked late while being clearly second best in a game effort. COLORS
OF THE WIND unhurried in the early going settling near the rear of the field, made steady progress down the backside to be in striking distance in the far
turn and finished willingly while unable to gain on the top pair. TEMPLAR RED slow early to trail through the first turn, remained toward the rear down the
backside, was set to a drive in the far turn while circling three wide and gained a bit of ground in the drive. STELLACZAR well placed to be tracking the
leaders from the fence down the backside but lacked a closing kick finishing evenly. IMALUCKYCHARM tracked the leaders from three wide in the first turn
and down the backstretch, was asked for her rally into the far turn, moved into a prominent striking position but flattened out in upper stretch. GLITTERARY
raced near the rear or at the back of the field most of the trip and never posed a threat showing some mild late interest.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS N ACES was moving up while two wide down the backstretch to stalk the pace throughout the turn, then edged clear in the early stretch and
was kept to task till the end. GEE SHE'S FANCY chased the pace from the inside, then bid gamely on the turn, gained place position mid stretch but could
not catch the leader in the end. LEXINGTON DIVA was unhurried early, then came out five wide leaving the bend to rally in late stretch and was closing
well. SENORITA BROOKE chased the pace while two wide, then rallied on turn before giving way in late stretch. QUEEN OF THUNDER was in tight early
and taken up, then raced along the inside, rallied in the late stretch but it was too little too late. JAGO raced in the two path towards the back of the field and
was no menace. MORE THAN SHAKIN set the unpressured pace down the backstretch and into the turn then faltered in the stretch. FAST TRACK raced at
a moderate pace in the middle of the pack while three wide then flattened out on the turn and into stretch.

UNBRIDLED MARY unhurried early to trail the field while taken five wide down the backstretch, angled in to the two path in the turn while commencing her
rally, split horses while patiently handled waiting for an opening, burst through in upper stretch, collared the leader inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear
at the wire in a well handled ride. TIZ MAGIC sped to the lead shortly from the gate, dueled early from the rail on the pace, shook off the pressure turning for
home to open a clear advantage but could not hold off the fast closing winner while second best in a good effort. REPASADO stalked the rapid pace from
three wide, continued to chase into upper stretch, could not close ground on the pacesetter but kept on willingly to hold the show. GET THE CANDY tracked
the pace while saving ground along the rail, angled out for the drive but could not gain down the stretch. SPEEDOMETER urged early to keep contact with
the field, was put to a drive into the turn and made a mild finishing rally. AMALFI SKY rated in mid-pack for the early going angled four wide turning for home
but lacked a late closing kick. STRESSED pressed the pace from between horses to upper stretch and weakened in the final eighth. QUATRO went evenly
as a non-factor.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL MOON set the pace from the inside into the first turn, was in a long drive heading into the home stretch and was kept to task till the end proving
best gate to wire. MIAMI MOONLIGHT stalked the pace from the inside under a steady hand ride throughout the first three quarters then closed belatedly
down the home stretch to be up for the place prize. HOLY EMPEROR stalked the pace while two wide, was urging on the far turn to rally in the stretch and
closed willingly just missing the place prize in the end. BIG BERNIE pressed the pace down the backstretch while two wide, then inched up on the far turn to
duel with the leader briefly then gave way in the stretch. FEDERAL HILL chased the pace from the two path and between rivals at an even pace throughout
and needed rally. SINGING DIXIE chased the pace while three wide and was flat throughout and needed rally. BAREFOOT SAMURAI was unhurried early
and failed to rally. R DOC reared up at the start and lost chance.

Footnotes
KING CAUSE kept in the clear racing five wide down the stretch the first time, eased into the two path in the first turn to be unhurried at the back of the main
body, drifted back out wide down the backstretch, commenced a four wide rally into the turn to close in on the leaders quickly, opened a clear lead in upper
stretch and held the closer safe. KOKOKOMO slow early to trail the field, picked up his pace nearing the far turn splitting horses at the three-eighths pole to
commence his rally, dropped to the fence turning for home and closed well to be second best. DEAN MARTINI raced up the fence to lead the dueling trio of
pacesetters from the first turn to the far turn, shook free of the two pressers turning for home but had nothing left to respond to the challenge of the closers
in the lane but kept on willingly to hold the show. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) reserved off the early pace away from the main pack, rallied into the turn saving
ground along the rail angled out for the drive and continued to grind down the lane. CAIRO WARRIOR well placed to be in the clear tracking the dueling
pacesetters, closed ground into the turn and flattened out down the stretch. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS pressed the pace from between horses for three
quarters of a mile and gave way on the final bend. LOGICAL MYTH dueled from three wide the entire trip to the top of the lane and came up empty turning
for home.
