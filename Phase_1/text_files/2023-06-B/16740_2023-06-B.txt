NORTHERN QUEST was allowed to settled around the turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch, rallied to take command at the sixteenth pole
and drew clear. JIMBO'S BIZ prompted the pace from the two path through the turn then engaged the leader at the quarter pole and shared command to the
eighth pole but was out kicked by late outside closer. HOT ARTIE went to the front to an unchallenged lead through the turn then was headed at the quarte
pole and match strides with outside rival to the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. FORT KNOX raced off the pace on the inside in the middle of the pack
while racing evenly. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE chased the field and was not a threat. PERVASIVE was forwardly placed through the turn then drifted out in
upper stretch and gave way.

VICTORY BOULEVARD tracked the leaders down the backstretch then was coaxed at the half pole from two wide, moved up to engage the leader at the
quarter pole and drew off to prove best. MASTERPIECE DAY went to the front to set the pace for a half then was headed at the quarter pole and kept on to
be a clear second. DEBONNAIRE DUDE raced near the back from three wide and passed tired on to be best of the rest. RANCHER was roused to be off
the pace to mid turn from two wide and faded. MORE ACTION remained back.

NEW YEARS LOVE tracked the leaders around the turn then made a strong rail bid in the stretch, was determined and nailed the leader in the final jump.
SENTIMENTAL CROSS went to the front to an unchallenged lead and was nailed in the final jump. AUNT IRENE prompted the pace from the two path but
lacked the late response. SNICKEL TE had no speed and was not a threat. ELEMENTAL raced from three wide around the turn then floated out into the
stretch and lacked a kick.

MAIUS was hustled to vie for the lead from three wide then moved up to engage the leader at the quarter pole and matched strides to the eighth pole, shook
loose and drew clear. BULLAWAY trailed the field to the turn from five wide then moved in to four wide around the turn, moving in to three wide in upper
stretch and made a late gain on the leader to be a game second. GUNSLINGERS LEGACY set a pressured pace from the two path around the turn then
dueled for a furlong into the stretch and tired. TUFF WILLY TE tracked the leaders but never made a bid. FRIENDLY FOE shared command to the seven
sixteenths pole and gave way.

NAUGHTY EVELYN went to the front to a pressured lead to the three eighths then edged away and drew off in the stretch. GYPSY ROSIE hustled along to
press the pace to the three furlong pole then fell back, fended off outside rival in the stretch to save the place. HIGH GUNNER was rushed up to be off the
pace, moved up from three wide around the turn and was a game third, vanned off. SMOKIN AMELIA was five wide down the backstretch then saved
ground around the turn but flattened out. MIZZEN MILLIONS raced near the back on the inside down the backstretch then moved out to two wide on the
turn but didn't make a bid. WHAT A WAY TO GO had no speed and remained back. RETRO RITA tracked the leaders to the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
BIG HEAT vied for the lead from four wide to the top for the stretch then edged clear and was kept to task in the drive. WHISTLING HOME was off the pace
to the turn then made a three wide bid for a late run but was no match for the winner and proved second best. VIRTUALLY saved ground throughout, made
a late stretch rally to be best of the rest. TRULY A MESS raced near the back through the turn and passed tiring rivals. CAJUN TRINITY was reluctant to
load, then pressed the pace to the seven sixteenths pole and faded. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK was rushed to the lead through the turn then was headed at
the five sixteenths pole and tired. UNPLUCKED GEM prompted the pace to the half pole and dropped back. BREAKFAST BALL was always back.
