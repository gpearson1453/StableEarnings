Footnotes
KIT CAN RUN was off a bit slowly, raced off the early pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside, took over near the sixteenth
pole, switched back to the left lead soon after and edged ahead under a drive. RANSOM STYLE raced in range two wide, bid three wide around the far turn,
could not quite keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on between foes to gain the place. LOVELY DRAMA stalked the pace two and three wide, took over
near the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and just lasted for the show. ANTRIM saved ground in midpack,
advanced two wide around the far turn, angled back the rail in midstretch and just missed third. CONNECTING FLIGHT broke outwardly and bumped
LOVELY DRAMA at the start, raced off the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. CASTLE BORN saved ground off the pace, made progress at the
rail around the far turn, checked off heels near the quarter pole and had no further bids. MY FIRST DATE hit the starting gate, raced three and four wide and
never threatened. CARAVANA chased the pace three wide and retreated through the lane. KRAZYKATKOUSIN set the pace along the rail, stopped around
the far turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
STREAKING GREY rushed up from the five path around the first turn and set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, lost the lead and was put to a
ride along the rail early around the far turn, began to fight on from the inside turning into the stretch, and re-rallied in the final furlong to get back up just in
time. CHARGE ACCOUNT settled in range around the five path, lost ground midway down the backside, was under right handed urging in the four path
rounding the far turn, went back out to the five path into the stretch, ran on to bid into the final sixteenth, but just missed the bob to finish with place.
CRYSTAL COAST prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead in the two early around the far turn and opened up midway around that turn, was cued
from the three path into the lane, but began to shorten up into the final furlong, and was caught on both sides in the final strides to show. LA RUSIA rated in
the three path, was driven between foes in the two path rounding the far turn, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on but had to steady
between in the final strides. KIZZY tracked in the two path, dropped back along the rail early around the far turn, and made no impact from the five path
down the lane. LOVE MY JOB pulled while up close in the four path but was empty turning into the stretch. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF
LA RUSIA AGAINST THE RIDER OF CHARGE ACCOUNT FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
SIR KAHN raced off the pace in the two path, advanced under a hand ride along the rail rounding the turn and took the lead passing the quarter pole,
opened up around the three path into the stretch, and held sway. MAJOR KING prompted the pace along the rail early, lost position between rivals and was
under coaxing passing the three eighths pole, shifted out to the four path into the lane, and stayed on for place. SUN VIKING chased in the five path, was
roused turning into the lane, and kept on for show. MOPED DENNIS raced in midpack around the four path, had to steady nearing the three eighths pole,
fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, but did not factor. EXALTED CHARM bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path but made no
impact. ASSERT DOMINANCE stalked in the two path early, tipped out to the three path into the turn, was stymied between foes nearing the three
sixteenths pole, floated out to the eighth path in upper stretch, and did not threaten. TORETTO bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the
three path, but lost the lead while in the two path approaching the quarter, and gaveway.

Footnotes
NORTHSHORE DRIVE prompted the pace between foes in the two path, bid from the four path turning into the lane, ran on to sustain that bid into the final
furlong, and inched past an inner foe in the final sixteenth. LE DOM BRO bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside into the turn, was driven
from the two path into the stretch, dug in and fought on under left handed encouragement thru the stretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth. JIGSAW
bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated along the inside, shifted out around the turn and was driven from the six path into the lane, and finished evenly
for show. DONTBESOOGROUCHY bumped with an inner foe at the start, was behind in the seven path early, shifted to the three path early around the
turn, angled back out to the eight path in upper stretch, but was one paced. A G DIAMOND was reluctant to load, vied for the lead in the three path but
faded turning into the stretch. CELTIC PRIDE was factious in the gate and bumped between foes at the start, raced wellback in the four path, tipped inside
around the turn and moved up into the stretch, but flattened. PAISAN got bumped on both sides at the start, was pushed along in range around the four
path, floated out to the seven path into the lane, but made no impact. PRAISEWORTHY chased in the six path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the
stretch, and was no menace. EL ROJO VIVO bumped with an outer foe at the start, was hustled in midpack from the three path but was done early.

Footnotes
OH DARLIN pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter pole and drew clear while ridden out. SEQUIN LADY saved ground off the pace,
tipped out turning for home and ran on for the place. KOTYLE tracked the pace in the four path, was no match for the winner but held well enough to
preserve the show. FRENCH KISSING failed to menace while racing three wide. PRINCESS BLAKELY chased the pace two wide and came up empty in
the lane. LUNA WEST set the pace in the two path and faltered in the stretch. SEA ART had her head turned at the start and trailed in the four path.

Footnotes
PROVERB was fractious in the gate, prompted along while in range around the three path, bid into the turn and took the lead midway around the turn,
stayed on from the three path into the stretch, drifted out slightly inside the final furlong, but held on. HERCULES was behind in the four path into the turn,
circled inner foes from the five path around the turn and bid into the stretch, ran on to sustain that bid into the final furlong, was carried out slightly in the final
sixteenth, and hung for place. UNCORK THE BOTTLE chased in the five path, tipped into the three path rounding the turn, angled back out to the seven
path in upper stretch, and was along for show. URANIUM raced off the pace in the two path, was under coaxing along the rail rounding the turn, tipped out
to the six path into the lane, but made no impact. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED stalked in the four path, but lost ground between foes around the turn, and did
not threaten from the eight path down the lane. NATURE BOY set the pace inside but yielded rounding the turn.

MONFORTE dueled two wide, drew clear in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. VELOCE raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied through
the lane. WINNING FACTOR raced off the duel in the three path, advanced three wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner through the lane
but was one-paced through the final furlong. WAR CROSS saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch and rallied between rivals. DREAM

wide in midpack, was in traffic in upper stretch, swung widest leaving the eighth pole and finished well. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND failed to menace while
racing four and five wide. THENORTHREMEMBERS played no factor while racing four and five wide. POUND GREEN chased the pace inside and lacked

TALKIN TIPSY tracked in the three path, ranged up in the four path around the turn, took aim while floating out to the eight path into the stretch, rallied past
an inner trio in the final furlong, and went clear. MOOR STRENGTH trailed in the two path, was driven in the four path rounding the turn, shifted out to the
seven path into the lane, and ran on for place. SASSY BEAST was forwardly place in the four path, bid in the five path rounding the turn, kept on from the
six path into the stretch, led narrowly passing the eighth pole, but evened out and was caught by an outer pair to show. TIME PASSAGE set the pace along
the rail, fought on turning into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. SHOWGIRL LYNNE B raced off the pace along the rail, was in the three path turning
into the stretch, but made no impact. CHOOSE JOY vied for the lead between foes in the two path early but faded from the three path down the lane.
FULTON MARKET pressed between in the three path but weakened from the four path in the stretch.

Footnotes
FLAKES broke outwardly, raced in range four wide, steadily gained around the turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch,
swished her tail when urged right-handed multiple times in midstretch then dug in gamely under solid hand urging the final sixteenth to fend of CHARLIE'S
WISH's late charge. CHARLIE'S WISH raced off the pace four wide, angled wider near the quarter pole, steadily gained outside of the winner through the
lane and just missed. PACHUCA raced off the pace six and was along for the show. ARELLA STAR chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed
rally. IT TAKES HEART pressed the pace in the three path, briefly led near the five-sixteenths pole and faded through the lane. JELLICLE KATZ checked
entering the turn, steadily angled out around the bend, entered the lane in the seven path and never threatened. QUEEN KARIMA was off bit slowly, rushed
up inside, set the pace in the two path and retreated through the lane. GIRVIN GIRL was outrun in the two path.

Footnotes
SPLURGE tracked along the rail, tipped out to the three path and was roused early around the turn, took aim from the five path into the stretch, and stayed
on to be up on the wire. LOVE MAMI LOVE raced prominently in the three path, took command approaching the quarter, opened up into the stretch, and
fought on but was nailed on the wire by an outer foe to place. SEA PEARL broke out at the start, raced in midpack around the five path, was under coaxing
in the four path rounding the turn, angled out to the six path into the lane, and kept on for show. EILAT pressed along the rail, waited for an opening passing
the quarter, tipped out to the two path at the top of the stretch, but evened out. ROMASHKA stalked in the two path, but lost ground while in the three path
rounding the turn, and did not factor from the six path in the stretch. AWESOME VALENTINE had a slow start, rated inside, tipped out to the four path into
the lane, but made no impact. R AWESOME SAUCE raced wellback in the three path and did not threaten from the seven path in the stretch. OUR
FORTUNE COOKIE chased in the four path, but had to check between foes in the two path nearing the quarter, and was eased thru the lane. SECRET OF
SARATOGA set the pace in the two path, but gaveway from inside and brushed turning into the lane. AMARULA SUN broke in at the start and never
menaced around the six path.
