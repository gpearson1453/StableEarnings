OPTIMIZME good position from off rail to the turn, rallied outside in time while ridden out. WITCHING HOUR inside trip to the stretch, ran on well split
horses in the stretch and led but nailed at the wire in a good effort. SHEZADADDYSGIRL chased leader to turn, took over into stretch, wore down late.
AWESOME VALOR inside run to turn in good position, dug in gamely, faltered. DOGWOODS BECCA shuffled start, ran into a bit of traffic in stretch, mildly.
VIVI BRASS saved ground to the turn to no avail. BIRD SET FREE never a menace throughout. SHADY DAISY never a factor. MARLAND broke well and
failed to threaten. HER TIME IS NOW rushed with inside brief speed to the turn and began to bear out into the turn while fading.
