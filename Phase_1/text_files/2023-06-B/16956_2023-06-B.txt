Footnotes
HARBOR SKY checked slightly leaving the break, tracked the decent early pace while inside of rivals, raced two then three wide to the quarter marker while
well placed, angled four wide into the drive, loomed at the furlong marker, overtook DICK BEST approaching the sixteenth-pole and kicked clear under
moderate urging in deep stretch. DICK BEST broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions to the turn then was pressed by
AMANOFMYSTATURE to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to the furlong marker, was overtaken by HARBOR SKY heading to the sixteenth-pole
and was outfinished by the winner, while besting the rest. AMANOFMYSTATURE tracked the decent early pace, advanced to press the pacesetter to the
quarter marker while inside of that rival, battled with DICK BEST to mid-stretch, weakened in the final furlong and held safely for third. MR. CLUTCH raced
close to the early pace, gave chase while three wide on the turn, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch and gave way. MYSTIC TBILISI chased the
decent early pace, lost ground three wide on the turn and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHUCKANUT BAY was away a step slowly but recovered to be forwardly placed early on, advanced outside of rivals along the turn and vied for the lead
while three deep nearing the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task under steady
urging to prevail. CHAOKOON took back off of the solid early pace, gained ground while three wide on the turn, rallied into the stretch, put mild late pressure
on the winner but could not reel in CHUCKANUT BAY and was second best. DR LOW KEY chased the solid pace while inside of rivals, swung widest
leaving the turn and came five wide into the drive, raced on the left lead to the sixteenth-marker, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch and
passed tiring rivals to secure third. ZOOKEEPER was sent leaving an alert beginning and dictated terms to the turn, set a pressured pace along the bend
while carving out solid fractions, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker and gave way. EDDIE CROSSWIRE stumbled leaving the
start but recovered to be close to the decent early pace, pressed the solid pace on the turn while between runners, lost position heading to the furlong
marker and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
ITS THIEVERY was well placed in the early stages and stalked the decent pace from a ground saving position, was roused nearing the quarter marker and
tipped three wide for the stretch drive, reeled in BUTTONWOOD TREE inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the final sixteenth. BUTTONWOOD
TREE broke a step slowly and was hustled to establish the early lead, set decent fractions through the backstretch run and held a comfortable margin to the
far turn, was erratic and swerved while leading approaching the furlong marker, weakened in the final stages, was overtaken by the winner nearing the
sixteenth marker and held safely for second. DANCE COMPANY settled just off of the early pace and raced outside of rivals into the first turn, advanced to
stalk the decent pace along the backstretch run, maintained a three wide path to the quarter marker, ran evenly in the stretch run and was outkicked, while
well clear of the rest for third. DANNY MICHAEL settled off of the early pace while outside of a rival, tracked the decent fractions through the backstretch
run, raced two wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the leaders into upper stretch and lacked a late rally. TAKE THE TWO TEN was
unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the backstretch run and was not far back heading to the half-mile marker, was outrun along the far turn
and did not threaten. ALGERIA (IRE) settled off of the decent early pace while outside of rivals, tracked the pace through the backstretch run, could not
keep pace into the far turn and was not persevered with in the stretch drive.

JAZZY LOVE settled just off of the early pace while racing inside of rivals, advanced to stalk the moderate pace through the backstretch run, was roused
three wide between runners nearing the quarter marker, chased HAPPY IS to mid-stretch, responded to urging in the drive, caught HAPPY IS nearing the
sixteenth-marker and drew away in the final stages to prevail. HAPPY IS was sent in the early stages and contested the moderate pace with KERRYGOLD
LADY, carved out a decent pace with that rival to the half-mile marker, shook free along the far turn and was set down in upper stretch, held foes at bay to
the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished, while besting the rest. BIG JOLT settled off of the early pace while
not far back, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the quarter marker and came within aim approaching the top of the
stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and could not match strides with the top pair in the final stages, while clear of the rest for third. KERRYGOLD
LADY broke alertly and was prominent into the first turn, contested the moderate pace with HAPPY IS through the backstretch run, lost position along the far
turn, chased into upper stretch and tired in the drive. ZAFFERANA raced close to the early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground along the backstretch
run, chased four wide along the far turn, could not keep pace in the stretch drive and gave way. ESCAPE FREE (IRE) was unhurried in the early running,
saved ground into the backstretch run, raced in the three path along the far turn while trailing and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLURSDAY broke alertly and established the early advantage, set decent fractions while well handled into the turn, drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter
marker, extended the lead heading to the furlong pole, had the margin cut into a bit by the oncoming runner-up but remained clear to the wire to hold sway.
BARBERA raced close to the moderate early pace, lost ground to BLURSDAY along the turn and chased that rival from the three path into the stretch, was
able to close into the winner's margin in the final furlong but could not reel in BLURSDAY and bested the rest. ELEGANCE CODE chased the moderate
pace from the inside, was not able to match strides with the top pair inside of the furlong marker and was outkicked, while holding safely for third at the
finish. RAUCOUS TIZZY chased the early pace while between rivals, was coaxed along three wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into upper
stretch and tired. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE took back and was allowed to settle, was steered three wide into the turn, chased into upper stretch and did not
factor. AMANDA ROSE chased the early pace while outside of rivals, lost ground on the turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
SMILING LADY was away a step slowly and was asked to show speed in the early stages, assumed command into the first turn and set the pace into the
backstretch run, was well handled while carving moderate fractions to the far turn, raced in hand into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong
marker, was kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and was geared down in the final yards as much the best. CARMEL BY THE SEA tracked the
pace from the inside early on, was well placed while saving ground through the backstretch run, made a steady gain from the rail into the far turn, tipped
three wide for the drive and floated out PRINCESA DEL TIGRE, could not keep pace with SMILING LADY in the final furlong and held well in deep stretch to
secure the place. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE was prominent in the early running and attended to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, maintained a
three wide path to the quarter marker then was floated out a path in upper stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong and missed for
second, while well clear for third. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA stumbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, settled
between rivals through the backstretch run, gave chase along the far turn, was outrun into upper stretch and lacked a late rally. MASTERY KAT raced
outside of rivals into the first turn and stalked the pace from the four path into the backstretch run, lost ground along the backstretch run and angled to the
two path heading to the far turn, was outrun along the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
BOB'S BLUE MOON broke alertly then was on the outside of a trio setting a moderate pace down the backstretch, took command passing the half-mile
marker, drew away to open lengths through the turn then was never threatened in the stretch, holding sway under intermittent right handed urging. SILENT
SUNDAY broke through the gate before the start, lost the rider, was caught by the assistant starter then reloaded, broke awkwardly at the start, then veered
out into IRISH CORN, those two bumped again within a few feet, once gathered worked to the inside, gained a brief lead before being overtaken by BOB'S
BLUE MOON before the turn, came under a ride with a quarter mile to run and kept to task well enough to hold second by a clear margin. STRENGTH OF
AUTISM settled off the pace in the early stages, was asked to pick up the pace rallied three wide into the stretch and was unable to threaten the top pair but
finished well enough to gain the show. TALK ABOUT AUTISM broke well then allowed the pace to shape up in front, moved away from the rail heading into
the turn, made a two or three wide bid through the turn then stalled a bit mid-stretch and was outfinished for third. GULARA kept to the inside throughout,
struggled to keep up early, fell far behind, had some late run and made up some ground in the end but was never a serious threat. IRISH CORN broke
alertly but was bumped from the inside by SILENT SUNDAY, raced up close between horses down the backstretch, stopped near the quarter pole and was
not persevered with from that point to the wire.
