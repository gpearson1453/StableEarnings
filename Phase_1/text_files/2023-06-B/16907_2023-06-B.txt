Footnotes
SUNDAY SPEIGHT saved ground through the bend, moved clear upper stretch, began to wear down in the late going but dug in and held JERSEY JET at
bay. JERSEY JET contested the pace outside SUNDAY SPEIGHT, did not keep up into the lane, came again as she slowly drifted out under left-handed
pressure the last eighth, came up short but was easily second best. TIGGER ATTACK was away slowly, angled in to be just off the rail on the bend, moved
out three wide upper stretch for a clear path then could only pull away for third late. BELLA FRANCESCA also broke slowly then bobbled a few strides from
the gate, chased from outside, was four wide on the turn, angled in entering the stretch and failed to have a significant response. RARE BEAUTY chased
from just off the inside, angled out into the bend and flattened out the last two furlongs. MOCOWBELL fractious in the gate, broke well, soon gave way from
inside, steadily distanced himself from the rest of the field, finished the course and was walked off.

Footnotes
WHITE CASHEL hesitated at the break, was soon well back though urged along, picked up her pace along the rail through the bend, came into contention
upper stretch, angled out four wide for a clear path inside the last furlong and got up in the waning yards. BLUE EVEN SCORE also was somewhat slow at
the break, advanced from inside on the backstretch, came off the rail some on the turn, fanned four wide for the drive, floated out some midstretch and
found best too late deep stretch. DART ATTACK shared the early lead from outside, moved clear and stayed in path three through the bend then slowly
wore down between rivals deep stretch. TINA'S TAPIZAR vied for the lead between horses on the backstretch, did not keep up two wide on the turn and
also weakened in the late going. RAIN ATTACK displayed early speed from inside, remained a serious threat to inside the last eighth then also began to
wear down. BRIANA HARPER chased from outside, was widest taking the bend and had no late bid. BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER faded just off the inside on
the turn.

under urging the was allowed to coast the final seventy yards. ROAD GAME in contention early, advanced four wide on the turn, fanned outside LITTLE
MIGHTY MAN into the stretch, was no match for that one but proved easily second best. W W RUSSIAN GOLD soon trailed from inside, swung out leaving
the bend, came widest into the lane and passed tired ones to gain third. W W TRAFALGAR hesitated at the break then steadied briefly in traffic, moved up
quickly between horses, took the rail midway on the backstretch, did not keep up leaving the turn, angled out to path three upper stretch, had no rally then
altered in when PRINCE OF MAYHEM crossed his path inside the last furlong. PRINCE OF MAYHEM displayed early speed just off the inside, was
overtaken on the turn, retreated as the top pair moved clear upper stretch then steadily drifted out inside the final eighth. IT'S BELLAMY TIME pressed the
pace between horses on the backstretch but gave way two wide on the bend.

MISS TENA MARIE chased the top pair, commenced her bid three wide on the bend, fanned out further entering the lane and edged ahead of RISKY
SPIRIT in the waning yards. RISKY SPIRIT vied for the lead from outside from the beginning, was two wide on the turn, drifted out some upper stretch,
edged ahead, was all out in the late going, did not have enough left nearing the wire but was clearly second best. TOO CLOSE contested the pace from
inside but flattened out the final furlong. COOGAN was checked while in tight quarters behind traffic into the bend, just off the rail through the turn and had
no late bid. SOLICITOR broke inward, trailed from inside, angled out midway on the turn and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
ST. LOUIE LOUIE broke alertly, was soon clear of the rest and taken inside, challenged on the bend but drew off under urging in the lane and maintained
control under steady handling. MIDNITE REVOLUTION dwelt at the break then took some time to find his stride, advanced from inside on the turn, took over
second upper stretch, angled out some for a clear path with a furlong to go, could only make up minor ground on the leader in the late going, pulled up with
an injury after finishing the race and was vanned off. KNUCKLE was away somewhat slowly, three wide on the bend, rallied belatedly from outside in the
lane and moved clear for third deep stretch. DURANGO CHROME helped prompt the early pace, was just off the inside taking the turn then flattened out for
the drive. DRAGGING MAIN chased from just off the inside, angled out some in the lane but had no significant response. RA'DOM prominent from outside,
went for the lead outside ST. LOUIE LOUIE on the bend but could not sustain his bid in the stretch. RED BIRD quickly faded from outside, fell from a
serious injury, was humanely euthanized and vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry into RED BIRD'S loss of action and collapse. No changes were
made after their review.

Footnotes
JACK VAN BERG broke in stride and sprinted away from the rest, was roused leaving the bend, lengthened command some upper stretch, began to wear
down inside the last eighth but held sway under steady handling. PERFECT WAGER chased from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, lost further
ground staying outside PACHI into the lane, edged ahead for second and was closing in on the leader late. KARAYEL between rivals on the backstretch,
was three wide taking the bend, angled out widest of all upper stretch, showed a willingness to run late and edged ahead for third nearing the wire. NOT
AGAIN JACKIE progressed just off the inside on the turn, moved out a bit upper stretch, was also closing in on the tiring leader the final sixteenth but
leveled off in the waning yards. PACHI closest to JACK VAN BERG in the early going, stayed in path three on the bend, drifted out to path five into the
stretch and began to wear down the final furlong. DEVIL'S RULE soon trailed, had the rail on the turn, swung out to path three entering the lane, altered in
nearing the eighth pole for a clear path, bumped TALIS PARK GRAD and no significant bid deep stretch. TALIS PARK GRAD began to retreat from inside
on the turn, was bumped near the furlong marker and continued to gradually yield.

Footnotes
KING DOODLE jostled briefly with STOLICH shortly after the break, was steadied while boxed in behind traffic on the first bend, angled to the outside
entering the backstretch, steadily advanced, lost ground in path four then five through the second turn, vied for the lead inside the last eighth and edged
ahead late. ARROW STRIKE also jostled briefly with STOLICH just after the start, raced in contention between horses, angled out for a clear path midway
on the backstretch, went for the lead outside TIZWOW on the second turn, came into the stretch from path four, battled for the lead between foes inside the
final furlong, lugged in some to bump with TIZWOW with a sixteenth to go and edged the latter out for the place. TIZWOW soon overcame a somewhat
awkward start, progressed from outside to vie for the lead on the first bend, gradually angled in as he moved ahead on the backstretch, was just off the rail
on the second turn, floated out entering the lane, moved clear upper stretch, began to wear down inside the last eighth, drifted out some and bumped with
ARROW STRIKE near the sixteenth marker and lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. GEORGE'S VISION settled inside, picked up his pace after a
half mile, saved ground taking the second turn, angled out widest of all upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late. STOLICH was jostled between
rivals shortly after the break, moved up to contention from just off the inside on the backstretch, did not stay close on the second bend, lodged a mild bid in
the lane, angled out for a clear path deep stretch but could not make up any significant ground on the leaders. KITTEN'S CLOWN chased from inside, came
off the rail some on the second turn, gained a striking position midstretch but flattened out instead. PAYNT BY LETTERS quickly recovered after being
steadied behind traffic shortly after the start, took the lead into the first bend, soon had the inside, did not stay with TIZWOW midway on the backstretch,
yielded into the second turn then continued to give way the last furlong. There was a stewards' inquiry into the bumping incident between ARROW STRIKE
and TIZWOW deep stretch but no action was taken after their review.
