Footnotes
FOREVER AFTER ALL set the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with that bidding foe around the far turn, then shook free of that one entering the lane
and drew off. LITTLE PRANKSTER leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, stalked two wide, pressed the leader down the backstretch, vied around the
far turn, but failed to keep pace with that one entering the lane and remained well clear of show. MEDAGLIA FOREVER took contact from an outer rival at
the start, tracked inside of rivals while a bit off of the rail around the first turn, shifted outside of the top pair at the five furlong pole, chased them under stout
urging around the far turn, failed to keep pace turning for home, yet held show from an outer rival through the final furlong. INSENSITIVE laid off of the pace
three to four wide, trailed around the far turn, improved to produce a show bi in upper stretch but was fended off. METHODOLOGY trailed along the inside
early on, took closer order to achieve a tracking position at the half mile pole, but only managed to chase around the far turn before tiring.

Footnotes
LET'S GO MARK set the pace inside of a pair of prompting foes into the turn, inched a narrowly clear margin leaving the three furlong pole, edged away
from an outer pursuer in upper stretch and held sway while hanging on his left lead. ASTRONOMICO pressed three wide, took aim on the leader two wide
nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace with that one while shifting ground inwardly in upper stretch and was second best. IN A JAM prompted the pace
two wide and between horses entering the turn, but failed to keep pace with them nearing the lane and held show from an outer pair through the final
furlong. COULDITBEMAJIC was severely impeded by an outer rival at the start causing him to transfer trouble to an inner rival as well, lacked early speed in
the aftermath, launched progress in the five path entering the turn, tucked down to the three path turning for hoe before tipping back to the four path in
upper stretch, then sustained his advance to bid for show in the final furlong but missed. TIZ MY HERO steadied from crowded quarters between horses
approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, was relegated to pursue from midpack in the two path into the turn, gained fourth from an inner rival at the five
sixteenths pole, but only chased evenly between horses through the lane while lacking a bid. MUGATU broke inwardly and greatly hampered a pair of inner
rivals at the start, trailed in the three path, advanced in the five path turning for home and improved position entering the final furlong. LEGEND OF THE
NILE chased while forward along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leading group entering the turn and faded. BAYTOWN CHATTERBOX lacked
early speed despite being strongly hustled along by the rider early on, remained under urging while off of the pace in the four path around the bend and
tired. BOLD FORCE took firm contact from outer rivals causing him to spot the leaders multiple lengths at the start, then never got involved along the inside.
LUCKY PAL hopped slightly while off slow, chased from midpack in the three path and between horses, but weakened turning for home before being eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
ROJA LIGERA broke inwardly and snagged the inner part of the gate, set a clear pace in the two path, then drew off turning for home. HALO OF FIRE
tracked along the inside, gained place leaving the quarter pole and was second best. KALL KAT bobbled a bit at the start while last away, laid off of the
pace in the two path, then stayed on to gain show from an outer rival passing the sixteenth pole. SHIP IT tracked two wide, took the turn in the four to three
path, gained show from an outer rival at the furlong grounds, but was surpassed by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. SHES A SECRET stalked the clear
leader from the three path, but failed to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole and tired outside of foes through the lane. FLORIS broke a step slow and got
outrun in the three path. SOCIAL MANDATE chased in the four path early on, but bore outwardly around the turn and was eased in the outer part of the
track through the lane.

Footnotes
SAHLABIYA set the pace in the two path, dug in to resist CALLIE'S GRIT's challenge at the five sixteenth pole, gamely clung to an advantage through upper
stretch, inched away entering the final sixteenth and held from an outer bidder late. LEMON BOMB bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the
inside, gained before taking aim outside of the leading pair from the four path nearing the lane, but drifted out to the six path in upper stretch, chased
through midstretch, kept on in the closing stages to produce a late bid, but missed. CALLIE'S GRIT stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped out to bid
outside of the leader and in the three path at the five sixteenths pole, sparred through upper stretch, but yielded between the top pair at the sixteenth pole.
STAY LOST nudged the gate before taking contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, then gained fourth from an outer
rival entering the lane. NO GUILT saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. FROTHY was reluctant to load, then broke slowly causing her to spot the
leaders multiple lengths at the start, trailed along the inside, moved out of last in the two path entering the far turn, then improved inside of rivals entering the
lane. RETROSPECT lacked speed in the three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor. RESOURCE laid off of the pace two wide,
but retreated outside of rivals down the backstretch, trailed entering the far turn and made little impact thereafter. PAINT ME PERFECT stalked the leader
from the three path, but weakened in the four path nearing the five sixteenths pole. GLAMOUR ANNA tracked in the three path, but weakened between
horses turning for home.

Footnotes
PIGALLE trailed in the two path, gained in the four path entering the far turn to bid outside of the top pair at the five sixteenths pole, led nearing the lane and
drove clear in upper stretch. LUNA MOTH tracked along the inside, tipped to the two path at the five furlong pole, chased the leaders around the far turn,
lacked rail racing room in upper stretch, but managed to slip through in the final furlong to gain place at the sixteenth pole. SHELL SHOCK set the pace
early on, but showed the way under firm restraint down the backstretch allowing for pursuing rivals to remain within striking range, vied with an outer bidder
while a path off of the rail around the far turn, but got headed by a wider challenger at the five sixteenths pole and steadily yielded through the lane.
FORTUNE BOUND stalked in the three path and between horses, applied pressure between the top pair at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace with
them entering the far turn, sustained a chase turning for home before fanning to the five path in upper stretch, and kept on to miss retaking show late. GRAY
FROST tracked in the four path, bid nearing the far turn, vied with the pace-setter from the three path around that bend, but was outkicked by an outer
bidder at the five sixteenths pole and weakened between horses through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SPRINKLEHEAD bobbled slightly at the start, vied along the inside entering the backstretch, chased his outer counterpart turning for home, yet sustained
stride to offer a re-bid in upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, changed over soon after and held sway. SMOKIN'
HOT set the pace outside of a vying rival, briefly cleared that rival at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to resist that foe's rebid in upper stretch and was
second best. BODOCK laid off of the pace along the inside, bid for show in upper stretch, gained that position at the furlong grounds and held it from an
outer rival late. LONG CROW stalked outside of the top pair, chased them from between horses around the far turn, kept on to vie for show with an inner
rival in the final furlong but missed. JOB SECURITY trailed along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn, spun for home three wide and moved
up between horses. MADISON LUVS DUKE laid off of the pace three wide, crept closer four wide to track around the far turn, but weakened entering the
lane. CRIMINAL DEFENSE tracked in the two path, but chased between horses around the far turn and faded entering the lane.

Footnotes
MAGICAL LUTE stuttered a step at the start, trailed while well off the hot pace early on, saved ground around the turn, then sustained a rail rally through a
wide seam in upper stretch, then produced a bid in the final furlong before driving clear of outer rivals entering the final sixteenth. MO TOWN MAYHEM
bobbled at the start and lacked early speed, gained in the five path turning for home, sustained his charge outside of foes to bid in the six path at the furlong
grounds, but was outkicked by a rail-skimming rival shortly after. IN COLOR tracked along the inside, shifted out before ranging up outside of the leading
pair and from the four path turning for home, offered a bid in the five path at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by rivals on either side shortly after.
MISS PEABODY laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the four path entering the lane and ran on to gain fourth in the final sixteenth. GRAND
LOVE dueled for the lead with an outer rival while staying a bit off of the inner rail, led turning for home, drifted out to three path in upper stretch before
meeting challenges from rivals on both sides in the final furlong and weakened between horses approaching the final sixteenth. ERVADEAN chased the
leaders from the three to two path around the turn and faded. CHARRIERE dueled for the lead outside of a rival and in the four to three path into the turn,
but failed to maintain vying position and chased her inner counterpart turning for home, then weakened between horses in upper stretch.
BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO broke slowly and was outrun in the four path.

Footnotes
POLICY OPTION settled far back in the two path, launched a rail rally turning for home, split the leaders two wide at the furlong grounds to offer a bid,
struck the front coming to the final sixteenth and held thereafter. BLUE DEVIL vied two wide, led in the three path in upper stretch, changed leads at the
furlong grounds before being confronted by an inner bidder leaving that station, got headed approaching the final sixteenth, then fought on through the late
stages but was fended off. LINCOLN HIGHWAY trailed, improved in the four to six path around the far turn, then sustained a late kick outside of rivals in the
final furlong to gain show at the wire. DUNEDIN tracked two wide, then in the three path outside of the top pair around the far turn, had aim on the leaders
while floated four wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase them thereafter before being nailed by an outer rival for show. TAKING CANDY laid off
of the pace along the inside, was roused for run entering the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane and ran on mildly between horses. GAMER pursued
from midpack along the inside, tracked in the three path around the far turn, chased in the four path and between horses while subtly getting outkicked by
outer foes at the furlong grounds, then was taken in hand behind a rival late. PRINCIPE D'ORO stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the
far turn, brushed his way to the three path entering the lane, but only managed to chase behind the leaders while among foes through midstretch, then
steadied when put to crowded quarters at the sixteenth pole. WAKE SURF set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that one in upper stretch and
folded in hand nearing the final sixteenth. IM A MODEST MAN laid off of the pace two wide, weakened in the three path and between horses turning for
home, then sustained an injury in the gallop out and was vanned off. MOONSTRIKE (GB) lacked speed three wide, trailed along the inside into the far turn
and was outrun.

Footnotes
SOCIETY set the pace inside of a prompting foe, shook clear of that one while well in hand entering the turn, then drew off turning for home and widened
under vigorous hand urging. DRIFAROS prompted outside of the winner, but failed to keep pace with that one entering the turn, chased around the bend,
embraced MATAREYA's outer bid for place at the quarter pole, then turned away that foe entering the final sixteenth. MATAREYA tracked in the three path,
bid for place at the quarter pole after the eventual winner kicked away, spared for that position through upper stretch, but yielded entering the final sixteenth.
BE LIKE WATER broke a step slow, trailed while saving ground, and moved up in the lane. HIDDEN CONNECTION tracked along the inside, chased while
shifting to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, but drifted to the six path entering the lane and gave way. STELLA NOIR bobbled briefly soon after the
start, lacked speed in the three path and got outrun.

Footnotes
KIGALI set the pace, cleared into the turn, widened his margin under a drive in upper stretch. BE THERE laid off of the pace two wide, awaited racing room
nearing the lane, tipped in and rallied through the final furlong to gain place late. LIQUID ADDICTION (IRE) chased outside of the clear leader around the
turn then lost place to an inner rival late. ZAPHOD pursued from midpack in the two path, floated three to four path in upper stretch and chased evenly.
BRAZILIAN FURY tugged under restraint while attempting to settle into a stalking position behind the leaders, steadied slightly behind foes at the quarter
pole, tipped out in upper stretch but tired between horses. YOUNGDUMBANDBROKE trailed two wide, fanned to the five path entering the lane and moved
up. ETERNAL BLISS pursued three wide, then weakened in the four to five path in upper stretch. HOME RUN HANK took contact from an outer rival at the
start, then made little impact along the inside. HOLY MOLY ABRAHAM lunged in and bumped a rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside and
tired.
