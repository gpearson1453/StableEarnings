Footnotes
BAYSHORE FOXES raced up close three wide in early stages, matched strides with CLASSY AND FAST around the turn, shook free entering the head of
the lane, widened to a clear advantage and stayed sharp under steady encouragement. CHEER UP pressed the pace in opening stages then edged back
and tracked the top pair around the turn, given cue three wide in upper stretch, sustained a solid bid through the lane and finished second best. LIL DITTY'S
KITTY was unhurried and raced in the back, shifted out five wide at the head of the lane, responded willingly and finished strongly. PAISLEY'S VISION
raced in range tracking the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and flattened out. SWEETNESS TO raced off the early pace, saved ground around the
turn, launched a rail bid in upper stretch, edged a bit closer then gave way. CLASSY AND FAST sent to the lead and set a pressured pace, vied with the
eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
LOUD BOY raced in contention tracking the top trio into the turn, loomed up three wide to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, cleared command past
upper stretch, responded willingly when asked for more, pulled away from the field and raced in hand approaching the wire. RIVERSPORT raced three to
four wide off the early pace, picked up the tempo heading into the turn, swung four wide into the lane, closed with response and cleared second best. WILD
APPEAL vied inside of rivals in opening stages, continued to battle with the added challenge of the eventual winner nearing the quarter pole, fought back in
upper stretch then steadily weakened. RING BEARER raced up close three wide, moved up with three furlongs left to run and engaged WILD APPEAL for
the lead, dueled around the turn then tired in the drive. MEET GEORGE JETSON lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, tipped
two wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. SPEEDBAYOU raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, urged along the rail in upper
stretch but failed to move on. HEART HEADED ARKY vied for the lead in opening stages, continued up close with three furlongs left to run then came up
empty late on the turn.

REDNECKERTHANYOU sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, quickly widened to a commanding lead
and kept to task. ELIOT NESS raced in early contention three wide, edged closer in the two path around the turn, given cue three wide turning for home,
sustained bid through the lane and captured place. HOOKED ON DREAMS chased up close along the inside entering the turn, tipped two wide entering the
lane, continued to chase after the clear leader and got caught for place in final strides. STAR OF MINE was not too far back in early stages, chased three to
four wide around the turn, ran on into the lane and closed on the runner up spots. PRIDEOFDIXIECREED raced in the back, saved ground around the turn,
hustled up along the inside in the stretch run but lacked a needed rally. JUSTASTROLLIN raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and failed
to move on. COBYMEISTER was forwardly placed up the backstretch, came up empty mid-way around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

CASEYS MEMORY tracked the top trio up the backstretch, saved ground and edged closer along the rail late on the far turn, cut the corner and given cue
entering the lane, responded willingly, quickly widened to a commanding lead, stayed sharp and kept to task. COLONEL KLINK dueled outside of
ESKENFORIT around the first turn and up the backstretch, shook free midway around the far turn, was overtaken by the winner entering the lane, ran on
two to three wide through the stretch run and held place. IRISH VALOR was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two wide around the first turn,
continued unhurried up the backstretch, ranged up into contention four wide late on the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared the
rest. GRAVES MILL ROAD rated off the early pace, hustled along two wide around the far turn and lacked a needed rally. ESKENFORIT dueled inside of
COLONEL KLINK around the first turn and up the backstretch, could not match strides mid-way around the far turn and faded in the lane. POKER PLAY
raced up close in early stages, came up empty leaving the backstretch and steadily retreated. PER RULING FROM HIWU, COLONEL KLINK WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
LUCKYHOTSTUFF was forwardly placed sitting just off the top pair in early stages, loomed three wide near the quarter pole, launched a bid for CONFETTI
BETTY turning for home, dug in two wide under firm handling, gained the advantage at the sixteenth pole and finished clear. CONFETTI BETTY dueled for
the lead with ANNIEWAYUWANT IT up the backstretch, began to edge asway on top while taking on the challenge of LUCKYHOTSTUFF midway around
the turn, saved ground and led the way by a narrow margin, battled back gamely but could not hold off the winner in deep stretch. LAVENDER LIL was
unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted out four wide at the head of the lane and rallied for a share. DREAMINONTHENILE
raced up close along the inside, waited for a clear path near the quarter pole, hustled along the inside in upper stretch then flattened out. READY TO GET
LOUD raced in range two wide around the turn, tipped wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally. KASA settled through early stages, ranged up three
wide around the turn, ran on to the eighth pole then faded. ANNIEWAY U WANT IT dueled for the lead through early stages, could not match strides nearing
the quarter pole then steadily faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MY FIRING LINE dueled for the lead up the backstretch, shook free midway around the turn, came three wide into the lane, responded gamely when called
upon and drew off under steady encouragement. SWEET STROLL moved up to challenge MY FIRING LINE for the lead late on the backstretch, vied briefly
then failed to move on with the eventual winner, sustained a three to four wide bid through the lane and finished second best. FIREBAUGH came away slow
at the start, raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into the lane and rallied for a share. CAN'T MAKE ME was forwardly placed from the onset,
chased three to four wide around the turn, sustained bid to the eighth pole then gave way. STREAKIN' EASY raced off the early pace, hustled along three
wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally. BLITZED raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and failed to move into contention. BACKSTAGE
PASS vied for the lead in the opening quarter, weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
