Footnotes
LILLY SIMONE , patiently rated while saving ground as a duel developed up front, found ample room along the rail to advance in upper stretch, wrested
command from MYSTIC SEAPORT in mid stretch, spurted clear under some right handed asks then held firm while kept alert. GATITA SUAVE rated
outside the winner leaving the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, straightened away and closed willingly to nab the place. MELIPONINI BEE , away
last when steadying off foes, regrouped and settled off the pace while saving ground, moved through towards the rail past mid stretch and churned on.
MYSTIC SEAPORT sped up to contention and held a slim lead dueling to the inside of rival around the turn, came off the rail entering the stretch affording
the winner a seam, battled past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly between foes. STRAWBERRY POINT , well placed tracking the embattled leaders,
angled four wide into the lane, loomed past the three sixteenths but went evenly in the final furlong. LOVING CUP rushed up and disputed the pace outside
MYSTIC SEAPORT, kept up to upper stretch then weakened. ALLIALLIOXENFREE , under rating three wide outside foes early, began to get out leaving
the far turn and weakened.

SPEEDYNESS bumped with MALIBU SLEW at the start, hugged the inner rail dueling with that one, asserted himself approaching the eighth pole and drew
away under urging. NEVER GREW UP , in the four path between horses entering the turn, was outside horses through the stretch and rallied. WINE
COLLECTOR rallied along the inner rail. MALIBU SLEW dueled outside the winner and faded late. CAPTAIN WOODROW , caught in the five path between
horses entering the turn, was no factor. WYSOQUIET , six deep entering the turn, was outrun. PASSIONED , fractious during the post parade and going to
the starting gate, was checked when getting out entering the turn.

Footnotes
REMUDA was nudged up to the inside of rivals early to gain a forward spot, took to rating while saving ground and to the inside of foe mid turn, responded
when called upon in upper stretch, moved through along the rail to overtake the leader nearing the furlong grounds, kicked well clear under a solid drive with
a sixteenth to go and was kept alert to the wire. ARZAK drafted in behind rivals nearing the turn, raced three wide nearing the lane, shifted in some and kept
on grinding to nab the place. ZYRAMID sped clear and set the pace two wide, was hooked from his inside in upper stretch, battled on past mid stretch then
gave way grudgingly. GRATEFUL BRED stalked the pace three wide, came four wide for the drive but failed to generate a serious response. MARVALOUS
MIKE , off the pace and under asking mid turn, saved ground into and through the stretch but only mustered up a mild kick. DETERMINED KINGDOM
prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. CAZADERO , sluggish from the gate and away last, lagged
back into the turn, was under a ride mid turn, shifted out five wide past the three sixteenths but came up empty.

RUNAWAY STORM assumed the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and was kept to his business in the drive. TOOFAREASTISWEST , in hand
when bottled up mid way on the far turn, moved outside in upper stretch and rallied on his left lead. ZEVON saved ground chasing the winner and finished
willingly. NOW AND LATER , checked in tight quarters soon after the break, was rank lacking room entering the first turn, raced five deep turning for home
and passed tired foes. HARD TRAVELER chased the winner to the stretch and gave way. NANGA PARBAT (GB) raced in the three path both turns and
failed to rally. QUALITY ART , along the inner rail down the backstretch, remained inside horses on the far turn and weakened. SWING SAMMY moved up
in the four path on the far turn and gave way in the drive. MARTINI MARTIN was no factor. MAJOR NELSON was outrun. HERE'S LIAM was no factor.

Footnotes
STREET HUSTLE , quickly to contention, was confidently handled shadowing the leader, took over leaving the five sixteenths, cleared soon after,
responded to a right handed ask near mid stretch then powered away while ridden out. CAVALRY COMMAND sped to the front, set the pace towards the
rail, ceded to the winner after three furlongs, stayed on willingly past mid stretch, faded late but had enough late to clearly be second best. HERE AND
NOFURTHER , off the pace, was shoved along leaving the far turn, edged up three wide and between rivals into the stretch, chased past mid stretch then
flattened out late. HE ROLLS saved ground with pursuit nearing the turn, worked outward to be four wide into the stretch, gave effort past mid stretch then
faded late. GLORIOUS MAHOMES chased outside a rival leaving the far turn, shifted five wide approaching the stretch and gave way. RASCALLY REBEL
broke a step slow, steadied when in a bit close into the turn, dropped in towards the rail and lacked a rally. MUNGO MAGIC chased the pace, angled in for
the drive and gave way. NATAGAR , off slowly, lagged off the pace and raced about six wide into the turn, continued well wide while coaxed near the three
eighths, lacked a response and dropped back.

Footnotes
SELF ISOLATION broke sharply and attended the pace outside BENEATH THE STARS, was put to firm asking mid turn, drew alongside three wide with a
quarter to go, took over soon into the lane, repelled an outside challenge from INTREPID DAYDREAM in mid stretch, shook clear and widened while kept to
task. INTREPID DAYDREAM , coaxed along three wide stalking the leaders, circled four wide into the stretch, ranged up to challenge in mid stretch, was
turned away after a few strides, faded late but was able to save the place. DECO STRONG , off the pace, saved ground mid turn, swung out for the drive
and closed steadily. BENEATH THE STARS accelerated inside and took command early on, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure past the three
eighths, staved off the winner to the head of the lane, ceded soon after and weakened through the final furlong. JUROR NUMBER FOUR broke a step slow,
settled off the pace and outside a rival, failed to respond to rousing past the five sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
UPSIDEDOWN MAN , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained command in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and dug in
tenaciously. BUBBA CHROME , shuffled back about a furlong after the break, raced in the three path in the stretch drive and closed between horses.
STORMING CHROME worked between horses on the turn, eased outside in upper stretch, advanced outside the winner in mid stretch then flattened out.
BLAME B B , four deep on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and had a slight rally outside rivals. SWIFT DANCER sped to the early lead,
moved to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained prominent to mid stretch and weakened. THEOLOVESAWINNER lacked speed, swung to the six
path in upper stretch and failed to rally. DISPUTED CLAIM , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened approaching the eighth pole. POPPY B
hugged the inner rail most of the trip and weakened. NICK'S LITTLE BOY , four deep on the turn, gave way. FREEGFTWTHPURCHASE , reluctant to load
into the starting gate, was outrun.
