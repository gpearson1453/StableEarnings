TAKE A HINT stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over at the five sixteenths, shifted in leaving the quarter pole and kicked
away in the lane to prove best under a drive. BEN'S HERO tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid with the winner on the turn, could not keep
pace with that rival in the stretch while being clearly second best. STONECOLDWARRIOR prompted the pace two wide, fell back on the turn and lost the
crop leaving the quarter pole and weakened, held show award. RESPIRATOR chased the early pace two wide, eased out on the turn and came four wide
into the lane and had no rally, missed show award. ALBOROTO passed the tiring rivals. SHELLBACK lacked a rally. CITY HUMOR was away alertly to set
the early pace on the inside and faltered. TWIST OF FAITH was inside early and not a factor.

MY LAST MISSION prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, went on even terms by the quarter pole, had a long drive with
ARISTOCRATIC in the lane and prevailed late to prove best. ARISTOCRATIC set the early pace while in the two path, then dueled for the lead by the
quarter pole and fought gamely in the lane but was outfinished late to just miss. SPEARGUN stalked the pace four wide and lacked the needed winning bid
while keeping on to the wire to clearly best the rest. JUST PLAIN ORNERY showed speed on the inside and weakened. MISSION KEY was outrun early
and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SADDLE UP JESSIE pressed the early pace two wide while hard held, went up to vie for command on the backstretch, then drew clear on the turn and ran
up the score in the lane while under a hand ride to crush foes. CHEZ SOLEIL stalked the early pace and went four wide to vie for command on the outside,
then chased the winner on the turn three wide, dropped to the inside by the quarter pole, proved to be no match for the winner while lasting for the place
award. CANDY COOP tracked the early pace towards the inside, two wide on the backstretch, ridden along on the turn to try to keep up but weakened, got
the show award. BRING THE MAGIC stumbled at the start, chased the pace four to three wide, ridden along on the turn and tired. NOTHINGMAKESENSE
was taken back early and failed to menace. PINK SUNSET set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way after a half mile, stopped.

DANCING DIANA had an alert start and set a pressured pace along the inside while well handled, was asked leaving the turn and given one pop right
handed nearing the furlong marker with the crop and responded well, drew off smartly to prove much the best while being ridden out the final furlong, sharp.
TINA TINA TINA was off a step slow, chased the early pace on the inside, eased out on the turn and came three wide into the lane, raced greenly through
the lane but did finish willingly to be clearly second best. URSULINE pressed the winner three wide and then two wide on the turn but was empty in the
drive. LOU'S IRISH LADY was away alertly to show brief good early speed two wide but stopped.

Footnotes
TITOSCHANGEDMYLUCK tracked the pace early, three wide on the turn and made a four wide bid off the turn, lugged in by the furlong marker, then was
corrected and continued that bid and edged clear late to prove best, driving. RITABOOK set a pressured pace while racing off the inside, then vied for the
lead three wide on the turn, shook clear leaving the turn but then was challenged by the winner and dug in gamely in the furlong grounds but was caught
late, good effort. BLAME CATALAYA was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace and was three wide on the far turn, lacked the needed rally while
besting the rest. LINAHASPECSHOES pressed the early pace and made a inside bid to vie for command by the half mile marker, continued to the turn but
then was empty in the lane. UNBRIDLED SASS was rated along the inside and roused at the five sixteenths and had no rally. THREE COINS was taken
back early, four wide on the turn and never factored.

BLIND SIGHT was rated early on the outside, moved up five wide entering the backstretch to be up on the pace on the outside by the half mile marker,
made a four wide move on the turn to take over, then drew clear in the lane under left handed crop urging. MY BOSS LADY was settled early two wide,
moved up between rivals on the backstretch, shifted out on the turn to make a five wide move by the quarter pole, sent down in the lane but failed to gain on
the winner, second best. HELEONORTIZ stalked the early pace on the first turn on the inside, moved out and moved up to vie for command between rivals
by the half mile marker, then was on the inside on the turn but weakened, stayed on to best the rest. REINA LA KELSY was void of early speed, advanced
on the inside on the turn, split rivals leaving the furlong marker and offered a belated rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. CAGED PIXIE was bumped
hard and then checked after the start, saved ground on the first turn but lacked a solid rally. NURSE RACHETT stumbled at the start, sent to the lead three
wide into the first turn, got to the front and dropped to the inside, then was confronted and vied for the command by the half mile marker, gave way on the
turn. RAISON THE GLASS chased the early pace three wide, then was four wide on the backstretch and then stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
HIP HOP HOORAY was well placed three wide early, dropped to the inside on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn and moved out to engage with LUNITA,
battled that rival through the furlong grounds and edged clear late to prove best, driving. LUNITA tracked the early pace on the outside, made a five wide
sweep to take over leaving the turn, then battled the winner but hung late, second best. ALICE HARPER was rated early on the inside, two wide by the
quarter pole and finished well on the inside. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY vied for the early lead towards the inside, shuffled back on the turn, then shifted out
nearing the quarter pole and came four wide into the lane and showed some late foot for the last spot in the superfecta. ICESTORMING vied for the lead
between rivals and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened. CIRCLE OF COURAGE lacked a rally. LIZZIES RED VELVET vied for the lead on the
outside and made a four wide bid on the turn but weakened, vanned off. NUCCI vied for the lead in between rivals and stopped.
