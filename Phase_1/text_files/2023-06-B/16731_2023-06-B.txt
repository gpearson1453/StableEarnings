SALUTE THE STARS was bumped and steadied back at the start, pulled early and was rank entering the clubhouse turn, then settled off the rail, on the
backside, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the lane, commenced a strong run past the furlong marker, surged in deep stretch and was
up in time. KINGSBARNS settled comfortably off the inside, stalked close up three wide, bid three wide entering the far turn, hooked up with SUBROGATE,
dueled with that rival into the stretch, battled heads apart to the furlong marker, edged away at the sixteenth pole, dug in gamely and was caught in the final
strides. HOWGREATISNATE stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals, could not go with the top pair on the far turn, came three wide into the lane,
then re rallied and got up for third at the wire. SUBROGATE set the pace on the inside, dueled inside of KINGSBARNS on the far turn, battled heads apart
with that rival into the stretch, dug in gamely inside and weakened late. CLASSIC CATCH bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside, was asked on the
far turn and lacked a respond. NO CONFESSION was bumped at the start, trailed the field and dropped back.

Footnotes
HELDISH stalked close up three wide, bid four wide on the turn, took charge turning for home, kicked clear and was kept to the task. DEPOLI was off
slowly, outrun early, moved up at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane and rallied outside for second. NOTAH was bumped at the start, chased
between rivals early on, then pulled his way into contention between horses nearing the turn, dueled between on the turn and weakened in the lane.
SMOOTH FLYIN MIKE vied inside for the lead, dueled inside on the turn and faded. SIR ROBERT HALL vied two wide for the lead, was in tight and
checked at the three eighths pole and dropped back. TORRONE was bumped hard at the start, chased on the inside, gave way on the turn, was eased late
and walked off.
