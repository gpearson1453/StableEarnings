STAN FROM MALIBU hit the gate but still came away fairly well, stalked up close from outside to the turn, bid three then four wide around the bend, took
over in upper stretch, put away RIGHT TURN in midstretch, met the challenge from outside rivals in the final furlong and dug in late to gamely prevail.
CAROL'S COMIC stalked two to three wide on the turn, tipped out in the lane, drew alongside the leader with a furlong remaining, fought between rivals late
and could not get by. LORD TRIPPING broke slow and brushed with inner rival, tracked four wide into the turn, five wide into the lane, bid four deep at the
eighth pole and finished gamely to the line. RIGHT TURN sped clear early, led two then three wide around the bend, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. THE LAST ONE PERK broke a bit slow and brushed with LORD TRIPPING, chased off the rail at the back early on, went two
to three wide around the bend and weakened.

DANCING SOUL threw her head at the start but recovered quickly, went up to vie for the lead inside a pair of rivals, cleared around the turn, opened up at
the quarter pole, drifted in then back out while still well clear into the final furlong and ridden out to the wire. ROSES R BLUE was off slow to begin, chased
off the rail at the back, made progress three wide around the bend and put in a belated rally to whittle the gap on the winner while gaining the place. HALF
HOPING chased two wide then along the rail on the turn and was along for the show. NOISEY BURGLAR vied three deep to the turn, chased the winner
three wide around the bend and weakened in the drive. NENE ROMANO took the early lead while vying between rivals up the backstretch, could not keep
up with the leader around the bend, chased two wide into the lane and weakened.

GYPSY TEARS broke inward but was quickly corrected, was closest in pursuit while racing keenly in-hand, coaxed along at the five-sixteenths pole, took
over in upper stretch, cleared in the final furlong and won going away. FORDY G got bumped from outside at the start, shook it off and went up to clear the
field, showed the two wide through the turn, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and stayed on to hold the place. LUKA GRAZIE threw his head at the
start to come away last, moved into range from outside, chased four wide on the turn, five wide into the stretch, kept on through the lane but could not get by
FORDY G for second. GET THE GOLD broke in and bumped rival, stalked from inside, saved ground to the stretch, remained within striking distance
entering the final furlong and failed to produce a bid. RIGGSALICIOUS got bumped leaving the gate, trailed on the inside to the stretch and was not a factor.

REIGN OVER ME got bumped on both sides in the beginning, chased three wide around the turn, rallied steadily under left-handed urging, drew alongside
TIGER'S ARROW in deep stretch and proved best late. TIGER'S ARROW dueled for the lead from outside, inched head around the bend, cleared into the
stretch, remained unchallenged into the final furlong, pressured by REIGN OVER ME with a sixteenth to go and could not fend off the winner. PAT CAN'T
COUNT dueled for command inside TIGER'S ARROW, asked to keep up around the turn, lost touch in upper stretch and flattened to third. DIAMONDS
PREFERRED brushed the gate and outer rival then got crowded between immediately after, chased along the inside then two wide into the stretch and
lacked a bid. MOON TIME got bumped between rivals in the beginning, coaxed along chasing between rivals, got shuffled at the seven-sixteenths pole,
came three wide into the lane and failed to rally. CHAIN GANG came in and bumped rival at the start, trailed early off the inside, went three wide on the turn,
four wide into the drive and could not rally.

CORPORAL KLINGER broke a step slow then sent from outside and dueled with IRONDALE into the turn, inched ahead on the turn, maintained a short
lead still fighting with IRONDALE through the drive, put that rival away late and held over EREBUS nearing the wire. EREBUS stumbled slightly but still
came away quickest, raced up close two wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane, rallied through the final furlong but was too late. IRONDALE dueled
off the rail inside CORPORAL KLINGER to the turn, battled two wide around the bend, kept the pressure on through the lane and finished a clear third. WE
NEED MARKETING raced up close on the inside then took hold entering the turn, moved out around the bend and came three wide into the lane, chased
within striking distance then flattened in the final furlong. KING HEAT chased along the inside, lost ground around the bend and lacked a rally. BYE
EVERYBODY hit the gate in the beginning and dropped back, trailed two wide around the bend, angled in at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened.

TEMBO tracked off the inside, ranged up four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, took over nearing the stretch, cleared at the three-sixteenths and was kept to
task to the wire. MONGOLIAN LEGEND had to pause briefly to avoid a tight situation early then chased between foes, bumped outer rival past the
seven-sixteenths pole, bid between at the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the winner past the three-sixteenths pole but stayed on to hold the
place. WRONG SPOT broke a step slow, trailed wide up the backstretch, came five wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally and gained the show. CAN'T
RECALL forwardly placed on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, asked in the lane but flattened in the late stages. SONIC BREES chased three deep
into the turn, got bumped early around the bend, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, failed to keep up in upper stretch and weakened past the
three-sixteenths pole. BLACK MAGICIAN showed keen early foot, led two wide then along the rail on the turn, vied inside a trio of rivals late on the bend

UPWARD MOBILITY tracked two then three wide around the bend, tipped out and rallied under right-handed urging, reached the front at the eight pole and
drove clear. IN VRONSKY STYLE broke well then settled in a stalking position off the inside, patiently ridden three wide through the turn, drew alongside the
leader at the three-sixteenths pole, drifted in and bumped nearing the eighth pole, then got outkicked by the winner in the furlong grounds. BIG SPLASH sat
off the pace early on, raced on the rail into the turn, steered out and came five wide into the drive and was along for the show. HANDSOME GARY chased
four to five wide around the bend and never responded in the lane. SCARY FAST SMILE sped to the front from inside, led two wide into the stretch, collared
by IN VRONSKY STYLE at the three-sixteenths pole, gave up the lead then got bumped by that rival nearing the furlong grounds and flattened in deep
stretch. MY RANSOM raced outside a rival at the back into the turn, got moved out to the four path on the turn then shifted back in leaving the bend and
failed to menace. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING forwardly placed in the early going, started to weaken around the bend near the inside and tired. PER RULING
FROM HIWU, BIG SPLASH WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
KINGS RIVER KNIGHT dueled for the lead from inside into the first turn before taking control from POSITIVITY, showed the way two then three wide
around the far turn, put to right-handed urging entering the furlong grounds and remained clear under steady handling. LOVESICK BLUES tracked three
deep early, moved out and went four deep into the far turn, came five wide into the lane, drifted in to brush COALINGA ROAD in the lane and kept on to
gain the place. COALINGA ROAD settled at the back off the rail, went four wide into the far turn, exited that bend six wide, moved into range for the final
furlong but finished evenly while gaining the show honors. POSITIVITY was off alertly under coaxing from the gate, dueled from outside into the first turn
then raced up close outside KINGS RIVER KNIGHT, chased that rival four wide into the lane, got brushed and floated in by LOVESICK BLUES in the
stretch run and flattened out in the final furlong. DESMOND DOSS broke in to brush NONE ABOVE THE LAW at the start, stalked two wide around both
turns and never responded when called upon. NONE ABOVE THE LAW brushed the gate then brushed with DESMON DOSS in the beginning, chased
along the fence, cut the corner into the lane and weakened.
