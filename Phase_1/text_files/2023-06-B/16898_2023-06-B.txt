Footnotes
BELLA'S GATSBY raced well off of the pace and at the back of the field, raced four and five wide while being rated in hands, launched a bid at the three
eighths pole, responded well and willingly circled horses through the tun, took command by the quarter pole under slight urging, was under left handed
encouragement in the upper stretch, responded well and drew off and won under a hand ride. FIVE O FOX vied for the lead, took control and attended the
pace while racing in the three path, was asked to rate for the first half mile, was given rein at the half mile pole, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, was
pressured by outside attackers, repelled one of the attackers, let the other one go, was encouraged and driven down the lane under strong urging, was no
match for the winner but was second best today. CUNNING stalked from the rail, saved ground through out, had a clean trip, was asked to close and was
kept on point, surely gained ground with every stride and was able to secure third. NOBLE CONNECTION raced off of the pace from the four path, steadily
gained ground, circled through the turn improved position and was within striking distance then faded. JARED THE WARRIOR raced from off of the pace
and made a mild bid, improving position slightly. CHIEF BULLET made no impact. WINNING DANCE forwardly placed, faltered.

FROSTY BREW vied for the lead, took control, set the pace was briefly challenged at the five sixteenth pole by an outside offender, quickly put that one
away and went wire to wire un contested. PETULA was off of the pace early in the race, was five wide and outside down the back side, advanced at the half
mile pole, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, raced four wide in the turn maintaining position, was urged at the quarter pole, responded well, closed
down the stretch ducked in for a stride, was corrected, hooked an outside rival at the eighth mile pole, battled and out finished the rest scoring second place.
SMARTY'S ANGEL was three wide and stalking, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, challenged by the five sixteenth pole, battled briefly in the stretch
then faltered. WAIT ON ME raced off of the pace, was in the three path and inside of another rival, shifted out at the three eighths pole, was five wide in the
turn and six wide in the upper stretch, was asked and responded well to encouragement and closed making a mild bid late. ARKLAHOMA SOUL was no
menace. BIDOFHONEY was sharp out of the gate, flashed early speed then gave way.

RISKTAKER was racing in the middle of the field after the break, was three wide and in between foes while gaining ground, steadied slightly nearing the
three eighths pole, shifted out into the four path and launched a winning bid, raced past rivals, cleared the front runners by the eighth pole and drew off after
the sixteenth under a hand ride. PRICED RIGH Twas reluctant to load. vied for the lead, led the race from the two path, attended the pace, was under
pressure and getting strong encouragement at the quarter pole, was cleared by an outside rival by the eighth pole, was no match for that one but continued
to run and repelled the other attackers finishing with a hard earned second. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW stalked the pace, raced in the two path, saved
ground through the turn, slowly but surely gained ground in the stretch, was guided down the lane and encouraged, getting up for third. GTUONE BUCK
was off a touch slow, was well off the pace, rallied from the back and quickly gained ground on the outside passing rivals down the back side, was four wide
in the turn, was in contention at the quarter pole then tired by the eighth mile pole. MR. BUTCH WOMBLE made no impact. LETSTAKEITOUTSIDE raced
on the rail, was off of the pace, and never got involved. NINEJUANJUAN CALL trailed through out.

Footnotes
MY MY raced off of the pace and saved ground on the rail, launched a bid at the quarter pole and responded well by closing like a' rocket sled on rails'
turning in the fastest quarter of the race, collared the leader in the last few jumps and took the win. SURREY vied for the lead, raced on the rail set the pace,
showed the way through out, got collared in the last few jumps and settled for second. LUV AND COMMITMENT mild bid. BARRETT stalked the leader in
hands, faded after six furlongs.
