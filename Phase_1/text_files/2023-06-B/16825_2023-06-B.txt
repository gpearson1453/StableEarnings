Footnotes
HEAVEN IN MIND stalked in the four path, was coaxed midway around the turn, got floated out to the nine path into the stretch, and rallied past an inner
pair in the final sixteenth to win. KOZEM was prompted along in the three path, ran on from said position into the lane, bid into the final furlong, but was
out-finished by the outer eventual winner to place. WELLTON GIRL raced off the pace in the two path, tipped out to the five path while under a drive into the
stretch, and kept on for show. MISS ATHLETIC broke well to set an open pace in the two path, but drifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, and yielded
late. BRASSIC was wellback in the three path and made no impact from the six path down the lane. CAP IS BACK broke a step slow, trailed in the two path
early, and did not threaten. LAS COLINAS broke in at the start, chased in the three path, tipped inside rounding the turn, but was empty.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR raced up close in the four path, was confidently handled while making a bid in the three path around the far turn, was shaken up
passing the quarter, led from the four path into the stretch, and drew clear while tipping inwards. PAPA KATZ chased in the four path, lost ground down the
backside, was ridden into the far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, and rallied for place. MEDIA SENSATION was unhurried in the five path
early, under right handed encouragement midway around the far turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. ARTICO tracked in
the two path, was cued along the rail midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. HUBRIS set the
pace in the two path, was roused into the far turn, lost the lead along the inside into the stretch, and faded. BADBADBOBBY stalked in the four path but
flattened down the lane. GOTTA GO GATOR raced in midpack between foes from the three path but backed up around the far turn.

Footnotes
TEARDUC set the pace in the two path, kicked clear midway around the turn, drifted out a bit in the lane and held safe under left-handed urging. KHOZY
COLBY was bumped at the start, advanced three wide around the turn and finished willingly to narrow the gap. NEXT ON STAGE prompted the winner two
wide, could not gain on that foe but stayed on to hold the show. MISS SAYELY was bumped between foes at the start, raced four wide and never
threatened. BUCCHERA was bumped between rivals at the start, raced five wide and was no menace. SAVANAH LADY chased the pace from the rail,
tipped two wide near the quarter pole and came up empty. LETS GO KOKO played no factor while racing five wide. TALKIN' SASSY was outrun while
racing two wide. FUTURE FORTUNE broke in and bumped foes at the start and was never involved while saving ground.

the turn, tipped out to the six path into the lane, and kept on. DA JOURNEYGIRL broke out and bumped at the start, trailed in the three path, swung very
wide into the stretch, and did not threaten. LUNA TUNA set the pace in the three path but yielded at the top of the lane. HOLLYWOOD HONEY brushed
with an inner foe at the start, tracked between foes in the two path but backed up early around the turn.

GOOCH GO BRAGH tracked the pace four wide, steadily gained outside through the lane and was up in the final strides. READYSEEKGO stalked the pace
in the three path, took over near the five-sixteenths, edged ahead in upper stretch and led until the final strides. SILENT CHAOS raced off the pace three
and four wide and rallied for the show. DRILLOMATIC steadied midway around the first turn, saved ground off the pace and rallied belatedly between foes.
MAGICAL ADVENTURE chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) set the pace in the two path and gave
way near the five-sixteenths marker. D. SILO was outrun while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
BATTLE CRY tracked in the four path, ranged up around the far turn, bid from the five path and took a narrow lead at the top of the lane, and inched away in
the final furlong. FLYING BLACK brushed the gate leaving, rated in the three path, was ridden between foes in the four path around the far turn, tipped out
to the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. PACIFIC PRINCESS prompted the pace along the rail, tipped out to the two path and brushed an outer
foe passing the five-eighths point, bid in the three path rounding the far turn, briefly led passing the quarter, but lost the lead while in the four path at the top
of the stretch, and stayed on to hold show. KHOSEA stalked in the two path, got brushed out to the three path passing the five-eighths point, then was
shuffled back between foes rounding the far turn, angled out to the five path into the stretch, and finished evenly. GOLDEN VOICE set the pace inside, but
lost the lead approaching the final quarter, and faded. BOSTON PRINCESS trailed in the three path early, circled inner foes from the five path around the
far turn, swung out to the seven path into the lane, but flattened. TIZ IMPRESSIVE settled off the pace in the two path but did not threaten. PRESSLY'S
HOPE steadied between foes early around the first turn, was held up along the inside down the backstretch, but was no menace.

Footnotes
AVANT GLORY set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe. POSITIVE REVIEW raced in range at the rail, tipped out in upper
stretch and finished well to narrow the gap. DESERT RULER pressed the winner in the three path, could not match strides from the quarter pole but kept
trying outside to stay well clear of the rest. SENSEI LAWRENCE chased the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed
rally. SMOKIN BOW failed to menace while racing two wide. SMOKIN CLOUD had only brief speed outside.

Footnotes
EIGHTNINEGO set the pace in the two path, was cued to open up into the stretch, and was driven out. MR. RHODIUM prompted the pace in the three path,
was driven from the four path into the lane, brushed with an outer foe passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. DON'T ANSWER pressed in the five
path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and stayed on to hold show. MR. AMERICAN chased inside, was cued right handed midway around the
turn, remained inside entering the lane, tipped out to the three path just past the eighth pole, and kept on but just missed minor placings. CATALINA
EXPRESS travelled up close between foes in the four path, was under urging from the five path into the stretch, brushed with an inner foe passing the
eighth pole, then flattened. BALTIC MULE raced off the pace in the three path but made no impact. CLASSIC BOURBON was wellback along the inside and
never menaced. UNCAPTURED TIGER had an awkward start and trailed throughout.
