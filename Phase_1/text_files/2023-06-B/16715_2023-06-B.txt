Footnotes
DARYL'S BOLT pursued from midpack two wide, tracked the top pair from the three path around the turn, took aim outside of them and from the four path in
upper stretch, rallied while lugging in and closing in on clear leader entering the final sixteenth, offered a late bid and forged an advantage in the shadow of
the wire. CAPTIVATED DRAMA set the pace in the two path, met CHARLIE WHISKEY's challenge turning for home, repelled that rival in upper stretch and
kicked clear, dug in to embrace DARYL'S BOLT's confrontation entering the final sixteenth, but was caught at the wire. CHARLIE WHISKEY bumped the
outer part of the gate upon leaving it, stalked outside of the pace setter and from the three path, attempted a bid at the quarter pole, but was turned away in
upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, changed over at the furlong grounds, but flopped back to his left lead from a right handed crop while losing
place at the sixteenth pole and gave way. CREPE YARNS trailed along the inside, vacated the rail turning for home before entering the lane in the four path
and moved up. CRAVENSWORTH leaned inwardly at the start, tracked along the inside but faded. ROYAL AIR FORCE laid off of the pace in the four path,
spun into the lane in the six path and tired.

Footnotes
MISS SAIPAN broke a touch outwardly, dueled for the lead outside of a rival while in the three to two path around the turn, brushed lightly with that one
coming to midstretch as the battle sustained and inched clear in the closing stages. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS dueled for the lead inside of MISS SAIPAN,
brushed and battled gamely as the war persisted through the lane, but was bested doggedly in the late stages. BOOTSY'S MERLOT tracked along the
inside, chased the embattled leading pair in the three path while sparring for show with an outer rival through the lane and prevailed late. GROVE ST.
bumped with an inner rival soon after the start, tracked three wide, chased in the four path while dueling for show with an inner rival through the lane, but
was bested for that position. CASSOULET chased in the two path, then between horses into the turn, but weakened at the quarter pole. LITTLE SASS
lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. SLAINTE MHATH bumped with an outer foe in the opening stages, then never got involved in the four
path. STRANGE JOY broke a bit outwardly, trailed in the four to five path around the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
HOYA PARANOYA broke flat-footedly and was brushed between rivals at the start, rushed forward to set the pace in the two path, drew clear of pursuing
foes while nearing the lane in the three path and held sway through the final furlong. COURTHOUSE COVE chased along the inside, gained place in the
four path leaving the quarter pole while failing to keep pace with the clearing leader, then chased that foe home well to prove second best. BIG BEEMSTER
lacked speed in the three path, shifted out entering the lane, floated to the eight path leaving the furlong grounds and moved up to gain show at the wire.
ASPEN CLUB was urged in pursuit of the main group in the four path around the turn, sustained stride while tucking to the two path in upper stretch, gained
show from an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, but was caught for that position late. SANTA CRUISER lunged outwardly at the start, pressed the leader from
the three path, but gave way in the five path entering the lane. INVISIBLE WAR got outrun in the four to six path.

Footnotes
WOODCOURT chased along the inside, took aim outside of the leader entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge in the final furlong and edged past the
tiring leader in the final sixteenth. BALTA sped clear early on, showed the way in the two path around the turn, held sway from a pursuing WOODCOURT in
upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong and was caught by that one in the late stages. SHAKIN LOOSE laid off of the pace while a bit off of the inside,
gained show from an outer rival while entering the lane in the three path and gradually closed in on the leading pair in the final furlong while too late.
RACCOON RODEO lacked speed in the three path and surpassed a tiring rival for a minor share late. JUST STEEL broke a step slow at the start, chased in
the three path around the turn but weakened in the four path entering the lane. STEEL LINK saved ground while trailing around the turn, but to no avail.
CAPER'S HOOLEY never got involved from the four path.

Footnotes
HOCUS dueled for the lead two wide, inherited a clear advantage at the five sixteenths pole after his inner counterpart faltered, then held sway safely
through the lane. ICEATUDE tracked in the three path and between horses, then vied with an inner rival for place while chasing the clear leader in upper
stretch, edged that position entering the final sixteenth and narrowed the leader's margin late. DR. PERRY bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked
the leaders from the two path while inside of rivals, vied for place with an outer foe while chasing in upper stretch, but was bested for that position at the
sixteenth pole. OVERBORE broke half a beat slow, pursued in the five path and outside of foes around the turn, tucked four wide turning for home, but
yielded through the lane. KENTUCKY BOURBON was off a step slow, trailed in the three path and improved between tiring rivals. SPARTAN ARMY tracked
in the four path and between horses, but gave way at the five sixteenths pole. JEREMY'S JET bumped with an outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead
inside of a rival, but failed to keep pace with that one nearing the five sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
MORE THAN LOOKS broke inwardly, laid off of the pace in the three to four path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes while
taking a bump from an inner rival inside the final furlong, yet sustained his charge in the closing stages to surge past the leader nearing the wire.
FEARLESS SOLDIER set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, held firm through midstretch, inched away entering the
final sixteenth, but was caught by an outer on-charging foe in the closing stages. MIRANDA RIGHTS pursued from midpack along the inside, vacated the
rail while vying with an outer DEMOLITION DUKE for show in upper stretch, drifted out and bumped that foe leaving the furlong grounds, yet sustained his
grinding advance after getting outkicked by the eventual winner in the final sixteenth to re-gain show late. DEMOLITION DUKE tracked along the inside,
tipped to take aim outside of the top pair straightening for home, but was herded outwardly by an inner rival entering the final furlong, took contact from that
one passing that marker and transferred it to an outer foe in the process, then got outkicked and chased among foes. OCEAN POINTE stalked three wide,
ranged up approaching the far turn, vied two wide around that bend, but failed to sustain even terms coming to midstretch, was turned away at the sixteenth
pole and weakened late. ANGLOPHILE pursued from midpack two to three wide, spun for home in the five path, but shied from an inner rival while between
horses at the furlong grounds and lacked a bid. THREE ON THE TREE was pinched between horses at the start, laid unhurried along the inside, then in the
two path around the far turn before sustaining a rail chase through the lane, but lacked a bid. GO BALI GO leaned outwardly at the start, prompted along the
inside early on, shifted two wide and outside of the pace setter around the first turn, crept closer along with an outer rival approaching the far turn, but got
outmoved by that one entering that bend and yielded between horses turning for home. ROJA REDEMPTION trailed along the inside, failed to gain in the
five path around the far turn and made little impact. POINT PROVEN raced at the rear two to three wide and was outrun turning for home. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, MIRANDA RIGHTS WAS DISQAULIFED AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
ZEITLOS bumped an outer rival soon after the start, stalked outside of the pace setter to the turn, bid at the three furlong pole, gained an advantage while
well in hand at the quarter pole, took charge once set down entering the lane and was ridden out before put to wraps nearing the wire. UNCORKED set the
pace along the inside, met an outer challenge at the three furlong pole, failed to keep pace with that one leaving the quarter pole, gave way on his left lead
through the lane and proved second best. IT'S MAGIC laid far back in the three path, tipped out at the furlong grounds and ran on to gain show at the
sixteenth pole while slowly gaining on the leaders. DRIANA raced forwardly outside of the top pair early on, chased them from the two path around the turn,
drifted to the four path entering the lane and lacked a bid. PHAT CHANCE FANCY broke a step slow before taking contact from an inner rival causing him to
steady between horses at the start, trailed along the inside, and surpassed a tiring rival in the final furlong. SAUCY SECRET was urged along in midpack
along the inside and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
HOOSIER PHILLY showed the way via a loose and uncontested margin with her ears pricked, then glided away from chasing rivals entering the lane and
cruised home well in hand. WET PAINT saved ground while patiently trailing the short field, continued on at the rear entering the lane, yet offered a rail rally
in upper stretch to gain place from an outer rival leaving the furlong pole, then gradually narrowed the clear leader's margin in the late stages. FLAMAND
bobbled slightly upon leaving the starting gate, was intently rated off of the leader to stalk from the inside under firm restraint, gained place in the two path
turning for home as the leader kicked away, but lost that position to an inner rival at the furlong grounds before lasting for show. CHAMPAGNE CALLING
laid off of the pace three wide, floated to the four path while chasing outside of rivals turning for home, then lacked a bid and was fended off for show
through the final furlong. SABRA TUFF stalked two wide, but was urged in hopes of sustaining that position entering the far turn and weakened between
horses leaving the quarter pole.

VIVAR stalked along the inside, smoothly vacated the rail before bidding two wide at the quarter pole, forged a slight advantage in upper stretch, dueled
through the final furlong and narrowly lasted from an outer bidder late. THERAPIST saved ground in midpack, took aim outside of the embattled leading pair
entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge while slowly closing in inside the final furlong, produced a bid approaching the wire, but just missed. HIDDEN
STASH set the pace along the inside, met a challenge from VIVAR turning for home, fought on gamely after getting headed in upper stretch, but lost place
nearing the wire. TIZ THE BOMB broke outwardly, got hung five wide early on while failing to achieve forward position, laid off of the pace in the three to two
path, improved along the rail entering the lane, gained to be behind the leaders entering the final sixteenth, but encountered traffic in the late stages and
failed to get through. MEDIA BLITZ pursued from midpack two wide, was urged along to inch closer three to four wide turning for home, then sustained a
grinding charge outside of rivals in the final furlong but missed reaching fourth. FOREIGN RELATIONS settled off of the pace in the two path, but failed to
advance while four to five wide around the final bend and made little impact. BAY STREET MONEY trailed in the two path, then in the four to five path
around the final bend, but failed to get involved. PUNCH HARD stalked two wide, faded around the far turn, then weakened between horses at the quarter
pole.
