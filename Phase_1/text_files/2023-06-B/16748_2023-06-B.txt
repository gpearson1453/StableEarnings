EXPERIENCE was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. RADCLIFFE set a pressured
pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. SUPER BREW was off the pace and roused on the
far turn but had no response. BOCELLI tracked the leaders from the outside and forced the pace on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch was empty. RAYO COLORADO stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and dropped back though the stretch.

Footnotes
STORMING LADY settled off the leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. CANT BEAT THE KATZ
stalked the leader and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. GIMBALA was in touch and
saved ground on the turn but had no late kick. HASN'T HIT ME YET was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the three path at the top of
the stretch was not a factor. CHASING JOY set a pressured pace and dueled on the turn but faded through the stretch. DETERMINED LOVE was up close
but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON GIMBALA AGAINST STORMING
LADY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE GOING INTO THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch just missed while switching inside. BEYOND TALENTED was unhurried early, hustled along on
the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. RELOAD BULLET showed speed from the outside and had a clear lead on the turn but
was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. VERY DEBONAIRE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch needed more. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. HIGH RESERVE was well back and showed
nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
PLUIE D'AVRIL was off the pace, moved up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. MUSICAL RIDE set the pace, had a
slim lead on the far turn and vied to mid stretch but was second best. SUBZERO PLUS stalked from the inside, was roused on the far turn and from the six
path at the top of the stretch was up for show. REIGN BY REIN was in touch and forced the pace on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch was all out. SAN NICOLA STAR was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. TICKLE HER TOE was in
range and a factor on the far turn but weakened through the stretch. WEST PAW settled off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was no threat.

moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. PRIVATE LAKE was off slow and moved up on the turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch evened out. LOQUACIOUS showed no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch

Footnotes
ALACRITOUS was away alertly, took command on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. STRONG ENDING was
unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. VINNIE VAN GO showed speed
from the inside and had a good position on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. JACK BEANSTALK was in mid pack and
had a mild gain on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. SEVEN IS A BREEZE settled off the pace and trailed the field on
the turn but passed tired foes through the stretch. CHAIRMAN BOB was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was not a threat. MOBILIZER was in
range and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no rally. WOOD BE WILD was up close and a factor on the turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch faded. GUNZIG STINGER was in touch and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was
empty.
