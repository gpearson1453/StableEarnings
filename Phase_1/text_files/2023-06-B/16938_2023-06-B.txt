CAR LADY was three wide into the first turn, settled in the back and moved to the inside, advanced nearing the half mile marker while saving ground, shifted
out nearing the three eighths marker, advanced on the turn and came four wide into the lane, closed well under left handed crop urging and edged clear in
the final seventy yards to prove best. MI CLEOPATRA AND I tracked the pace, made a two wide bid in hand to be clear by the quarter pole, widened the
margin off the turn, but was caught in the final hundred yards while staying on to be clearly second best. LOVE IS STRONG was reserved early, three wide
on the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally to best the rest. SWITCHRATTLENROLL was allowed to settle early, advanced two
wide on the turn to be in contention by the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. DANCE A LITTLE JIG was reserved early, wide trip and had no rally.
HAY BUCK was three wide into the first turn, then sprinted clear and got to the inside on the backstretch, then gave way nearing the quarter pole.

the inside, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. ON THE EDGE stalked the pace three wide, then shifted in by the half mile marker, two wide on

Footnotes
RIPKEN was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move nearing the quarter pole, continued that move when straightened in the lane and edged clear
late to prove best, driving. MISCHIEF WARRIOR vied for the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace and move down to the inside while clear,
remained clear to the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner late, second best. HANFORD was reserved early two wide, dropped to the rail and
advanced on the turn, then was blocked nearing the quarter pole, remained blocked on the rail to the three sixteenths marker, tacked out for racing room
and finished well to gain the show award, tough trip. CITY OF GOD vied for the early lead on the inside, then rated back and stalked the pace on the inside,
remained saving ground and faded in the lane, bested rest. UPTOWNJACOB BROWN got out into the first turn, corrected quickly, then trailed early,
advanced on the turn and passed the tiring rivals. FIFTH ELEMENT stalked the early pace, then went up three wide and in between foes on the backstretch,
weakened in the drive. BOOK RUNNER tracked the early pace three wide, then went up to stalk the pace four wide on the backstretch, tired. BOB'S OUR
UNCLE was off slowly, four wide into the first turn and failed to menace. SENSE OF IRELAND was not a factor. WHAT'S HIS NAME tracked the pace on
the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
TRUE QUEEN was sent to the front to set the pace, drew out on the turn and remained clear to prove best while being kept to her task. SIMPLE JUSTICE
was settled back early, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out in the furlong grounds and rallied well to gain the place award. UNCAPTURED
GRACE chased the early pace and lacked the needed winning bid on the inside and lost the place award late. MASKED HEROINE was settled early,
advanced five wide on the turn but lacked a late kick in the lane. BUSTIN WIDE OPEN chased the early pace in between rivals and weakened on the turn.
HOPEFULLY ICU stalked the early pace four wide, tracked the winner three wide on the turn, then took a bad step by the furlong marker and was wrapped
up the final furlong, walked off. IOANNA showed brief speed three wide, then was four wide on the turn and stopped. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO

TRENDING UP was void of early speed, advanced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive, closed fast to get up in time, driving. DEE JAY
stumbled at the break, then recovered and went up to set a pressured fast pace on the inside, dug in gamely in the drive turning back multiple bids, drifted
out late and was denied on the wire to just miss. FAMISHED pressed the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the turn, loomed boldly at the furlong
marker but hung late. EAGLES CRY tracked the early pace in between rivals on the first turn, then made it to the inside, drafted behind the front runners on
the inside on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn to loom by the furlong marker but needed more late. WILL E SUTTON chased the early pace on the
inside, then settled on the backstretch, angled out leaving the turn and had a belated rally. TATE stalked the early pace three wide, then dropped back on
the turn, weakened. YES SIR ROBERT was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and tired. The rider on the number five FAMISHED
claimed foul against the number two DEE JAY for interference nearing the wire, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the OBJECTION was
disallowed and race left as is.

GRAND WISER was well rated on the outside, made a four wide sweep on the turn, was clear off the turn and drew off while being wrapped up the final
furlong, easily. ECONOMIC POWER prompted the early pace three wide, hard held on the backstretch, made a bid between rivals by the five sixteenths,
could not go with the winner while winning the battle for the place award. CLOSER LOOK set the pace on the inside, was headed on the turn and proved to
be no match for the iner while being outfinished for the place award. ONCE A GIANT was rated along the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and
had no rally.
