Footnotes
RARE COIN stalked the pace while racing outside, rallied five wide on the turn, closed steadily and inched away late. SIMPLY ELEMENTARY set a
pressured pace to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. NOGAL CANYON raced mid pack, dropped inside into the turn, closed along the
rail and got up for show. SHAME ON ZCUINTLE pressed the pace along the inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to late stretch, hung and was
caught for third. DISTORTED GUY got away well, pressed the pace, fell back on the turn and went evenly late. SEA OF INDY was void of early speed,
raced wide and offered a mild bid only. DON HOLLYWOOD broke in and was away slowly, saved ground and lacked a bid. BOOM BOOM DADDY was not
a factor. THE BUSINESS MAN dwelt at the start and trailed the field. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.

Footnotes
HE'S NO YOKE was away alertly, set a pressured pace, drew off leaving the turn for a clear lead and held safely. FRANCHISE TAGGED held a good
position, went five wide entering the stretch, closed well and finished second best. TSUNAMI GOLD pressed the pace along the inside, fell back on the turn,
came again and earned show. D C ALLIED FORCES was steadied at the start, pressed the pace while racing between horses, challenged for the lead on
the turn, fell back and leveled off. JASMINE WHO was void of early speed, raced outside, offered a mild bid only and was not a threat. DINOS DA DADDY
was slow early, raced inside, lacked a bid and was outrun. POOF HE'S GONE pressed the pace while racing three wide between horses, challenged for the
lead on the turn, swung out and stopped. BYE BYE HEATH lost the rider at the start. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was
made.

MY SPECIAL MISTAKE vied to the turn, swung wide into the stretch and drew off in the drive under mild urging. SPLISH SPLASH vied to the stretch,
dropped back, was no match for the winner and all out for place. PLAYTHEMARKER stumbled at the start, raced in the back, angled out into the turn, went
widest in the drive and was gaining for second. WEEKEND WARRIOR bobbled at the start, raced mid pack towards the outside and failed to threaten in an
even effort. SPEED BUMP BOB hopped, broke slowly and was checked at the start and was outrun in an even effort. BIG D W showed good early speed,
fell back, saved ground and steadily faded.
