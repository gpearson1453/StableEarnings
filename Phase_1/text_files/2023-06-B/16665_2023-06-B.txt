GOTTS GOT IT set the pace on the outside, shook clear in the lane, then drew off and was kept to the task. RAMMING SPEED never far back, held
position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. CLASSIC RICHIE well placed and off the rail,
held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path, lugging in into the stretch and could not gain. FACE DOWN vied for the early lead on the inside,
then weakened the final furlong and held a share. EMPTY MY POUCH void of speed, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
improved position. A BIT OF CAPTAIN unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and had no rally. GRUMPY
BROOKSIE chased the pace on the inside and faded through the turn.

NIGHT RIDE led in the early going, was rated back to a tracking position, saved ground through the turns, came through on the two path into the stretch,
angled three wide, made a steady gain and edged up late. WORLDS ON HIGH unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four
wide into the stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then came again edged ahead late and was outfinished. AMERICA'S GUEST well placed
and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead late and
weakened. GEMINI MOON set the pace outside, shook clear and angled in down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
weakened the final furlong and held a share. CAMINO DE SANTIAGO mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into
the stretch, then drifted in and faded. SAVVY ON BLANC was never involved.
