Footnotes
ALL THAT MAGIC stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and took over leaving the turn, drew off in the drive to prove much the
best, ridden out. MADE TO HUSTLE was away alertly to set the pace and get over to the inside, was headed by the quarter pole by the winner, proved to be
no match for the that rival while staying on to be clearly second best. ASUE was well placed on the inside, weakened, held show award. GOOD SOURCE
chased the pace three wide, two wide on the turn and came three wide into the lane, lacked the needed bid and just missed the show award. MISS
CONVEYOR was settled early, inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane and had a belated rally. I CAME TO DANCE was reserved early, saved
ground on the turn and had no rally. POSITIVE FORCE was settled three wide, came four wide into the lane and was not a threat. SERENE WARRIOR
failed to menace. TERPEYE was not a factor.

Footnotes
MUNDLE OF JOY was away alertly to press the early pace, made a three wide bid on the turn and kicked clear leaving the turn, then remained clear to the
wire to prove best, driving. LITTLE RED BUTTON tracked the early pace and advanced three wide on the turn and then was slowly gaining late to get the
nod for the place award. HIPNOTIZADA was rated along the inside, made a bid to be between rivals at the furlong marker and then continued to finaish well
towards the inside late, missed place award. COLOR FORCE was settled early, three wide on the turn and then offered a late rally for the last spot in the
superfecta. CINQUE AMORE set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened in the lane. SHOYYOOKH was outrun early and failed to menace. LUCKY
DAY DIVA had a inside trip and was not a factor.

FLOWER'S FORTUNE set a pressured pace along the inside, made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear by the furlong marker and then kicked away to
prove best under a drive. JUSTIN TIME tracked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole, but flattened out,
held place award. WICKED T pressed the winner two wide, between rivals by the quarter pole, could not go with the winner while running on to just miss the
place award and hold the show award. LONDONDERRY hesitated at the start, chased the pace two wide, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had no
kick in the lane, bested rest. MISS MORENO was settled early and saved ground throughout but had no impact. RIDGELYSREDHOT was five wide into the
first turn while throwing head, settled on the outside down the backstretch, made a mild advance four wide on the far turn but tired. ESTA CHUCK chased
the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
WHISKIED UP set the pace while in the two path, well handled and drew off leaving the turn, then was widened the margin while being ridden out. SIR
STEELE tracked the early pace from the inside, made a three wide bid on the far turn but flattened out, second best. OVER THE BORDER was settled early
on the inside, advanced two wide on the turn and was along for the show award to best the rest. HE'S FANCY FREE broke outwardly at the start, six wide
into the first turn, settled back four wide, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally for the last spot in the superfecta. MOMENT AT SEA stalked
the pace three wide, dropped to the inside on the far turn while chasing the pace, weakened. HE AROSE was settled while five wide, came widest into the
lane and had no rally. STEADY EDDIE stalked the pace on the inside and tired. SYLVIA I AM chased the pace four wide and tired.
