Footnotes
KINGS WAGER was on the bit and pulling on his reins going into the first turn, drifted into the four path, was brought back in and asked to rate, settled in
hands two wide right off of the pace setter, was allowed to draw next to the front runner after the half mile, rated while setting the pace in a set, was asked
and responded well at the quarter pole, pulled away, with full of run and took the win gamely. WESTERN STAR raced on the rail in the middle of the field,
inched up and improved position on the back side, saved ground on the rail through the turn, closed well under urging in the stretch drive, edged out late to
pass a tiring rival and went on to take second place honors. MY PAL SWEET raced two wide, vied for t he lead, took command and set the pace, was joined
by an outside foe then set the pace as a set, started to battle through the turn, was under heavy encouragement at the quarter pole but could sustain the bid
and gave way in the stretch. MAGIC LIGHTNING raced four wide early on, rated behind the first wall of horses, was kept in place through the turn, was cued
at he quarter pole and strongly encouraged, responded well. INFINITESIMAL raced off of the pace early on, maintained position, closed late with a mild bid.
JUDGMENTAL raced on the rail, saved ground through out, maintained position but made no impact. FLOWER CAT was sharp out of the gates, pulled his
way to the front, was asked to rate and sit off of the pace, finally settled into mid pack in the four path, faded after that. CROSSING IRIS trailed, passed tired
rival. RICKY RIGHT showed little.

Footnotes
VIV'S WILD ACES found herself well off of the pace and racing mid pack early on, raced along the rail, saved ground, found her best stride through the turn
where she smartly saved ground and made up lengths on the rail, excelled down the lane, had to stop, angle out into the three path after the sixteenth pole,
picked up the pace and drew off like a professional. GIRL LIKES BLING vied for the lead, raced on the rail and set the pace, was joined by another
challenger to the outside and was pressured through out, was still on the lead, battled down the lane gamely, had her head in front, was collared by an
outside closer and had to settle for second, still ran a very competitive race. PLUM WINE raced four wide, was un hurried for the first half of the race,
shuffled back to the rear of the field, launched her bid at the three eighth pole, circled through the turn, was six wide in the upper stretch, found her best
stride down the lane, responded well and closed ground quickly when she was asked, nice effort. RONNIE'S DEAL vied for the lead, raced in the two path in
between rivals, drew next to the front runner and set the pace with one to her inside and a rival pressuring on the outside, engaged in a battle down the lane
with the same horse she was out side of through out, was asked and dug in gamely, fighting for the lead, was collared late by a fast closing foe t the outside
and flattened out late. TAKE HER AWAY was off of the pace and four wide early, loomed up to the outside of the early front runners after the half mile pole,
maintained position into the stretch but had no late kick. OUR LAST HALF was mid pack and four side, made no impact. COMMUNICATIONISKEY was
never involved. DEMOTION stumbled badly out of the gates, recovered and found her legs, tracked the rest of the field greenly.

Footnotes
VALENTINE ANGEL vied for the lead, raced on the rail, shuffled back and stalked on the back side, launched a bit at the three eighths, edged out into the
three path , found clear racing room, came back on her early challenger nearing the eighth pole, over came that rival, and took command of the race and
drew off willingly at the sixteenth pole. IRISH WRIT was well off the pace, raced along the rail, angled out into the four path and started to gain ground after
the half, improved position through the turn, launched a closing bid after the quarter pole while racing in the six path down the stretch, responded well to
encouragement and urging, was able to get up for second. BLUE COWGIRL raced three wide and off of the pace, quickly advanced into a stalking position,
continued to gain ground and passed her rivals and took command after the half mile pole, set the fractions until the quarter pole, was run down by the rival
she had took the lead from at the half mile pole, relinquished the lead back to that rival and finished flat. BEAUCLAIRE was forwardly placed early, raced
two and three wide, was passed by a fst moving outside rival at the half mile pole, tried to g o with that foe but could not sustain the bid and stopped.
PREPAID SPECIAL was never involved. DON'T LOOK ETHEL raced in the middle of the field early, raced five wide and faded. WISH FOR CANDY was off
of the pace early raced on the rail, showed little.

SWEET PERFECTION went wire to wire. HAVE I EVER was racing in the middle of the field in the three path, launched a bid at the quarter pole and closed
with determination, gained ground quickly and just missed. TEXAS TIDELANDS stalked the early pace, raced in the three path, loomed next to the front
runners after the half mile pole, could not sustain the bid and flattened out in the stretch. C C'S COWGIRL was off of the pace early, was allowed to settle
and find her stride while working on the rail, advanced after the half mile marker and improved position into the turn, angled out into the four path in the
stretch, found clear racing room, closed well, just had to much to do this time. KENYA STRIKE was mid pack and raced along the rail, smartly saved ground
through out, was in contention in the upper stretch, had racing room but no late kick. ABBY THE BULL DAWG trailed early, mild bid. GEE SHE'S PRETTY
stalked the front runner, raced on the rail, tired after six furlongs. GIFTED TALENT showed little.

Footnotes
OPTIMISTIC stalked the early pace, was asked to rate, grudgingly waited for the cue, was shifted out into the three path at the three eighths pole, willingly
passed the front runners, took the lead, showed the way in the stretch but had pressure on the inside and had to battle to stay in front, repelled that foe,
then had pressure from the outside, started looking for the wire while that outside foe was closing in, was kept on point and encouraged, kept going and got
to the wire in time. FIRST LINE was off of the pace and racing on the rail, was asked to moved at the half, responded well and closed up the fence, shifted
out three wide in the turn and was in a full on hand ride, continued to push, and urge, encouraged to keep closing, was kept on point and had the winner in
her sights, could not catch the winner today but closed with a great effort. SCREENPLAY vied for the lead, set the first easy fractions, battled into the
stretch, faded after the eighth pole, but had done enough early to still hold on to third place honors. POP LIFE was off a bit slow, was well off of the pace,
raced on the rail, made one clean run, gained ground, improved position, could not do enough to get with in the tope three but did out finish the rest of the
field. MR. UNUSUAL was never involved. MAX PANDOWDY was no menace. CORVETTE SPIRIT made no impact. DONNA'S COURT stalked the front
runner from the three path, passed the leader to take command after the half mile marker, then faded.

Footnotes
RECKLESS RANSOM raced on the rail, was off of the pace for the first part of the race, found his stride and starting gaining ground after the half, shifted
out six wide in the upper stretch, was encouraged and urged, kept on point, closed with every stride, collared the leaders before the sixteenth pole and went
on to win easily. WISE ANCHOR was off the pace and three wide early, found his stride and started gaining ground after the half mile marker, shifted out
into the six path in the upper stretch and closed with determination, needed more room to get the win but ran a game second. PINCH ME A PENNY was
three wide and racing in the middle of the pack, was asked at the half, responded well and challenged for the lead at the three eighths pole, battled into the
stretch and down to the eighth pole, was collared by an outside closer and just missed for second. ran very gamely. DOCTOR LEO was off a touch slow,
raced on the rail while being last, found his stride, gained ground, was in contention by the quarter pole, closed well in the stretch, looked like he was going
to get in the money, but came up short. HALF AGAIN vied for the led, took control of the race and set the fractions, was challenged in the turn and stopped.
LILRASCALMAN was never involved. YOUNG TUSCAN flashed early speed. FIERY PLAYBOY stalked the pace setter, raced two wide, drew next tot he
leader, matched strides through the turn, then faded. TARGET PRACTICE trailed through out.

Footnotes
LOVING LUCKY stalked the early pace while racing in the two path, launched a bid at he three eighths pole, and challenged for the lead, took control before
the quarter pole and drew away, started to feel pressure after the sixteenth pole by another rival closing in, was urged and encouraged and held on for the
win. LI MU BAI (IRE) stalked from the rail, raced in the second tier, saved ground through out, maintained positioning through the turn, closed ground on the
rail, shifted out a bit late and was up for second. ELUSIVE D'ORO stalked from the three path, moved up along side of the pace setter, was challenged by
an outside foe, battled with that rival briefly before repelling him, picked up and battled wit an inside closer, gave way to that one and settled for third.
DECLARE WAR raced off the pace and launched a mild bid late. CHIEF CHEETAH was mid pack and in the two and three path in between rivals, but had
no impact. MONARCH MAN was racing in the four path on the outside, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, and had no kick. DARE TO FAIL was mid
pack, stayed on the rail and showed little. TAPIT CITY was never involved. HELIOCHROME set the early pace, raced on the rail and stopped. VETERAN'S
HOLIDAY trailed through out.
