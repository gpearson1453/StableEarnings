away under mild urging and was in hand late. TURN ON THE CHARM was bumped hard at the start, chased the pace, came three wide into the lane, rallied
in the final furlong and got up late for second. PROUD MULE was off slowly, rushed up outside to set the pace, held a clear lead, was no match for the
winner, then dug in through the lane and lost second at the end. OSCAR GAZE broke out bumping a rival at the start, then steadied, raced two wide off the
pace, came wide into the stretch and closed belatedly. SWEET FURY chased the pace, chased on the turn and had no rally. SISTREN was bumped at the
start, raced off the pace inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
SYSTEMIC CHANGE raced off the pace with an inside trip, saved ground on the far turn, rallied on the rail turning for home, closed steadily inside, dueled
with KOBE B and prevailed late. KOBE B led on the first turn, then tracked along the inside, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled, gained a short lead, shook
free in upper stretch, then dug in gamely in the final furlong and battled on to the finish. GREATHEART raced off the pace between rivals, advanced
between horses at the quarter pole, found a seam three wide into the stretch, rallied mildly and got third. IRISH MEADOW bobbled at the break, trailed on
the inside, moved up at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly and missed for third. LOGICO was off slowly, raced five wide early,
settled three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. KING OF HOLLYWOOD stalked close up two wide, bid three wide on the far
turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. HARPOON HARRY raced four wide into the first turn, pulled his way to the front coming to the three
quarter pole, took over to set the pace, dueled on the far turn and gave way.
