C C'S WORLD saved ground while racing close to the pace, awaited room on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly, dueled late and
proved best. SEQUAYA vied inside to the stretch, inched away for a short lead, responded to duel in deep stretch and was outfinished in a good effort.
BELLS OF JOY vied two across to the turn, fell back, swung wide entering the stretch, continued to close and got up late for show. GYURZA stalked the
pace, challenged three across on the turn, came up empty late and was caught for third. QUEEN EKATI was through after a half, stopped, bled and was
vanned off.

WICKED SUPRISE was a bit crowded at the start, was unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied into the turn, angled out, assumed command entering
the stretch, drew off in the drive and was kept to task. CHERRY ORCHARD vied inside, was taken back entering the turn, shifted out, continued willingly
and earned place while no match for the winner. JACKPOT BOY broke in, was unhurried early, was roused on the turn, offered a mild bid only and was
along for show. ONE ACE settled off the pace mid pack while racing outside, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid. KING ZION vied two across, drew
clear into the turn, was headed entering the stretch, weakened and faded.

TEMPER TANTRUM stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and inched clear late. SAILING SOLO sprinted clear
to set the pace, responded when challenged to duel for the lead and yielded late to finish second best. PROTONIC POWER raced close to the pace
towards the outside, went widest in the drive and closed steadily to get up for show. CADET CORPS saved ground, bid inside on the turn, angled out and
lacked the needed late response. CAPTIVATING MOON was a bit hard to load, stalked the pace to the second turn, gave way and was not urged late.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL MOMENT was in tight early, rallied around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up in the
final strides. GOOD ONE got away well to set the pace with a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. HATCHET CREEK chased the pace,
swung wide leaving the turn, lacked the needed late response and settled for show. RISKY BOY raced close to the pace, bid inside to loom a threat and
hung late. REMEMBER THE MAINE pressed the pace while racing along the rail, fell back into the turn and offered a mild bid only. DEORA STORE raced
behind horses, was under restraint from the start to the turn, angled out and was not urged thereafter.

outrun. VELVET SEASON was off slowly, checked at the start and failed to contend. SHORT STRAW sprinted clear, led to the turn and stopped.
