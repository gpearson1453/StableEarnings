take command near the eighth pole, inched away to the finish kept to task. GRAM fractious in the gate prior to the start, got checked near the half mile pole
as rivals tucked directly in front as the leader took the rail in front of them, lost ground and position to the tail of the field as a result, chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, showed good courage to kick on belatedly and secure the place honors. NICKY
JOLENE chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, ran on to procure the show honors. GRAB
THE GLORY coaxed from the gate, got briefly steadied at the half mile pole and in turn backed up rivals in behind her, chased along the inside, swung four
wide into upper stretch and closed well to the finish. FOLLOW YOUR ARROW broke forwardly placed and crossed to the inside at the half mile pole forcing
rivals to grab hold in behind her at that station, spurted away along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, kept on to the end. SORORITY PARTY broke in at the start taking over the lane of RUN
FOR YOUR HONEY and forcing that foe to steady at the break, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home,
offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. CHARITY FIRST coaxed from the start, got paused at the half mile pole and eased off as rivals crossed directly in
front, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no headway. RUN
FOR YOUR HONEY got steadied at the start as SORORITY PARTY broke inwards taking over her lane, chased just off the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, tipped four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SHEZA BERNARDINI coaxed from the start, got steadied briefly at the half mile
pole when outside rivals crossed over, chased just off the inside under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and made no impact.

MIDNIGHT STROLL was last to commence, settled on the outside, ranged up five then four wide on the turn, made a bid coming to the five-sixteenths, was
put to a drive into upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, took the lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong
urging. GOOD SAM was coaxed to the front, lost the lead just inside the three-quarter pole then stalked on the outside, regained the advantage in the three
path passing the seven-sixteenths, was asked some near the five-sixteenths then roused for more coming to the quarter-pole, led under a drive until near
the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while well clear for second. HONEY MONEY tracked the pace on the inside of a foe while in hand, was let out near
the half-mile pole, chased four then three wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. MISSY GREER was taken in hand while wanting to get
to the outside early then moved up inside of a foe, took the lead just inside the three-quarter pole then showed the way, lost the advantage while inside at
the seven-sixteenths, dropped back coming to the five-sixteenths and faded. QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED AND PROVIDED BY THE

Footnotes
PROVISION three wide in pursuit through the dog legged turn and then down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with PARATUS latched on to his outside to engage the leader inside the final furlong,
grabbed a narrow command just inside the sixteenth marker while dueling to the finish and gamely prevailed on the wire. PARATUS settled just off the
inside near the rear of the field, tipped three then four wide midway on the far turn and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, rallied dueling with the aforementioned foe through the final eighth, overthrew the leader in concert with his main rival just inside the sixteenth
marker battling on gamely but was ultimately bested at the end. SPETTRO showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
and was collared just inside the sixteenth marker, and ran on to preserve the show honors. GHOSTLYPRINCE bobbled at the break, recovered to track the
pace along the inside from mid pack, came under light and brief coaxing just before cutting the corner into upper stretch, got paused in behind the leader
down along the rail unable to tip out until URAGANO had backed away sufficiently enough to be roused near the sixteenth pole, then tipped out at that
station to the two path late and was up for the last major share. MAMA BANNED ME two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. URAGANO tracked the pace along the inside
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. GOOD RAPPORT three wide
in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish. FATHER GLADO tracked
the front three then two wide coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened. SCOTTO chased along
the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered three wide at the head of the stretch, offered no response.

Footnotes
TWENTY FOUR MAMBA settled off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn, came a bit off the rail in upper stretch, rallied inside foes to get
the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then kicked clear and held under steady urging. LAFITTE'S FLEET settled at the rear of the field, was roused in the two
path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained into the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner the place. HAPPY FARM
pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader while in the three path on the turn, dueled with that foe into the final furlong, dropped back into
the final sixteenth and weakened but held the show. EMERALD FOREST was well placed under urging, went two then three wide on the turn, gained under
a drive into upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then missed the show. CATCHYASOON was hustled to the front, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while still inside a foe on the turn, turned into upper stretch under solid urging, dueled inside a rival into
the final furlong and tired. LOST IN ROME settled on the outside, was urged while moving from three to five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, held a reasonable striking position approaching the furlong marker but flattened out and lacked the needed kick. WAYAKIN chased the
leading duo on the outside then in the four path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and retreated.

into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LAWFUL three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out eight wide into upper
stretch, kicked on belatedly for the last major share. GOLDEN PURCHASE chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into

the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tired. EQUALIZER chased just off the inside under a ride from the

inside, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from LUNA WARRIOR to the outside, quickened the pace and widened away from
the field as a pair through the turn, spun two to three wide for home under threat and yielded the front straightened away into upper stretch, then tired in the
drive. COSMIC STORM chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside
route into upper stretch and made no impact. MOMENT OF INSIGHT chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, made no impact. CARPE CAPELLA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, retreated through the latter

ANGELIQUE showed good speed from the inside and went to the front, lost the advantage briefly passing the five-eighths then regained the lead, vied
inside of foes while along the rail on the turn, shook clear inside the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage in the two path into the stretch, drew away
under a drive into the final forty yards then was eased up while much the best. CLOVER STREET broke out then was corrected by the winner, settled on the
outside, was urged four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. TOSCONOVA
BEAUTY bumped with a rival at the start, chased the early pace, moved up inside the three-quarter pole, held a very brief lead passing the five-eighths, vied
between foes in the two path from that point, dropped back late on the turn then spun three wide at the quarter-pole, remained on her inside lead in the
stretch and tired while able to get the show. LAVON settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted in
inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. SWEETIE was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
was no factor. DANSEUR D'ORO showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend,
spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. CHARGE NURSE bumped with an opponent at the start, dropped back under urging, raced between foes in
the two path under urging on the turn and failed to respond. REIGNING CHICK dropped well behind, angled out near the five-eighths, went four then five
wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch, had the rider lose his crop near the sixteenth-pole and showed little. CAPTIVATING CARA was urged
along towards the back, saved ground while inside of two rivals on the turn and failed to respond.

OUTLAW KID just off the inside in closest pursuit of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun two to three wide for home, took over
command at the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail. PINE KNOLL chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. MAXWELL ESQUIRE
chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled three wide into upper stretch, kept on to garner the show honors.
RUNNINGWSCISSORS chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, offered up a bid swinging four wide into upper stretch, then
flattened out in the stretch. SOUPER SUCCESS chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
offered no response. AFTER FIVE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. INTO THE SUNRISE showed the way briefly from the two path before taking to the inside, remained in hand
through swift splits and came under coaxing near the quarter pole when under challenge for the initial time by the eventual winner to the outside, took the
inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded with three-sixteenths to run and weakened to the finish. BIG PACKAGE chased along the inside under
coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, angled four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. SEVEN SCENTS three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, angled six wide at the head of the stretch and tired.
