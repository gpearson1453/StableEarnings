Footnotes
BIG HAZEL three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out,
inched away under a drive to prevail. ICHIBAN dueled from the three path early on before easing off a step allowing SHORT SHIFT to take sole albeit
narrow command, pressed that rival through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, seized command
straightened away, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to preserve the place honors. FOXY CARA coaxed from the gate, chased five
then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. JESSICA'S RIDE chased
along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out three to four wide at the three-sixteenths
and weakened. SHORT SHIFT brushed the near side stall at the start, dueled early on with ICHIBAN to her outside while in the two path, had that rival ease
back slightly and then came under pressure once more through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths in response, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and tired.

Footnotes
COLLABORATION broke a bit awkwardly then bumped lightly with the hindquarters of a foe, moved from the rail to the two path while under a snug hold on
the first turn, tracked outside down the backstretch, ranged up in the two path on the far turn, took the lead inside the five-sixteenths, kicked clear under a
right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. SNOWY EVENING went two then three wide under a hold on the first
turn, was rated off the pace, advanced in the three path on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, fought with the winner under a drive in upper
stretch, lost touch with that foe before the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. SALS DREAM GIRL was bumped lightly in the
hindquarters at the break, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, brushed with a foe
while roused five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while up for the show. RHEAUME brushed with a foe at the start, was taken under a tight
hold early, tugged hard at the bit under stout restraint in the two path going around the first turn, was rated off the pace, raced inside for most of the far turn
then slipped to the two path, was roused four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. RED HOT CHICK was taken back early then moved in
into the first turn, raced in the two path under reserve, shifted to the three path while roused on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
LADY JASMINE was taken under restraint early, tugged eagerly on the bit while four wide on the first turn, settled more kindly while given cover on the
backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn, brushed with an opponent while roused six wide into the stretch and also failed to rally. LA
CONQUISTADORA brushed with a foe then was hustled from the gate, displayed good speed while three then two wide on the first turn, sped clear late on
that bend, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside while shortening stride on the far turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
CENTRAL PRIDE bobbled at the break, recovered to chased five then four wide early on, tucked three wide at the five-eighths before tucking to the two
path through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with the runner up to his outside
overthrowing the leader with seventy yards to the finish and inched away in the late stages to prevail. SWAY'SINMYDNA chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied in concert with the aforementioned foe to overtake the leader
inside the final sixteenth offering up a mild kick to secure the place honors. WARMAN ROAD established the front and showed the way in hand just off the
inside, tucked inside through the turn and was patiently handled, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused near the three-sixteenths, dug in
under threat from a pair and was collared inside the final sixteenth and was along clear for the show honors. SORPRESO chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish. REUNION TOUR chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. JUGGLER bobbled at the start, chased four then three wide growing
detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch well behind, then got eased through the final
furlong and trailed throughout.

PROGRAM TRADING (GB) moved up after the start, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the turn, gained the lead
just inside the five-sixteenths, was asked between foes into the stretch, battled inside of two rivals into the final furlong then shook clear and proved best
under steady urging. OPERATION TORCH was rated just off the pace on the inside, moved to the two path late on the far turn, was roused outside the
quarter-pole then came four wide into the stretch, gained to make an outside bid inside the three-sixteenths, battled outside of two foes into the final furlong
and was outfinished while well clear for the place. SCRAMBLE was rated just off the pace, ranged up two then three wide on the turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, fought with foes under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. LACHAISE dropped back early then settled on the
outside, was roused while moving closer in the three path on the turn and came up empty. THUNDERIAN went to the front, showed the way on the inside
while in hand, was asked on the turn, lost the lead to the winner just inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way. BABY BILLY
was hustled from the gate, dropped back when taken in hand leaving the chute, settled off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, rounded the
turn in the two path, paused off heels near the five-sixteenths then was roused for more and failed to respond. CLASSIC CREATION brushed the inside of
the gate at the start, checked severely along the rail early then fell to the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

LASTCHANCEATGLORY four wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked to the two path advancing on that rival and coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, slipped away as a pair from the rest of the field, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, took over command just inside the
three-sixteenths and dug in under a drive fending off LITTLE DEMON through to the finish and gamely inched away to the end. DUST DEVIL four then three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly surging late to just get up for the place
honors on the wire. LITTLE DEMON broke in at the start taking over the lane of PIT BOSS forcing that foe to steady in behind, showed the way in hand just
off the inside, tucked inside coming under pressure to the outside from the eventual winner and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish, got shaken off late and was just nailed on the wire for the place honors. TWO THIRTY
FIVE got bumped at the start by CUPID'S CLAWS, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and kept on to the finish. PIT BOSS got steadied at the start when LITTLE DEMON broke inwards taking over the lane, chased six then five wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. CUPID'S CLAWS broke in at the start bumping TWO THIRTY
FIVE, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued in the
two path into upper stretch and made no impact. ROCCO STRONG chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, tired. MY FRIENDS BEER chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, lost ground through the latter portion of the turn
and went four wide into upper stretch, tired, and was eased home to the finish.

from that point, ranged up in the two path on the turn, took the lead while set down into upper stretch, kicked clear coming to the furlong marker and held
under steady urging. SCHERZANDO settled off the pace, was taken in hand while off heels near the five-eighths, went around the turn in the two path, was
roused while shifting four wide coming to the quarter-pole then was driven five wide into upper stretch, chased outside in the drive, gained in the final furlong
and finished willingly for the place. FORWARD MOVE moved out early then settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused at the
five-sixteenths, came four wide into upper stretch, chased the winner in the drive and was out-kicked while just able to get the show. LAUREL VALLEY
settled off the pace, was taken in hand while moving in over the heels of a rival who came out in front near the five-eighths, saved ground on the turn, was
roused while shifting three wide into upper stretch, chased the winner to the finish and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. FROSTUITOUS
dropped back while taken in hand early, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, had the rider lose his crop into upper stretch, moved out near the
sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. MISSION HILL settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. SHARPAZ went to the front then moved clear with five furlongs to run, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead under urging into upper stretch and gave
way.

Footnotes
NEW GINYA broke in striking the near side stall at the start and getting away last, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch, then closed well outside to get up in the final jumps to the finish. ROAD TO REMEMBER
showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in under growing late threat and was caught in the final strides to the end. MASTEROF THE TUNES chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. HOWDYOUMAKEURMONEY chased along the inside under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish. SILKEN DOLLAR chased just off the
inside, got let out angled three wide into upper stretch, improved position to the wire. MOONAGE DAYDREAM chased two to three wide under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened. SHINFULL chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. DREAM CENTRAL chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued along the inside route into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
KANT HURRY LOVE stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, chased the runner-up while outside in the stretch, gained on that foe
in the final sixteenth and got up in the last stride to prevail. GRANNYS CONNECTION went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, extended
the advantage in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked once straightened for the drive, was put to a right-handed crop inside the furlong
marker, led until the final stride but was denied while able to get the place. STERLING SILVER broke in and brushed with a foe, settled off the pace, was
asked in the three path while between foes on the turn, chased in the two path in the stretch, gained in the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show.
BETSY BLUE was coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger encouragement in the four path on the turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and
also finished willingly but just missed the show. CAPTAINSDAUGHTER settled at the rear of the field, lugged out some while kept to the inside under heavy
left-rein pressure going around the turn, came out five wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. ROSSA VELOCE was hustled from the gate, dropped just
off the pace, chased inside on the turn and came up empty. BANK ON ANNA brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path
while between foes on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
BORN A GAMBLER got bumped at the start by the veering out ACAMAR, then had to briefly steady and alter slightly out as that foe continued outwards in
front, took to the inside and chased the leader from mid pack, tipped to the two path into the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out
five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong taking command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish
to prevail. MAURITIUS established the front as ACAMAR took most of the field on the scenic route at the start and spurted away showing the way just off
the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home and had the field take closer order remaining unhurried and clinging to the front with five-sixteenths to go,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive inside the eighth pole, dug in under
threat from flanking challengers and was collared a sixteenth from home and was along safe to preserve the place honors. AMERICAN GRANT chased two
to three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three then two wide into upper
stretch before taking to the rail straightened away, then ran on to the finish to be along clear for the show honors. WATASHA got steadied after the start due
to pressure from the veering out ACAMAR, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. MISTER ABARRIO got steadied after the start caught in the tangle early on by the veering out ACAMAR, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. LEGENDARY LORE chased along the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened
in the drive. HIGH MOUNTE (IRE) got steadied at the start, chased three then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide into upper
stretch, made no late headway. ADDICTED TO YOU got bumped at the start and was forced to check out from between foes due to pressure from
ACAMAR, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing midway, continued just off
the inside into upper stretch and offered no kick. ACAMAR veered out at the start bumping BORN A GAMBLER into ADDICTED TO YOU and continued
outwards in front of those foes forcing ADDICTED TO YOU to check out, two other rivals to steady out and then two additional rivals to steady out after the
start, chased two to three wide in closest aim of the spurting away leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
tired. HIGH STRIKE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.
