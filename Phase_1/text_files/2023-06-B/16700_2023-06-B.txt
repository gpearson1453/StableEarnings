Footnotes
IMPLICITLY was unhurried in the early stages, saved all of the ground to the top of the stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker, took command nearing
the sixteenth-pole and drew away in deep stretch. DEALERS HAND settled off of the decent early pace, outside of a rival along the turn, closed well in the
drive, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. HAY JUAN showed speed at the start and dictated terms in the early going, set
decent fractions into the turn, drew to a clear lead at the quarter marker, was tiring into deep stretch, was collared by IMPLICITLY heading to the
sixteenth-marker, was outfinished for second and held clearly at the end for third. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH forwardly placed in the early stages, chased the
decent fractions two deep into the turn, was carried out a path by the loose horse approaching the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the drive and tired.
STANFORD BAY was fractious in the gate, stumbled at the start, lost the rider and walked off under his own power. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INTO THE START INVOLVING STANFORD BAY. THE STEWARDS RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT STANFORD BAY CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES AT
THE START AND WAS DECLARED A STARTER.

Footnotes
SHANAGOLDEN was allowed to settle while well placed, saved ground into the backstretch run, was asked three wide nearing the quarter marker,
confronted SNAKE ISLAND in upper stretch, disposed of that rival heading to the furlong marker, drew away into deep stretch and was hand ridden to the
finish. WILD WAGER settled early on while not far back, raced outside of a rival through the backstretch run, was roused four wide along the second turn
and came widest into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive and bested the rest. SNAKE ISLAND was sent in the early stages and contested
the pace with THE LONNA RANGER, shook free of that rival into the backstretch run and carved out moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, came under
pressure by a host of rivals nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken by SHANAGOLDEN in upper stretch, tired in the final stages, was outfinished for
second and was well clear in the end for third. THE LONNA RANGER disputed the early pace with SNAKE ISLAND, took back to track that rival through
moderate fractions into the backstretch run, re-engaged with SNAKE ISLAND and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, was shuffled back a bit heading
into the stretch, lost contact approaching the furlong pole, was eased through the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
CITY GLITTER raced close to the decent early pace, advanced on the pacesetter along the turn, confronted DON'T TELL HYDEE into upper stretch and
drew to even terms with that rival nearing the furlong marker, determinedly battled to deep stretch, made a final push nearing the finish and kept to task to
prove best in the end. DON'T TELL HYDEE was sent leaving an alert beginning and dictated early terms, set decent fractions into the turn, was confronted
nearing the quarter marker, held a narrow lead to mid-stretch, met the bid of CITY GLITTER to the sixteenth-marker, battled gamely to deep stretch and was
bested in the final strides, while just holding for second. DRESS REHEARSAL stalked the decent early pace from from the inside, lost position on the turn
while saving ground, advanced into upper stretch, could not muster the needed late response in the final furlong and finished evenly, while holding safely for
third. NEVER SWAY chased the decent pace while outside of rivals, improved position on the turn while three deep, could not sustain that bid into the drive
and weakened. LILA AT THE BEACH chased the decent early pace, gave chase two wide on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and lacked a late
response.

Footnotes
TEAGANS ATM was hustled leaving the break and established the early advantage, drew to a clear lead into the turn, was well handled through the bend
and raced in hand into upper stretch, drew off inside of the furlong pole and was hand urged to the finish as much the best. CATCHMENT chased the
decent early pace while outside of a rival, came two wide to the quarter marker, was no match for the winner in the drive and was best of the rest.
SMUGGLER'S COVE chased the early pace, gave chase while two wide on the turn, crowded WOLF'S LIFE a bit heading to the furlong marker, gave way
in the final stages and was clear in the end for third. MAJOR TOM lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn and did not factor. WOLF'S LIFE chased
the early pace from the inside, steadied slightly in upper stretch when crowded by SMUGGLER'S COVE, could not keep pace into the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR raced close to the decent early pace, came two wide into the bend then was steered to the rail and made a quick move to take command
nearing the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead into the stretch and drew away under mild urging in the final stages. MUAY THAI (IRE) was hustled leaving the
start, set decent early fractions into the turn, set the pace while off of the rail and was overtaken heading to the quarter marker, chased MY DOMINATOR to
mid-stretch, was unable to impact the winner in the final stages and was clear of the rest for second. HAWK HILL chased the decent early pace, raced
widest into the turn, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, was outkicked by the top pair in the drive and held well for third in the final stages. ECHO
ALPHA SIX stalked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, lost position while three wide on the turn, could not keep pace in the drive and tired.
UNUSUAL CODE stumbled leaving the break and was off slowly, trailed into the turn, was not able to make headway into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
UNRAPTURED was prominent leaving the break, set a disputed pace into the turn, shook free along the bend, drew to a clear lead into upper stretch, felt
mild late pressure from the runner-up, kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and held in a drive at the end to prevail. BOBBY'S ALIBI stalked the
decent early pace while outside of a rival, improved position two wide on the turn, raced three deep into the stretch, lost position at the furlong pole,
re-rallied in the final sixteenth, put mild late pressure on the winner but could not reel that one in and bested the rest. TOP EXECUTIVE settled just off of the
decent early pace, raced along the rail on the turn, shifted two wide into upper stretch, could not muster the needed late response in the drive, was
outkicked for second and held safely in the end for third. LITTLE CASINO showed early speed and contested the pace with UNRAPTURED, pressed that
rival into the turn, lost position on the bend, was steered four wide into the stretch and lacked a late rally. DEVELOPING THE WAY hit the gate at the start
then was shuffled back leaving the break and was away slowly, chased from the rear into the turn, was not able to make headway in the stretch and did not
factor.

Footnotes
EXTREME BLAZE broke well, took command before the turn while racing well off the rail, held sway to the quarter pole, opened up turning for home and
drew off under intermittent left handed urging. AUNT NOREEN tracked the leader in to the outside of DANCING BONBON to the quarter pole, let that rival
slip away at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but kept to task and gained the second spot over that same rival in the final yards. DANCING
BONBON raced close up early in a tracking position behind the lone pacesetter, was set down at the three-sixteenths pole, raced on the wrong lead for
most of the stretch and was outfinished for the place. DRAW NEAR was away in good order but not part of the early pace, found some room before the turn
to angle in to save some ground, began a sustained bid with just over three furlongs to get into contention but was unable to find another gear in deep
stretch when needed. HAUGHTY KITTY raced in mid-pack to the middle of the turn, struggled to keep pace through the turn and was unable to improve
position to the finish while generally keeping to task. GOLONDRINA was hard to load before the start then was off a bit slowly, raced near the rear of the
field to the stretch, attempted a bid from the five-sixteenths but was unable to improve. CUTE RENEGADE stumbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked
early speed while saving ground, tipped three wide for the drive and did not factor.
