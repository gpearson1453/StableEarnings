Footnotes
MINOSO prompted the pace set by Gold Rush Candy while racing two-wide and finished strongly to wear that one down in the final sixteenth. GOLD RUSH
CANDY saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. MILEYS BLUECAT saved ground while
being forwardly placed and finished in a mild rally. PARTY FOR ONE was unhurried early, moved between horses nearing the quarter pole and improved
his position. IRON ROB was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. CONTINUE ON VICTOR hopped slightly at the
start, dropped back early, was four-wide the final quarter and failed to seriously threaten.

CLOVISCONNECTION vied for the lead from along the inside, opened clear nearing the stretch and was ridden out to increase his advantage. LLOYDS
LOGIC prompted the issue while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner but was clearly second best. COMPANY'S DREAM was bumped at the
start by TABLE BAY then allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. ROYAL HALO vied for the early lead from
between horses and weakened. STEALING HEARTS saved ground early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. TABLE BAY
stumbled at the start then came in to bump, was wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BRONY BOY saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out three-wide nearing the eighth pole, split rivals during the drive and finished fast
to be up in the final strides. WEAR THE CROWN dueled for the lead with FAMOUS ROCK STAR from along the inside, responded when asked and just
failed to last in a determined effort. PICK YOUR BID broke in, then was forwardly placed racing along the outside, was four-wide entering the stretch and
finished strongly to lose a tough decision. FAMOUS ROCK STAR dueled for the lead from along the outside into the stretch and held on stubbornly during
the drive in a steady effort. NATIONHEART was prominently placed from the outset, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked the needed late response.
STEPHEN JAMES steadied shortly after the start in tight, dropped back and gained his best stride too late.

Footnotes
ALOHA BREEZE saved ground setting the pace, drew clear nearing the stretch and drew off to win as the rider pleased. MISS DYNAMIC prompted the
pace from along the outside, was unable to stay with the winner during the drive but held on well for the place. JAMIES INHERITANCE was unhurried early,
rallied three-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. ME GUSTA LUNA settled in the middle of the pack, steadied in traffic nearing the three-eighths pole,
came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. STEPUP saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out three-wide nearing the eighth
pole but lacked a rally. PEPPER MILL was reserved off the pace, steadied in traffic nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was unable to recover. GET MY
POINT dropped back early, raced four-wide on the turn and failed to threaten. TENNESSEE MOON bobbled at the start, then moved up to be forwardly
placed for three furlongs and gave way.
