ONE WAY HOME rated between rivals, lost his path at the half mile marker, angled out on the bend, came four wide into the lane, rallied, was bumped a
couple times inside the last sixteenth but edged ahead the final fifty yards. PACHI vied for the lead between horses from the start, angled in some at the half
mile marker, was two wide through the turn, moved clear in the stretch, drifted out some under left-handed pressure with a sixteenth left, bumped with ONE
WAY HOME a few times, slowly yielded in the waning yards but was easily best of the rest. IT'S BELLAMY TIME moved clear of the others nearing the end
of the first furlong, gradually floated out midway on the backstretch, was challenged approaching the half mile pole and flattened out for the drive. CITY
POSITION soon trailed, stayed well off the inside and was never a factor. BAM BAM CAM displayed early speed from outside, was three wide taking the
bend then gave way the final two furlongs.

W W RUSSIAN GOLD settled early, angled to the inside after the first eighth, picked up his pace three wide on the bend, fanned out widest for the stretch
run, was all out and got up in time under a well-judged ride. SIRCORRI rated in the second flight, took over second three wide on the turn, gained the lead
with a sixteenth left, was narrowly outfinished but easily best of the others. CHERNYAHOVSKIY failed to keep up from inside on the bend, gradually angled
out in the lane for a clear path and caught RED LABEL for third nearing the wire. RED LABEL quickly overcame a hesitant start to gain a clear lead, showed
the way along or just off the rail but wore down inside the final eighth. SCARLET CITY bumped a couple times with FAIRWAY LANE at the start, helped
prompt the pace from between horses on the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the lane, began to fade, altered out midstretch and finished evenly.
FAIRWAY LANE bumped twice with SCARLET CITY at the break, was prominent on the backstretch but faded two wide on the turn.

THACKER FROMM rated between horses on the backstretch, commenced his bid along the rail on the turn, quickly took over upper stretch, drew off and
was allowed to coast the final sixteenth. LELAND JOHN angled out near the half mile pole, took the lead three wide on the bend, was no match for
THACKER FROMM when set down for the drive, gradually drifted out inside the last furlong but lasted for second. ANUNKA was sent to vie for the early
lead, moved clear nearing the half mile pole, was challenged from both sides on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, fought for third and edged out
RA'DOM for the show. RA'DOM forwardly placed toward the outside, lost ground four wide taking the bend, battled for third in the stretch, altered in late
when his path was taken by LELAND JOHN and just missed for the show. HEART OF JOSEPH was a factor on the backstretch but faded from inside on the
turn. WAVE THE GOLD soon trailed, gradually angled out through the bend, came into the stretch from path four and had no late bid. GOVERNOR
ATTACK gave way from outside after two furlongs, distanced himself from the rest in the stretch and was walked off.

MON AMI FUZZIE settled well back, picked up his pace along the rail on the turn, fanned out behind THE LAST FACT into the lane, altered to the rail for a
clear path, was all out and took the lead just inside the seventy-yard marker. LAYTON THE DAY shared the early lead outside THE LAST FACT, moved
clear on the bend, drifted out some into the lane, opened up on the field but began to wear down deep stretch. EMPTY HOLSTER also settled well back in
the early going, commenced his bid two wide on the turn, lost ground fanning widest into the stretch, closed well and gained third late. A MERRY HEART in
the second flight on the backstretch, was three then four wide taking the bend, moved clear for second upper stretch then lacked the needed late kick. EL
RAYO in the second flight early, was forced to stay in path four on the turn, lost further ground into the lane and lacked a significant stretch bid. THE LAST
FACT contested the pace from inside, was steadied slightly as he tried to drift out while in tight quarters along the rail with two furlongs to go, floated out into
the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
MAMAS FIRE stalked the early speed from outside, took over two wide on the bend, was put to urging in the lane, challenged from outside the last
sixteenth, dug in and kept HIGHLY PERFECT at bay. HIGHLY PERFECT advanced two wide on the turn, fanned outside MAMAS FIRE into the stretch,
engaged that one deep stretch, did not have enough in the waning yards but was easily second best. RUN THE TABLE broke on top, was overtaken from
outside into the bend, flattened out the final furlong but was unchallenged for third. GOD GUNS N GUTS progressed from path three on the turn, fanned out
further into the lane and ran evenly to the wire. DANZA TAXI fractious in the gate, was taken out, examined by the veterinarian then reloaded, was still in the
assistant starter's hands when the gate opened, left well behind the others and only passed a few tired rivals upper stretch. FADE FROM BLACK moved to
the inside after two furlongs and had little to offer for the stretch run. RED ROIL pressed RUN THE TABLE briefly but gave way after two furlongs. There
was a stewards' inquiry into DANZA TAXI'S start. After their review, the stewards determined DANZA TAXI did not have a fair chance to break with the rest
of the field and declared DANZA TAXI a non-starter for pari-mutuel purposes only. A consolation daily double was paid.

Footnotes
BETHY vied for the early lead outside DOROTA, took the advantage from between horses on the bend, drifted out slightly upper stretch, lost the lead, came
again to edged ahead inside the final furlong, was brushed and crowded in the waning yards but kept MY MORNING GAL at bay. MY MORNING GAL
progressed between horses on the backstretch to vie for the lead three wide on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch, lugged in some with a sixteenth left,
brushed and leaned on BETHY approaching the wire and had to settle for second best. I LUV THIS BAR advanced from inside on the bend, came off the
rail some for a clear path entering the lane, moved clear for third, leveled off deep stretch but lasted for the show. WAR COLORS trailed from outside,
angled in some with two furlongs to go, came into the stretch from path three, gradually angled out for racing room and showed a willingness to run late.
MISS WINDY SLEW raced in contention from outside, lost ground four wide through the bend and flattened out the last furlong. DOROTA displayed early
speed inside rivals but gave way along the rail the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
CRANKSHAFT quickly overcame stumbling at the break to stalk the early speed from outside, moved clear for second from path two on the bend, drifted out
as he was roused leaving the quarter pole, came into the lane from path four, took the advantage midstretch, soon moved clear and gradually lugged in
under mostly hand urging. BEEASY hesitated at the break, progressed from path three on the turn, fanned out further entering the lane, moved out widest
upper stretch, closed well and caught ALPINE GHOST for second. ALPINE GHOST chased in midpack from between rivals, was two then three wide
through the bend, loomed a threat with a furlong to go but leveled off in the waning yards. LONESOME DREAM was away slowly, moved to the outside
early on, advanced two wide on the turn, angled outside CRANKSHAFT upper stretch and improved position late without threatening. PAPA'S LUCKY
SEVEN hesitated at the break as well then was steadied behind traffic, trailed from inside, gradually angled out taking the bend, came into the lane from
path four, moved out widest midstretch and passed tired ones. CINDY'S G MAN broke on top and was quickly clear of the others, was challenged from
outside upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. FASTNFURIOUS somewhat unruly in the gate, helped prompt the pace on the backstretch, began to
yield from inside after three furlongs, floated out some entering the stretch and steadily faded. READY MADE moved to the inside after two furlong and
steadily gave way.
