BEAU MISCHIEF dueled for the lead from along the inside, responded when headed by SECRET SAGA nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear
late. SECRET SAGA disputed the issue while racing three-wide, gained a slight lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled with the winner into the stretch but
wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. DESHAMBEAU was forwardly placed from the outset, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
MISTER MIDAS dueled for the lead from between horses and weakened during the drive. ICE TOWER was unhurried early, came three-wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. YOUNG LIFE LAURA was close up early racing along the inside and gave way after three furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

Footnotes
BLAZINGBELLABLU was reserved off the early early, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught SLACK TIDE nearing the eighth pole and proved
best in a stiff drive. SLACK TIDE dueled with DAFFODIL SWEET from along the outside, shook that one off entering the stretch, responded when
challenged by the winner but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. CAUSE SHE'S A LADY was allowed to settle in stride, came six-wide into the
stretch and finished well for the show in a steady effort. ZAZEN settled in stride early while between horses, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in
his mild rally. SILVERY ORB settled in the middle of the pack early, lacked room nearing the quarter pole, angled out five-wide entering and went evenly
late. YOU GO GIRL was prominently placed early, came five-wide into the stretch and weakened. DAFFODIL SWEET dueled for the lead from along the
inside to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ was unhurried early, moved forward along the
outside nearing the quarter pole, came eight-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL prompted the issue while racing three-wide
and held on well during the drive to earn the show in a game effort. ZESTFUL saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through entering the stretch,
angled out three-wide nearing the eighth pole and was gaining late. COASTAL KID came in at the start, then was allowed to settle, came four-wide into the
stretch and improved his position. ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE saved ground while racing in the middle of the field, found room entering the stretch and went
evenly late. SMILING GOODBYE forced the pace to the stretch while two-wide and weakened. MISSED THE BOAT was prominently placed while racing
between horses but lacked a rally. A MAN'S MAN hopped in the air at the start, then was pinched back shortly after that, raced four-wide on the turn and
failed to menace. PRAYER OF JABEZ came out at the start, was six-wide nearing the quarter pole and failed to be a factor. YOU'RE THE CAUSE dropped
back early, came seven-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. COASTAL JAZZ was forwardly placed while racing four-wide and gave way during the
drive.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC LEGEND was reserved off the early pace, rallied three-wide the final quarter, dueled with SUPER CLASSIC through the stretch and prevailed
narrowy. SUPER CLASSIC was allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the outside of the winner nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly to lose a
tough decision. MOONLIGHTNWINE settled in the middle of the pack while saving ground, lacked room nearing the quarter pole running up on rivals,
angled out for room and finished willingly. SUMMANUS vied for the lead with PREDICATION, shook that one off nearing the stretch and then weakened
late. VALIDATE dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. PREDICATION vied for the lead from along the inside to
the stretch and tired. NATION OF FAITH was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
