Footnotes
CARLOS PUNCH vied for the lead, claimed the rail advantage, was joined by another competitor and set the pace in a set, rated until the quarter pole,
battled with his company down the lane, matched strides, finally edged clear and held sway. Game effort. DOUBLE PRIORITY stalked the leaders from the
three path, was given the cue at the three eighths pole, hand ridden through the turn, was encouraged and kept on point through the stretch drive, slowly
but surely gained ground, did not have enough time or room to catch the winner but was second best today. MY HEAVY SON was off a bit slow, found his
stride and starting advancing before the half, improved position and angled out six wide at the three eighths pole, circled the field in the turn was in
contention by the quarter pole, was driven down the land in the five path passing rivals and was able to get up for show. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE vied for the
lead, settled next to the other front runner and led in as set, rated together until the three eighths pole, was given the cue and encouraged to pick it up
through the turn, did not make any advantage but stayed with the other front runner, battled down the stretch, gave way in the last sixteenth of a mile.
HEREWECOMETOGETYOU was off a tad bit slow, raved four wide down the back side, improved position through the turn, had no late kick. OSCAR
CHOICE raced two wide while saving ground on the inside, raced with another rival to his outside, had a clean trip but made no impact. SILKY'S DANCE
was pinched a bit at the start, raced three wide early, improved position and was in contention by the quarter pole, tried to close in on the field but to no
avial. HALF A BUCK rail, was never involved.

Footnotes
MY OCHO vied for the early lead, was briefly pressured by an outside foe, improved lead by a length, set the fractions to their liking and drew off un
contested for a nice win. BELLE ELENA raced in the four path while stalking the front runner, maintained that position through out, started to tire in the
stretch but was able to hod on for second place. JERSEY DOLL was two wide and racing in the middle of the field, launched a bid and shifted to the rail at
the three eighths pole, saved ground in the turn and closed up the stretch earning third place money. JENNYSBIGBABY was five wide and stalking from the
outside, improved position on the outside through the turn and the had no late kick. MALLY'S MONSOON was racing three wide in the middle of the field,
advanced and within striking distance then gave way in the stretch. RONA VISION raced off of the pace in the three path, maintained position and made no
impact. MISS CHARGE IT was off slow, raced on the rail, trailed and passed tired rivals late. MONTASTICAL showed little. JANIS was forwardly placed
early, then faded after the half mile marker.

Footnotes
ROYAL O'HAIGAIN was well off of the pace early, closed on the outside, was driven down the stretch and kept on point under strong urging and was able to
take the win. ATOMIC ROSE vied for the lead, raced in the three path, was in between horses and setting the pace through the turn was challenged and
was second best. IRONIT stalked the leaders in the five path, inched up and was forwardly placed, then gave way late. MS CARROLL COUNTY was off a
step slow, trailed the field, closed with a good turn of foot and improved position. LIGHTNING HART vied for the lead, raced on the rail while setting the
early pace, had company setting the pace into the stretch and stopped. RUMPUS staked the front runners five wide, advanced at the half but had no finish.
TWIRLING TIGRESS trailed through out. SENSEOFEXCELLENCE showed little.
