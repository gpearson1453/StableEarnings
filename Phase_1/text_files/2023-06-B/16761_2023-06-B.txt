Footnotes
I LUCKED OUT set a pressured pace, was collared into the stretch, battled back and gamely held off challenges. RUN FOR KARL settled off the pace, bid
wide into the stretch, loomed a threat and just missed. PRACTICALLYMINE stalked the pacesetters three wide, led briefly in midstretch and finished
willingly. SYNCOPATED dropped back early, moved very wide into the stretch rallying. BOINTHEBACK lacked speed and continued well while no factor.
TAKEMETOTHEMOON saved ground off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX lagged far behind and narrowed the gap without
menacing. JEWELS IN THE BAY very fractious loading, prompted the pace to the final turn and faded. IT'S A PITY moved closer wide on the final turn then
faltered. CARRICKMACROSS dropped far behind and was never in contention. PRINCIPE trailed long way and was always outrun. SEA CRUISE flashed
speed outside for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
RIDIN WITH BIDEN urged early, forced the pace outside, took over at the quarter pole and rallied clear through the stretch while kept to his task. FAR MO
POWER saved ground behind the dueling leaders, bumped with rival near the top of the stretch and finished willingly. MARKET MAVEN ducked out at the
break, settled outside, bumped with rival near the top of the stretch and was just up for the show. IRISH CORK set a pressured pace inside to the stretch
and continued gamely. SHOOGER RAY TOO dropped back three wide and lacked a rally. BIRD KING steadied along between rivals on the first turn then
had no further response. PRINCE OF RAIN trailed far behind and was never in contention. ELOQUIST dropped back early, chased inside and gave way
readily.

clear. DECIDING VOTE rated close up along the rail, bid on the final turn then finished gamely for second. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) stalked the pace three
wide, rallied to the front at the top of the stretch and weakened. TIC TIC TIC BOOM was eased back into the first turn, moved wide into the lane and closed
well. OUT OF SORTS hustled from the outset to set the pace to the final turn and came up empty. NURTURING prompted the pace outside, led briefly into
the final turn and faltered. ONE MORE KELLY settled between rivals within range and faded.

DETECTIVE SCARN prompted the pace three wide, pulled clear on the turn then widened through the stretch driving. BIG BOYS ANSWER lunged at the
start, steadied along and was taken up sharply near the half, recovered, swung wide and rallied. ROYAL MOVER raced just off the pace in the two path
then flattened out. BLUEY dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. NORLANDER forced the pace outside and faltered in the stretch.
UNION PARK lagged far behind then showed some late energy. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN raced very wide and weakened steadily. VENTILATOR hustled to
the front inside, vied through the turn and gave way. SKYHOOK broke sluggishly, steadied inside near the three eighths pole and lacked a response.
SPECIAL PERMIT ducked out at the start, chased wide and stopped.
