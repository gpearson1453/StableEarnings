IRISH KITTEN raced outside, was never far off the pace, was roused on the turn, closed steadily and inched away late to prove best.
THTWASTHENTHISISNW was sent to the front to set the pace, responded when challenged to duel for the lead, went willingly to the wire and yielded late.
MY BOY COLTON was hustled along to press the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, vied to mid stretch, was unable to sustain a bid and held safely
for show. RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE raced mid pack, showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. HURRICANE ANDREW bumped at the start,
pressed the pace while boxed in along the rail to the backstretch, backed up, was through early and stopped. GOD GIVEN RIGHTS bumped at the start,
was through after a half and not urged through the stretch.

Footnotes
MO STYLISH was a bit crowded at the start, hustled along to set a pressured pace, drew clear on the turn and extended the lead under mild urging. SUZY
Q THE QUEEN raced close to the pace, bid three across on the turn, failed to rally and was no match for the winner. JIMMYDABOOK pressed the pace, fell
back on the turn, finished evenly and held for show. RUBY DOOBY DOO was never far back, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only. ONE
PAIR OF HANDS bobbled at the start while away well, stalked the pace along the inside, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back. SHELLEY'S
SONG saved ground, was through early and not urged in the stretch. HARPER'S DO broke slowly, fell far back, raced wide and was not urged. PER THE
DELAWARE THOROUGHBRED RACING COMMISSION, HARPERS DO HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
