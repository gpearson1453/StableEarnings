Footnotes
FOXY JUNIOR stalked the pace from the inside, checked hard when the pacesetter went bad on the turn, then got back into stride and came four wide into
the lane, closed well to get up in time, driving. SHUTUP AND HANG ON was well rated early, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the
quarter pole, gained a short lead leaving the furlong marker and was clear by the sixteenth marker but was caught late to just miss. CHARM ALARM stalked
the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn and dueled for command by the quarter pole on the inside, then faded the final furlong and bested the
rest. SPECTACULLARI was reserved early, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. PHANCY PHILLY was four wide into the first turn, tracked the
early pace from the outside and tired. GREAT BARONESS set the pace on the inside and went bad on the turn and was pulled up, vanned off.

ON THE SHORTLIST vied for the lead on the outside and made a two wide bid on the turn to dispose of JAYLEE leaving the turn, but then was confronted
by PRIZE DEBATE by the furlong marker, but slowly edged away from that rival and kept SATISFIED safe late to prove best under mild crop urging.
SATISFIED was settled two wide early, inside on the far turn, came two wide into the lane and then finished well on the inside. PRIZE DEBATE tracked the
pace from the inside early, made a three wide bid off the turn and loomed boldly but flattened out, bested rest. BABKA was rated from between rivals but
weakened. FIRST SPIRIT GIRL was settled back early, three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and passed the tiring rivals. JAYLEE vied for the lead
on the inside and weakened. SO STEADY lacked a rally. WIN FOR LAILA was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. DON DIVA was four wide
into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and tired. RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH was reserved early, four wide on the turn and was not a threat.

was up for the place award while no match to the winner. BULLET BREEZE chased the pace four wide and came five wide into the lane but lacked the
needed rally, got show award. ZEALOUS LEGACY set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. QUINCY
ADAMS was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and lacked a rally. SUNSHINE HARRY was fractious in the gate, then lost iron at the start and trailed.
