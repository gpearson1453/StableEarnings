Footnotes
THREE RIVERS brushed the near side stall at the start before taking over the lane of rival to her inside who had a troubled beginning, showed the way early
on from the two path before being displaced from the front by JUSTTHEFACTSJACK nine-sixteenths from home, tucked inside and advanced on that rival
prompting along the rail through the turn before taking narrow advantage spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and
edged clear under a drive to prevail. RISK FREE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to just get up for the place honors. JUSTTHEFACTSJACK brushed the off side stall at the start, raced three wide in
aim early on before advancing to split foes taking command at the nine-sixteenths, tucked to the two path through the turn facing pressure to the inside by
the eventual winner, got headed spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish but was nailed for the place honors in
the final jump. WICKSIEPIXIE coaxed from the gate, strode green early on three wide growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired. AVALANCHE IS COMIN tossed her head just as the
latch was sprung and got away last conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, came under coaxing five paths off the inside and rushed
up to be with the majority of the field into the turn, tucked three wide at the half mile pole before tucking to the two path placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
NO SHOW SAMMY JO (GB) was reserved near the middle of the field on the outside, moved closer while three then four wide on the turn, rallied to the lead
in upper stretch then kicked clear outside the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. BEST PERFORMER was last to commence, raced
towards the rear under restraint, moved from the two path to the four path while let out on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and finished
willingly for the place. MACHIAVELLIQUE showed the way early while in hand, lost the lead near the three-quarter pole then stalked on the outside, vied in
the two path on the turn, was asked late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but just
held the show. RIVER TAY (IRE) was rated under a snug hold, drafted two to three wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole then battled
with foes under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and also weakened then just missed the show. NO DELI (IRE) broke near the rear of the field,
was reserved on the outside towards the back, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved to just miss the
superfecta. FIZZY settled in the early going, steadied while taken in hand behind horses inside the seven-eighths, was reserved towards the rear, saved
ground while put to coaxing on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide near the quarter-pole then was placed under light urging into
upper stretch, remained under mild urging while behind foes until near the sixteenth-pole then was removed from cover, was given one token pop of a
right-handed crop late and failed to threaten then galloped out in front with interest. LA MAZEL was hustled from the gate, steadied inside the seven-eighths,
settled near the middle of the field, saved ground while roused on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then tipped further out and lacked the needed
response. IDLE CHATTER pulled keenly on the bit under stout restraint, dropped in early on the backstretch, was rated off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and came up empty. JUST A SPLASH (IRE) broke out then was corrected by the rider, moved forward while in
hand, went to the front with six furlongs to run, showed the way on the inside of a rival, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage in upper stretch and gave way. EVITA dropped back early then paused in traffic near the seven-eighths, was reserved towards the back, traveled
around the turn in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
PRINCE JAMES was well placed down the backstretch, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, ranged up on the wayward winner in the two path early on
the turn, inherited the lead with three furlongs to run, moved clear passing the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage into upper stretch, responded well in
the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. WINNING DRIVE settled at the rear on the outside, was urged while gaining four wide on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place. THREE TWO ZONE settled on the outside, moved closer late on the
backstretch, made a bid in the three to four path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend, chased into the stretch and weakened while just able to get the
show. RISK PROFILE was taken up some while shut-off at the start, settled towards the back, was roused three wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response then just missed the show. PRINTRACK broke out while away very fast, quickly opened up a sizable advantage while lugging out some, began to
lug out more late on the backstretch, gave up the advantage while bearing out from the five path to the ten path on the turn, dropped to the rear before the
five-sixteenths, floated about fifteen wide into the stretch under a vigorous left-rein grip, was put to urging after straightening for the drive, pursued foes for
the minor awards to the finish and just missed the show while near the outside of the track.

Footnotes
DISARMED lightly coaxed along showing the way just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn under some pressure from MY SEA COTTAGE, came
under urging at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat clinging to command and stubbornly fended off the challenge
to prevail on the wire. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) broke in at the start taking over the lane of DON'T LET ME DOWN, prompted the pace three then two wide,
got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive on near even terms inside the eighth pole but couldn't go by and was
ultimately rebuffed at the end. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and missed at the finish closing in late. KING JAMES chased along the inside, got let out taking the inside route into upper
stretch, ran on to secure the last major share. KING MOONRACER chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five
wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. BUCKORTWO chased three then two wide, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. RELATE broke a beat slow, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch, offered no rally. DON'T LET ME DOWN broke a half a beat slow and lost his to MY SEA COTTAGE, chased along the inside under a ride
from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. JESTER'S SONG chased just off the inside until tucked inside through
the turn, got let out swinging just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened.

LIGURIA charged the front of the gate just before the latch was sprung and came away clearly in front, dropped back then settled off the pace, fell to the
rear while patiently handled on the turn, was roused while swinging seven wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to make a bid inside the furlong marker,
took the lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under good handling. TAX IMPLICATIONS (GB) settled at the rear, was roused three wide on the turn,
rallied six wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker, led to the sixteenth-pole then was headed by the winner and
missed while clear for the place. SOVIET EXCESS brushed with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside while in hand, was given her cue in the
three path on the turn, gained four wide into the stretch, took the lead near the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up outside the furlong
marker and weakened but just held the show. CECILE brushed with a foe leaving the gate, was hard held while rank between foes onto the backstretch,
raced under tight restraint towards the back, traveled three wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, made a bid between foes outside the furlong
marker but also weakened then just missed the show. BREATH AWAY (GB) bumped solidly with an opponent at the start, was rank under steadying
restraint onto and early on the backstretch then reserved off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, waited briefly coming to the quarter-pole then was
asked three wide into the stretch, raced behind foes under a solid hand-ride to the furlong marker then angled out and lacked the needed response. IM
JUST KIDDIN was taken under a tight hold early, became very rank under steadying restraint onto and early on the backstretch, tracked the pace under a
tight hold, was let out in the two path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and tired. VIOLET GIBSON (IRE) settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, was asked late on that bend, chased behind horses in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated. KERRY
bumped solidly with a rival at the start, moved up in hand to take the lead then went clear, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and
gave way.

Footnotes
TRUCULENT chased just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn remaining patiently handled, cut the corner into upper stretch and was roused
straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking narrow command nearing the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely to fend off
a pair of rivals to the finish. HIGHER QUALITY grew fractious, the rider dismounting to be assisted by pony when coming onto the track and got loose, ran
off during the post parade jogging along for three furlongs into the clubhouse turn before being apprehended and returned by outrider, broke awkward at the
start pulling on the bit, then gave chase five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, seized narrow command at the three-sixteenths, dug in between foes getting collared nearing the
sixteenth marker and fought on gamely between rivals to the finish. COOL QUARTET chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping to the
two path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and tipped out to be four wide midway on the turn, continued four wide into upper
stretch, rallied outside a trio and then a pair battling on to the finish but was ultimately staved off while clear for the show honors. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS
chased four then three wide until tucked to the two path when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
improved position to secure the last major share. JALEN JOURNEY stumbled at the start, showed the way in hand four paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat
to the outside, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to run and weakened to the finish. BLAKE B. chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
PIONEERING SPIRIT was taken back early then angled in, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, moved closer with five furlongs
to run, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch then moved further out while brushing with a foe, bumped with
another foe while rallying inside the three-sixteenths, closed fast to get the lead coming to the sixteenth-pole then powered away under good handling.
ROYAL SPIRIT moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went three then four wide on the far turn, rallied to make a
bid into upper stretch, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to get the place. FIGHTER IN
THE WIN was taken under a tight hold early, dropped in entering the first turn, reached the inside shortly thereafter, was rated off the pace, raced inside to
the two path on the final turn, was asked three wide into the stretch, came out some and bumped with the winner inside the three-sixteenths, pursued the
leader into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage for the show. SO HIGH (GB) was taken under a snug hold early, went three then two wide on
the first turn, tracked the pace under tight restraint, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path on the far turn, battled under a drive into the
final furlong and weakened then just lost the show. HOLD THE SALSA was taken up after the start, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved at the
rear on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, came under urging while four then five wide on the far turn, brushed with an opponent while in
good striking range in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MO Z was reluctant to load, angled in while going to the front, showed the way on the
inside, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. BASSO went two then three wide on the first turn, prompted
the pace on the outside, took a short lead on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
LINARITE angled in while settling off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed
strongly to get up late. DANCE WITH ME BABE showed speed then pressed the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, took a short lead at the
quarter-pole, kicked clear while put to a drive in upper stretch, led into the final seventy yards but was caught while clear for the place. MO
DAMORNINGGROUCH showed speed then was taken back off the pace under a tight hold, went around the turn in the two path, was asked for her best in
upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. PAUCILOQUENT settled off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the
turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. APRIL FIRST
angled in early, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. LADY BANKER broke a step slow, settled well back in the field,
went three then two wide on the turn and failed to rally. MARY KATHERINE was hustled from the gate then settled on the outside, went three then four wide
on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, moved out in the final furlong and failed to respond. PUREST PERFORMANCE broke out then was corrected by
the rider, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, was taken in hand while off
heels outside the furlong marker and had nothing left. RENT CONTROL moved up to take the lead with five furlongs to run, vied in the two path on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch, drifted out some inside the three-sixteenths and gave way. HAYFLATION was off slow and spotted the front several
lengths, dropped well behind, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. MAXING THE BANK broke a step slow, angled in early, was taken in hand while
off heels at the nine-sixteenths, raced inside to the two path on the turn and showed little.
