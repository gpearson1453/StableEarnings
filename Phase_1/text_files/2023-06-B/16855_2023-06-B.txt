Footnotes
LEAVE IT TO KITTEN unhurried while near the inside through the far turn, came into the lane from three path, bid three wide near the eighth pole, caught
the leader near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. EVIL EYE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane, gained the lead outside the
eighth pole then yielded to the winner in the last seventy yards. MAJOR SPARKS was well back and trailed into the lane, came into the lane from the four
path and was finishing willingly to be up for the minor share. LOADEMUPJUSTICE was unhurried while off the inside, was asked for more in mid-turn, came
into the lane from the three or four path then found good energy late while closing in and just missed the show spot. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) saved ground into
the lane then moved up while lacking a closing kick. CLEARING WAIVERS set the pace while along the inside while dueling for the lead then gave way after
entering the lane. PATRIOT DRIVE chased the pace along the inside into the lane, was in the two path with an eighth to go then lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
PAYNTER'S CANVAS was quickly over to lead inside and held sway under steady urging. SARGENT HULKA broke inside, stalked inside, angled three
wide at the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. HITCHPIN stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole but couldn't last. SECRETO DE AMORE
was unrushed, bid six wide at the quarter pole and gained the fourth spot. QUALITY DANCER raced evenly between rivals. SEMINOLE AUSTIN was
bumped at the start, stalked the early pace inside, bid at the quarter pole inside but faltered down the lane. BIG STORMY saved ground, angled four wide at
the three-eighths pole, then couldn't close late. BAGGINSHIRE and TAP TAP COMIN THRU were not factors. SILENT TOWN stalked the pace outside of
the winner, then gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
K J'S LEGACY chased the pace from the two path into the turn, bid two wide in mid-turn, cleared straightening in the lane then widened through the final
eighth. ACTION SEEKER stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, was confidently ridden through late turn, bid into the lane then could not
gain on the winner while flattening out late. A LOT LIKE LUTE was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and moved up while not a threat.
DOMHNALL chased the pace from the four path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path and weakened. MAJESTIC MR. JONES was in the two
or three path throughout and never factored. GRAY MIKE never was a factor while near the rail. OTIS ON THE CAPE hustled off the lead before the first
call, continued clear to the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) chased the pace from the two path through the turn, took aim on the leader entering the lane then reeled that one in at the wire.
STONE SILENT set the pace on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane, looked to be a winner with an eighth left then was all out late and denied
while clearly second best. STELLA TERESA was in the three path throughout and was inching up late. CAUMSETT was in the four path through the turn,
came into the lane while three wide, drifted in through the final eighth and was gaining. DESIGNED BY KITTEN was four wide and between rivals through
the turn, continued in the four or five path through the lane and was gaining from mid-track. FOOLISH was brushed at the start, raced three wide and
between rivals through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, was in the six path inside the eighth pole and never was a serious menace. MORNIN'
BOSS was near the rail through the turn and lacked a finishing bid. GIFT WRAPPED saved ground through the turn and into the lane and lacked a finishing
kick. LIL EVIE never a factor while in the three path. QUILTER was five wide through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and made no impact.
OSIRIA chased the pace from the two path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

ROYAL TO BE dueled outside of a rival, bid on the turn, drew off in the stretch and then lasted under steady handling. NIGHTTIME JUSTICE stalked the
pace in the three path, bid at the eighth pole and was getting to the winner. SMOOTH JUSTICE was off awkwardly, rallied six wide at the quarter pole and
closed belatedly. MI ESTRELLA stalked the pace in the four path, then gave way in the stretch. BETCHA dueled inside to the turn and gave way.
SENTIMENTALJOURNEY saved ground. EXPRESS LADY raced in the four path and faded in the stretch. LASHES stalked the pace in the five path before
fading through the stretch.

Footnotes
WHOSFORJUSTICE made the lead at once, raced on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane then widened when asked. CHA CHA LARRY chased
the winner from the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path, was asked for more when straightening, could not gain
on the top one but stayed on to be clear for the place spot. STARLITE RUN chased the pace from the two path through the turn, was in the four path for the
drive and never threatened while best of the rest. GOLDEN RAPPER saved ground through the turn and into the lane and lost ground through the final
eighth. SUNSIGN bumped at the start and forced in a bit, raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane and never was a factor. AMELIA'S
MACHO never a menace while in the three path through the turn. SUNDAY TRYST step slow start, raced along the inside through the turn, came into the
lane from the four path and never factored. PAIGE PERFECT was in the three path through the turn when behind mid-pack then tired through the stretch.
