DALLAS ALICE broke well and showed speed between rivals before ceding command, stalked two wide into the turn, remained in the two path to the
stretch, took over in upper stretch, cleared at the furlong pole and was kept to task to the wire. ROMAN EMPRESS had to pause behind a rival in traffic
early, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane, put in late run and gained the place. PARCO dueled for the lead outside
rivals early then cleared up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside on the turn, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to third. MOONLITE
IN HEAVEN vied for command early inside rivals then chased PARCO up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide into the lane and
flattened out. STORM D'ORO bobbled a bit leaving the gate, chased three deep into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, tired in the drive and eased in
the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
PRINCESS MAGIC took control early, led two then three wide around the turn, drifted in at the three-sixteenths pole while opening up and was ridden out in
deep stretch. ASSUREDLY chased from outside early, rounded the bend four wide, finished willingly but had to settle for second best. ARTEMIS STAR
fractious in the gate, hustled early and pressed the pace between rivals, could not keep up with the leader on the turn, angled over to the inside and
flattened in the stretch run. MIDNIGHT SUSI dropped back early, saved ground then angled out into the stretch and was along for the show. MENSA ON
TAP raced up close three deep to the turn, chased the winner three wide into the lane and weakened. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ stumbled badly and lost the
rider at the start, was quickly caught by the outrider and walked off.

Footnotes
BIG SWEDE hit the gate and got bumped in the beginning, chased three wide off the pace into the turn, four wide turning for home, moved out further in the
lane, closed steadily through the drive and got up in the closing moments. JAM SESSION chased outside a rival then three wide on the turn, bumped with
inner foe at the quarter pole, reached the front midstretch, held a short lead into the final sixteenth and was caught in the final strides. CURLY ESA tracked
along the inside into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane, bid five deep in the drive, fought outside JAM SESSION in the furlong grounds
and could not get by. SPIRITIST got bumped into inner rival at the start, lagged behind wide up the backstretch, navigated the turn four then five wide,
closed widest in the lane and gained a minor award. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME dueled for command from inside, fought to midstretch and flattened.
STORMY SAMURAI bumped inner rival at the start, went up to duel from outside, had the rider lose his whip at the quarter pole and weakened. SQUARE
CAT chased two wide through the turn, bumped outer rival at the quarter pole and weakened. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE SIXTH RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
WICKLINE went to take control from WILL BE, set the pace with rivals on both sides early, led two wide around the bend and three wide into the lane,
cleared WILL BE in upper stretch and inched away under a drive. WILL BE away quickly from inside, pressured WICKLINE from inside, lost touch with that
rival in upper stretch but remained close into the final furlong, faltered a bit late but proved second best. CENTRAL DISPATCH pressed three deep up the
backstretch, lost touch with WICKLINE around the bend, chased four wide into the drive, drifted out and in through the lane and kept on for a clear third.
STAVROS stalked the leaders from outside, driven four to five wide into the stretch and weakened. CONFUCIUS lacked early speed, went two then three
wide around the bend, shifted in upper stretch and failed to menace. BENELLI traveled towards the rear in the early going, saved ground around the bend
and failed to make an impact. LEVON broke a bit slow, chased off the pace two wide through the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
REDLINE got shuffled between rivals prior to the first turn then tracked three deep, remained outside rivals into the far turn, loomed five wide into the lane,
challenged FINNEUS from outside, dueled through the final furlong and drew clear in the end. FINNEUS was a bit rank chasing three wide to the outside of
the leader around the first turn, remained closest in the middle stages, challenged around the far turn, drifted out leaving the bend while taking over, put
away SHORTMAN at the top of the lane but was soon engaged by REDLINE, dueled with that rival into the final furlong and got outkicked in deep stretch.
