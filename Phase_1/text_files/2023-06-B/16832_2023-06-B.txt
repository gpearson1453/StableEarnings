Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO was hustled away from the gate and established the early advantage, set a decent pace into the turn while off of the rail, was pressed to
the quarter marker by MR. FIGHTER, turned away that rival into upper stretch, kept to task under steady urging to the final sixteenth and held safely in a
drive to prevail. MR. FIGHTER raced close to the decent early pace, pressed COLONEL VARGO along the bend while outside of that rival, was turned
away into upper stretch and lost ground to COLONEL VARGO nearing the furlong marker, was held at bay by the winner into deep stretch and was clear of
the rest for second. LIVERMORE HEAT chased the decent early pace, raced two deep to the quarter marker, made a mild advance along the rail heading to
the furlong pole, lacked a final kick in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. BIG DIFFERENCE lacked early speed, raced outside of a rival along
the bend, was steered three wide for the drive and did not offer a late rally. EXTRA INNINGS bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, chased the
decent pace from the inside, tipped two wide for the drive, lacked a response in the stretch run and tired.

Footnotes
G'S LAST CHANCE tracked the early leaders while outside of rivals, advanced along the bend and came within aim nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly
to mid-stretch, responded to steady urging and rallied in the final sixteenth, drew to even terms with WEE BEASTIE in the final yards and won the nod on
the wire. WEE BEASTIE contested the early pace with WAKES AND WEDDINGS, assumed command and set the pace while off of the rail along the turn,
extended the lead into upper stretch, kept to task to the sixteenth-marker, felt late pressure from G'S LAST CHANCE while all out in deep stretch and was
nailed on the line for the win, while holding for second. DARK MYSTERY bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be prominent in the
early running, pressed the pace while between runners into the turn, lost position heading to the quarter marker, slipped to the inside and re-rallied into
upper stretch, could not reel in the top two in the final yards and held clearly in a good effort for third. COBRE was a bit slow into early stride, chased outside
of a rival along the turn, came two wide into the drive and mounted a mild late rally while unable to impact the leaders. WAKES AND WEDDINGS broke
alertly and contested the pace into the turn, raced outside of the pacesetter while in the three path along the bend, could not keep pace into the stretch and
gave way. BOLD NEW TRICKS was shuffled back at the start and was away slowly, chased from the rear into the turn, saved ground to the top of the
stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
DADDY'SDARLINGBOY took back off of the moderate early pace, tracked outside of rivals along the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, responded to
steady urging inside of the furlong pole, reeled in the runner-up inside of the sixteenth-marker and edged away to prevail in the rider's first career win. VIVA
LEON JODIDO engaged with RIVER'S BENCHMARK in the early going and pressed the moderate pace into the turn, kept close attendance to that rival
through the bend, took command in upper stretch, was kept to firm urging while leading approaching the sixteenth-pole, could not hold off the winner in the
final stages and held safely in the end for second. ONE BIG SMILE was rushed up leaving the break and raced close to the pace while outside of the
leading pair, pressed the decent pace while three deep nearing the quarter marker, lost ground into upper stretch, lacked the needed response in deep
stretch and was outkicked, while holding clearly for third. RIVER'S BENCHMARK contested the early pace with VIVA LEON JODIDO, set moderate
fractions while pressured along the bend, lost the lead to VIVA LEON JODIDO into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened in deep
stretch. ONE LITTLE INDIAN settled off of the early pace while outside of a rival, raced two wide into the stretch and did not threaten. NOTCH settled off of
the early leaders while saving ground, was outrun along the turn and did not factor.

LUCY TREASURE broke alertly and was hustled to the early lead, set a decent pace into the turn, rated nicely along the turn and drew to a clear lead along
the bend, extended the lead into upper stretch, was kept to task in the final furlong and remained clear to the wire. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE was forwardly
placed in the early running, chased LUCY TREASURE from a two wide path along the turn, could not make headway on the winner in the drive and held
well in the end to be second best. RIGHTEOUSLY stalked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced four deep along the turn, chased into the
stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and was outkicked, while just holding for third. GARDEES WORLD chased the decent early pace,
saved ground to the top of the stretch, lacked a late rally in the drive and just missed for third. O'NEILL'S LEGACY raced close to the decent early pace,
chased three deep along the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened. SPUN BEAUTIFUL was crowded leaving the start and was off a step
slowly, chased from the two path along the turn and did not threaten. LADY IN A HURRY broke through the gate prior to the start, was slow into stride
leaving the break, trailed into the turn and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
TRINIDAD was forwardly placed early on, prompted OH GREAT through moderate early fractions while outside of that rival, lost ground to OH GREAT
along the second turn, re-rallied into upper stretch, responded to steady urging and drew to even terms with OH GREAT inside of the furlong marker,
pushed past the stubborn runner-up in deep stretch and kept to task in the final yards to prove best. OH GREAT (IRE) broke alertly and assumed command
in the early running, was well handled through moderate fractions along the backstretch run, shook free from the prompting TRINIDAD heading to the
quarter marker, was confronted by TRINIDAD in upper stretch, met the bid of that rival to the sixteenth-marker, grudgingly gave way in deep stretch and
bested the rest. EL JOY was allowed to settle, tracked the moderate fractions while inside of a rival along the backstretch run, came in tight along the far
turn and waited for racing room approaching the top of the stretch, slipped to the inside in upper stretch, was not able to impact the top two in the final
furlong but was gaining in deep stretch and outfinished DRUIDIC to secure third. DRUIDIC settled just off of the early pace, tracked the moderate pace while
inside of rivals along the backstretch run, lost ground while two then three wide along the far turn, chased the leaders to mid-stretch, could not muster a final
response and was outkicked, while and just missing for third. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN broke out at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled outside of rivals
into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run, chased three then four wide along the second turn, was outrun into the stretch and lacked a late
response. HOT JOURNEY tracked the early pace from the inside, advanced along the backstretch run, lost position while saving ground on the far turn,
could not keep pace into the drive and tired in the final stages.

BUSKER ALLIE settled off of the moderate early pace, was unhurried through the backstretch run while not far back, gained ground two wide on the far
turn, came in a bit tight in upper stretch and angled four wide for the drive, rallied under steady urging at mid-stretch, overtook COUNCILWOMAN JILLY at
the sixteenth-marker and drove clear in the final stages. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY stalked the early pace into the first turn, raced three wide into the
backstretch run, moved up while between runners approaching the half-mile pole, was coaxed along two then three wide along the far turn, was asked for
run in upper stretch and took command heading to the furlong marker, was confronted by BUSKER ALLIE heading to the sixteenth-marker, could not hold
off the winner in the final stages and was clear in the end for second. FINNLEY'S KITTEN raced close to the early pace and saved ground into the
backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace while inside of runners heading to the far turn, raced within aim to the quarter pole, vied for the lead in upper
stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong, weakened in the final sixteenth and held safely for third. HERSABIGGIRL stalked the
moderate pace from the inside, raced within aim along the backstretch run and saved ground into the second turn, angled four wide into upper stretch, did
not offer a rally in the final stages and was outfinished for third. FEELING FLUSH was prominent leaving the break and was sent to establish the early pace,
set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the drive. KOKO'S
MOM saved ground early on while unhurried, settled along the backstretch run, trailed into the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and made a mild gain at
the furlong pole, could not sustain that bid into deep stretch and did not threaten. LYINATTHEBAR was shuffled back at the start and was off slowly, settled
outside of rivals into the backstretch run, raced three wide along the far turn and did not offer a response in the drive. SWEET LAYLA RAE was forwardly
placed into the first turn, stalked the pace while four wide into the backstretch run, improved position approaching the half-mile pole, raced three wide along
the far turn while within aim, could not keep pace into the drive and gave way in the stretch.

MO TOWN GAL broke in a tangle, veered outward bumping MORO FIRST CLASS in the first stride, recovered nicely and allowed to settle in the early
stages, was content to track the early leaders in hand, drew to even terms without being asked while racing three or four wide before the turn, bid for the
lead near the quarter pole while still three wide, quickly opened up in the stretch and was hand urged to the finish as much the best. MY YVONNE broke
sharply and went straight to the front, was joined after a quarter mile by STAN'S STARLET to the inside but held a slight lead to the turn, disposed of that
rival near the five-sixteenths pole then was challenged to the outside by MO TOWN GAL, was unable to match strides with the latter in the stretch but easily
held second. MORO FIRST CLASS stumbled badly at the start at the start then was bumped by MO TOWN GAL, fell far behind early then chased the field
to the stretch, outfinished one for a minor award. STAN'S STARLET broke a step slow then rushed up the rail to vie for the early lead with MY YVONNE,
started to lose ground through the turn then tired badly in the stretch.
