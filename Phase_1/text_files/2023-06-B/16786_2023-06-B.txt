STRIKE ONE angled in from the six to the two path passing the five furlong marker, set a pressured pace into the stretch then widened the balance of the
trip to win going away under a strong hand ride. BAILEY ROAD pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match while well clear for
second. AFLEET O ME was in tight between rivals causing his rider to check soon after the five eighths pole as the winner angled in then went evenly.
OXBOW'S RIDE was in tight along the rail causing his rider to check just past the five eighths pole then failed to menace. KETTLE KING inched closer two
wide on the turn then came up empty. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF OXBOW'S RIDE LODGED A CLAIM OF
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
STRIKE ONE AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

MS. THE LAW broke in full stride to set all the pace under pressure two wide and prevailed under strong handling. DATTTSAFANCYFOX never far back,
saved ground into the stretch, angled out to the three path late and finished second best. TYRONA bore in badly causing a chain reaction of bumping to her
inside then closed some ground late outside. ALWAYS MISCHIEVOUS was bumped hard at the start, battled with the winner along the inside until mid
stretch then was outfinished. CANDYMONIUM was bumped at the start and failed to menace. MY DANCING QUEEN was no threat. JACK'S YACHT
QUEEN also bumped hard at the star and forced inward into rivals then failed to reach contention. CONTESSINA moved up along the inside through the
turn then came up empty. LADY GIULIANA had brief speed. BELLAVALENCIA was through early. MISS EASY was always outrun.

SUGAR LOVES IT was fractious in the gate, stalked the early pace three wide, responded readily when set down to make the lead two wide nearing the
furlong marker and finished full of run under mild right handed urging to win as much the best. COUNTRY STYLE bumped at the start, sprinted clear, set the
pace along the inside until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. ONE MORE TANGO was fractious in the gate, had good early speed along the
inside, shifted out on the turn then went evenly. MERE BAG OF SHELLS well placed, failed to respond. JUPITER ECLIPSE bumped at the start and failed
to menace. DEE'S KY WILDCAT was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start and was never involved. ANGEL'S DESTINY also fractious in the gate, was
