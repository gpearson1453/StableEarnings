Footnotes
SIMPLY STATED vied for the early lead in between rivals, then dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn and drew off
smartly in the lane to prove much the best under right handed crop urging. ARROGANTE chased the early pace in between rivals, checked nearing the
three eighths marker, dropped back, came six wide into the lane and rallied well to gain the place award, no match to the winner. HELLO GRACIE was
allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn and came five wide into the lane, gained the place award in the furlong grounds but lost that spot
on the wire. UNION FOLLY chased the early pace in between rivals, steadied behind rivals nearing the five sixteenths, then came four wide into the drive
and angled out by the furlong marker and had no kick. STORMY SPELL chased the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, angled in leaving the
turn and had no kick. SCHNUER WILL chased the pace on the inside and weakened. COULD BE A COUGAR vied for the lead three wide, then dueled with
the winner to her outside and weakened. BOUND BY TRUTH was fractious in the gate, vied for the lead on the inside and faltered.

KLAYTON'S KANDY was sent to the lead to set the pace on the inside, drew clear on the turn, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best, driving.
SASSY MARTINI was rated along the inside, steadied by the five sixteenths, shifted out and made a four wide move off the turn, got place award. ALONG
THE WAY was settled early, then had a mild late rally on the inside to gain the show award. GIRL'S ON FIRE stalked the pace two wide, made a three wide
bid off the turn but faded in the drive, lost show award late. BECKON was well placed on the inside, came two wide off the turn and faded in the lane.
LAUGH IT OFF lacked a rally. ALWAJD failed to menace. Race was HAND TIMED due to sensor error.

MORGANS COVE was bumped at the start, then was close up by the half mile marker on the inside, rated on the turn on the inside, angled out leaving the
quarter pole, made a four wide bid off the turn and drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN stalked the early pace
and made a three wide bid on the turn, gained a short lead leaving the furlong marker but could not go with the winner, second best. HAPPY RIDE was
away alertly to be soon clear, then set a pressured pace on the inside by the half mile marker, then vied for command by the quarter pole on the inside and
faded the final furlong, bested rest. OUR GAILYNN B checked shortly after the start, settled back early, made a four wide move on the turn but flattened out
in the drive. SCOREBOARD LILY pressed the pace two wide, then vied for command between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.
FINISHING TOUCH chased the pace three wide and weakened. WARRIOR'S MISS chased the pace in between rivals and tired.

LUCKILY LEYTON set the early pace while well clear on the inside, then was sent down leaving the turn and roused by the furlong marker, held sway late
while drifting out through the lane. HARVEY SPECTER was off a step slow, chased the pace three wide, dropped to the inside and advanced on the turn,
tipped out three wide leaving the turn, finished willingly to be gaining late, second best. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT was bumped by the nine sixteenths on the
inside, saved ground on the turn and was along for the show award while besting the rest. ABBY'S SPIRIT passed the tiring rivals to get the last spot in the
superfecta. HE IS BAD was off slowly, then rushed four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but tired badly in the lane. WINNING CANDY failed to
menace. BARN SWALLOW chased the early pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
MRS BELL was well placed on the inside, eased out nearing the quarter pole, to launch a bid four wide off the turn, drew off in the lane to prove much the
best, ridden out. MADI'S TUNE pressed the pace three wide, made a two wide bid in hand on the turn, sent down leaving the turn but proved to be no match
for the winner, clearly second best. MISS MIA LIA was settled back early, swung wide leaving the turn and finished well to be along for the show award.
LITTLE MOOJI set the pace on the inside and then dueled for command by the quarter pole but weakened in the lane. TELL ME IM AWESOME was settled
early, saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. TENACIOUS TRAVELER chased the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn
but came up empty in the drive. LILYSGOTACLUE stalked the early pace three wide and weakened. LALLYBROCH was void of any speed and was not a
threat. SYNDEY GIRL was through early.
