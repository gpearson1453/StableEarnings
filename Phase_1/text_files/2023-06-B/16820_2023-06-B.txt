Footnotes
HASHTAG WINNER settled at the rear two wide, gained inside of foes leaving the three furlong pole, shifted out turning for home to take aim outside of the
leader and from the four path entering the lane, sustained progress to bid at the furlong grounds and edged ahead in the late stages.
SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI prompted the pace two wide, led at the three furlong pole before drawing clear soon after, spun for home in the three path as an
outer rival threatened in pursuit, met that foe's bid in midstretch and got bested in the final furlong. SHE'S GONE D'WILD laid off of the pace along the
inside, trailed around the far turn, then moved up between horses in midstretch. JUDY'S WAY shied from an outer rival while between horses early on,
tracked inside of a rival while a bit off of the rail, chased in the three to four around the far turn, but was outmoved by an inner rival turning for home and
yielded. APRIL'S NO FOOL set the pace inside of a prompting rival, but was headed by that one at the three furlong pole and weakened with five sixteenths
to go. SACRED BEAUTY broke outwardly, tracked in the three path, chased while floated to the four to five path around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SARATOGA SECRET prompted the pace two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led leaving that marker, dueled with a narrow advantage through upper
stretch and inched clear at the sixteenth pole. MYSTICAL CHANT set the pace inside of a pressing foe into the turn, got headed by that bidder passing the
five sixteenths pole, fought on through upper stretch, but yielded a sixteenth from home. CANDY LOVER laid off of the pace in the four path, then improved
position to gain show at the furlong grounds. RACONTEUSE chased the leading pair from the three to two path, then failed to keep pace nearing the lane
and lost show at the furlong pole. BOSSY BRUIN GAL broke in the air and was off multiple lengths slow, trailed early on, improved between horses at the
half mile pole, saved ground well off of the pace around the turn and tired. SOPHIE'S SHADOW lacked speed along the inside, but failed to keep pace with
the rest of the field entering the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
PATTERN BET tracked two wide and between horses into the turn, ranged up outside of the leading pair turning for home, struck the front entering the lane
and drove clear. MUSICMANSANDY stalked outside of the leader, but was outmoved by the eventual winner entering the lane, tipped inwardly and
sustained a chase thereafter to regain place nearing the final sixteenth. SUNDAY GRACE broke outwardly and hampered a foe at the start, chased along
the inside, but faltered entering the turn, retreated to trail the field at the five sixteenths pole, yet regained stride in upper stretch and came again to regain
show late. AWESOME LAWSON broke a step slow before taking contact from an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, shifted out to
embrace an outer rival's challenge entering the lane, but quickly proved no match for that one and gave way. JE SUIS RAPIDE laid off of the pace three
wide, inched closer outside of the eventual winner and in the four path around the turn, but failed to sustain a bid and flattened out entering the lane. BALI
DREAMIN tossed her head at the start before taking back from crowded quarters between a pair of foes soon after, trailed in the three path and made little
impact.

Footnotes
MISTER MMMMM stalked from the two to three path, bid outside of the top pair in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds and drove clear. DIAMOND
CITY prompted the pace two wide, bid at the quarter pole, vied between horses in upper stretch, but got outkicked by his outer counterpart at the furlong
grounds, gave way and lasted for place. GREGORY'S PRIDE bumped an outer rival before being put to crowded quarters among foes soon after the start,
raced at the rear two wide, then three wide and between horses in upper stretch, rallied among foes through the final furlong and missed reaching place.
WILLTORUN took contact from an inner rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four path, fanned to the five path in upper stretch and
moved up outside of a rallying rival in the late stages. RED HORNET saved ground at the rear, tipped off of the fence at the furlong grounds, moved
between horses at the sixteenth pole, but encountered brief traffic soon after. AGENT PETER GRAVES set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a
pair of outer bidders in upper stretch and yielded through the final sixteenth. ALL IN SYNC tracked along the inside, vacated the rail turning for home, then
faded between horses.

Footnotes
TWO RIVERS OVER took contact to his hind quarters leaving the gate, then steadied hard when pinched between horses at the seven furlong pole, settled
off of the pace in the two path, gained inside of foes turning for home to be behind the leading pair in upper stretch, altered course outside of those rivals at
the furlong grounds and sustained his grinding charge to gain an advantage in the shadow of the wire. ABSOLUTE COURAGE set the pace inside of a pair
of prompting foes down the backstretch, disposed of those rivals before SPEED INSTITUTE offered a challenge at the quarter pole, got headed by that one
nearing the furlong grounds, fought back gamely through the late stages to wrestle an advantage one more approaching the wire, but was outfinished by an
outer bidder. SPEED INSTITUTE had his hind quarters knocked from underneath him while transferring contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the
start, stalked along the inside, vacated the fence turning for home to offer a two wide bid at the quarter pole, forged an advantage nearing midstretch, failed
to kick away from his inner game foe soon after, battled between horses as an outer bidder joined the fray in the final sixteenth, but was bested by them
late. REPREHEND stumbled outwardly and squarely bumped an outer foe at the start, saved ground at the rear, then improved inside of rivals entering the
lane and failed to threaten the leading trio thereafter. PATROLMAN prompted the pace two wide and between horses but gave way at the three furlong.
PHILHARMONIC raced towards the rear in the three path, attempted to gain four to five wide around the far turn, but made little impact. TEXCOCO pressed
three wide, but was outmoved by an inner rival at the five sixteenths pole and weakened nearing the lane. MATLOCK broke outwardly tracked two wide,
then in the three path around the far turn and faded between horses turning for home.

HEADLAND stalked two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole and drove clear leaving the furlong grounds. QUICK MUNNY cleared early on, met an outer
challenge turning for home, got bested by that one as her rider lost his crop in midstretch and remained clear of show. KANTEX tracked along the inside,
pursued the top pair under urging turning for home, entering the lane in the three path and chased the leaders thereafter. JETS A GINNIN broke a step
slow, lacked speed along the inside and moved up. ROCK STAR PARKING pursued from midpack in the three to four path and lacked a bid. LOVE OF MY
HEART failed to factor in the four path. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT stumbled at the start, trailed in the five path and got outrun.

BRITERDAYZAHEAD stalked three to two wide and between horses into the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole along with an outer rival, vied between
horses while turning for home with a narrow advantage, then drove clear nearing the furlong grounds and held from an outer bidder late. ARABIAN PRINCE
settled off of the pace in the three path, fanned five wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes while hanging on his left lead in midstretch, changed over
at the sixteenth pole, sustained his charge to offer a late bid, but came up short. COUNTERSTRIKE tracked along the inside, tipped two wide nearing the
lane, but awaited racing room behind the leaders entering it, gained place while chasing the clearing leader entering the final furlong, took aim inside of that
one soon after, but was fended off and lost place in the final sixteenth. FADETHENOISE broke outwardly, stalked four to three wide into the turn, bid at the
five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch, yielded through the final furlong, yet lasted for
fourth. FAVORITE OUTLAW chased two to three wide and between horses, but drifted inwardly in upper stretch, yet ran on between horses entering the
final sixteenth, but missed gaining fourth from an outer rival late. PATTON'S WAR hopped at the start, trailed in the two path, shifted out entering the lane
and in upper stretch, then stayed on while flopping leads multiple times. TRUST DADDY pursued from midpack three to four wide, entered the lane between
horses, but was outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch and lacked a bid. LARK'S MISCHIEF set the pace along the inside, met a pair of challenges around
the turn, got headed at the quarter pole and weakened through the final furlong. B D VALESKI laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out turning for
home, but was blocked behind rivals in the four to three path entering the lane, got herded inwardly by an outer FAVORITE OUTLAW before being forced to
steady at the furlong grounds, and failed to threaten. CADILLAC CANDY lacked speed in the two path, cut the corner entering the lane, but steadied behind
rivals at the furlong grounds and made little impact.

Footnotes
SOLIDIFY tracked along the inside, was blocked behind the leading quartet turning for home, shifted outside of them entering the lane, then produced a late
rally in the final furlong to bid approaching the wire and forged an advantage at it. SLAM DUNK SERMON bobbled before brushing with an inner rival at the
start, stalked three wide, bid two wide leaving the three furlong pole, vied between horses turning for home as outer rivals joined the fray, sparred gamely
through midstretch, inched away entering the final sixteenth, but was nailed by an outer rival at the wire. BEVERLY PARK exchanged light contact with
rivals on both sides at the start, tracked four to three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, as an outer rival loomed a danger, vied between horses turning for
home, but failed to keep pace with an inner rival leaving the furlong grounds and held show from an outer foe late. TETSU raced at the rear along the inside,
paused briefly behind a troubled foe entering the turn, commenced a gain while shifting out passing the three furlong pole, loomed a danger outside of the
leading trio at the five sixteenths pole, bid at the quarter pole, vied in upper stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. LAMUTANAATTY grazed an outer
rival at the start, sped clear soon after, got headed while vying inside of a trio of bidders turning for home, fought on through midstretch but weakened
entering the final sixteenth. SOARING BIRD raced forwardly two wide and between horses, checked as an outer rival crossed over at the half mile pole, lost
position entering the turn and failed to factor thereafter. ALEXANDROS trailed three wide into the turn and got outrun.

FRONTAL ATTACK trailed two wide, launched an eye-catching rally four wide leaving the five furlong pole, quickly closed in on the leaders entering the far
turn, offered a bold bid at the five sixteenths pole and took charge under a drive in upper stretch. BOLTORO lacked speed two wide, fanned to the five path
entering the lane and rallied to prove second best. BOLT'S BROAD rated at the rear along the inside, fanned from the three path to the six path entering the
lane and stayed on to gain show at the sixteenth pole. CHURCH SERVICE tracked along the inside, then two wide entering the backstretch, bid three wide
around the far turn along with an outer rival, but was quickly outkicked at the five sixteenths pole and yielded between horses in the final furlong. PURE
COUNTRY pressed three to two wide, dueled down the backstretch, but proved no match for an outer bidder nearing the lane and weakened. ENGLISH
CHARM lacked speed two wide and failed to bid. BAG LADY failed to factor along the inside. MY TALLULAH chased along the inside and weakened around
the far turn. WORDS OF PRAISE dueled for the lead inside of a bidder down the backstretch, but was headed at the three furlong pole and folded.
