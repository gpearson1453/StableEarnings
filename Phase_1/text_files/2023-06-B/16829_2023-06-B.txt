Footnotes
CROSS CLAIM tracked the pace from the three path, then was moving up on the turn to take command in the early stretch, then kicked clear in late stretch
and held on well to prove best in the end. MORO PRINCESS set the pace along the inside, led gamely throughout the turn then gave way to an outer rival in
the late stretch and was best for second. LOCKSMITH LEAH chased the pace while three wide, was moving up on the turn to rally in the stretch and was
closing well in the end. NOMOROTHAT pressed the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive throughout the turn, then flattened out in late stretch.
TERE'SDRAMAQUEEN trailed behind the field early, then rallied in the late stretch while two wide and was no threat. SHACK IT TO ME chased the pace
from the inside, then rallied on the turn and needed more in the end. EXPECT LAVENDER broke awkwardly at the start, then was distanced early, rallied on
the turn and passed tired rivals in the end. DOC'S BUD chased the pace while four wide, then rallied on the turn and into the early stretch, was used up and
tired in late stretch. MAGICAL GOLD raced in the middle of the field while two wide, then bid on the turn and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
SUMMER CAT coaxed shortly away from the gate to take control of the pace into the first turn, set a well measured, unchallenged pace, responded when
called upon at the top of the lane and kept giving in a well handled ride. ENDLESS ROMANCE rated just off the early pace, lost some position down the
backside when several rivals made early moves, kept rail position saving ground and rallied well up the fence in the stretch. STREET TAPPER tracked the
leader from the rail to the far turn while well positioned, waited for racing room through the final bend, angled out for the drive and finished willingly. CARPE
HORSESHOE stalked the pace from three wide while hard held, loomed up three wide in the turn and lacked a closing kick. QUINN ELLA unhurried early to
be at the back, made a bold middle move to mount a wide bid in the far turn and flattened out coming home. DEL MAR DRAMA well placed in striking
distance of the leader, moved up to challenge in the turn and evened out. DADDYMADEMEDOIT prompted the pace from the rail through both turns and
weakened in the stretch.

PERFECT TOM dueled from the inside down the early back stretch, then inched away to lead the field throughout the turn, then kicked clear in the early
stretch and held on well to prevail. MAN IN THE MIDDLE saved ground throughout the back stretch, then came out three wide leaving the bend to close
willingly down the lane and be up for the place prize. COMO ESTAS stalked the pace from three path down the backstretch, was in a long drive throughout
the turn to gain the place position, was closing well but was caught in the end for the place prize. GHOST CREEK raced in the middle of the pack from the
inside at a moderate pace throughout and needed more. BAJA BOOGIE raced in the middle of the pack while two wide at a flat pace and needed rally. YOU
EFF OH settled in the two path down the backstretch, then made a mild bid on the turn and was no threat. ROCKIN TAMIM no menace. SEEMS RIGHT
dueled with in inner rival down the early backstretch under a hard drive, was used up and flattened out in the stretch. HAKEEM'S DREAM never a factor.

Footnotes
OVER PAID dueled for the early lead from two wide, took command turning for home and drew off as much the best. DA RINGO slow early to trail the field,
angled wide at the top of the lane and closed with a rush to be second best. SONNY BOB unhurried early to be at the head of the rear pack leaving the
quarter pole and made steady progress down the stretch. SHARP LIKENESS sped to the lead up the fence, set a pressured pace for three-eighths and
weakened in the drive. TOO INTIMIDATING stalked the pace through the turn in striking position and flattened out in the lane. RUSTY GADGET steadied a
bit leaving the gate, settled into stride, moved up to be mid-pack and lacked a closing response. RACE FOR DOUGH went evenly never posing a threat. MY
BOY MAX tracked the leaders to the quarter pole and faded. TAKE POINT showed brief speed to be mid-pack early and lacked a response.

Footnotes
PARROT HEAD was well rated along the inside down the backstretch, was gaining ground gamely throughout the far turn to vie with an inner trio at the
quarter marker, then inched away to duel with an inner rival in the late stretch and was able kick clear and be up at the wire. BIG COUNTRY tracked the
pace from the inside down the backstretch close behind the leaders, was moving up on the second turn to vie for the lead, bumped an inner rival, continued
to bid gamely down lane while battling with an outer rival and was out finished in the end. KAZAN (IRE) was unhurried early, then settled in the two path, bid
on the far turn to rally in the late stretch and closed gamely for show. DRIVEHAPPY chased the pace down the backstretch while two to three wide, was
urging on the far turn to rally from the five path in the late stretch and closed well in the end. JUST A IRISH LAD settled along the inside throughout the first
three quarters, was urging on the far turn to bid in the early stretch, was denied room, then was clear in the late stretch to close willingly in the end.
RANDELLO set the pace into the first turn and onto the backstretch, was in a long drive throughout the far turn to try to maintain the lead but gave way in
the end. GORDON ANTHONY was bumped at the start, then stalked the pace early under a hard drive, then flattened out on the far turn. CITY LEGEND
broke outwardly and bumped rival, then pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch and into the far turn, vied for the lead at the quarter
marker, was in tight, then bumped and gave way in the stretch. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The
rider of BIG COUNTRY claimed foul against the rider of PARROT HEAD for interference leaving the second turn. After reviewing the replay, no change was
made to the order of finish.

DARE TO WISH sped to the lead on the fence, was always under pressure, shook off the presser in mid-stretch and held the two closers at bay in a
determined drive. YVONNE'S MISS unhurried early to be off the pace in mid-pack, circled five wide to mount a strong rally in the middle of the track but
came up short. JJ'S AMERICAN DIVA tracked the leaders from the rail saving all the ground and finished well finding her best stride late to be gaining at the
wire. ATTA MOY GIRL pressed the pace down the backside, continued to duel in upper stretch and weakened late in the drive. IT'S A GIRL stalked the
pace in striking position to the top of the lane and faded in the stretch. STAR POSE reserved to be well off the leaders and lacked a rally never menacing.
CRAFTY CHARLIE went evenly never presenting a threat. BELL PEPPER broke a step slow to be at the back and was never a factor. TWITTER TRAFFIC
chased the pace from mid-field and came up empty.

Footnotes
LIARS CLUB dueled from the inside throughout the first three quarters, then kicked clear in the upper stretch and held sway to prove best. MOOJAB JR
saved ground throughout the backstretch, then came out six wide on the far turn, to close belatedly down the lane to be up for the place prize. LOOKIN
HIGH raced in the middle of the field from the inside, was in a hard drive throughout the far turn and into the early stretch, drifted out to the two path then
gave way for the place prize. CHARLIECANDO chased the pace from the inside into the far turn, hit a wall of rivals, then re bid from the four path to rally in
the late stretch and closed well in the end. BIG ROJO raced towards the back of the pack in the two path, then made a mild bid on the far turn to close well
in the stretch but needed more. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY chased the pace down the backstretch from the two path, then bid on the far turn and flattened out in
the stretch. LOUIS LE GRANDE raced in the middle of the pack while three wide down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn before giving way in the
stretch. UNION STATION settled along the inside throughout and was no threat. LAB RAT dueled from the two path down the backstretch, was in a long
drive on the far turn, was used up and stopped.

Footnotes
BIG WAVE JAMES stalked the pacesetter through the first turn, closed the gap into the far turn, took command while still in hand midway through the bend,
opened a clear advantage turning for home, widened in the lane and was geared down late as much the best. CAPITAL JOKE sped to the lead into the first
turn, set quick fractions while on a non-pressured lead, could not match the winner when challenged in mid-turn but kept on gamely as second best.
GOLDBRIDGE tracked the leaders at the head of the second flight and made a mild bid down the lane to pick up the show. ACCRUAL slow early to be near
the rear of the strung out field, steadily gained ground to hit the board. FREE MAKER unhurried to be near the back of the field early, maintained that
position most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. THISGUYCANFLY went evenly never presenting a threat. MOONSHINE STEVE was washy
in the post parade, broke well to prompt the early pace, settled just off the leaders down the backside and faded through the turn. DISCOVERY PEAK trailed
and was never a factor.
