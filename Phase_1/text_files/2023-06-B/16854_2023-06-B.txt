Footnotes
BLISS THIS dueled to a slim lead at the five sixteenths pole and contested even terms in the three path on the turn, drew briefly clear toward mid-stretch
and dug in determinedly for the nod. FLASH OF DAY engaged in close early chase inside but steadied at the rail approaching the five sixteenths pole,
angled five wide through the turn and dug in gamely through the final sixteenth. MO EH HENNESSY pressured the pace three wide through the backstretch,
dropped back midway on the turn but came back to take third late. TRICKY STRONG raced with a pressured early pace toward the inside, contested even
terms at the rail on the turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened in the lane. FROSTY THE BULL raced with the pace two deep while
between horses but dropped back midway on the turn and weakened in the lane. MONEY MAC gave chase outside and raced in the five path of the turn.

MIDNIGHT PASS took a quick lead and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily
handled to hold well. HOLY HIP came away a bit awkwardly but picked up the chase leaving the chute, raced close off the rail on the turn but relented in the
duel through the stretch. FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail, was steadily handled leaving the turn and
just lasted for third. FESSIN UP gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and just missed third in an even finish. CHANTILLY MOON (PER) chased
inside, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. HEARD was not a factor. MOON WALKIN chased outside, rounded the turn about the five

Footnotes
TOUGH TO TAME raced in the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the half mile pole and drew to even terms five wide approaching the head of
the lane, dug in determinedly with the lead past the eighth pole and edged clear later yards. CHARLIE POTATOES saved ground on the first turn, bid
nearing the seven sixteenths pole but raced hemmed in in the three path midway on the far turn, eased to the six path toward the head of the lane and
dueled through the stretch to take second later yards. ANOTHER VICTORY rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. LANTAU rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail approaching the head of the lane and remained close to mid-stretch before flattening stride.
ROYAL THUNDER rounded the opening turn about the four path and stalked leaving the turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, closed to
even terms four wide approaching the head of the lane and raced close through the upper stretch before flattening stride. HAPPY CHAMP rated close
inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but lacked room at the rail midway on the far turn, dueled close in the upper stretch then flattened later
yards. COWBOY AT HEART broke through prior the start then stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms two deep
while between horses toward the top of the stretch but weakened leaving the eighth pole.
