NOBLE REALITY (FR) vied for the lead from the two path through the turn, entered the lane from the three path when still dueling for the lead, shook clear
nearing the sixteenth pole then widened late. MAGNIFICENT MILE vied for the lead with the winner while in the three path, floated into the four or five path
into the lane while still pressuring the leader, yielded to that one after the eighth pole and settled for second best. WOODYTHEBIDSPOTTER saved ground
through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on the to two while settling for the distant show spot. LIAMS LAD chased the pace from the three path
through the turn, came into the lane from the five path then weakened through the final eighth. CLOSE TALKER was bumped twice and forced in at the
start, raced along the inside through the turn and never was a threat. RIVOLI stepped in and bumped inside rival twice while forcing him in, raced in the
three path through the turn and never was a factor.

Footnotes
ORO AZTECA set the pace on a clear lead early, continued clear into the lane, remained clear with an eighth to travel while in the four path then was all out
late to last. BANDIDO DE AMORES chased the pace while three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path with aim on the leader,
continued with a steady pace inside the eighth pole then was inching up late and ran out or real estate. CIELO AZUL stalked the winner while near the rail
through the turn, had an open rail into the lane then lacked a closing bid. DANANG chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane
from the six path and finished evenly. DOUBLE TUFF chased the winner from the two path through the turn, drifted into the four or five path while under a
drive and weakened. GOOD SUGAR was in the three or four path through the turn and tired.

continued to inch up through the final furlong and just got up. IT'S LAST CALL set the pace while under into the turn, continued under pressure into the lane,
repelled one challenger into the lane, was joined by the winner while straightening in the lane and gave ground grudgingly. SHAGBARK chased the pace
from the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up. REFLEX was last away and moved to the inside, raced along
the rail into the lane, came off the inside into the lane and weakened. BACHMAN pressed then vied for the lead into late turn then faded through the lane.
INCLINED close up into the turn, was steadied between rivals and dropped back to last, raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane, shifted out
inside the eighth pole and was not menace. POSITIVE CHANGE raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired.

Footnotes
ANJAWAY stalked her stablemate through the turn while in the three path, bid into the lane, moved to near even terms with an eighth to go then inched
clear late. BEREA set the pace from the two path through the turn while on a clear lead, was joined by the winner outside the eighth pole, dueled with that
one to near the sixteenth pole and could not keep up while staying on well for the place spot. GOODY FOUR SHOES was in the two path through the turn
when never far back, moved further off the inside into the lane then was slowly gaining to the end. ENCHANTED MELODY pressed the early pace before
the first call, settled back to chase the pace through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing kick. MAJOR GRACE raced in the four path through the
turn, came into the lane from the six path and tired. REDHOTJUSTICE never a factor while in the four path through the turn. JULEE FOREVER raced in the
three path through the turn, was put in tight nearing the quarter pole, taken up sharply entering the lane and never was in it thereafter. KNOTTY BLONDE
raced along the inside through the turn and was empty in the lane.
