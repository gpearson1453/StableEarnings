OCHO hopped in the air at the start to get away behind his field, moved up four-wide nearing the turn, offered a bold bid nearing the quarter pole but was
unable to match strides with the winner late. D K'S CROWN was close up early while racing two-wide and finished in a mild rally. CROOKED FINGER RAY
was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and went evenly late. MAMACALLMEBOO prompted the early pace from along the inside and weakened.

DONTFORGETHESUGAR bobbled at the start, then was reserved off the early pace, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final
strides. LA POPIS saved ground stalking the early pace, angled out three-wide for room nearing the quarter pole, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and
just failed to last. CAMDEN HIGH settled in the middle of the pack while racing two-wide, found room entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MISS
MENSA saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened slightly late. MUNNINGS TALE was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch
and failed to menace. EASY DOES IT dropped back early, was three-wide entering the stretch and failed to threaten. GUNNHILD was forwardly placed for
six furlongs and tired. FLY PATTI FLY prompted the issue for five furlongs from along the outside and gave way.
