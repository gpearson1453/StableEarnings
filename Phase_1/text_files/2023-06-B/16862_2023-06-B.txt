ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE stalked the dueling leaders, made a strong bid nearing the quarter pole, took charge, pulled away under urging and was hand
ridden late. RHUMJAR bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied into second, then dug in
late to hold that spot. FORTY STRIPES raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and missed for second. TITLE
