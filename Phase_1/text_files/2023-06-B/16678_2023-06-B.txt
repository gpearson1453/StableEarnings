Footnotes
BLING BLING BLING broke a step slow, moved up the fence in hand to take command a hundred yards from the gate, set a well measured pace, opened a
clear advantage in upper stretch while still in hand and drew away convincingly. TAPITURE JONES prompted the pace from two wide throughout, failed to
gain on his stablemate but kept on willingly to hold the place. GUITAR BOY reserved off the pacesetter in the second flight, rallied three wide in the turn and
steadily gained ground on the runner-up in the lane. RED SUMMERBIRD tracked the paced from the fence in striking distance and failed to gain ground
down the stretch when called upon. I'M A COWBOY went evenly and never posed a threat. MORO OUTLAW trailed throughout as a non-factor.

LIARS CLUB stalked the pace from three wide to the three-eighths pole, moved to the lead while still in hand in the turn, opened a clear advantage at the
top of the lane and finished well to be clearly the best. JIM AND JIM unhurried early while caught three wide in the first turn, steadily gained ground down
the backside while dropping to the fence, angled out for the drive and closed well to be second best. INFINITE MORO reserved off the pace in mid-pack to
the final bend, circled four wide coming home and showed late interest gaining in the stretch to be up for the show. GAMMA RAY raced well off the pace
near the rear of the field to upper stretch and made up ground in the stretch. MR OKLAHOMA CITY slow early to be the trailer to the head of the lane and
passed tired rivals late. NOOGE sped to the lead, set a contested pace to midway on the turn and faded coming home. PROUD TO SERVE pressed the
pace for a half mile and steadily gave way. SCHOENHARDT chased the leaders for a half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
CANDY TAP vied for the lead from the inside into the turn, then drew away in the early stretch to duel grudgingly with an outer rival down the lane and was
up at the wire to prove best. GLITZ AND GLAMOUR vied for the lead while three deep into the bend, then inched away to duel with an inner rival in the
stretch drive and was out finished in the end. SHINING EXAMPLE broke outwardly at the start and bumped rival, then vied between rivals into the turn then
gave way in the early stretch and held onto the show prize. TERE'SDRAMAQUEEN raced close behind the group along the inside, was urging steadily on
the turn to close well in the late stretch. CRANKY SHEILA chased the pace while two wide, made a mild bid on the turn, came out four wide at the top of the
lane then flattened out in late stretch. FREE DROP GYPSY was in tight early, steadied then was out run and no menace. RABBIT HOLE was bumped at the
start, then trailed behind the field throughout and was no factor.

Footnotes
JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) stalked the leaders from the rail down the backside, waited for racing room through the turn while patiently handled, angled out in
upper stretch to the clear and closed rapidly to be up late in the drive in a game effort. ENGLANDER pressed the pace from between horses through the
first turn and down the backside dueling on the lead, pulled to the front midway on the far turn, took control in upper stretch but could not hold off the winner.
SEDUCTIVE U S A unhurried early to be well back at the tail of the field, closed ground to the far turn to commence his rally in earnest while circling five
wide and closed ground down the lane to be best of the rest. PARROT HEAD prompted the pace while racing three wide throughout, loomed up midway on
the final bend and failed to sustain his bid down he stretch. FRED'STWIRLINCANDY sped to the lead the first time by the stand, dueled on the pace from
the rail to the top of the lane and weakened late in the drive. WHISKEY NOT WINE broke tardy from the gate giving a length or so at the start and raced
near the rear never posing a threat. COLOSI went evenly never menacing at any point.

MR. NIGHTBLINGER lead the way in the early furlongs, then vied between rivals throughout the turn, then dug in gamely mid stretch to kick clear and
prevail under a strong drive. HAMAZING WISDOM stalked the pace while four wide, was moving up to vie for the lead from the three path throughout the
bend, was in a gamely rally down the lane but was out finished in the end. BIG COUNTRY stalked the pace from the inside, was urging on the turn, angled
out four wide then rallied in late stretch to close well for third place. VANGILDER was unhurried early then bid from the inside on the turn to close willingly
down the stretch drive. CHARLIECANDO chased the pace while two wide, then came out five wide to rally in the upper stretch and was closing well but it
wasn't enough. FIRE EXTINGUISHER was moving up along the inside to lead the way in the late backstretch, was in a hard drive throughout the turn while
battling to keep the lead with outer rivals, was used up and tired in late stretch. BIG POWER RED settled along the inside, then made a mild bid on the turn
and needed more in the end. SAMURAI CAUSE was out run and needed rally. HANS GRUBER chased the pace from the inside in the middle of the field
then rallied on the turn but did not fire.

Footnotes
AUTOSTRADA broke alertly to be on the pace away from the gate, settled two wide to press the pace, took control midway on the turn, repelled the
challengers in upper stretch and dug-in gamely down the lane in a determined victory. TRUE BLUE SKY unhurried early, rallied down the backside into
contention, made a strong sweeping move from five wide in the turn to collar the frontrunners and battled down to the wire in a game effort to be second
best in the end. HOURGLASS FIGURE tracked the leaders from the second flight in between rivals, rallied well down the lane but could not gain ground on
the top pair. KEEP THE BLING rated in mid-pack most of the way and showed late interest in the stretch with a mild bid. AUSTIN CITY GIRL stalked the
lead from three wide most of the way, loomed up boldly at the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. GREY HALO chased the leaders in the second
flight from the rail to be well placed in the far turn but failed to respond when called upon for the drive. TEXAS TIDELANDS sped up to take the lead into the
first turn from the rail, dueled on the pace to the far turn and weakened turning for home. GRASS QUEEN trailed most of the way and passed tired rivals in
the stretch. HONOR GIVEN went evenly never posing a threat. CHEROKEE SUMMER was never a factor.
