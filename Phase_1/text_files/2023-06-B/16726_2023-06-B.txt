Footnotes
DON'T TELL DEREN chased the pace, was under urging three wide leaving the far turn, drifted in approaching the sixteenth pole and was up inside
WALKS LIKE A LADY near the finish. WALKS LIKE A LADY showed speed, raced in the two path down the backstretch, opened up mid way on the turn,
drifted out in mid stretch and weakened. TRUE BLUE PEARL lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied
late. HOT CHOICE saved ground while advancing on the far turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and was steadied to avoid the heels of DON'T TELL
DEREN approaching the sixteenth pole. WATER WITCH , rank behind horses entering the first turn, raced along the inner rail on the far turn, swung widest
near the sixteenth pole and showed a mild gain. DROPKICK QUEEN , four wide the far turn, weakened. MISSAWLET between horses leaving the
backstretch, steadied to avoid EXTRA CRUNCHY entering the far turn then gave way. ONE LAS OLAS was outrun. EXTRA CRUNCHY showed speed
along the inner rail, took up inside WALKS LIKE A LADY entering the far turn, dropped back and was eased. An objection by the rider of HOT CHOICE
against DON'T TELL DEREN for alleged interference in the stretch drive was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiyr concerning the run into the far turn
but no action was taken.

Footnotes
GILLIGAN , four wide outside rivals early, moved clear in hand near the five eighths, dropped in a bit and set a rated pace, came under a ride soon into the
lane, wandered outward despite right handed asks then held firm while kept alert. PATRIOTIC PARTY prompted the pace while saving ground, came under
pressure mid turn, angled three wide into the stretch and gave game pursuit to the wire. ON THE ENGINE , off the pace while saving ground, came under a
ride leaving the far turn, made steady progress saving ground past mid stretch then flattened out through the final sixteenth. SUPERSTITIEUX edged up
four deep heading towards the far turn and reached a stalking spot, was put to pressure pursuing four wide past the five sixteenths, continued a presence to
about mid stretch then gave way. NOTION TO TAPIT lagged back off the pace, saved ground into the stretch and passed tired foes. NO ME DIGAS was
hustled up between runners soon after the break, chased the winner into the turn and dropped back after a half mile. TROPHY ROOM , three wide between
rivals pursuing the winner, lacked a kick nearing the lane and faltered.

to four wide on the turn, chased the pace and weakened. TWO SPOT was no factor. LUCINA chased the pace, raced between horses in upper stretch and
was taken up when NAMI came out on her in mid stretch. FREE ADMISSION showed speed outside MASHUA, was steadied when getting out entering the
turn and retreated. TEMPTRESS CALLING , wide on the turn, was no factor.

Footnotes
HE'S PURE TALENT prompted the pace inside a pair of rivals early on, saw those two get away a bit into the turn, angled out to be three wide leaving the
three eighths, had his rider drop the whip in the vicinity of the quarter pole, closed in under steady hand encouragement, drew alongside BAR DOWN
EXPRESS inside the eighth pole, was floated out a bit when dueling inside the sixteenth marker and forged ahead in the final jumps. BAR DOWN
EXPRESS , three deep in hand and with the pace into the turn, vied outside PRINS FIRE while rated along past the five sixteenths, took over into the lane,
was roused clear soon after, drifted out when dueling past stretch, battled gamely inside the winner and just missed. BRIDGE TO SUCCESS , off the pace
while saving ground, moved up past the three sixteenths, angled out leaving the eighth pole and churned on. PRINS FIRE vied between foes on a slim lead
heading to the turn, shifted in a bit and sparred to the inside of BAR DOWN EXPRESS from the far turn to upper stretch, continued with effort to about mid
stretch and weakened. DOWSING ROD , three to four wide pursuing the leaders, faded through the drive. WE GOT LUCKY hopped at the break to be away
last, was taken up soon after and failed to seriously recover.

Footnotes
THE ADDISON POUR lacked speed, raced outside horses while four wide on the far turn, floated wider in upper stretch, closed steadily outside horses,
drifted in a bit approaching the sixteenth pole and was up late. CRABS N BEER stalked the pace near the inner rail, found a small opening along the rail to
challenge for the lead in mid stretch and continued gamely. RICCIO sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, moved to the two path into the
stretch, dug in to deep stretch then faded late. CONSULTANT stalked the pace behind horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, swung to the four
path at the head of the stretch, gained a short lead outside horses in mid stretch, drifted in late and weakened. HARDSPUN REASON , slightly off the inner
rail turning for home, lacked room in upper stretch, angled to the five path in mid stretch and checked in tight quarters inside the winner approaching the
sixteenth pole. REEL WELL lacked speed, circled the far turn four wide then failed to rally. WILLOW WOOD chased the pace outside RICCIO and
weakened the final furlong. BEYOND THE PALE was no factor. JONES FALLS was not a factor.

VAX A NATION , forwardly placed while saving ground, was coaxed along staying in range of the embattled leaders leaving the five sixteenths, worked
outward for a seam nearing mid stretch, leveled off soon after, had his rider lose his whip with about a sixteenth remaining, surged under solid hand asks
and got up in time. HAY CHIEF was squeezed back soon after the break, drafted back off the pace and saved some ground, cut the corner advancing into
the stretch, rallied inside rivals to take command near the sixteenth marker, edged away a bit, kept on gamely but was nipped in the final jumps.
MARYLAND MOON , four wide to contention into the first turn, tracked the leaders three wide, was pushed along pursuing past the five sixteenths, ranged
up and challenged near the sixteenth pole then flattened out. DR. SNYDER engaged SNEAKING SUSPICION from his outside with six furlongs to go,
dueled on a short lead through the backstretch and around the final turn, kicked clear under a drive in upper stretch, wandered outward when confronted
leaving mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. SNEAKING SUSPICION sparred to the inside of DR. SNYDER a long way, saw that one get away a bit in
upper stretch, stayed on to pursue past mid stretch, steadied briefly near the sixteenth pole, regrouped and continued with effort. IMAGINE IT , three wide
between runners into the first turn, lost ground four wide stalking past the five eighths, continued wide and came up empty late. GIANTSBANE bobbled at
the break, recovered and edged up past the five eighths to track three wide, shifted five wide nearing the lane and one paced through the final furlong. SILK
PRINCE , between runners stalking the pace, continued between foes past the five sixteenths, dropped in nearing mid stretch and faded.
FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER , off the pace while saving ground, angled four wide with a run into the lane, steadied off heels near the three sixteenths then
lacked a further response. HOLEY MOLEY , caught four to five wide early, drafted back past the five eighths, lacked a kick in upper stretch, angled in and
faded in handy fashion. MENO was outrun.

Footnotes
DOCTOR DAVIS quickly cleared, was nursed along setting the pace towards the inside, responded when set down in upper stretch, spurted away, kept on
under right handed encouragement leaving mid stretch and continued with good energy to the wire. ROYNE bobbled slightly at the break, dropped in and
settled off the pace, edged up while saving ground into the far turn, slipped through to be the closest pursuer in mid stretch, failed to make headway from
there but stayed willing enough to save the place. EONS settled off the pace and off the inside, moved up behind rivals into the far turn, remained behind
horses while patiently handled to the quarter pole, leveled off to his best stride inside the eighth pole, split rivals and was too late. OCEANS MAP stalked
outside a rival, was under asking three wide pursuing into the lane, shifted out some in mid stretch and came up empty. FLOP SHOT (IRE) stalked inside,
eased out nearing the quarter pole and faded. JOE , in range off the inside, was caught between runners from the far turn to the quarter pole, shifted out
four wide for a clear run in upper stretch, failed to kick on and faded in the final furlong. DOUBLE CROWN was angled off the rail near the three quarter
pole, advanced outside foes under asking around the far turn, lacked a further response approaching the lane and gave way. BODECREAM broke in the air
and failed to menace.

break, was four wide around the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and gained the place. ARMANDO R lacked
speed near the inner rail, swung four wide leaving the far turn, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. NOSTALGIC RUN assumed the early lead, set
the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. GALERIO chased the pace racing near the inner rail and
weakened on the far turn. TAPPIN CAT , four wide entering the first turn, chased the pace down the backstretch, steadied in close quarters between horses
entering the far turn then gave way.

Footnotes
POGGIBONSI took a short lead early on and set a rated pace between rivals, emerged in a battle to the inside of QUIT QUAY leaving the five sixteenths,
responded to asking past the three sixteenths and shook clear, drifted in while on her left lead and held firm under steady handling. QUIT QUAY , three
deep and with the pace heading to the turn, dueled outside the winner past the five sixteenths, failed to match strides near mid stretch but kept on willingly
to be second best. FORGOTTEN GIFT , fractious behind the gate, rushed up inside foes soon after the break and contested the pace under asking,
steadied out of a tight spot mid turn, regrouped to pursue and continued with effort to earn the show. GINAMAYA , four wide, steadily advanced mid turn,
circled into the lane and flattened out. ELLYMARIE , between rivals early, failed to respond. LIL' LATE LUCK , sluggish from the gate, raced off the pace
and two wide leaving the far turn then lacked a rally. HEY RIRI steadied off foes soon after the break, saved ground and faded.
