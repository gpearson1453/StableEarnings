NOBLE JON set a clear pace and held sway. LEGAL DEAL stalked outside of the clear pace setter, was roused while pursuing in the three path around the
turn, drifted out to the six path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over inside the final furlong but lacked a bid while clear of show.
CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH laid off of the pace in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, ran on to gain show leaving the furlong pole and
held that position from an inner rival late. FIRERY TALE saved ground while trailing around the turn, then offered a mild rally inside of foes to bid for show
final sixteenth, but was fended off. HERD IMMUNITY tossed his head leaving the gates, then pursued from midpack inside of rivals while in the two path
and under a firm drive around the turn, chased between horses entering the final furlong, then tired while drifting about. BEST OF GREELEY broke a step
slow, chased three wide but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

ON A SPREE tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path into the far turn, took aim in the three path and between horses turning for home, offered
a bid while floated to the four path entering the lane, then took charge approaching the furlong pole and drew off while hanging on his left lead. SUGOI set
the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that one nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave way leaving that marker, yet sustained stride to surpass that
one at the wire to reclaim place. SUMMER SPLASH vied two wide, led at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path to embrace ON A SPREE's
challenge entering the lane, but proved no match for that one at the furlong grounds, tired thereafter and was caught by an inner rival for place at the wire.
BEAVER HAT tracked three wide, chased three to four wide around the far turn, then floated to the five path entering the lane and gave way. TAPAGE
trailed the short field four wide, but faded entering the far turn.

PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE tracked along the inside, pursued comfortably from the two path around the far turn, split foes three wide entering the lane,
ranged up to bid at the furlong pole and edged ahead. WHAT'S UP DOC pressed two wide, and between horses early on, vied with the pace setter around
the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch as an outer PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE loomed a danger, got headed by that one at the furlong grounds,
fought on through the late stages but was only second best. JEWELSTOWN broke a beat slow, stalked three wide, was urged along to sustain chasing
position around the far turn, but was floated four wide entering the lane before failing to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, flopped back to his left
lead leaving the furlong grounds, yet surpassed a tiring inner rival to gain show. DOG RED set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer bidder around
the far turn, but got headed by a pair of foes in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. BOLD LOOKER trailed four wide and was outrun.

TAMARA'S WAY bumped with an outer rival at the start, rushed clear leaving the chute, showed the way in the two path around the turn and held sway
through the lane. ZIPPIN PIPPIN broke a step slow step slow while exchanging contact with an inner rival at the start, rushed forward with six furlongs to go
to achieve an inside stalking position, shifted to the three path to pursue outside of the clear leader around the turn, spun for home within striking range, but
drifted out from a left handed crop leaving the furlong grounds, then lugged back in from a right handed stick entering the final sixteenth and failed to
produce a bid while holding place. MAMBA OUT bobbled subtly at the start, tracked three wide, chased the top pair from the four path around the turn, and
held show from an inner rival late. CEE MINUS raced at the in the two path, stayed on through the lane to bid for show inside of foes in the final sixteenth,
but was denied. PROMISEMEPARADISE tracked two wide and between horses, but yielded with a half mile remaining and weakened along the inside
around the turn. NEWYEARSPRESENT chased briefly but was done early.

Footnotes
DON'T WAIT UP took mild contact from an inner rival at the start, set the pace inside of a vying rival while a path off of the rail, shook free of that one at the
three furlong pole and held sway thereafter. MAC DADDY TOO vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner and from the three path, but subtly failed to
keep pace with that one leaving the three furlong pole, yet chased that foe home well through the lane but failed to offer a re-bid. CARBONITE tossed his
head while off a step slow, got keen behind rivals approaching the five furlong pole, settled off of the pace before taking the turn in the three to four path,
then ran on in the four path through the lane to gain show at the sixteenth pol. HOLIDAY HOUSE tracked two wide, but chased between horses in upper
stretch while hanging on his left lead and gave way. LAZARUS chased along the inside and tired. WESTERN COMMAND leaned outwardly and into an
outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the three to two path, shifted out in the final furlong while closing in on tiring rivals, but failed to menace. SAIL AT
SUNRISE trailed in the four path around the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
UNSUNG MELODY broke outwardly at the start, pressed outside of the leader and from the three path around the turn, vied turning for home, wrestled an
advantage entering the lane and edged clear leaving the furlong grounds. LITTLE MOMBO set the pace inside of a vying rival while a path off of the rail, got
headed by that one at the three sixteenths pole, gave way in the final furlong yet lasted safely for place. CANCEL THIS bobbled at the start, trailed in the
three to two path around the turn, awaited racing room behind foes at the five sixteenths pole, cut the corner while improving entering the lane, stayed on to
gain show from an outer rival leaving the furlong marker and held that position thereafter while closing in on place. SCARLET STRIPE stalked along the
inside, shifted to the four path to be outside of the embattled leading pair entering the lane, but lacked a bid while losing show to an inner rival passing the
furlong pole and kept on. MY MY MUNNY raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but yielded while being floated to the five path entering the lane.
HOME PORT tracked three wide and between horses, tipped to the four path entering the turn, but faded in the six path at the top of the stretch. HARTFUL
HOPE pursued four wide and outside of foes, retreated in the five path around the turn to trail approaching the five sixteenths pole and continued to fade
thereafter.

TOP SECRET dueled for the lead along the inside, drew off passing the quarter pole, widened under a drive through midstretch and was put to wraps in the
closing stages. BAD BOY FRANK broke outwardly, raced at the rear three wide into the turn, patiently bided time turning for home, shifted out and bumped
LE BAR while launching a rally four wide and between horses at the furlong grounds, then ran on willingly to prove second best. TEXAS TOAST saved
ground towards the rear, improved position turning for home, gained place from outer rivals at the furlong grounds, but tired in the closing stages. LE BAR
raced at the rear two wide and between horses despite heavy early urging, improved among foes turning for home, bumped an outer BANDON while
swinging to the six path entering the lane, then got bumped and outkicked by an inner BAD BOY FRANK at the furlong grounds and lacked a bid thereafter.
KING ME bumped with an outer foe soon after the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, gained entering the turn to achieve a pressing position
outside of the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole, but yielded in the four path entering the lane and faded between horses. DENIER laid off of the pace in
the four to five path and outside of foes, but was brushed to the eight path by inner rivals entering the lane and failed to menace. ALOHA MAKUAKANE
exchanged contact with an inner rival soon after the start, vied two wide, then between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened at the quarter pole.
BANDON stalked three wide, but failed to sustain forward position in the four path approaching the turn, chased around the bend before being bumped by
an inner foe into an outer rival while floated to the seven path entering the lane, lacked a rally between horses in upper stretch, then steadied when put to
tight quarters at the furlong grounds. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING BAD BOY FRANK'S ACTIONS AT THE FURLONG GROUNDS,
NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SWEETS MAKER set the pace in the two path, remained in hand as an outer rival sustained pressure around the far turn, inched clear at the quarter pole
and held sway from an chasing foe through the lane. LA TOURISTA tracked along the inside, took aim in the three path and outside of the leader at the
quarter pole, but only managed to chase her home. TRANSPARENCY pressed in the three path and between horses, but yielded entering the far turn and
kept on for a minor share. ARDEN'S ASSAULT stalked in the four path, prompted the leader from the three path around the far turn, but weakened after
floating back to the four path at the quarter pole.
