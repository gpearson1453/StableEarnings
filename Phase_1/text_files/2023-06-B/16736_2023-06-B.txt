Footnotes
AGENCY was off slow to begin, reserved early at the back, went two wide into the turn, angled out across the dirt and came six wide into the lane, rallied
steadily through the lane and got up in the closing moments. SMART CODE settled off the rail, went three wide into the turn, moved closer while easing
further late on the bend, challenged five wide while getting bumped entering the stretch, cleared inner rivals outside the eighth pole, lugged inward
midstretch, cleared into the final sixteenth and got run down by the winner. HORACE MANN raced in range two wide into the turn, moved out and launched
a bid four wide and between rivals across the dirt, got bumped on both sides entering the lane, could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong and
churned on to edge PLEASE FOCUS for third. PLEASE FOCUS sped clear to take control, moved to the inside for the turn, drifted out crossing surfaces
and bumped HORACE MANN into the lane, relinquished the lead to SMART CODE, then flattened in the furlong grounds and was edged for the show.
IRISH ROYALTY stalked on the inside then moved to the two path around the bend, altered out over the dirt crossing and could not rally. BOLT
SUPREMACY stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the lane, moved out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. JAM SESSION raced up close from
outside early then chased two wide on the turn, lost his path entering the dirt crossing and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
LOV U MEAN IT broke well from inside, chased early then moved out and went up to apply pressure from outside, pestered the leader two then three wide
around the turn, took over with a furlong to go and drove clear. ILA VEIW TOO cleared and crossed over quickly before being pressure by LOV U MEAN IT
up the backstretch, maintained a short lead along the inside then two wide into the lane, was overtaken at the eighth pole and stayed on to secure the place.
MISS KALINE chased four deep up the backstretch, came five wide into the lane, finished willingly for the show and whittled the gap late. RUN FOR MY
HONEY was forwardly placed outside the top pair early, chased four wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. MOVINGLIKEAWINNER raced off the rail at the
back to the turn, asked two then three wide on the bend and failed to menace. TA TA FOR NOW was off slow to begin then coaxed from the gate and
became rank briefly in the chute, moved into range from inside, lost ground while asked along the fence through the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
GRAND SLAM SMILE pressed the pace from outside, lost touch briefly with the leader into the turn, reengaged between rivals while three to four around the
bend, lost touch with BECKY'S DREAM (FR) entering the lane, came back on under left-handed urging before the rider lost the whip midstretch, dug in
under strong handling and got up late. BECKY'S DREAM (FR) set the pace under pressure from GRAND SLAM SMILE early, inched away momentarily
past the seven-sixteenths pole before being challenged by outside rivals around the bend, held command two to three wide entering the lane, cleared at the
top of the stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth and could not fend off the winner late. CRAZY HOT broke a step slow, chased outside the to pair
to the turn, bid three deep and five wide into the lane, could not keep pace with the leader in upper stretch and flattened to third. STORMY GAL was off slow
to begin, trailed six wide into the turn, angled in a few paths around the bend and never got involved.

Footnotes
UNFAITHFUL WAYS tossed her head to come away a bit slow in the beginning, settled in the two path at the back outside a rival, closed in while angling
out on the far turn, took over four wide into the stretch, kicked clear at the top of the lane and held safely. SHARED FUTURE settled outside a rival, gained
two to three wide through the far turn, tipped out in the lane and outfinished FREEDOM LASS for second. FREEDOM LASS hopped and hit the gate to
come away last, moved down to the inside, tossed her head about on the first turn, got blocked behind ALOHA KITTEN entering the far turn, continued to
lack room to the quarter pole, angled out leaving the bend, showed late run but got outkicked for the place honors. WARRIOR'S MOON was closest in
pursuit from inside early, raced a bit off the rail in the middle stages, launched a bid from outside at the quarter pole, took over briefly past the marker before
being passed by the winner, came in and bumped ALOHA KITTEN in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. ALOHA KITTEN brushed with
outer rival at the start, chased on the inside off the pace, moved closer from the fence in the middle stages but got put in tight spot and had to check at the
three-eighths pole, continued inside on the far turn, tried to split foes but was impeded and had to check again in upper stretch and could not regain
momentum. CRIMSON ROSE cleared early and showed the way two wide then along the rail on the first turn, controlled the pace with a comfortable lead to
the far turn, clung to a short advantage with a quarter mile left to run, lost command shortly after, failed to keep up with winner then got crowded along the
rail in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED WARRIOR'S MOON FOR CROSSING
OVER AND TAKING THE PATH OF ALOHA KITTEN IN UPPER STRETCH, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

DEVIL BE ME got pinballed leaving the gate, chased off the rail then pulled up on the heels of the leader from the half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths
pole, tipped three wide around the bend, took aim into the final furlong, reached the front with a sixteenth to go and drew clear. CHICK'S DIG IT chased off
the rail then between foes into the turn, moved out and took aim four wide into the drive, finished willingly in the late stages and got up for second. DEVIL
MOON forwardly placed early, bid outside leaving the backstretch, put a head in front while dueling around the bend, inched head past the quarter pole,
cleared in upper stretch, yielded to the winner at the sixteenth pole and got nailed for second. J D'S RUDE BOY bumped outer rival at the start, sat off the
pace on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and improved position. QUICK BUCK chased from outside into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and
weakened. BOOK SMART broke through the gate and had to be brought around and reloaded, came away alertly to clear the field, challenged into the turn,
lost command but fought back around the bend, lost touch in upper stretch and weakened. POWERTRAIN got bumped in the beginning the dropped back,
raced two to three wide around the turn and was not a factor.

PICTURE OF A LADY was closest to the pacesetter early three then two wide, bid from outside on the far turn, took over at the top of the stretch and drew
clear under energetic handling and a tap of the right hand approaching the sixteenth pole. LULU LEMON DROP cleared in the two path then moved inside,
showed the way to the far turn, met the challenge from PICTURE OF A LADY on the far turn, was overtaken at the top of the stretch, fought to midstretch
before yielding with a sixteenth to go but was clearly second best. CANDY ON TOP settled inside at the back, advanced between rivals on the far turn in the
two path and was along for the show. THE FLYING PHAROAH suffered a mild shuffle shortly after the start, steadied off heels nearing the first turn, went
two then three wide around the bend, advanced outside rivals in the middle stages, came over to bother rivals at the three-eighths pole, chased a bit off the
rail into the lane, lacked a late bid and lost the show. LT'S CHOICE pulled in the two path between rivals early, raced outside a rival at the back then three
deep at the quarter pole and could not rally. BILLY GALLIVAN hopped slightly at the start but didn't lose much ground to the rest, was rated three deep
early, moved closer on the backstretch then got bothered by THE FLYING PHAROAH coming in at the three-eighths pole, angled to the rail around that
bend and weakened. BELLA VOLPE stalked the pace from inside, got put in tight and shuffled at the three-eighths pole, dropped back to last and had little
left for the drive.

TRANCHE cleared quickly and steered to the inside, showed the way along the rail through the turn, cornered nicely when flagged with the whip exiting the
bend, put to right-handed urging with a furlong left to run and widened through deep stretch. MIRAHMADI broke a step slow on the outside, chased three
deep or four wide into the turn, took aim at the winner three wide into the lane, could not summon the needed response in the lane but stayed on to secure
the place. REFOCUS chased the pacesetter inside a pair of rivals to the turn, rounded the bend two wide and flattened in the furlong grounds. GOING
MOBILE chased from between rivals into the turn, roused midway around the turn, started to lose ground approaching the quarter pole, entered the lane
three wide and weakened. NEXT LEVEL was off a bit slow to start, trailed the field on the fence into and around the bend and never got involved.

Footnotes
CHERUBIC FACTOR sat off the pace early, went three deep into the turn, was on the move while angling out around the bend, came five wide into the
stretch, reached the front approaching the eighth pole, cleared with a sixteenth to go and held safely. KING APOLLO took a bump inside leaving the gate,
lugged out in the chute, pulled and became rank while shifting in and out up the backstretch, moved into the three path for the turn, angled five wide around
the bend, rallied and gained the place. BAJ pressed from inside early then dueled around the turn, inched ahead in upper stretch before losing command
with a furlong remaining, stayed on through the late stages but got outkicked for second. JACK SIXPACK stalked from inside, cut the corner into the lane,
launched a bid in upper stretch but faltered in the late stages. SUBSIDIZE broke out and bumped rival, dropped back and steered to the inside, shifted to
the two path around the bend and showed a mild response to improve placings. DANCING RINCA chased three deep into the turn, raced between rivals
then three wide into the lane and lacked a bid. YOGI BOY set the pace outside of BAJ early, dueled with that rival around the bend, could not keep up with
that rival in upper stretch and weakened. CALI BAY (IRE) got knocked into outer rival leaving the gate, was forwardly placed four deep early, chased three
to four wide around the bend and retreated. WODETON (FR) chased between rivals then got shuffled back at the three-eighths pole, angled to the inside
and faded in the lane.

MEESH broke a step slow then went up to take control set the pace inside COWBOY MIKE early, maintained command into the stretch, cleared at the top
of the lane and inched away under a drive. THE BIG CHEESEOLA got bumped in the beginning, stalked two wide into the turn, raced between rivals then
altered three wide past the five-sixteenths pole, finished willingly through the drive and gained the place. COWBOY MIKE showed early speed then pressed
the pace from outside, remained alongside in the two path through the turn, lost touch with the winner at the three-sixteenths pole, continued to give chase
through the final furlong and got edged for second. DONT FIGHT THE FED lifted at the start, tugged while trying to be reserved early, could not advance
through traffic around the bend, angled five wide into the lane and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. GRANNY'S IPA broke in and bumped
rival twice at the start, raced five wide around the turn, drifted inward in the lane and failed to threaten. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME got bumped on both sides
at the start, raced between into the turn, two wide into the lane, tipped out and lacked a rally. EL REY DORADO broke a step slow, got crowded along the
rail on the turn and churned on through the lane. BIG BABY chased three deep into the turn, bothered past the quarter pole and could not menace after.
IMPERIAL HORNET bumped twice leaving the gate, raced in range four deep into the turn, remained wide into the lane, lost path and checked in upper
stretch and weakened. SEATTLE SURF stalked along the inside, roused at the quarter pole, asked right-handed into the lane and faded.

STAMP MY PASSPORT raced up close in the two path early to the outside of the leader, challenged around the far turn, fought through the lane then dug in
late and edged the runner-up. TALKLESSWORKMORE cleared and moved to the inside, showed the way to the far turn, met the bid from STAMP MY
PASSPORT on the far turn, resisted into the final sixteenth but yielded grudgingly in the final moments. OUBABE stalked the pace from inside through both
turns, moved out in the lane, could not threaten the top pair but kept on to hold the show. WORSE READ SANCHEZ keen along the inside when being
rated, saved ground to the stretch, roused at the top of the lane and was denied third. MOBOU tracked outside a rival in the two path, chased two three wide
on the far turn, tipped out in the lane and lacked a bid. MOOGIE SON reserved in the two path early, saved ground on the far turn, asked in the lane but
lacked room in midstretch and could not regain momentum. BIG BET JAFINSAFA was off slow to begin, trailed early then passed tired rivals from outside in
the middle stages, asked three wide into the lane and could not rally. IRISH HEATWAVE reserved in the two path early, trailed past the half-mile pole, came
three wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DORIS MAE set all the pace on the inside, inched away in upper stretch and held safely late. PEQUENA TORMENTA chased four wide into the turn, five
wide into the lane, finished well and closed the gap on the winner while earning the place. SHE'S RESILIENT stumbled and broke out at the start, chased
two wide around the bend and finished evenly late. DENIM IN GOLD got floated out by SHE'S RESILIENT at the start, stalked from outside to the turn, went
three to four wide around the bend, failed to find the needed late kick and missed the show. CLIQUISH broke a step slow, raced near the back early, went
outside a rival or two wide on the turn and needed to find more in the furlong grounds. VITALERA (CHI) chased out of range to the turn, saved ground
around the bend and lacked the needed response. TIP TOP GAL was off a bit slow to begin, trailed three wide into the turn, eased out to the five path then
came four wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ brushed outer rival at the start, settled inside, angled four to five wide across the dirt, drew closer into the furlong grounds and
inhaled the runner-up while drifting inward. LADY JAE sped to the front from inside, kicked in upper stretch, unchallenged into the final sixteenth and was
run down by the winner late. OVER ATTRACTED raced between foes early then moved into the two path, angled eight wide crossing over the dirt, rallied
through the lane but could only gain the show. SPEED LANE chased two wide nearing the turn then shifted to three path, moved back in a bit around the
turn, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. HAYLEY LEVADE sat off the pace, traveled three wide into the turn, moved in a bit while outside a
rival then spun four wide into the drive and lacked a rally. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) was off slow and brushed at the start, lost his path early, raced
along the inside then two wide over the turn, steered out in the lane and could not threaten. ALBAYAADER (IRE) up close then had to steady off the heels
of the leader early, angled in on the turn, went two wide into the lane and failed to rally. GIMME MO BABY raced three deep at the back into the turn, came
six wide into the drive and lacked further response. NU PI LAMBDA raced two wide into the turn then moved to the rail, cut the corner into the drive and
could not respond to right-handed encouragement.
