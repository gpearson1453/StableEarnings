on, was off the rail into the lane, weakened late in the stretch and was caught for place at the wire. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY chased the pace early, was in
the three path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. TEA'S DREAM was steadied back after the break, raced off the rail into the lane and
faded late in the stretch drive. REAL MIKEY trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane and improved position down the lane. LIEUTENANTS

Footnotes
TOES N THE SAND set the pace early, dueled from the inside down the backstretch and far turn, was in the three path into the lane, inched clear nearing
the eighth pole and held off rival in the final stages. ROYAL FOX HILLS raced back early on, was on the inside along the far turn, fanned into the seven path
entering the lane, rallied down the lane to make a bid but did not have enough in the final stages. BARONS BLITZ raced widest into the first turn, stalked the
dueling leaders, was in the six path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. STREET COP OFFICER chased the pace early, was in the six path
into the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. PERFECT MOON raced in the four path into the first turn, dueled down the backstretch and far turn
while two wide, was in the five path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE was never a threat. SAGA was a tad slow at the start
and never a factor. KADAR INDY was a tad slow at the start and through after a half.
