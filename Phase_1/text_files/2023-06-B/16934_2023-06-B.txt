Footnotes
IRA CHAMP was quick to begin to set the early pace and held a clear advantage to the wire under a strong hand ride. SPEND AGAIN chased the early
leader and got up for the place position racing two to three wide. GIT AROUND BROWN was hustled from the inside, checked near the quarter pole,
continued an inside run and kept on to the wire. JOAN'S JUNIOR chased the pace from the outside, raced three four wide and raced evenly with no closing
run. GOSPEL DANDY raced three to four wide around the far turn and never was a factor. YUUUGE PARTY dropped back early, raced near the inside and
lacked a bid. BREAKING THE BANK saved ground and never threatened.

the pace along the inside and faded.

BRICKTOWN BROWN dueled three deep from the outside of foes, took command and held gamely late under strong handling. WELDON G dueled while
racing near the rail and kept on gamely to the wire. PRAIRIE DOLLAR was shuffled back at the break, raced off the early going, moved around the far turn
through the stretch along the inside and improved position. LOCK UP YOUR PETS settled off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had
not enough. IM THE MAN NOW dueled for the early lead between rivals and faded. ORNERY AS HELL stalked the pace, tired readily and eased up on in

JUSTABOUTRIGHT showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside, came off the rail in the stretch run and held gamely to remain clear under
strong handling. HEY ROXY chased the early leader two deep, shifted to the inside of the winner in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. VIVA LA
SECRETA coaxed along from the outside, raced three to four wide and finished willingly to the wire. DIXIELAND CANDY hopped at the start, raced off the
early going after the poor start, moved up two to three wide and never was a serious threat. SHA BLUSH raced mid pack early, saved ground and lacked a
bid. EVENING STORM was slow early, raced four wide and trailed.
