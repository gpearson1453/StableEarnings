Footnotes
LAGRUE rated from outside on the backstretch, vied for the lead four wide when allowed on the bend, was all out in the lane and edged ahead in time.
BLUE TEARDROPS was sent to vie for the early lead between rivals, two wide through the turn, fought gamely in the stretch but had to settle for second
best. MY KINDA TETON prominent from inside on the backstretch, was outrun and forced to wait for room on the bend, got through along the rail
approaching the quarter pole, battled for the lead but could not sustain his bid in the waning yards. UNCLE O. G. exchanged bumps with LORD
SHAFTESBURY at the break, disputed the pace just outside BLUE TEARDROPS, was caught in tight quarters between rivals leaving the quarter pole,
retreated a bit then flattened out for the drive. LORD SHAFTESBURY exchanged bumps with UNCLE O. G., soon dropped well back from the rest and
lacked a significant stretch response.

Footnotes
FUTURE VISION shared the early lead between rivals, was roused two wide on the bend, drew off under urging inside the final furlong and was kept to task
to the waning yards. WINDIGO SPIRIT bumped a time or two with SAFE at the start, disputed the pace inside horses, gained the rail into the turn, was no
match for FUTURE VISION inside the last eighth, began to wear down late but lasted for second. SAFE bumped with WINDIGO SPIRIT at the break, had
the inside early on, angled out for a clear path into the bend, came into the lane from path four, altered in some when he lost his path midstretch, took over
third inside the final sixteenth and was closing in on WINDIGO SPIRIT nearing the wire. STAY STRONG settled just off the inside, also swung out into the
turn, lost further ground widest entering the stretch, showed a willingness to run late and narrowly missed third. HE'S A FINE MAN contested the pace from
outside, took the bend three wide, began to yield, drifted out some midstretch and continued to gradually give way. BRASKA moved toward the outside early
on, lost ground on the turn, angled in some into the lane and lacked a significant response under hand urging.

IRISH DECLARATION rated from inside, commenced his bid after a half mile, took over with two furlongs to go then steadily opened up under mild urging in
the lane. WILLOW RIDGE rated toward the outside, picked up his pace three wide on the second turn, fanned out further for the drive, took over second,
was all out and proved easily best of the others. READY REDDING broke on top, was soon chasing MADE TO FIT from just off the rail, went for the lead
between rivals on the second bend, found himself boxed in nearing the quarter pole, altered in entering the stretch, was not match for the top pair but lasted
for the show. FRONTANA was settled well back and well off the inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, lost ground widest through the second turn,
passed outside tired ones the final furlong and was closing in on READY REDDING late. SHOBIZ STAR chased from outside, came into contention four
wide on the second turn, swung outside WILLOW RIDGE for the stretch run and gave way. MADE TO FIT soon had a clear lead, showed the way along or
just off the inside, began to wear down on the second turn, was overtaken from inside with a quarter mile left, floated out some for the drive and steadily
faded. AMERICAN SUCCESS showed little in a ground-saving trip.

THAT'S A BIRD, unruly in the gate, popped his gate door open, was contained well by the assistant starter, stalked the early speed from outside once his
gate was closed and the race began, commenced her bid after two furlongs, advanced four wide on the bend, lugged in slightly as she responded to urging
upper stretch then drew away from the rest while ridden out inside the final eighth. THERE RUNS MARY hesitated at the break, quickly recovered,
advanced between rivals, took the lead after two furlongs, had the rail on the turn, was no match for THAT'S A BIRD the last furlong but stayed clear for the
place. MO WANNA GO soon took the advantage from inside, lost the lead after a quarter mile, was two wide taking the bend, ran evenly through the stretch
but was unchallenged for third. MADELYN ATTACK prominent between rivals, was three wide through the turn, altered out some when THAT'S A BIRD
took her path upper stretch and failed to have a serious late bid. GABRIELLA ATTACK was an early contender along the rail but steadily yielded after two
furlongs.

Footnotes
AH LEAH prompted the pace from between horses, was roused three wide on the bend, fanned five wide entering the lane, altered outside BEIRUT
BEAUTY upper stretch, rallied under steady urging and caught BOBBIE TOO TOO near the wire. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke alertly, set a pressured pace
between horses, was challenged from outside on the turn, floated out some into the stretch, moved clear of the rest but began to wear down inside the final
sixteenth. BEIRUT BEAUTY pressed the early speed from outside, went for the lead from path three on the bend, did not stay with BOBBIE TOO TOO into
the lane, drifted out some upper stretch, held a straight path the last furlong and closed the gap belatedly in the waning yards. TEMPLUNA settled well off
the early pace, picked up her pace from inside leaving the turn, waited for room upper stretch, got through along the rail with a furlong to go, closed well but
was too late. SUPERTRIX was away somewhat slowly, stayed well off the inside on the backstretch and through the bend, came into the lane from the
middle of the track, surged the last eighth but was also too late. ABBMAR boxed in behind BOBBIE TOO TOO on the backstretch, was shuffled back into
the turn, angled out four wide, lost further ground staying outside AH LEAH into the lane and upper stretch and rallied belatedly the final furlong as well.
TWO MORE TIMES was steadied behind traffic leaving the chute, settled inside, picked up her pace some just off the rail on the bend, lost ground when
swung out behind ABBMAR entering the stretch, angled in some for a clear path between horses approaching the eighth pole and also showed a
willingness to run deep stretch. SWEET JUSTICE well placed from inside, gave way for the drive. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN prominent two wide on the
backstretch, began to quickly fade nearing the end of a half mile.

MOON PIES IMAGE rated just off the early pace, went for the lead three wide on the bend, battled through the lane and edged ahead nearing the wire.
CANTOO vied for the lead between horses from the beginning, was two wide through the turn, fought gamely in the stretch, did not have enough left in the
waning yards but was clearly second best. JULYNNE prominent between rivals, was two wide on the bend, swung outside MOON PIES IMAGE entering the
lane, gained third inside the final furlong but could only just hold her position late. GHAALEB'S RANGER a step slow at the break, was boxed in on the
backstretch and through the turn, gradually altered outside MOON PIES IMAGE in the stretch and failed to have the needed late kick. PRIMITY was hustled
to contest the pace from inside on the backstretch but began to wear down before finishing a half mile.

DIAMOND DAVE jostled briefly with ALLEN at the break, was settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, came into contention under urging three
wide on the second bend, quickly moved clear upper stretch and maintained full control while with little asking inside the final sixteenth.
EVERLOVINGHAND broke inward, bumping YOU'RE IN COREY, was four wide as he vied for the lead between rivals leaving the first turn, did not stay with
BABA'S BOY after a half mile, lost considerable ground, staying outside the latter leaving the second turn and upper stretch, took over second inside the
last eighth and held his position under steady handling. MKAR THE FAST settled outside, also commenced his bid after a half mile, lost ground four wide on
the second bend, was forced out leaving that turn to be in path ten into the lane, jostled briefly with ALLEN and found best stride too late deep stretch.
BABA'S BOY lost ground as he advanced five then four wide through the first turn, moved clear and gradually angled to the inside after four furlongs, drifted
out badly leaving the second turn and entering the lane and gradually yielded. ALLEN jostled briefly with DIAMOND DAVE at the start, was settled off the
inside, also commenced his bid after a half mile, followed the latter on the second bend, fanned out trying to gain a clear path leaving that turn, forced to
path nine into the stretch, jostled briefly between YOU'RE IN COREY and MKAR THE FAST once straightened for the drive and lacked a significant late
response. YOU'RE IN COREY bumped at the break, was hustled along to stay close between rivals, improved position three then four wide on the second
turn, was also forced out leaving that bend, altered out a bit further for a clear path outside EVERLOVINGHAND upper stretch, jostled briefly with ALLEN
and faded. VIOLENZA D'ORO was a brief factor from inside but began to fade after two furlongs. BLAZEN ROAD displayed early speed along or just off the
rail and steadily gave way two wide before finishing six furlongs.
