Footnotes
YO DAWG was off a step slow, tracked the early leaders from the inside, angled to race from the outside in the stretch and surged up late under strong
pressure while racing from the outside. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY pressed the early leader from the outside down the backstretch through the far turn, led
deep stretch and was caught near the wire in a game effort. CROCODILEHUNTER was off a step slow, rushed from the inside soon after the start to vie
near the rail and weakened in the final stages. EYES FLYING BYE chased the early pace from the outside early on, raced three wide around the far turn
and raced evenly late with no closing run. QUARANTENA BAMBINO dropped back early on, raced four to three deep in the drive and had no late rally.
HEAVENLY GAZEBO was void of early speed, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid.

MISSMOLLYORBIT showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. I'M SO FUNNY stalked the pace,
moved up along the inside past the quarter pole, shifted out a little bid through the stretch to race four deep in the lane and kept on to the wire. STRABELLA
tracked the early leader racing two deep, made a three wide near the quarter pole to challenge for the lead and kept on willingly to the wire. KOOKYBERRY
settled off the early pace, raced near the inside and had no late response. MIDNIGHT LANE dropped back early on, raced six to seven wide into the upper
stretch and never threatened.
