through the backside mustering a mild response down the lane to best the others. NOGRATZ gained on the outside on the far turn racing evenly four wide
down the lane. SWEET TORI PAT stalked the pace chasing on the far turn being dispatched in upper stretch weakening from there.

Footnotes
PERFECT SPLIT away alertly set the pace maintaining daylight to upper stretch holding firm under a drive the final eighth. REIGNING CHAMPION a step
slow through the turn raced evenly into upper stretch rallying belatedly to save place. ROGERS GINGER stalked the pace looming through the turn into
upper stretch weakening late. RESVALON was always a step slow failing to mount a credible bid. TRUST FUND ROBBER slow early played no factor.
GHOST MINE varied little playing no factor. HICKORY BILL was always outrun.

Footnotes
FUELED UP stalked the pace chasing to upper stretch rallying clear late at mid track. W H LITTLE MISS GO a step slow early saved ground to upper
stretch rallying late along the inside. SHISH KABOB broke sharply pressing the pace digging into upper stretch weakening late under outside pressure.
LOMA VISTA slow early lagged to upper stretch moving up late in the four path. MY BRIDGET VERDOT slow early gave a mild rally to upper stretch
hanging late on the inside. HOT TAKE pressed the pace dueling to upper stretch tiring late. THATS ALL SHEWROTE played no factor. GOTTA HAVE
FAITH was never involved. SPICEY SECRET gave way on the turn.
