Footnotes
NAMBITI was fractious in the gate, prompted the pace two wide, made the lead before a half, set a pressured pace into the stretch then drew off late while
drifting out under left handed urging to win going away. SPIN DOCTOR with the second flight two wide, closed ground in the six path into the stretch, drifted
in under right handed urging to the four path at the furlong marker then finished clear for second. SERVE REVENGE COLD hit the gate at the start, vied for
the lead along the inside for six furlongs, shifted out to the four path for racing room, was shut off at the furlong marker then finished evenly. JUDGE HEAD
set the early pace along the inside, gave up the advantage before a half, kept pressure into the stretch then faded late. RIDING IN THE WIND went evenly.
SAMMY DA BULL was no factor. THE RIDER OF SERVE REVENGE COLD LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SPINT DOCTOR
FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SPIN DOCTOR AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

pace and went evenly. STREET TRAFFIC failed to menace. ALTAIR failed to respond. MINDSHIP Q had speed along the inside through the turn then
weakened.

IT'S OFFICIAL matched strides for the lead two wide while hung out in the five path into the stretch, drifted in when struck with a right handed whip at the
furlong marker bumping KID RUSSEL, the rider quickly switched to left handed urging, continued to drift in bumping the runner up a few stride later and
proved best by a narrow margin under strong handling. TEAM HUCKY stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied inside the dueling leaders to gain a narrow
lead at the furlong marker, was bumped soon thereafter and just missed hanging on. OAKEN raced outside and went evenly. GOLDEN MONEY failed to
menace. KID RUSSELL battled for the lead in the four path inside the winner into the stretch, was bumped by that one at the furlong marker causing his
rider to check then lost momentum. TEH STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED IT'S OFFICIAL FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETECH AND PLACED HIM LAST.
