CORE was up close, a factor on the turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. MORNING THOUGHTS stalked the leaders from the
outside and had a bid on the turn but with the lead from the three path in upper stretch was outgunned. WORKIN OUT was unhurried early, saved ground
on the turn and was up for show. ACTION POINT was well back and closed the gap on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch evened out. M
C JACKHAMMER was away alertly but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. NAVAL OFFICER forced the
early pace and dueled on the turn but weakened through the stretch. VOYANT set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but was empty. A

FUN COOL stalked the early leaders, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. MS. P'S BELLA was away alertly,
raced evenly from the inside on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. DREAMINOFPASSION broke poorly, had a mild
gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. EASY ACCESS was hustled early and a factor on the turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. KOZY KAT was in mid pack and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no
response. NEW YORK MINT was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but was never as threat.

BORN TO BE GOOD was hustled early, raced evenly from the inside on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch proved best. HONEY GIRL set a pressured
pace and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was caught late. TICKLE HER TOE was in touch and had a good position
on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. LETS RUN TWO was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch needed more. ROYAL CITY REIGN was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. MS SUEDOO was
well back, trailed the field on the turn and had no impact. KATY AND EMMA showed speed from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the six
path at the top of then stretch was eased to the wire.

BEYOND MY DREAMS settled off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch drew clear. HALF LIT was away
alertly, dueled on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. DOTTED LINE stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and
had the lead from the five path in mid stretch but gave way. A I INITIATIVE was well back, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of
the stretch finished well. DIAMONDBACK was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch faded. CRYPTIC
CREED was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.
