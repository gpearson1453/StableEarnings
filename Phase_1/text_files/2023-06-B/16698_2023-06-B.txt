marker and drew clear in the final sixteenth. POGI raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and rallied for
second. BUSTIN LOOSE had the rider briefly lose the irons in the early stages, recovered at the five furlong marker, chased two wide, bid on the turn,
dueled, gained a short lead, dug in and weakened late. COUNTERFEITCURENCY raced two wide off the pace, went four wide past the quarter pole and
lacked a rally. DR. DOYLE chased on the inside, chased on the turn and tired. ON THE COME UP set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL STRENGTH settled off the pace, chased on the far turn, rallied outside rivals turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker, put a head in
front and edged away late. DAD'S ON A ROLL pressed the pace racing close up outside, chased on the far turn, bid two wide nearing the quarter pole,
rallied between horses in the stretch drive, dug in gamely and came up second best. LIDIA'S PRAYER set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the
far turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in inside rivals, then weakened. BRANDON'S SMILE bobbled slightly at the break, raced off the pace inside and did not
factor. BROOKLAWN raced off the pace, gave way and stopped.
