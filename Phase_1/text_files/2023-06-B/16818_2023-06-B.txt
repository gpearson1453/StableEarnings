Footnotes
GREAT FACES was well rated early, made a middle move to split rivals leaving the seven sixteenths, was clear by the five sixteenths and widened the
margin off the turn, then was kept to mild right handed crop urging to prove best. KIDYOUNOT vied for the early lead four wide, three wide on the turn and
ran on to the wire, second best. AHSAD vied for the lead in between rivals, inside on the turn and weakened, lasted for the show award. ZIPPER ZAPPER
was reluctant to load, four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace three wide, inside by the quarter pole and weakened. SINGLINO was hard held early on
the inside and tired. GABBYS BIG NOTION was void of early speed and failed to menace. IM YOUR PAPI vied for the lead on the inside and gave way,
stopped.

Footnotes
KERANOS was rated between rivals early, advanced two wide on the turn, then continued that bid two wide in the lane and drew clear in the final sixteenth
to prove best, driving. BOYD'S BAND set the pace while racing off the rail, then was pressed by the half mile marker, shook clear again entering the turn
and drew clear by the quarter pole, but was caught by the sixteenth marker and could not go with the winner late, clearly second best. MR LAOBAN stalked
the pace four wide early, three wide on the turn chasing the pace, weakened while besting the rest. RIVER FULL stalked the early pace and then went up to
press the pace by the half mile marker on the inside but tired. EL PATOJO was off a step slow, reserved two wide and had no rally. UNXPECTED TIGER
was reserved early, wide on the backstretch, then saved ground on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally. STELLWAGEN
BANKER was four wide into the first turn, chased the ;pace on the outside and tired. HAPPYIZE chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

MY BEAUTIFUL BELLE stalked the early pace three wide, then tracked the pace three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, closed well on the
outside to edged away late under left handed crop urging. WHISKEY AND RYE was away alertly and clear early, then was pressed on the outside by I'M
THE BOSS OF ME on the turn, shook clear of that rival leaving the turn to be clear by the furlong marker, but could not hold off the closing MY BEAUTIFUL
BELLE late while staying on for the place award. I'M THE BOSS OF ME was away alertly, let WHISKEY AND RYE go and shifted out two wide and went up
to press that rival, two wide on the turn and came three wide into the lane to have aim on that rival but had no kick in the lane while besting the other foe.
CAN THE QUEEN was off slowly, rushed up four wide to be close up entering the turn, dropped to the two path on the turn but fell back, weakened.

Footnotes
GRAND MACALLAN set the pace while in the two path and clear, well handled and came three wide off the turn, dug in gamely in the furlong grounds and
held sway to prove best, driving. THE GREAT GAZOO was well placed on the inside, made a inside bid leaving the turn and was slowly gaining to the wire
but needed more. INDYBOUND stalked the winner two to three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane to have aim but hung in the final furlong,
bested rest. MEAN TWEETS chased the early pace two wide, shifted out on the turn and advanced three to four wide but lacked the needed rally in the
drive. BRIGHT FORECAST was settled early, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. OILER chased the pace three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
PYRON was rated early between rivals, two wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn for aim on the front runners, closed well on the outside to
draw clear in the final hundred yards to prove best, driving. LIKE WHAT I SEE set the early pace on the inside, then was headed on the turn by BOWIE
TWO STEP on the turn, turned back that bid leaving the turn and shook clear, but could not hold off the winner late, second best. BOWIE TWO STEP
prompted the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command but weakened the final furlong. KINGPIN was off slowly, chased
the pace on the inside and stopped.
