Footnotes
CATCH THAT PARTY was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, saved ground while rated off the pace, moved closer with six furlongs to run,
drafted inside while behind the leader on the far turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to inside the three-sixteenths and checked behind horses,
had the runner-up get a big jump on him in the process, altered out for room near the eighth-pole, accelerated quickly while rallying in the final furlong,
closed fast into the final sixteenth and got up while nudging the runner-up at the finish. AGENT CREED was taken in hand early, dropped in entering the first
turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was reserved under restraint, went two then three wide while patiently handled on the far turn, rallied four wide into
the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, shook clear under a solid hand-ride into the final furlong, remained clear under a
confident hand-ride into the final seventy yards, had the rider take a peek behind him at that juncture and was seemingly surprised by the winners presence
coming on the outside, was put to a stronger hand-ride to the finish and was denied while nudged at the wire. BATTLE SCARS dropped back after the start,
moved from the two path to the rail early on the first turn, was unhurried at the rear, saved ground while asked on the far turn, swung five wide while gaining
into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR was taken in hand early, stalked the pace
on the outside in the three path, was given his cue on the far turn, chased the leader under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. BARRAGE was
hustled from the start, showed speed on the outside of an opponent, dropped from the two path to the rail while moving to a solo lead on the first turn,
showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper
stretch,
lost
the
advantage
to
the
winner
inside
the
three-sixteenths,
threw
his
right
hind
shoe
inside
the
furlong
marker
and
tired.
BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the inside of a foe, was taken up while wrestled back off the pace midway through
the first turn then fought the rider rankly while moving to the two path, tracked the leader down the backstretch, chased between foes in the two path on the
far turn, was taken in hand while dropping back into upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
PITCH CLOCK broke in at the start and was corrected, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn
getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, then edged away under a drive to
prevail. STUNNINGLY chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick to secure the place honors. PORTAGE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside five
furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out,
kept on to preserve the show honors well clear of the rest. ST. BENEDICTS PREP chased just off the inside coming under prolonged coaxing from the half
mile pole, was placed to a drive midway on the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. VITA DE VITO hard to load prior to the start,
chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued along the inside route into upper stretch, tired. SPELL ON YOU coaxed from the
gate, weaved in and out striding greenly early on when growing detached at the tail of the field, chased along the inside well behind, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. HOLLYWOODLAND chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and folded.

INTO HAPPINESS bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, was forwardly placed on the outside, ranged up in the four path on the turn, took the lead at
the five-sixteenths, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch and widened under steady urging. CHASING
DAYLIGHT lost her footing some at the start then bumped multiple times with a foe, settled off the pace, was roused while moving from three to five wide on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place. LA AGUILILLA bumped multiple times with a rival while brushing with another
at the start then was taken up sharply, settled at the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, came five wide into upper stretch,
remained on her inside lead in the drive and earned the show while no match for the top two. JULIANA'S ROSE bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the
pace on the inside of an opponent, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths, went five then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into upper
stretch and had nothing left. MY SWEET SUMMER showed speed on the inside of a foe and led early, contested the pace on the inside, vied along the rail
on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and faded. DASHING DELLA broke in then brushed with a foe
before being corrected by the rider, showed speed on the outside of a rival then was taken under a tight hold, moved out while tugging at the bit near the
three-quarter pole then went to a short lead, vied outside in the three path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and stopped.

command inside that station, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive inside the eighth pole, saw that margin cut into while
getting geared down near the finish. MISCHIEF JOKE chased three wide getting coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper
stretch, closed well to secure the place honors. ANTONIO OF VENICE stumbled at the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. SPLIT STRIKE fractious in the gate prior to the start, traded a lean at the start with A KNIGHT'S
COURAGE, vied from the two path between foes clinging to command and coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed just inside that station,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. KHADULLAH bobbled at the break, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. A KNIGHT'S COURAGE traded a lean at the start with SPLIT STRIKE, chased
along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DR SCHUSTER chased five wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, tired. UNAUDITED broke in at the start bumping BLUE EIGHTY FIVE, chased
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths and made no impact. BLUE EIGHTY FIVE was bumped at the start by UNAUDITED, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from midway on the turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. MO BATTEN coaxed from the gate, vied inside a pair
from the get go coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and tired through to the

Footnotes
ORANGE FREEZE was rated off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, rallied outside to get the lead in upper stretch,
kicked clear outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under a strong hand-ride to the finish. CAMCHA settled off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then moved further out, chased the winner under a drive to the finish and narrowly earned the place. LEM ME
DRINK was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and just missed the
place while clear for the show. JANNIE MAE showed speed then tracked the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased the
winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. KARA PARA settled towards the rear, was roused three wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. NEVER PERSONAL stumbled at the start but broke with the field, moved up to take the lead then went clear with
seven furlongs to run, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong and gave way. MY CARA MIA MINE was reserved under a tight hold at the rear, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue near the
five-sixteenths and failed to rally. MIZZ ME settled on the outside but with some cover, was urged five wide on the turn, remained on her inside lead in the
stretch and failed to respond. BOURBON DIVERSION was reserved near the back on the outside, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn
and failed to threaten. SHOPPINGATBLOOMIES came away in good order, was well placed towards the front, traveled around the turn in the two path and
came up empty. DREAMING OF CARLI settled on the outside without the benefit of cover, was asked four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path near
the quarter-pole and failed to respond. GIGGLING GHOST was reserved off the pace, went three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and was
no factor.

Footnotes
KHALI MAGIC went to the front, showed the way with some company to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked while near the rail at the
quarter-pole, inched clear under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging. ADELIESE'S
SMILE pressed the pace on the outside, was taken up leaving the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, pursued
the winner under a left-handed crop while remaining on her inside lead, switched to a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker, swapped to her proper
lead outside the sixteenth-pole, gained on the winner late and just missed while clear for the place. CUPID'S HEART tracked the pace on the outside, made
a bid near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and was
outfinished while clear for the show. TO A T settled towards the rear, was roused while inside early on the turn, moved to the two path later on that bend,
was driven three wide into the stretch and gained ground but failed to threaten. ROYAL POPPY settled off the pace, moved in leaving the backstretch,
dropped from the two path to the rail while roused on the turn and lacked the needed response. CUPIDS GIRL settled at the rear of the field, was roused
two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

BORN DANCER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from Z DANCER to the outside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under late threat from a trio and held on gamely to prevail. ALL GOOD HERE
got bumped at the start by CHULLIGAN, who broke inwards, then got bumped by Z DANCER coming outwards and in turn bumped CHULLIGAN in concert
with FERRIS MULER to pinch back that rival, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, closed well outside kicking belatedly and missed at the end while just getting up for the
place honors. TONY O coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive along the rail rallying to latch on the leader inside the final sixteenth but missed at the end. STOW ON THE WOLD chased three then
two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. CAPTAIN PARTY chased two to
three wide down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, kept
on under a drive to the finish but was out-finished in the late stages. Z DANCER broke out at the start bumping ALL GOOD HERE against CHULLIGAN and
causing half the pressure that pinched back that second rival, pressed the pace of BORN DANCER from the outside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths on near even terms, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. FERRIS MULER broke in at the start and bumped
CHULLIGAN, then got bumped by CHULLIGAN and pinched that foe back in tandem with pressure inside from Z DANCER, chased briefly just off the inside
and got steadied near the seven-eighths shuffling back GOSSIPING PANDO in behind, chased along the inside before darting out four wide inside the
nine-sixteenths, went six wide through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued six wide into upper stretch and made no late headway.
CHULLIGAN got bumped at the start by FERRIS MULER and then bumped again by ALL GOOD HERE due to pressure from Z DANCER and was pinched
back and steadied out between foes conceding five lengths to the front, came under urging and chased three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tipped five wide through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, made no headway through to the
finish. UNAFFECTED chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. GOSSIPING PANDO away towards the rear, got shuffled back when FERRIS MULER
steadied back directly in front, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no
response. BORDER PATROL chased three wide just off the top pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and tired.
OYSTA chased along the inside, grew detached at the tail of the field nearing the far turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch well behind and unable
to make an impact, and was eased home to the finish.
