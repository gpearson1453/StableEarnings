in an extended drive. IGNITED , four wide around the turn, advanced outside horses to challenge for the lead in mid stretch and hung. STAR SHOPPING ,
rated along the inner rail around the turn, was in hand waiting for room in upper stretch, altered course to the outside of the top pair near the sixteenth pole
and rallied. MY BOY PADDY , wide around the turn, floated to the six path in mid stretch, raced on his left lead and rallied outside rivals. CLASS WIZARD
saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. KILLY START , raced between horses on the turn, failed to respond

Footnotes
MISS ANTIETAM vied outside a rival before going clear leaving the five eighths, drafted in and set a rated pace around the turn, moved away after being set
down to a drive in upper stretch, kept on under strong encouragement past the sixteenth marker then lasted. LOOKING FOR WATER , off a bit slow when
rank leaving the gate, was taken wide soon after, gathered momentum under a ride past the five sixteenths, circled four wide into the stretch, leveled off to
her best stride near the sixteenth pole and quickly gained in the final fifty yards. BRIGHT MOON settled three wide while not far back, edged up leaving the
far turn, was put to asking chasing past the five sixteenths then lacked a serious stretch response. CORA'S CHOICE , under firm rating three wide stalking
the leaders, took aim two wide mid turn, was under a hearty ride pursuing into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. ELIKA , off the pace while two
wide, failed to go on under asking mid turn and retreated. SKY BUY vied early inside the winner, saw that one get away leaving the far turn, remained in
touch under a ride past the five sixteenths then dropped back through the drive. MOLLIE TAPPER rushed up towards the rail nearing the five eighths, failed
to keep up mid turn and gave way.

Footnotes
AFANDI , in hand leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn under confident rating, eased out in upper stretch, took command outside FAST LANI
near the sixteenth pole then drew out under a hand ride. FAST LANI sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground around the turn, was still in front in mid
stretch and weakened late. CHROMEPLATED HEART , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, failed to rally in an even effort. CUT FROM
CLASS , four wide on the turn, shut off CAROLINA SUN when bearing in near the three sixteenths pole then flattened out. CAROLINA SUN , steadied on
the heels of SKYLAR'S SISTER mid way down the backstretch, raced inside horses on the turn, was in the two path entering the stretch, checked when
shut off, angled out and closed gamely between horses. QUEEN SHEBA , five wide entering the stretch, passed tired horses. BITTY BOSS raced between
horses in the stretch and failed to menace. AWESOME JAZZ , no factor, was six deep turning for home. ALLA BREVE , three wide chasing the pace around
the turn, gave way in mid stretch. SKYLAR'S SISTER , taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained along the rail thereafter and
weakened. Following an objection by the rider of CAROLINA SUN, CUT FROM CLASS was disqualified and placed fifth.

Footnotes
DILLINGER , three deep stalking the pace, steadily advanced under coaxing into the lane, closed in under stout left handed encouragement, reeled in the
leader with a sixteenth to go and drew away while kept to task. CHILDERS quickly went clear, set a rated pace towards the rail, came under pressure in
upper stretch, could not fend off the winner's charge leaving the sixteenth pole but stayed on gamely to be well clear of the rest. BAR DOWN EXPRESS
chased between rivals and went evenly in the final furlong. WIND EVENT , fractious at the gate, broke slowly, lagged well back while saving ground,
continued inside through the lane and finished well. ENERGY EFFICIENT saved ground under asking past the three eighths, worked outward in the drive
and had belated interest. ISRAELI ARMY prompted the early pace while saving ground, chased inside a pair of foes mid turn, eased out a bit for the drive
and faded. NORTH HIGHLAND , two wide while off the pace leaving the far turn, angled four wide and failed to menace. DYNA BLAST , three wide, gave
way.

Footnotes
STERN CHASER sprinted clear entering the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail and dug in tenaciously late. CARMEL SUNRISE , lapped outside the
winner throughout, gamely chased that one. PALACSINTA stalked the pace racing along the inner rail throughout and weakened. CUSH EFFECT lacked
speed, swung four wide leaving the far turn and passed tired horses. BESSIE BLUE , steadied in close quarters entering the first turn, raced in the two path
on the far turn and was not a factor. STAGE CALL , three wide the first turn, had a mild, three wide advance on the far turn then gave way in upper stretch.
LA SANTA CLARA raced inside horses down the backstretch and was done on the far turn. NO SHARING , four deep the first turn, circled the far turn three
wide and was not a late factor. MIDSUMMER STORM raced along the inner rail and dropped back.

Footnotes
BIOGENIC BABE prompted the pace outside SWEET BEAUTY, moved to the attack three furlongs out, wrested command heading to the quarter pole,
spurted clear leaving the three sixteenths, met the outside threat from LOVELY LIZA past the furlong grounds, kept on under energetic handling and proved
resolute to the wire. LOVELY LIZA stalked the leaders three wide, was coaxed along from the three furlong pole, ranged up outside the winner leaving mid
stretch, continued valiantly to but was kept at bay through the final yards. SWEET BEAUTY sped to the front along the rail, was confronted leaving the far
turn, battled past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on with the winner leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. SPENCERIAN saved ground pursuing,
worked outward in the lane but failed to menace. CLOSERTOTHEHEART stumbled at the break and was away last, raced wide off the pace and failed to
rally.

I'M NOT A BABY settled four then three wide heading to the turn, dropped in and secured the rail leaving the three eighths, closed in under right handed
asking, engaged STEP AHEAD from his inside in mid stretch, wrested command a sixteenth out and slowly edged away. STEP AHEAD took command
early and set a rated pace toward the rail, was guided three wide while clear into the lane, dropped in a path leaving the quarter pole, met the winner's rail
bid leaving the three sixteenths, sparred from mid stretch past the sixteenth marker, switched over to his left lead and gave way grudgingly. ICETECA , off
the pace two wide, was lightly steadied off the heels of the winner mid turn, angled out to be five wide entering the stretch, drifted in when making progress
in mid stretch, straightened and churned on. NOT AS LUCKY AS US saved ground while off the pace, made a mild run towards the rail in mid stretch then
flattened out. OBOY , three to four wide stalking the pace, faded. ASK HIM OAKEY edged up early and stalked the pace, was under asking mid turn, came
four wide for the drive and tired. MIZWARRIOR , off the rail stalking the leaders, was pushed along into the lane, lacked a punch and retreated through the
final quarter mile. GREAT COCKTAIL stumbled at the break and was away last, lost ground four to five wide, faltered soon into the stretch and was eased
through the final furlong. An objection by the rider of ICETECA against the winner for alleged interference around the turn was not allowed
