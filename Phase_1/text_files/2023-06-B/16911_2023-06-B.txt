Footnotes
ALATION tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, angled out and made room three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain
and drew off late. RAINAS ROLLIN set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then was no match in the late going and
held the place. STRAIGHT MADNESS unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing
room and lost the path, then could not gain late when clear. CHEAP AND CHEERFUL hard to rated, vied on the outside through the turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. HIGH DOLLAR DATE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, lugged in and faded. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF STRAIGHT MADNESS AGAINST THE RIDER OF ALATION
RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

SPIRITED DEBATE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenged and lasted under steady pressure. GOVERNOR ATWOOD
stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain, closed the
gap on the winner late and lacked the needed kick. RED GUN hopped at the start, looped up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the
stretch, closed willingly and missed the place. CHANGE THE HOUR well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, angled out for racing room and had a mild gain. ALWAYS THERE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn,
came three wide into the stretch and had no rally.

COLONEL POPPY stalked the pace while rating on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader gaining a
short lead into the stretch, then drove clear late. I STRONG broke sharply and was rated back, looped up two and three wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the stretch and closed well for the place. CACTUS KEVIN unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
evened out. RAINBOW'S PRIDE well placed, raced boxed through the turn on the two path, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out, then
drifted in and flattened. STEERAGE well placed, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. TRUCKIN
TOMMY set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. DISASTER RECOVERY tracked the pace,

Footnotes
CREATIVE CHOICE sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then came again late and drove clear.
CLEMSON TIGER well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
gaining a short lead, then was no match in the late going and held the place. BATTLE CREEK well placed and inside, angled out and moved up three wide
through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, weakened late and held the show. GOODTIME ARTIE angled in down the backstretch to track the
pace, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. PAPA CHARLES allowed to settle, looped up
three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. ROWDY JESS mid pack and inside, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong. FARM STRONG mid pack, moved up two and three wide through
the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. K. K. ICHIKAWA was no factor. HAD RIGHT was never involved.
