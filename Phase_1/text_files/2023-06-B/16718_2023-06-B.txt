Footnotes
DEAL WITH IT DADDY in the second flight while between horses, moved closer in the three path late in the turn, saw his progress stall on the winner upper
stretch, roused, late surge to win going away at the end. SOUNDS LIKE POWER broke sharp, dueled up front into the turn closest to the inside, disposed of
the other speed by late in the bend to shake free, edged away from the runner up in upper stretch then failed to contain that one in the late going. EL
DINERO in the second group outside the winner, moved closer with that one late in the turn, lacked a further advance, finished well clear of the others.
POP'S PEPPYSTEPER also raced in the second flight for three furlongs, crept a bit closer along the inside late in the bend then came up empty for the
stretch run. BABY'S LAST DANCE fell back to trail after the start, did not menace. POUND OUT A DEAL broke alertly, dueled outside the runner up for
three furlongs and stopped late turn.

Footnotes
MY PAL MATTIE broke on top, set all the pace, drew off under his own courage in a sharp effort. DANCIN WITH ANGELS back off the pace inside, moved
closest to the winner turning for home, chased that one in vain past the furlong marker, no match, proved determined for the place. SEAU headed up the
second flight up the backstretch between horses, long drive for the place, outkicked late by the runner up. SCRAPPY ARTIE never menaced while racing
outside.

BITSY C C LIL GIRL outrun early while firmly in hand, continued under restraint into the turn, advanced into a striking position while three wide into the lane,
took over when straightened for home, clear late when drifting in, continued to hold sway. MARDI GRAS ALARM dueled up front off the inside, garnered a
larger advantage late in the turn, offered some resistance to the winner in upper stretch inside that one then could not keep up, steadied late, second best.
THE GREY BEAUTY chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch off the inside, came four wide for the drive, idled past the furlong marker, came back to
earn the show while not a serious late threat to the top two. BOSTON LUCILLE last to leave, void of early foot, ranged up to become a minor threat five wide
turning for home, flattened out the final furlong to lose the show. RESPOSADO dueled up front inside the runner up, gave ay turning for home. LIGHT AS A
WHISPER settled off the pace, backed up through the stretch.

COURAGEOUS TIMMY off a step slow, raced well back up the backstretch and into the turn, angled out widest for the drive, finished full of run down the
middle of the strip to be edging clear at the wire. LONG ARROW in the second flight inside, asked for run midway on the turn, roused along the rail entering
the stretch, tipped out a bit for some run, challenged with a sixteenth to run between foes, could not contain the winner late. FUNNY ACTOR in the second
group outside the runner up, came three wide for the drive, lodged a mild bid in late stretch, not enough for the top two late. VEGAS GUY dueled up front
closest to the inside, shook clear upper, weakened. ROYAL UNLIMITED alternated up front in the two path, gave way. WAR REPORTER fell back to trail by
a wide margin after the start, continued sluggishly into the turn, eased, vanned off.

Footnotes
SEEHOSS forwardly placed past the wire the first time, tucked in to save some ground into the first turn, tracked up the backstretch, in some traffic when
inching closer midway on the final turn, split foes under clever handling upper straight, gained command, repelled the winner late under steady handling.
BONUS APPRECIATION in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide out of the final turn, challenged outside the winner inside the furlong grounds,
turned back, held sway for the place. BATTLE OF WILL fell back after the start, continued to lack speed the middle half mile, five wide turning into the
stretch, staged a mild rally to garner the show. VALIANT DEFENDER last to leave, trailed while devoid of any early foot, advanced quickly late in the final
turn, angled out for room entering the stretch, traffic with a sixteenth to run, finished up evenly when clear. BARAHIN broke on top, chased early, soft duel in
the two path the middle half, weakened in the final furlong. YOUR TIME'S COMING settled off the pace, steadied in some traffic toward the rail with three
furlongs to run, came up empty when clear for the drive. XIETELEHUAS remained back in failing to menace. BRYKEN N MITCHELL took command to be
clear early, dueled the middle four furlongs through some modest fractions along the inside, gave way upper stretch. TIN DELAY four wide when forwardly
placed through the first turn, remained prominent in the run up the backstretch, weakened in the second bend.

Footnotes
MARINA broke in to bump and bother inner rivals, angled toward the inside, dueled into and through early turn, steadily kicked away while being kept to task
through the lane. AMELIES DREAMER broke forwardly, dueled up front outside the winner, failed to keep up with that one from late in the turn on in, fully
extended to save the place. SUNSET FLASH broke back, and was bothered soon after, void of speed, was five wide out of the turn, staged a willingly rally
down the middle of the start to be rapidly getting to the runner up. PERIPHERAL VISION in mid pack while inside, continued to save ground turn, displayed
some modest late interest to improve position. SILK NOT SATIN bumped at the start, raced back and well out in the strip, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a
serious closing response. A. P. STYLE bumped and bothered by the winner at the break, recovered to race closest to the dueling top two for three furlongs
and began to weaken. CAN SHE VENT in the second fight early, brushed in some traffic turning for home, faded. ELLA'S BABY in the second group, was
idling in traffic when forced to check up in tight turning for home, backed up in the run to the wire. TIZ A BREAKUP remained always back in failing to
menace. LUCILLE'S CANDY wheeled at the start, vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START AND THE RUN OUT OF
THE TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

INTIMIDATION broke forwardly, allowed the pace to go while saving ground, moved closer in some traffic into the far turn, moved out three wide for room
when straightened for home, outside bid past the furlong marker, drew clear under firm handling. MINNESOTA MIRACLE broke with the lead despite
bobbling, dueled up front in the two path, allowed a rival the rail after a half, helped pick up the pace in the far turn, vied between foes into the lane,
extended drive, proved stubborn to the end, game for the place. WHEN'S TEE TIME in mid pack while off the inside, roused in the second fight outside the
winner late in the final turn, three wide for the drive, stalled a bit in midstretch then managed a late push to be getting to the runner up. SNIVELING
forwardly placed early along the inside, moved up the rail to challenge just before a half, vied along the rail through the final turn, remained on equal terms
with the top two with a furlong to run then weakened late. CHAOSMOS raced in mid pack off the pace, came three wide for the drive, improved slightly
without posing a serious threat late. U S NAVY CROSS void of speed, four wide exiting the final turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had
been decided. JUST DEAL WITH IT last away, was never a serious threat. G VICTORY dueled outside the runner up in the three path first turn and onto the
backstretch, continued to contest the issue three wide second bend, gave way. GUITAR TRIBUTE was finished after a half.

Footnotes
BLESSED ASSURANCE fell back after the break, continued back and well out in the strip into the turn, made a nice move four wide into contention late in
the bend, took over when straightened for home, kicked steadily clear under firm handling. CAJUN CATALINA with the pace from the start, vied three wide
into and through the turn, proved no match for the winner in chasing that one home, held the place. SHESABEAUTYDANCER with the pace from along the
inside despite stumbling at the break, held a narrow advantage into the lane, also had little for the winner to the wire, outkicked for the runner up position.
BANDIT'S PRIDE fell back to trail after the start, four to five wide exiting the turn, improved position. DOLLY'S GUITAR settled in mid pack, lacked a closing
response. MY KIKI in the second flight early, began a steady fade before three furlongs. BUILDING HOME vied up front while between horses, gave way.

Footnotes
BUCK DOLL TAYLOR fractious prior to the start, broke well, relinquished the lead soon after, pressed into the turn, took over turning for home, edged away
late under steady handling. TRIPLE RED ACES moved up the inside to set the early pace after not breaking with the early leaders, continued to show the
way turn, headed into the lane by the winner, gave ground grudgingly to that one until late, lasted for the place. SUNNY SASSICAIA back off the early pace,
worked way toward the rail turn, roused in the two path exiting the bend, slowly gaining for the place late. ARKANSAS ZONG within striking distance
outside, four wide turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. STEAUXLIT off slowly, lacked speed for three furlongs, picked off a
few tiring rivals while not posing a serious threat. WICKED TOUGH in the second flight early, had little for the drive. FIGHTING SOLDIER mid pack early,
began a steady retreat before three furlongs. TEXAS PHAROAH off a step slow, trailed well back, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.
