Footnotes
GAGOOTS was unhurried early and raced far back along the inside, advanced to the second turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and
wore down his rivals to get up late. BEHAVIN MYSELF bobbled slightly at the start, set a pressured pace, swung out on the turn, drew clear, led to deep
stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. WHERE'D THE DAY GO settled off the pace, advanced to the turn, shifted out, bid, had little left, hung late and
held for show. KRAMDEN raced in the back, finished well and gained late. PISTOL BOX was unhurried early, saved ground, lacked a stretch response
under mild urging and did not threaten. BLURT pressed the pace to the second turn, fell back, leveled off and steadily faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
TEA WITH LEMON raced mid pack, rallied on the turn, got through along the rail entering the stretch, vied for the lead, was in tight near the eighth pole,
inched away and held well. TIZWOW got away well, stalked the pace, swung out a bit entering the stretch, closed under steady urging, didn't have enough
late and finished second best. CHAD'S FLASH hesitated and brushed at the start, stalked the pace along the inside while racing in hand, bid between
horses to contend, hung late and settled for show. FABRICATOR was fractious in the gate, saved ground early and failed to menace in an even effort.
DASTARDLY DEEDS brushed at the start and was outrun. CAMPISI broke in the air to be away slowly, was hustled along to set the pace with a clear lead,
was in tight near the eighth pole and stopped.

Footnotes
SIMPSON BAY stumbled badly at the start, dropped inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly, drifted in in the drive
and drew clear to win going away. SHARP STICK vied along the rail, was checked hard entering the turn, came again inside to contend and was outclosed
in a game effort. A P BLAZING GREEN vied between horses, inched away at the top of the stretch and was outclosed. DARK SOLUTION pressed the pace,
dropped back leaving the turn and lacked the needed late response. FROSTED TEMPTATION vied between horses early, was taken back, closed well and
didn't have enough late. SMOOTH ATTACK raced between horses to the turn, vied to mid stretch and faltered. ICE SHARD hesitated and was pinched
back at the start and improved position in an even effort. INDIO GUAPO veered out and was steadied at the start and did not threaten. SMILING STORMY
broke in, raced close towards the outside, lacked a stretch response and gave way. ARTIE AND JESSIE stalked outside to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
JEALOUS EYES went five wide on the first turn, challenged three across on the second turn, drew off in the drive and was vanned off. MEMPHIS PRAYER
was crowded at the start, was unhurried early, bid inside on the second turn, angled out for the drive and closed well to finish second best.
IMPULSIVENESS broke slowly, trailed the field, bid inside on the turn, angled out and finished well to earn show. COMMAND CENTRAL broke out and
bumped at the start, vied to the second turn, tired and gave way. PINBALLER got away well, vied inside, weakened in the drive and faded. GATE CREW
lagged early, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a response. FORWARD CURVE was in tight at the start, raced mid pack and had nothing left for
the drive. OVER CALENDARED bumped at the start, stalked the pace and was through after a half. MODIFIER was crowded at the start and failed to
threaten in an even effort.
