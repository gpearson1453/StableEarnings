TUATHA vied for the early lead from the inside and drew off to be well clear under steady pressure. CAROLS KITTEN was coaxed along two deep and was
no match for the winner in the drive to finish second best. GODDESS OF WONDER was hustled from the gate, raced near the rail throughout and kept on to
the wire. MISS RITA dropped near the back of the pack early on, advanced four to five wide around the far turn and improved position while racing from the
outside. SHE'S A PLAYER was off a step slow, raced three to four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. BOUJEE BRITT chased the pace four
deep from the outside foes and weakened. RUNNIN BOOTS chased from the outside, checked early on and faded in the drive.

from the inside, angled to race four wide and rallied late for the place position. ELDON'S SAMURAI broke to the outside, chased the early leader racing two
deep and weakened. MAJOR GRIFFIN raced mid pack early, was four deep into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. ELUSIVE FREUD was slow early,

a firm hold early, made a strong bid near the three sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire. KYEMBEA tracked the early pace two deep and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. SCHLEICHER was unhurried early on, raced two to three wide and never was a factor. WARRIOR'S STAR quick to
begin to set the early pace and gave way.

late interest. TOAH dueled outside of foe and weakenened. CHARING CROSS was slow early, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. LIMBO'S PROMISE
