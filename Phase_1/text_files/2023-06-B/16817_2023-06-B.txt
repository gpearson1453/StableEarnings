Footnotes
BARE BACK JACK sat in striking position, was asked to quicken leaving the backstretch, dueled through the final turn inside of CHROME KING, and edged
clear of the rival in the final sixteenth. CHROME KING was allowed to settle early, stalked outside through the backstretch, dueled for the lead in the final
turn, but was unable to get by late. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR tracked inside, lost ground leaving the backstretch, and tired. BIG AL'S VISION assumed the
lead, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, and was done early.

Footnotes
ENTITLED STAR raced widest through the backstretch, moved up closer into the far turn while three wide, came under light handling into the stretch, and
won driving. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY contested the early pace while five wide, dueled outside of FLASHY BIZ leaving the backstretch, struck the front into
the lane then came under heavy encouragement but was no match for the winner late stretch and held firm for place. VALUE DANCER cruised up outside
into striking range, was roused near the quarter pole, lodged a rail bid into the stretch but was unable to get by rival late stretch despite her best efforts.
CAPA BELLA lead the way leaving the chute, dropped back through the backstretch, drove three to four wide at the head of the lane, and improved position
late stretch. DAZZLING CHIC sat midpack while four wide, and lacked the rally needed. MY EXPRESSION trailed the field into the final turn and passed
tiring rival. FLASHY BIZ pressed the pace from a rail position and faltered.

Footnotes
WHISKARITA raced four to five wide entering the opening turn, moved up to contest the pace leaving the backstretch, drew clear nearing the final turn, and
opened up through the stretch under a confident hand ride. SKY DESTINY tracked in the four path, hustled leaving the backstretch, went wide into the final
turn, and closed gradually under handling. FLASHY SISTER unhurried early, stalked outside, fanned three wide in the far turn, went in pursuit of the leader
but was no match for the eventual winner and was worn down late stretch. KERIK fanned four wide in the first turn, sat just off the pace in the backstretch,
and came up empty in the drive. AMBER PRINCESS chased inside, and bid belatedly. SAVYSKYE vied inside for the early lead, was overtaken near the
three-eighths marker, and gave way. LITTLE HARPER was never far back and tired early.

SHE LOVES WINNIN sat just off the pace while five wide gained the lead near the three-eighths pole, turned back a challenge from LIGHT FAST FEET into
the lane, and held firm. LIGHT FAST FEET vied three wide for the early lead, chased the leaders through the far turn, swung out moving up menacingly, but
was unable to get by and finished second best. FLORIST trailed the field early, advanced quickly in the far turn, uncoiled a solid bid nearing the
three-sixteenth pole under urging but was unable to improve her position. EDGE OF OKOTOKS hustled inside, bumped THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI in the
backstretch, took back in the far turn, and offered a mild late bid. LOAD ABROAD broke outward, vied between foes for the early lead, was unable to keep
pace with the field, and retreated. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI bumped while along the rail, and yielded.

Footnotes
MINE ME tracked four to five wide, moved up into striking position, waited briefly at the quarter pole, angled out sharply, dug in under steady
encouragement to take over deep stretch, and held. PLUM BLUE raced from the back of the pack, was roused through the stretch, and closed gradually to
score second honours. TONE IT UP sat in striking distance outside, swung out in the final turn then angled inside under urging, closed gamely for show.
PRETTY ARIA saved ground while setting the pace, was under attack at the quarter pole, fought on inside and got caught. FLORAL prompted the pace
under a snug hold, fanned three wide in the far turn, and challenge the lead at the quarter pole then flattened out late stretch. DANCE SHOES saved inside,
rallied into the lane, and gave way.

Footnotes
SILVERFOOT went five wide into the opening turn, gained closer order outside through the backstretch, dueled outside of TOOL TIME, drew clear into the
stretch, and kept to task. KYSTONE sat midpack, angled out to the four-wide, drifted in at the head of the lane, closed steadily but was no match for the
eventual winner. ITSMYDAY tracked along the inside, lodged a late bid and was along for show. CALI CONQUEST closed late and missed. TOOL TIME
was outsprinted into the opening turn, sat just off the pace, dueled in the final turn, and flattened. RUNNINFORCOVER lacked a serious bid.
ANOTHERFORBROOKS was never involved. SPORTSCARR vied outside, and was done early.

Footnotes
WIDE EYED WILEY settled early, advanced quickly in the final turn then circled into the lane, drifted in under right-handed encouragement, struck the front
and held under a late drive. REMAIN CALM unhurried early, went four to five wide into the far turn, closed gamely, and narrowly missed after a determined
effort. BRODY'S PAL chased outside, went widest through the final turn, and rallied belatedly to score show. ZURI RISASI chased the pacesetters while five
wide, angled to the three path leaving the backstretch, rallied four wide at the quarter pole, was overtaken with a furlong remaining and weakened. CLEVER
CONNECTION bid belatedly. SPIRIT RACER broke alertly, contended the lead outside of REFUSE TO TESTIFY, dueled gamely in the final turn and gave
way late stretch. PUNCH PERFECT lagged early, and launched a late bid. REFUSE TO TESTIFY sped to the lead away from the gate, dueled inside of
SPIRIT RACER, was unable to move on with rival, and yielded. ANTIGUA BAY chased to no avail.
