Footnotes
BLUE MOUNTAIN took a quick lead and moved toward the inside to rate the pace, contested the advantage just off the rail on the turn and was steadily
handled to hold on well. AWESOME MOON chased, raced close in the three path on the turn and dueled clear in second mid-stretch. MICHEAUX chased
inside, rounded the turn near the rail, relented second mid-stretch but held on for third. JACKYSINTHECASTLE exchanged contact with Stowe Patrol
leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. I SHALLBE RELEASED chased, rounded the
turn in the five path and ran evenly in the stretch. LET'S DO THIS broke a step slow, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the
four path, but showed little in the lane. STOWE PATROL exchanged contact with Jackysinthecastle leaving the gate, gave only brief early chase, raced wide
on the turn and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
CLEARLY VISIBLE came away rank and inward and made contact with Congress Hall then saved ground well back, started a bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, steadily improved at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement through the stretch and took the nod under the wire. CRUZ
IN THE CASTLE raced with the pace two deep, was pressured with the advantage toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the turn, dug in
under steady right hand stretch encouragement but drifted outward in deep stretch and missed the nod under the wire. THUNDERTURTLE settled off the
rail on the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the four path, dug in from the head of the lane but was forced
out and had to steady late stretch. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY raced with the early pace, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the
rail nearing the quarter, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened later yards. CONGRESS HALL was bumped inward and into Ravenel leaving the gate,
rounded the first turn in the three path and gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn then flattened in the lane. SAX
saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four and five paths on the far turn and showed little in the
lane. RAVENEL was bumped leaving the gate then stalked from the four path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path then weakened into the lane. MAE SAI PRINCESS stalked from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on
the far turn. SHEMADEMELUCKY showed little response. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Cruz In The Castle for late stretch
interference, lodged by the rider of Thunderturtle, and disqualified the former to third place for forcing the latter outward through late yards.

Footnotes
IMINCHARGENOW gave chase and took the lead two deep midway on the turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn and held on well. JUJU ON
DA BEAT chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, altered course from the heels of Bowmans Lazy Girl toward mid-stretch and dug in
from there to take second later yards. LADY GANGSTER gave chase, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and came along to take third late.
LOCKDOWN VANNA chased, raced at the rail on the turn and flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL took over on the chute and
moved to the inside to set a pressured pace, but was caught midway on the turn and weakened the final sixteenth. SUNSET QUEEN chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, eased out leaving the turn but showed little in the lane. S S CASINO GIRL gave chase while saving ground.

ACADIAN GIRL rated a short lead inside, was urged into the far turn, widened at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. DIVINE FASHION saved
ground off the pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second best. VOLNAY stalked
the earlier pace two deep, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and took the nod for third in the final stride. TEQUILA
FOG settled off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane.
HIDDEN IDENTITY saved ground close to the pace but was boxed at the rail nearing the half mile pole, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened the final sixteenth. RED QUEEN raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened in the lane. MI CLEOPATRA AND I closed toward contention three wide through the front
stretch, raced in the three and four paths on the opening turn but showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
SISTER SPIRIT saved ground on the first turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole and circled rivals six wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead
passing the sixteenth pole and drew away later yards. JACCACI was bumped leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn and picked up the chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and dug in to take second the final yards. RATIONALMILLENNIAL came
away awkwardly then saved ground, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, clipped the heels of Hearditall midway on the far turn, quickly
recovered stride and left the turn three wide, angled to the rail mid-stretch and dug in to take the nod for third under the wire. PRETTY SPECTACULAR
rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase past the half mile pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, then finished evenly to pass rivals.
SPUNKY ZOEY ducked out and made contact with Jaccaci leaving the gate, raced in the three path on the first turn and picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole, raced close two deep through the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. CURLIN'S DOVE stalked three wide on the first turn,
challenged and took the lead leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn but was met mid-stretch and weakened.
LADY WHISTLEDOWN raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide then flattened in the
lane. RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled
to the rail into the lane and weakened. HEARDITALL stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, had her heels clipped midway on the far
turn and weakened. CONDUCTANCE was hustled with the lead early, ceded control and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadied in tight
and brushed the rail approaching the quarter pole and raced boxed in through the far turn.
