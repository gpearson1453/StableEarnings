NOT A WILD BRAT sprinted to the lead shortly after the start, set all the pace, turned back a bid rom the runner up in mid stretch and proved best while
drifting out under left handed urging. BOOGIE BOOGEE chased the winner from the start, drifted to the five path entering the stretch, drew on near even
terms for the lead at the furlong marker and was denied by the winner while finishing clear for second. GAIL'S DANCER never far back, finished with good
courage inside. DOUBLE EDGED bore in at the start bumping SARAH JANE stalked the pace into the stretch, swung wide and went evenly. SARAH JANE
was bumped at the start, in tight at the five eighths pole causing her rider to check then failed to menace. VICTOR STORY trailed.

pace and maintained his advantage under mild left handed urging. MR. BALI stalked the pace two wide into the stretch, angled inside near the furlong
marker and finished second best. HARSH TRUTH slow early, found his best stride late in the three path. KNOCK WOOD was hung five wide into the
clubhouse turn, settled outside and failed to respond. EL SORDO had a brief early lead entering the clubhouse turn as the winner drifted out, chased that
one along the inside to the top of the stretch then gave way. ELECTION INTEGRITY close up two then three wide, was through after a half.

Footnotes
WAY OF THE WORLD settled inside, responded under left hand urging through upper stretch to make the lead late two wide and drew off under strong
handling. GOLD APPEAL chased the pace from the inside into the stretch, inherited the lead past the furlong marker then was no match for the winner.
WICKED REESE chased the pace two wide into the stretch, was carried out to the six path by the leader and finished determinedly. MY TWO JAKES never
far back, moved up three wide into the stretch, drifted to the seven path then failed to sustain that bid. SHESANOTHERSONG broke in front, quickly opened
a daylight lead, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the five path and weakened late. SEE YA SISTA failed to menace. OH EYE SEE was no threat.
LISTEN LINDA LOU was outrun. HONEYBEE STINGS hopped at the start and was no factor.

SAMMY'S SMILE well placed near the inside, rallied three wide through the stretch under left handed urging and was along in time. MR LOOOCH pressed
the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead before the quarter pole, shook clear then couldn't handle the winner. DARK VADER stalked the pace
outside the top pair, moved closed in the five path nearing the top of the stretch then leveled off. GONE IN A FLASH was no factor. DERBY INCLUDED
hopped at the start and was no threat. MUTINY away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the far turn then weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
CONNECT ME unhurried early while saving ground, rallied two wide through the stretch under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. LEOLA
away alertly, set all the pace along the inside, dug in gamely and just missed hanging on. POT COMMITTED never far back, finished with good courage in
the four path. TWELVE MINUS ONE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. C C'S CLEAR CREEK bobbled at the start and was
through after a half. INSACIABLE PRINCE was no factor.
