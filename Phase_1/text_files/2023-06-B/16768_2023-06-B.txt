Footnotes
CENTAURUS was off slow, trailed the field early then moved between horses entering the turn, tipped out to three wide at the three furlong marker and kept
on to engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and won going away. SILENCE'S NATION pressed the pace from the two path and took a narrow lead at
the three furlong marker, inched away around the turn and was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way grudgingly but was a clear second.
GUTFIELD tracked the leader from the three path but was no match for the top two. BIGPARTY NOWHISKEY raced wide throughout and passed tiring
rivals. BARTSTER was off the pace while saving ground around the turn and never launched a bid. MAJOR TIMING was hustled to a pressured lead to the
three furlong marker and gave way.

THE RONALD tracked the leaders to the half marker then moved between horses at the three furlong marker and engaged the leader nearing the eighth
pole and drew clear. LOCO LUNA was off the pace then moved up the rail around the turn but lacked room, waited and shifted out to three wide at the
eighth pole for a late run but was too late. INCREDIBE MO went to a pressured lead for the first quarter then edged away around the turn and was collared
at the eighth pole and weakened. LINEARSPEED had brief foot then vied for the lead from three wide, moved out to four wide on the turn and in the stretch
showing a game effort. ENDALE ARCH trailed and was not a threat. LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT prompted the pace from between horses to the half marker
and retreated.

the lead from three wide then fell back on the turn, angled out to four wide for a late rally to be up for place. LIL LATIGO was reluctant to load, saved ground
throughout but lacked a late kick. CLEARLY MAD set the pace for a half then gave way grudgingly in the stretch. TOMBI was reluctant to load and was out
run.

FLIPLIT had no early speed through the turn then made a rail rally and drew clear in the final yards. MISS IZZY BEE chased the leader through the turn
then moved out to three wide in upper stretch and collared the leader in the final sixteenth but couldn't fend off the inside closer and was second best.
EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then moved up from three wide in upper stretch, moved out to four wide in the
final sixteenth and was just up for the show. MANDONA tracked the leaders down the backstretch, made a rail bid on the turn to take command at the top of
the stretch but was caught in the final sixteenth and was out finished in the final yards. T R'S FIRST raced in the middle of the pack from the two path then
moved out to four wide in upper stretch but lacked the late response. MISCHIEVIOUSLANIE sprinted to a clear lead for a half and tired.

COLLUSIONIST was roused to be off the pace through the turn then was asked at the top of the stretch and drew off. RONAMO was off a step slow then
rushed up to be in contention before the turn, made a three wide bid on the turn and showed late effort to be up for the place. LAUNCHED went to the front
to set the pace for a half then was over taken in early stretch and tired. BEDROCK tracked the leaders from the middle of the pack but failed to menace.
KICK IT saved ground to no avail. GOGO OXBOW raced wide throughout and was never a threat.
