Footnotes
MISS TRICKY INDY moved up inside to vie for the lead, inched away in the upper stretch and held well. GABRIELLA WHO got away well, vied to late
stretch, yielded grudgingly and finished second best. IT'S SAUL RIGHT was never far back, rallied around the turn, closed willingly and got up for show
while no threat to the top two. UNDO THE RIGHT was void of early speed, dropped inside to save ground, shifted out for the drive and lacked a late
response. MARQUEE'S STORM vied early, fell back to stalk the pace, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. CRAFTY WARRIOR pressed the pace to
the turn and stopped. ISLA JANE showed speed to the turn and stopped.

RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP stalked the pace, rallied four wide on the turn, closed steadily, inched away late andt held off the late charge off HOLLAND.
HOLLAND was never far off the pace in an outside trip, swung wide leaving the turn, closed well, shied from the whip and came out, was gaining late and
got up for place. SPINNING BLACK pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch, didn't have enough late and settled
for show. JULIA'S WARRIOR stalked the pace, got through along the rail on the turn, led briefly, weakened late and lost position. BIG EVENT set the pace,
responded when challenged to duel and faltered late. DADDY WHAT IF broke slowly, raced in the back, bid inside on the turn and lacked the needed rally.
LOOKING FOR BULL was outrun in an even effort.

Footnotes
BLACK EYED BANDIT raced wide, vied early, dropped back, swung wide leaving the turn, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. MONTEREY
SECRET vied early, fell back into the turn, continued willingly and got up for place while no threat to the winner. HESA PROSPECTOR dropped inside,
assumed command along the rail, drew clear into the turn, led to deep stretch, faltered and held for show. ROAD TO HEAT raced wide, vied early, fell back,
swung wide leaving the turn and closed well. BESITOS CRIMINALES was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and finished well. DOS REALES vied
early, fell back into the turn, continued willingly and came up empty late. NEXT AFFAIR was void of early speed, swung wide entering the stretch and
passed tiring rivals. FRANKS DEHERE moved up between horses to contend, fell back into the turn, stayed close and stopped near the sixteenth pole.
HOLD ME ONLY was not a factor. LUCK IN MY EYES failed to contend.
