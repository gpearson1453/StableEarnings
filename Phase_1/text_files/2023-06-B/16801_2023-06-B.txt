Footnotes
MOUNT UP bumped lightly with a foe leaving the gate then was coaxed to show speed, contested the pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the
turn, was asked approaching the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the front then dropped just behind the runner-up while
remaining on his inside lead, was pulled in by the rider with a tug of the left-rein and switched to the proper lead at the eighth-pole, fought back very gamely
in the final furlong, brushed with the runner-up late and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. COALVILLE stalked the leading duo on the outside,
engaged those opponents while four then three wide on the turn, took a short lead into upper stretch then dropped to the two path, lugged in while battling
outside of the winner with a narrow advantage, was put to a left-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, had the riders hand come very close to the head
of the winner at that juncture, continued to battle outside with a narrow advantage while kept off the inside foe under extra right-rein pressure and a
continued left-handed crop, brushed with the winner late and was denied while just able to get the place. TREATY OBLIGATION made light contact with
foes on both sides while slowest into stride then was hustled, moved up to race just off the pace with seven-furlongs to run then came under restraint, was
eased back coming to the half-mile pole, drafted inside while behind the leaders on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in
the two path, moved out while chasing the leading duo outside the furlong marker, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the show.
BIG NIGHT OUT broke in then bumped lightly with a rival, was rated just off the pace, drafted two then three wide while under snug restraint behind foes on
the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, chased outside to the finish and lacked the needed kick. NIGHT CHANT contested the pace, vied between
horses in the two path on the turn, dropped back three wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
EASTER (FR) got away slowest of all getting briefly taken in hand and conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, settled just off the
inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and was up in the last
jumps to the finish. CHASING THE CROWN just off the inside tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over
command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, came out a furlong out a path, dug in under growing threat from a pair and drifted out near the
sixteenth marker, then came out when getting collared by the top one and forced VERBAL to steady to his immediate outside while along for the place
honors. VERBAL tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out
nudging DUKE OF HAZZARD out to make a clear lane, rallied loosely between foes to the finish and was forced to steady when impeded by CHASING THE
CROWN coming outwards with seventy yards to run and was along for the show honors. DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) two to three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got nudged out a path by the aforementioned foe nearing the eighth pole, then kept
on to the finish. SKY AND SAND coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside shaking away midway down the backstretch, continued
along the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch displaced from the front, weakened in the
late stages. SEVEN CHANNELS tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of VERBAL alleging interference against CHASING THE
CROWN in deep stretch. After review, it was deemed that CHASING THE CROWN had interfered with VERBAL and therefore CHASING THE CROWN was
disqualified from second and placed third prior to the race being declared official. Please note that a head on replay of the start was unavailable and
therefore the details of why EASTER was off slowest could not be ascertained.

Footnotes
GREATEST LOVE prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, took over
in upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up into the final furlong and edged clear under steady urging. VALLARAND went to the front, showed the way while
inside of a foe, was asked while two path to the inside on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished but
held the place. GRINGOTTS was rated off the pace, came under urging while two then three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and
lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. RAFFINITY settled off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the turn, remained on her inside
lead in the stretch and failed to respond. TRADE SECRET showed speed on the inside then dropped off the pace near the three-quarter pole, dropped back
while saving ground on the turn and capitulated. CARLY HUSTLE settled at the rear, angled out outside the three-quarter pole, was urged four wide on the
turn and faltered.

Footnotes
TRYINMYHEARTOUT got bumped at the start when under coaxing by STEPHANIE'S CHARM, who broke outwards, established the front and showed the
way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home and remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, came under late threat to the inside and held on to score. LIFELOVENLAUGHTER just off the
inside tracking the front from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
issuing a challenge through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled at the end. ROOT CAUSE chased three then two wide patiently handled until set
down angled out six wide into upper stretch then offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. BIG BRASS BED four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to
secure the last major share. QUARREL four then three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. FAST KIMMIE three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. STEPHANIE'S CHARM broke out at the start bumping TRYINMYHEARTOUT, chased
along the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. TAP IT UP
broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased four then three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
SONIC SPEED stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then took the lead into upper stretch,
responded well under threat in the final furlong and just held under strong urging. HILLIARD steadied near another foe who was checking leaving the chute,
was reserved off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished with
good energy to just miss while up for the place. ARRIO moved in while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on an uncontested lead, vied
inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, fought on well to the finish but missed while clear for
the show. SPLENDID SUMMER was rated off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased
the vanguard to the finish and lacked the needed kick. STEELERSFANFORLIFE was rated off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LIFE AND LIGHT was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused near the
quarter-pole then came off the rail in upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. K P ALL SYSTEMS GO checked near other foes in trouble leaving
the chute, was reserved near the back while on the outside but with cover, went four then three wide while roused on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch
and failed to rally. CUMBERLAND BLUES settled on the outside without the benefit of cover, was roused in the three path on the turn and failed to respond.
PRAYER BOOK was taken under a tight hold early then put under slightly stronger restraint leaving the chute, raced towards the back under reserve,
dropped back in the four path on the turn and faltered. VOLIERO checked severely near the rail early then lost position badly leaving the chute, settled near
the back, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.
