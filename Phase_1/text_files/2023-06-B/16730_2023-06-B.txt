ROSALIE'S DESTINY was sharp out of the gates, took advantage of the one post position and took the lead along the rail, attended to the pace, was joined
by another competitor at the three eighths pole, battled with this challenger past the quarter pole and deep into the stretch, under left handed urging
ROSALIE'S DESTINY drifted out a stride and nearly bumped her challenger but was quickly corrected and re focused where she ran on and took the lead
for the win. DR. WOODS MIRACLE bumped at the start, was off a step slow and was un hurried, cued at the half mile pole and began to gain ground,
shifted close to the rail to save ground through the second turn, advanced up the rail at the quarter pole and was set down for the closing drive, was
encouraged and kept on point, finished willingly and was second best today. LEXINGTON DIAMOND was bumped at the start, raced mid pack in the four
path, advanced after the five furlong marker, gained ground and improved position, challenged for the lead at the three eighths pole, shifted into the two
path and traded blows with the eventual winner into the furlong ground, but tired late while starting to drift in. OLD SCHOOL FLASH vied for the lead, settled
into a stalking position on the rail, raced with another foe on her outside, gave way near the quarter pole. BISTINEAU BELLE raced from off of the pace,
followed in the three path, had no kick. DANCING TRICK trailed early, improved position late late but made no impact. SENSING GOLD vied for the lead,
settled into a satlking position while racing three wide and stopped after the half.

the four path entering the stretch, was encouraged and happily closed in on the leaders while racing down the lane, caught the leaders at the last sixteenth
pole, edged clear and drew off for the win. MISS PRIORITY stalked the early pace setter and raced in the two path, patiently waited until the quarter pole
where she was joined by an outside rival, and launched a bid with that one to her outside, entered the stretch and gave way to the outside rival, was kept in
the game and encouraged, she willingly kept on closing and was able to come away with second place honors. GOLDEN SMILES raced three wide and in
the middle of the pack early, was gathered up and starting improving position after the half, was in full swing after the half mile pole, gained ground and
improved position through the turn, raced five wide through the stretch and under strong encouragement got up for third place money. DROP DEAD SEXY
was sharp out of the gates, established the lead and raced along the rail, set all the early fractions at a brisk pace, was challenged after the quarter pole and
gave way. SWEET VIDALIA was off a bit slow, raced on the rail, had horses racing on her outside down the backside, launched a mild bit at the quarter
pole. MISS KENNEDY raced off of the pace and in the four path, raced on the out of another competitor down the backside, made no impact. INAWIC
settled off of the pace along the rail but was never involved. G'S SQUEEZE trailed through out.

Footnotes
TRAPPE VALLEY stalked the early pace in the two path, patiently waited until after the quarter pole, launched a bid and edged past the early leader to draw
off for the win. STOMPING HOTROD raced two wide in the middle of the pack, was joined by an outside foe after the half, improved position in a set, stayed
behind horses through the turn and into the stretch, was encouraged dawn the lane and proved to be second best today. TAPIT'S SPIRIT vied for the led,
raced on the rail while setting the pace, was challenged through the turn, relinquished the lead, was urged in the stretch and held on for third. D TWO was
settled in the three path, raced off of the pace on the outside of another rival, shifted entering the stretch, was angled back into the three and maintained his
position until the wire. FAR BEYOND trailed early and made no impact. CARL G showed little.

Footnotes
PICKENS stalked from the inside in the three path, challenged for the lead with pressure to his outside at the quarter pole, continued to match strides and
battle with a rival who was racing on the rail all the way through the stretch, was encouraged and finally drew off and cleared his rival late.
SCARLETTSBLACKJACK vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the early fractions, was challenged for the lead by an outside contender at the quarter
pole, battled down the stretch, matched strides until the end but came up short. G'WILDCAT raced in the middle of the field was bale to maintain position
through out. COHERE raced on the rail and made a mild bid late. KINGOFBROKENHEARTS showed little. OUR FREDDIE MAC flashed speed early then
faltered.
