Footnotes
RYANWATER raced from the back of the pack, took closer order in the far turn, drove five wide into the lane, then continued a four-wide bid and drew clear
in the final sixteenth to prove best, driving. FULL VELOCITY went three to four wide into the opening turn, contested the lead leaving the backstretch, drew
clear in the final turn, was overtaken midstretch and finished second best. FROBISHER BAY sat in striking position from along the rail, chased four wide into
the lane, but was no match in the drive. TALKIN MALICE hurried outside angling in, in the first turn, attended the pace from the three path, was unable to
keep pace with rivals and gave way. FLASH OF GLORY offered little. VISION QUEST was quickest leaving the opening turn, was overtaken and tired.

DANCING WILLIE was reserved off the early pacesetters, advanced quickly through the final turn outside, set sights on GODGUNSNCOUNTRY at the head
of the stretch, and won driving. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES trailed early, was roused near the quarter pole, closed gradually from the four path, and was
along in time for place honours. MACHINE went four to five wide into the early turn, closed steadily under light handling and got by just in time to score
show. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY lead the way early, drew away nearing the quarter pole, yielded in the stretch and was caught late. EXPLODE sat just off the
pace from the three path, and faded. THE BEAT was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
GREEK GEEK sat in striking distance while wide through the backstretch, went four wide through the far turn then started to quicken, drove five wide at the
head of the lane, rallied determinedly outside, dug in and prevailed after a multi-horse scramble to the wire. MASKWECIS rated off the early pace, rallied
four wide at the head of the lane, kept under handling from between foes and was out finished in the final yards. DRINKING AGAIN chased through the far
turn from a rail position, angled out to the three path, fought on gamely inside of MASKWECIS and GREEK GEEK, and yielded grudgingly. GLAVA
contested the early pace outside of ASYOUBELIEVE, gained a short advantage entering the final turn, and got caught. COUNTRIFIED trailed the field early,
and bid belatedly. ASYOUBELIEVE contended the early pace inside of GLAVA, was unable to match strides entering the stretch and wilted. SLAATS
stalked the pacesetters from the rail and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
SHURAZ vied outside for the early lead, contended the pace through the backstretch while four to five-wide, dueled outside of LIFES ADVENTURE entering
the stretch, dug in and edged clear. DADDY'S PEPPER stalked the pacesetters outside, hustled on the final turn then finished willingly in the late stages
and got up for second. LIFES ADVENTURE pressed the pace from along the rail, responded to a challenge from SHURAZ, and was rundown. BARAK
attended the pace between rivals, and lacked a closing response. AL REICHERT lagged early while wide, and improved late. HANDSOME HENRY failed to
threaten. BIG JIM chased outside and faded. PACHECO showed little.

Footnotes
DANZA UNBRIDLED bumped away from the gate, chased through the final turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, dug in between foes, and prevailed under
a long drive. VICTORY AT LAST tracked wide leaving the backstretch, rallied steadily outside of DANZA UNBRIDLED, and was bested in the final yards.
INDEPENDENCE NEIGH brushed leaving, chased the leader, drifted out under left-handed encouragement, and weakened deep stretch. J. CRUZ jostled
away, showed the way through the backstretch, was under attached approaching the stretch, and came up empty in the drive. HIGH KELLY SONG bumped
from the gate, sent for speed early, and improved position late. PUMP THE BRAKES bumped repeatedly leaving, rated off the early pace, and lacked a kick.
SNAP COUNT was not a factor. IMPERIAL BIRD sandwiched leaving the gate, raced wide leaving the backstretch, fell nearing the quarter, did not finish,
and was vanned off. MAJOR SHEPARD chased outside, fell over a fallen horse losing his rider, did not finish and walked off. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An
objection lodged by the rider of J.CRUZ against the rider of INDEPENDENCE NEIGH alleging interference in the stretch was not allowed. STEWARDS
INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the final turn of the race but made no change. *POST TIME was delayed due to an injured jockey.

I'M DASHING stalked five wide, drew closer nearing the stretch, and prevailed under a drive. LANNY MAC raced five wide into the opening turn, responded
to handling through the stretch and narrowly missed after a game effort. PRESS GANG vied outside, went three wide in the far turn, dueled outside of
JULIUS THE GREAT, edged away and was caught late stretch. TAPIT TO THE WIRE rated well off the pace, circled into the lane, and closed late.
KOVACS settled inside early, and rallied mildly through stretch. DUNE D'ORO dropped back leaving the backstretch, and bid belatedly improving position
from along the rail. UPO lagged early and offered a late bid. JULIUS THE GREAT vied inside for the early lead, dueled in the final turn, was unable to move
on with rival and gave way.
