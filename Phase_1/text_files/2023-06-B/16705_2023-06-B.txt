Footnotes
HALO STYLE had a good position three wide outside tracking the early front duo, engaged three wide midway on the turn, took control four deep at the top
of the lane and was kept to the task to win comfortably at the finish. MY GIRL GABBY settled near the rear at the half, rallied three wide outside foes
following the path of the winner throughout the turn, angled out five wide to be the threat at the top of the stretch and chased but to no avail to the finish. ITS
A BIRDIE was bumped at the start to be near the rear down the backside, took closer order inside running early on the turn, was on hold looking for a seam
entering the stretch, shifted off the tiring front runners in the four path at the furlong marker and offered a good finish to close in capturing third money.
JUNGLE TIGRESS had a good spot behind the contesting top two into the turn, was in tight surroundings nearing the five sixteenth pole, was checked
briefly. MANITOULIN ISLAND was unhurried in the early stages of the race trailing the field turning for home and could only pass the tired engaging
frontrunners to the wire. MURDER HORNET had a narrow advantage just outside taking the field into the turn, battled upfront between horses with five
sixteenths to the wire, was collared outside by the winner at the top of the lane and yielded on the rail in the last sixteenth. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ pressed the
issue on the rail down the back straight, was scrubbed on dueling inside for the lead midpoint on the turn and retreated on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SPEED CHESS was content tracking the loose pacesetter down the backside, began to reel in the frontrunner midway on the final turn, assumed command
inside at the eighth pole and was edging away in the final sixteenth for the victory. KIMONO KATE was keen early to get to the rail taking this field into the
first turn, continued up front opening up on rivals down the backstretch, was collared by the winner inside at the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly in
the last sixteenth. P. S. RISING STAR was bumped on the break, regrouped to track on the rail in the second flight down the back straight, battled two wide
outside for third money on the far turn and put in a good finish to secure a non threatening third in the end. LEADING FORCE broke out at the start, tracked
on the rail at the half mile marker, put in a brief rally on the fence at the three eighths pole and stalled in mid stretch to settle for a minor role at the finish.
SILENT CREEK stalked near the rear at the half, advanced on the fence throughout the second turn, angled out three wide for the drive and was only one
paced to the wire. TAKE CHANCES was pinballed between horses on the break, settled near the back with four furlongs remaining, was ridden for more at
the three eighths marker, shifted out to the five path at the top of the stretch but only made little impact down the lane. LOADED MISTRESS broke out at the
start, settled outside in midfield outside foes at the half, could not match strides with fellow runners three deep at the three furlong marker and faded when
turning for home. SMART IRENE was allowed to settle trailing the field down the backstretch, saved ground at the back of the pack through the final turn
and could not get involved driving to the finish line.

Footnotes
SIMPLE SOUVENIR tossed the head and was bumped at the start then exchanged light contact with another rival, was outsprinted early, tracked in behind
off the inside racing about in the three path, moved out leaving the turn coming six wide into upper stretch, bid outside rivals taking the lead seventy yards
out and edged away under urging. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD was lightly bumped at the start, stalked the pace from outside runners, went four to five wide on
the turn, bid seventy yards out but was outfinished by the winner while securing the place. FRERET broke outwardly bumping a rival, was coaxed forward
and clear, set the pace racing off the rail, drifted about a bit in the stretch, was overtaken seventy yards out and kept on gamely but was outkicked. MI
TORMENTA chased from inside, lost ground on the leader heading to the turn, saved ground on that bend, continued evenly and made no bid. CEDAR
VALLEY chased from between runners early then inside a foe but off the fence three wide through the turn, weakened in the stretch. BABY MO was
bumped around lightly between runners at the start, raced outside rivals off the pace into the turn four deep, floated seven wide into upper stretch and in
range but lacked the needed late kick.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO made a good move with five eighths left to run to have a nice inside position behind the contesting leaders, waited patiently throughout the
turn looking for a path to offer a run, decided to shift inwards to the fence at the three sixteenth marker to burst inside for the lead at the furlong pole and
was kept to the task late to hold safe for the win. MALIBU SECRET had a good spot outside tracking in the second flight watching the front duo set the
fractions, angled out four wide at the top of the stretch to take command but could not hold off the winner that was full of run on the rail in the final furlong.
DIXIE GIANT tracked between horses in the second flight at the five eighths pole, was on hold behind horses through the turn, looked for a seam four deep
in upper stretch, shifted in to the two path at the furlong marker and closed well to capture third at the wire. TAKE A CHANCE broke out at the start,
contested for the lead on the rail running on the turn, was headed on both sides in upper stretch, determinedly fought on in the late stages but was on the
losing end of a three horse photo in a gritty effort. FORESTER'S TURN settled near the rear in the early going, put in a mild turn of foot four wide keeping
position at the three furlong marker, shifted to the five path for the stretch drive and evened out at the furlong marker. SEA SCOUT was bumped lightly at
the start, trailed the field two furlongs from the wire angling out to be six wide, shifted out widest in the eight path in mid stretch for clear run and offered little
finish to the line. COMBATIVE trailed in the three path down the backstretch, offered a brief run four wide outside three furlongs from home, was in the mix
six deep for a small share at the three sixteenth marker and faded in deep stretch. ALICIA'S KID dueled for the front outside on the turn, was collared with
rivals on either side at the quarter marker and stopped with a furlong left to run.

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN settled in midfield three deep outside runners at the half, was nudged on to commence his run with five sixteenths from the finish,
angled out four wide on the drive gaining slowly on the leaders, assumed command at the sixteenth pole and held on for the win while not switching leads to
the finish. LOVE THE GAME settled just off the rail near the rear in the beginning, rallied three wide around foes with three furlongs remaining, shifted out to
the six path at the top of the lane and closed belatedly to be second best at the finish. MORNING THOUGHTS kept a close eye on the early frontrunner
down the backside, was in the hunt three wide between runners at the top of the stretch but needed more late to threaten for the top two placings at the
wire. SOUP SPOON hustled for the lead leaving the chute, dictated the pace through the turn, opened up a touch on the field at the top of the lane, was
looking for the wire at the eighth pole and gave way in deep stretch settling for a small share in the end. EXTRACTION WILL was situated in midpack two
wide four furlongs from home, could not keep position with three eighths remaining to be shuffled back on the turn and could not make any impact running to
the finish. DRAGON'S KEY travelled in the middle of the pack inside, was asked for more run on the fence on the turn, offered little response and stalled on
the rail in mid stretch. SUPER HEADLINE stalked on the rail near the back of the pack, was ridden on the fence midway on the turn, offered little movement
and could not reach contention running through the stretch. QUIET REBEL was outrun early trailing down the backstretch, could not get interested on the
turn and did not make a presence down the lane.

Footnotes
ANSELMO settled just off the leaders outside foes mid-division, raced four wide around the first turn, moved up outside foes about five wide midway up the
backstretch, had aim on the leader turning for home, struck the lead outside the furlong grounds and kicked clear. OPEECHEE came out a bit after the
break, rated in behind the leading group while inside a foe but off the rail in the two to three path, moved out from three to four wide while put to urging on
the far turn, came into upper stretch five to six deep, kicked on to capture the place while no threat to the winner. HEART BOY settled at the rear shifting in
two wide, lacked room racing at the back inside and in behind rivals, bided time then began to advance while tipping out a bit on the far turn, angled seven
wide into upper stretch, was left with far too much to do but got up for show honors without threatening the winner or making late headway on the runner-up.
PASSIONPLATE sped clear, set the pace racing off the rail, weakened in the stretch. MANETKA settled at the back three wide, began to move on the far
turn while tipping out from four to six wide, angled outside foes in upper stretch eight deep and ran on well but too late. RARE DISCOVERY gained forward
position stalking the pacesetter three wide, applied a tad of pressure up the backstretch, lacked the needed late kick. SNOOKERED was forwardly-placed
three to four wide stalking just in behind and outside the leading rivals, was close up heading up the backstretch, dropped back some heading to the far turn
and shifted in a bit racing two to three wide on that bend, asked for more at the quarter pole, failed to rally. WIKWEMIKONG GHOST was in tight after the
break, encouraged along two to three wide between runners early but lacking speed, swung out five wide for the stretch run, failed to menace. DOC
FISHMAN was a bit slow to gather, caught four to five wide outside foes toward the back in the early going, failed to threaten. WIN THE DRAW raced off the
pace saving ground through both turns, was put to urging three furlongs out but had no response and failed to rally. UNBRIDLED INFERNO cleared the field
and shifted in, settled along the rail to track the leader from inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
MARALINGA had a good trip sitting on the fence behind the engaging threesome throughout the turn, slipped up the rail in upper stretch, took command at
the eighth pole and just had enough left late to hold on for the win crossing the wire. TAPPING A RHYTHM contested for the front between rivals in the two
path running on the turn, bid for the lead four wide with numerous runners involved with three sixteenths remaining, gamely dug in when passed by the
winner at the eighth pole and re-rallied late to make it close at the wire. GRACE ON THE GREEN sat alone rating kindly in the third flight with four furlongs
left to run, loomed the threat six wide angling out for the stretch drive and closed outside runners to get up for third winning the nod at the finish. SMILES
FOR DAVID was coaxed for more inside with a half left to run, rallied behind the leaders three deep to be involved at the top of the stretch, shifted into the
rail for the final eighth and finished up well on the fence just missed the photo for third money at the wire. SILENT SKY had a good position beside the
winner running outside through the turn, shifted out to the five path for the stretch drive to be in with a chance in mid stretch but could not find another gear
to contend in the late stages of the race. WHERE'S SAMNBAILEY travelled in the middle of the pack two deep on the turn, angled out to be widest in the
seven path turning for home and finished up evenly to the wire in the final eighth. BURLAP broke inwards bumping rival at the start, travelled near the back
throughout the turn, angled out into the eight path at the top of the lane, lacked room, dipped in to the four path at the three sixteenth pole to start picking up
runners and had no room to extend her stride late in deep stretch. RAVELLO BEAUTY broke at the start bumping fellow rival to begin, stalked near the rear
three wide early on, angled out six wide for the stretch run and passed tired runners. SILENT TRIBUTE prompted the pace scenario three wide at the half,
was still in the mix of things five wide turning for home and tired between runners at the furlong marker. KRYPTO GAINS had a narrow lead on the rail with
two others rivals contesting up front at the half, was collared by runners at the three sixteenth pole and stopped deep stretch. GOLDEN SUZIE was
unhurried from the outside early, got the to rail to trail the field down the backside, saved ground running on the turn and showed little interest driving to the
wire. SNOW LAKE settled near the rear just outside in the early going, was roused at the top of the stretch and could not find another gear to be a factor to
the finish.

Footnotes
TEMPO MADNESS lead the field down the back straight , opened up through the turn while still in hand, comfortably was cruising up front in upper stretch
and widened to the finish when mildly roused in the final furlong. SWATH settled three wide in the middle of the pack at the half, took closer order three wide
around foes midway on the turn, was the only challenger to pose a threat to the winner at the top of the lane but could not keep up with the lone gone
winner and bested the rest at the finish. STRONGER TOGETHER stalked at the rear on the rail down the backside, started to move two wide with three
eighths from the line, was picking up runners in the four path at the quarter pole and found his best stride late to close well to be a clear third crossing the
finish line. BODIE travelled on the rail rail near the rear in the early stages of the race, advanced on the fence running through the turn, shifted four wide for
the stretch drive and was one paced to the finish to garner a small share in the end. LOMAKI FORCE settled at the back just off the fence at the half, was
ridden three wide on the turn making little impression, angled six deep in upper stretch and passed weary ones to the wire. DO THE GRIDDY tracked the
top pair in the early going, lost positioning inside entering the turn and could not offer a finish on the rail to the wire. VICTORY MARCH chased the
pacesetter down the backside, was scrubbed on the keep up between runners at the three furlong pole and retreated at the quarter marker.

Footnotes
STORMIN DAVE shifted in to the three to four path about mid-pack early, steadily advanced early up the backstretch, eased back off rivals on the far turn
then angled outside those to enter the top of the stretch seven wide and full of run, drifted in while taking the lead by mid-stretch but kicked clear.
TREBUCHET stalked two to three wide, bid briefly in upper stretch but was no match for the winner, kept on and just saved second. AIR FORCE RESERVE
was checked sharply after the start then coaxed along two to three wide to gain more forward position, raced about mid-pack, continued three wide on the
far turn, came out in the stretch, rallied and just missed second by a short nose. BARTICA saved ground racing inside early in the back half of the field,
gained closer contact with the leaders on the far turn, lacked room in behind two to three wide past the quarter pole briefly, came out in upper stretch and
kicked on just mildly once clear. HEY LUIGI prompted the pace two to three wide, took the lead about the five-sixteenths, was overtaken in upper stretch
and lacked the needed late kick. NGABE bumped a rival fairly hard at the start, lacked early speed dropping well back off the leaders, saved ground to the
quarter pole, shifted out swinging nine wide into upper stretch, finished strongest of all but far too late. DEFOGGER was bumped at the start, recovered
quickly to gain forward position inside tracking the leaders, came out a bit on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. TAYBO set a pressured pace inside,
wilted. RIVER OF BABYLON broke outwardly then veered in a bit to correct, went four to five wide on the first turn inside foes but forced wide by an inside
rival, advanced rapidly up the backstretch from outside to be within striking distance, continued wide on the far turn in range, faltered and faded. DIO
BRANDO was a bit unprepared at the start and consequently away slowly, was caught seven wide into the first turn but eased back and angled in, raced
well back and saved ground along the rail on the far turn, made no bid. GUESS I'M BEST received a saddle adjustment at the gate, was squeezed back at
the start, caught five to six wide on the first turn, dropped back, was pulled up near the five-sixteenths and vanned off. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY
THE RIDER OF BARTICA AGAINST AIR FORCE RESERVE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE COMING TO THE TOP OF THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.
