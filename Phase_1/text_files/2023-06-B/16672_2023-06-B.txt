PALACE KITTEN tracked four wide, ranged up in midstretch to bid leaving the furlong grounds and drove clear. SEVEN NATION ARMY stalked outside of
the leading pair around the turn, offered a bid at the furlong grounds along with an outer rival while being put to tight quarters by an inner foe, got outkicked
by his outer counterpart while crowded in the final furlong and secured place late. DERBY DATE vied two wide, led narrowly around the turn, but drifted
outwardly while confronting a pair of outer challengers at the furlong grounds, put a foe to tight quarters while getting outkicked leaving that station and held
show late. DARK TIMBER vied along the inside, but was outkicked by a pair of outer bidders in the final furlong and yielded late. DRIVE FOR FUN chased
along the inside and gave way turning for home before being eased through the final furlong. THE RIDER OF SEVEN NATION ARMY CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF PALACE KITTEN FOR INTEREFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, BUT THE OBEJCTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS.

Footnotes
RHYME SCHEMES broke well despite a very minor bobble, set the pace in the two path, shook free of an outer presser at the five sixteenths pole, then
drew off under a vigorous hand ride in the lane and widened with a strong finish. PONCE DE LEON was reluctant to load, then hopped while off a step slow,
tracked two wide and between horses, emerged to gain place at the quarter pole while in pursuit of the clearing leader, then proved no match for that one
while remaining clear of show. PASS THE HAT stalked along the inside, then lacked a bid and held show. OMEX saved ground under urging while off of the
pace around the turn, tipped two wide in midstretch while improving, but did not have enough to reach show. PHREDDIE MAC lacked speed in the two path,
paused behind traffic entering the final furlong and improved between horses late. TIMBERLAKE broke a step slow, recovered to track four wide around
around the turn, but hung on his left lead while lacking a bid in upper stretch, changed over while shifting in slightly leaving the furlong grounds, but yielded
in the late stages. BEAUDACIOUS COLTON laid off of the pace in the three path, chased between horses in upper stretch and lacked a bid. MI T CADEN
pressed the leader from the three path, but failed to keep pace with that one at the five sixteenths pole and weakened between horses thereafter. COWBOY
CODE broke slowly, raced at the rear in the three path and never got involved. RULEROFTHEUNIVERSE broke a beat slow before being slow into stride
and got outrun in the four path.

GOOD HEART sped clear in the opening furlong, showed the way in hand in the three path around the turn and held sway through the lane. JOKING WAY
stalked the clear leader from the four path from between horses around the turn, dueled for place with his outer counterpart turning for home and edged
away from that tiring one entering the final sixteenth. MONEY RUN broke outwardly and snagged the outer half of the gate, tracked in the five path, sparred
for place with an inner rival turning for home and through midstretch, but yielded at the sixteenth pole. ATKINS trailed in the four path around the turn, then
improved past inner rival late. CACTUS failed to factor from the three path. NULLARBOR chased along the inside while a path off of the inner railing and
weakened through the lane.

ISOCLINE vied inside of a rival into the turn, chased that foe while headed turning for home, offered a re bid in upper stretch before driving clear at the
furlong grounds, and held sway thereafter. PASS LINE saved ground off of the pace, gained turning for home before swinging four wide entering the lane,
then ran on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole and forged that position late. GUCCI BOY chased inside of rivals while a path off of the rail, tipped to take
aim outside of the leading pair entering the lane, chased while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, bid for place along with an outer rival in the final
furlong and got outfinished by that one late. MR. COMMANDER shifted outwardly soon after the start, vied two wide, led turning for home, but was headed
by his inner counterpart nearing the furlong marker and weakened between horses. SAVAGE KISS saved ground while trailing around the turn and
surpassed outer rivals in the lane. WHEN I GET PAID laid off of the pace two wide, improved past outer rivals in upper stretch, but failed to threaten in the
final furlong. REDHILL raced off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path at the five sixteenths pole, but lacked a bid. HURRY ON OUT leaned
out and bumped a rival at the start, lacked speed in the four to three path and failed to factor between horses in the late stages. FIGHTERTOWN tracked in
the four path but weakened turning for home. I NINETY FIVE took contact from an inner rival at the start, chased in the three path and between horses into
the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
RALLY SQUIRREL set the pace inside of a pressing rival and drew off entering the lane. ONE LAST HAND pressed outside of the eventual winner, proved
no match for that one entering the lane and remained clear of show. MOLIERE was last away, lacked speed along the inside, progressed turning for home
while shifting to the three path, bid for show along with an inner CO CONSIPIRATOR entering the lane and forged that position at the furlong grounds. CO
CONSPIRATOR laid off of the pace in the two path, gained show entering the lane but was surpassed by an outer rival at the furlong marker. MALIBU TIME
tracked along the inside and faded around the far turn. WARTIME HERO brushed an outer rival early on, raced forwardly in the three path, chased the
leading pair while drifting to the four to five path around the far turn and caved entering the lane. JINGLE took light contact from an outer rival early on,
lacked speed in the four path and never got involved. FERRYBOAT tracked in the four path, but weakened around the far turn before being eased through
the lane. GO FOR SHERRIE showed little before being eased around the far turn, then pulled up in upper stretch and walked off.

PLAYLIST vied along the inside, backed off to stalk an outer rival nearing the turn, tipped outside of that one to bid two wide turning for home, then gained
an advantage in upper stretch and drew off readily through the final furlong. HIDEKI took a bump from an inner rival at the nine sixteenths pole and brushed
an outer foe in the aftermath, laid off of the pace in the two path, altered course outside of a rival in midstretch and stayed on between horses to reach place
at the wire. SWEET ALYSSA laid off of the pace in the three to five path and rallied between horses in the final furlong to just miss reaching place.
NUMERO SEIS set the pace two wide before clearing to the rail entering the turn, met the eventual winner's bid turning for home, got headed in upper
stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was caught by a group of outer rivals at the wire. ERNA raced at the rear in the four path, fanned to the six path in
upper stretch and rallied outside of rivals to miss a minor placing via a photo. MISS ARLINGTON bobbled briefly and mildly at the start, bumped an outer
rival while gaining a tracking position, pursued from the two path around the turn, gained show in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong. ONLY KIDDING
stalked two to three wide, but yielded in the four path in upper stretch before weakening between horses. LADY IRENE bumped an inner rival at the start,
pursued from midpack along the inside, but faltered approaching the turn, trailed around the bend, and saved ground to no avail. COMEDY ACT took a
bump from an outer rival at the start, then steadied behind that foe at the nine sixteenths pole, raced at the rear two wide and between horses and failed to
factor. SURE CAN took light contact from an inner rival at the nine sixteenths pole, tracked in the four path and faded between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RIVER BOY set the pace inside of a stalking foe, shook clear at the three furlong pole, drew off through upper stretch and lasted safely with a clear margin
in the closing stages. ONEPARTICULRHARBOR lagged behind, took the far turn in the three path, split foes entering the lane while launching a rally,
shifted to the five path in upper stretch and progressed outside of foes to gain place at the sixteenth pole before narrowing the leader's margin late. PAID IN
FULL stumbled at the start, tracked in the two path, bid for place in the four path nearing the lane, gained that position at the furlong grounds, but was
outkicked by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole. BEOCCA lacked speed, pursued in the three path while between horses around the far turn and failed to
menace. DREAMFACTOR stalked outside of the eventual winner, pressed down the backstretch, but gave way at the three furlong pole and weakened
thereafter. INVASIVE failed to get involved from the two path. MOTOWN MISSILE laid off of the pace in the four path and tired.

Footnotes
TREATY was bumped and forced inwardly by an outer rival at the start, brushed an inner foe in the process, set the pace inside of pressing rivals while a bit
off of the rail, dueled with KEEN HEIR around the far turn, shifted out at the furlong grounds and gamely clung to an advantage through the late stages.
KEEN HEIR pressed three to two wide and between horses, dueled with an inner rival while in the three path around the far turn, but was herded outwardly
while failing to get past in midstretch and missed late. FREEZE POP laid off of the pace in the two path, then improved to gain show entering the lane.
BROOKLYN DIAMONDS was brushed inwardly by an outer foe at the start, trailed two wide, took the far turn in the four path and passed tired rivals.
TRIGGER HAPPY stalked four to three wide, but gave way in the four path at the three furlong pole and weakened. SOFT PANTS broke inwardly and
bumped a rival at the start, pressed two wide and between horses, but weakened at the nine sixteenths pole and was done early before being eased
through the final furlong.

Footnotes
QUEROBIN DOURADA pursued from midpack two wide, brushed an outer foe to take aim outside of the leading pair from the four path entering the lane,
bid leaving the furlong grounds, led nearing the final sixteenth and drove clear. CANDY LIGHT settled off of the pace in the two path, pursued three wide
around the far turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and rallied to gain place in the final sixteenth. COASTAL CHARM set the pace along the
inside, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, shook narrowly free of that one after spinning for home in the two path, but was bested by an outer rival
nearing the sixteenth pole and lost place late. VALENTINA DAY stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, but was turned away in the three path in upper
stretch, got outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and chased between horses to sustain a minor placing. VIBURNUM trailed along the inside,
shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and moved up late. ARM CANDY leaned inwardly at the start, saved ground of off the pace, but lacked the
needed kick to offer a rail bid through a narrow seam in upper stretch, then lost that option when that path was re-occupied by the pace setter in midstretch
and was blocked through the final furlong. POCA MUCHA stalked along the inside, loomed a danger from the two path behind the leaders turning for home,
but never found racing room and was blocked behind foes through the lane. OMIXOCHITL tracked three wide, pressed into the far turn, but was brushed to
the five path by an inner rival entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MOTOWN MIKA dueled for the lead two wide and drove clear leaving the furlong grounds. JACKIE'S SPIRIT dueled for the lead inside of the eventual
winner, gave way to that one leaving the furlong marker and remained clear of show. WITCH OF NOVEMBER laid off fo the pace along the inside, gained
turning for home before shifting to the four path in upper stretch and stayed on to reach show between horses late. CORNER KICK pursued from midpack in
the three to four path, then ran on in the five path to miss reaching show. GET BY was last away, tracked along the inside, tipped to take aim outside of the
top pair nearing the lane, but lacked a bid and faded. ISABEL DE CLARE broke out and brushed the gate, then pursued from midpack and weakened.
HURRICANE LASSIE took mild contact from an inner rival at the start, stalked three wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole. DREAM TRAP
trailed and never got involved. MELINOE brushed an outer rival leaving the gates, chased two wide and between horses, but faltered around the turn.
