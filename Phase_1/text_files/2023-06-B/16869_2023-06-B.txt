AA SWEET VICTORY prompted the pace for three quarters then took command at the top of the stretch and held on for the win. RS JEWEL CROWN was
unhurried around the first turn then moved up down the backstretch, angled out to three wide in upper stretch and was a game second. UPTOWN LADY
ARABELLA tracked the leaders through the final turn then moved out to four wide in the stretch, passed a tired on and proved to be best of the rest. WMA
BIG BABY went to the front to set a pressured pace for three quarters then was headed at the quarter pole and tired. VAZILLA SV was through after a half
and jogged in. WIKISPEEDIA saved ground down the backstretch but was distanced and eased.

AWESOME BID was hustled to as clear lead through the turn then was challenged down the stretch and fended off that one to hold on for the win.
PREACHER tracked the leaders from between rivals then moved up around the turn to make a late gain but couldn't catch the leader and proved second
best. ARIMONY saved ground to be along for show. MORO APPEAL chased the leader through the turn and tired. GREY ROGUE was three wide around
the turn, made a mild bid at the end of the bend but gave way. OPTIMAL trailed the field through the turn, moved out to six wide in upper stretch but was
never a threat.

the turn then made a three wide bid around the turn and made a mid track late rally to gain on the leader but couldn't catch and was a clear second. REAL

Footnotes
VALDINI was off a step slow, trailed the field to the turn then made a three wide bid to circle the field and took command at the top of the stretch and drew
off. FLYING LADY had early brief foot then settled off the pace down the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn for a late run and proved second
best. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE raced near the back down the backstretch, made a four wide turn to engage the leaders and matched strides to the top of the
stretch and weakened. SPARKLE IN THE SKY went to the front to co-lead to the five sixteenths pole then was collared and fought gamely to mid stretch
and gave way grudgingly. WHEREDIDITGO went to the front to co-lead to the five sixteenths pole but lacked a late response. KINSLEYS SWEET PEA
settled off the pace down the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the turn to take a brief lead mid turn, matched strides with outside rival to the
quarter pole and tired. MUCH ABOUT ONE tracked the leader from the inside to mid turn and gave way.
