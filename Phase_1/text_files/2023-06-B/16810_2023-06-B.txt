Footnotes
FLOWERPECKER pressed the early pace while in the two path, took over in mid-turn, cleared into the lane then widened when kept to the task to the end.
I'M WIDE AWAKE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, went after the leader into the lane then continued to chased the winner home while
finishing far clear for the place spot. DAY IN THE COUNTRY was in the two path through the turn, bid into the lane, could not gain on the leader while
winning the show duel. MR MANNING was in the four path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path then stayed on while
losing the show duel. PRINCE ACT was along the inside through the turn then weakened through the lane. HIGHEST PRAISE never a factor while in the
two path through the turn and into the lane. MILTONTOWN raced in the five to the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and
never menaced. SHIPSHAPE made little impact while in the three path through the turn. HARD NIGHT never made an impact while in the two path
throughout. SPECIAL PRYCE was last away and brushed between rivals, moved to the inside and never was in it. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER set the early

Footnotes
MIKE FROM P'BURG broke inward and bumped a foe, vied between foes early, lost his path near the nine-sixteenths pole, raced in the four path, rallied
late and was up in time under a well-timed ride. ORE MINE was bumped at the start, led inside, then drew off in the stretch but was caught late. KENNEL
CLUB stalked in the four path and closed belatedly. MASTER OF DISGUISE dueled before giving way in the stretch. PRINCE COLTON reared and broke
outward, raced in the five path, then passed tired horses. REVENGE TOUR was not a factor. FOX CREEK raced inside and faded on the turn.

Footnotes
MACADAMIA (FR) trailed for half while near the inside, angled out in late turn to go four wide with momentum into the lane, swept past the field before the
eighth pole, cleared then widened to the end. JOYFUL APPLAUSE chased the pace while saving ground through the far turn, came into the lane from the
two path while passing a tired rival then could not go with the fast closing winner and settled for second best. LILLY LANE vied for the lead along the inside,
continued to duel for the top spot into the lane then was no match for the top two in the final furlong. JUSTIFIABLE BELLE was bumped and forced out from
the four to the six path in the first turn, continued in the four path through the far turn and into the lane and never was a serious threat. MASSARD chased
the pace from the three path, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled into the lane then weakened in the final sixteenth. MINT EDITION was rank into the
first turn, was wrangled by the rider through the turn when stepping out and bumping rival, raced off the rail into the lane and never was a threat. FRANGO
ELECTRICO set the pace into the first turn, continued under pressure through the backstretch and into the turn and was done mid-turn along the rail. FAST
TRANSIT vied for the lead two wide into and through the turn, led in late turn then was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
JUSTICEONEMORETIME chased the two and three rival duel into the far turn, bid from the three path through the turn, gained the lead into the lane,
cleared outside the eighth pole and held. PORKYISMYNAME raced in the two path through the backstretch, bid in the three path through the turn when
chasing the eventual winner, came into the lane from the four path and continued to chase the top one to the wire while remaining clear for the place spot.
SCENIC JUSTICE saved ground into the far turn, came off the inside in late turn, had to wait momentarily for another to clear his path, bid from the five path
into the lane and was gaining to the end. CADILLAC JUSTICE raced near the back while off the inside, bid three wide through mid-turn, came into the lane
from the six path, was under a strong drive to the eighth pole then weakened and drifted in. WHITE SILVER SANDS set the pace along the inside, shook off
challenger into the turn, cleared into the lane then gave way through the final eighth. PURSUANT was off to an awkward start, trailed the field through the
far turn then passed a few tired ones through the final eighth. BUGSY BREEZE was bumped at the start, settled towards the back and never factored.
OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE pressed the pace from between rivals down the backstretch, continued to chase the pace through the turn then was empty. EL
TORNADO pressed the pace three wide through the far turn and was done in late turn.

Footnotes
FACE VALUE chased the pace from the three path down the backstretch, moved through the three path into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn, came
into the lane from the three or four path, gained the lead near the eighth pole then drifted into the six path while well clear. AIR MARSHAL chased the pace
from the two or three path into the turn, bid two wide and between rivals into the lane, dueled with the winner to inside the eighth pole, could not keep up
with that one but stayed on for the place spot. COSMIC STARDUST raced well back while in the three path through the turn, angled into the lane from the
six path and was gaining to the end. RUFFLED WATERS saved ground into the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and improved position while
not a serious menace. STEALTH MISSION was in the two path through the turns when in mid-pack and lacked a closing bid. DORMIR was in the three path
through the far turn when well back, came into the lane from the five or six path and offered a belated gain. ORO set the pace into the far turn then gave
way into the lane. NO ILL WILL was in the four path through the first turn, moved closer to the inside into the far turn, bid four wide into the lane and tired.
SMALL SAILOR chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then was done in mid-turn. OFFSHORE TITHE chased the pace from the three path into
the far turn and was done on the turn. LUCIOS ZORAN outrun while in the two or three path.
