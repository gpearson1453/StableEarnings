Footnotes
NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) stalked along the rail through both turns, tipped two wide nearing the stretch, challenged between rivals and got up in the closing
moments. QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE was a bit rank between rivals first time in the stretch then settled in a stalking position in the two path, roused midway
around the far turn while angling out four wide, rallied three deep in the final sixteenth and was outkicked by the winner. AUSTRALIA MIA stepped to the
front and led three wide into the lane for the first time and was a bit keen early, set all the pace a bit off the rail then along the inside to the stretch, put to
right-handed urging in the furlongs grounds and remained clear approaching the sixteenth pole but was overtaken by the top pair nearing the wire.
ZEYARAAT trailed off the rail then moved inside, angled four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) stalked outside rivals
then three wide into the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit into the far turn, launched a bid from outside leaving the bend but flattened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MUTH quickly cleared from outside and crossed over, opened up around the turn along the inside then a bit off the rail into the lane, coaxed along in upper
stretch still well clear of the rest, had the rider take a look back at the sixteenth pole and was geared down in the end. EL MAGNIFICO broke well then raced
greenly and dropped back off the pace, angled to the rail around the bend, kept to task in the lane and bested the rest. HARRY HOUDINI brushed with EL
MERO MERO early, chased under coaxing along the inside into the turn, tipped out and was closest in pursuit three wide into the lane, could not make any
headway on the runaway winner in the lane and churned on to save the show. OSAGE CREEK bobbled leaving the gate, chased three then two wide off the
pace around the turn and gained a minor award while never threatening. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL broke slow to begin, ran head-high and climbed early at
the back, saved ground through the turn and made no impact. EL MERO MERO brushed early with HARRY HOUDINI, chased outside that rival two wide
into the turn, started to weaken around the bend, came four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
EVER SMART stalked the lone leader from inside, closed in while tipping two wide approaching the quarter pole, drew alongside and put a head in front in
upper stretch, battled through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. HONEY JAR cleared and crossed over to the inside, opened up a comfortable lead
early, held a diminishing lead nearing the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch but battled back inside EVER SMART through the stretch run and
finished gamely to the wire. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM rated in the two path early, chased three deep at the quarter pole, tipped out into the lane and went
willingly late to earn the show honors. SEISAI (IRE) was rank between early into the first turn, traveled two wide off the pace into the second bend then went
between rivals again, chased under left-handed urging through the lane and finished evenly. KITTY KITANA (GB) settled inside, moved closer continuing to
save ground on the second bend, looked to launch a bid but lacked room behind the leaders in upper stretch, gained a clear path in the furlong grounds but
could not rally. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) stalked in the two path outside a rival, gained two then three wide on the far turn, was outkicked to the eight pole and
flattened. ANGEL NADESHIKO reserved on the inside at the back, asked right-handed exiting the far turn, steered out in the lane and failed to menace.
VERY SCARY tracked three deep early, four deep on the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
BELLA RENELLA chased three wide into the turn, closed in around the bend and drew alongside the leader entering the lane, cleared while drifting out in
upper stretch and drew off. SHANGHAI SUNRISE popped the gate open but never left the stall, sat off the pace on the inside, angled out and came three
wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and gained second. KISS MY KAT went up to take control inside WRONG TURN CUPID, cleared that rival
around the bend, challenged by the winner entering the stretch, relinquished the lead shortly after and flattened to third. WRONG TURN CUPID broke well
then pressed from outside early, chased two wide around the turn and weakened. WHY BEHAVE traveled outside a rival at the back into the turn, came
three wide into the lane and failed to menace. BACK ON THE STREET saved ground at the back and was not a factor. FLAT OUT JOY was off slow in the
beginning, chased four wide into the turn, remained wide into the lane and weakened. PER RULING FROM HIWU, BELLA RENELLA WAS DISQUALIFIED
FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
PLANETARIO (BRZ) settled off the pace on the inside, took closer order up the backstretch, tipped out on the far turn and came three wide into the lane,
gained command in upper stretch, cleared at the eighth pole and won going away. OFFLEE NAUGHTY unhurried in the beginning from inside, moved off
the rail on the backstretch, coaxed between on the far turn but had to pause behind RIMPROTECTOR, angled four wide leaving the bend, rallied and edged
that rival for second. RIMPROTECTOR tracked two to three wide early, moved closer up the backstretch, put in a mild bid three deep at the three-eighths
pole, could not keep pace with the leaders and chased three then four wide into the stretch, lugged out near the eighth pole and lost the place. DUVET DAY
(IRE) traveled two to three wide near the back early, three deep in the middle stages, angled five wide leaving the far turn, altered out from behind
RIMPROTECTOR at the eighth pole and could not rally. OPRY opened up on the field early while in-hand, controlled the pace to the final bend, dueled
inside BIRTH OF COOL then chased that rival into the lane and gave way. BIRTH OF COOL stalked from inside then moved into the two path, challenged
from outside into the far turn, dueled then inched ahead at the quarter pole, put away OPRY into the lane, relinquished the lead to the winner in upper
stretch and gave way. OPENING QUARTER FRACTION WAS 24.42

Footnotes
MY MAN BAGS raced up close then chased SWASDEE three deep into the turn, gained past the quarter pole and took aim two wide into the stretch, shifted
to the inside at the top of the lane, launched a bid with a furlong remaining, took over in midstretch and drew clear in deep stretch. SAWASDEE dueled four
deep early then cleared leaving the backstretch and crossed over to the inside, showed the way through the turn, held a diminishing lead into the lane, came
off the rail and was challenged at the eighth pole, gave up the lead midstretch and churned on to hold the place. ROOKIE MISTAKE pressed from between
early then chased two wide into and around the bend, could not summon the needed rally to threaten the winner but regained the show honors. MISTER
BOLD turned his head at the start to come away a step slow, tracked four wide and was asked right-handed around the bend, lacked the needed late punch
and got outkicked for third. SEATTLE BREAKOUT dueled for command inside rivals then chased leaving the backstretch, dropped back around the turn on
the fence and could not summon the needed rally. THIRSTY PAPPY stalked outside a rival early, pushed on two then three wide on the turn and could not
rally. STAY IN THE GAME chased at the back early, went three wide into the turn, got forced out past the quarter pole and exited the bend five wide and
failed to menace. ROY HOBBS was off slow to begin, angled to the inside and moved into range quickly, lacked room behind a rival then jumped shadows
at the seven-sixteenths pole, lacked room again behind a rival early on the turn, angled out four wide into the clear and came up empty.

putting her away late on the bend, met the challenge from outside rivals into the drive, dueled with HOTITUDE through the final furlong and yielded
grudgingly late. PALEO'S PRINCESS stalked from inside into the turn, waited for room around the bend, steered out and bumped with GOLDEN
MICROPHONE in midstretch and had the rider lose the whip, then finished willingly for third. KLEEN KARMA was off slow to begin, trailed on the inside into
the turn, angled out into the lane and further out to chase widest in the drive, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. NORAH'S PRINCESS
bobbled crossing onto the dirt, settled early, went two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend and failed to threaten. GOLDEN MICROPHONE
hopped slightly and bumped leaving the gate, traveled three deep to the turn, made progress and bid four wide into the lane, came in and bumped rival
midstretch and flattened out. SQUARED SHADY tracked along the inside into the turn, lacked room at the quarter pole, tipped two wide into the lane and
could not rally. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE stumbled and bumped at the start, chased between rivals into the turn, two to three wide around the bend and

SPICYBUG traveled in mid-pack off the inside, rounded the bend three wide, closed in under left-handed urging, reeled in the leader in the final sixteenth
and drove clear. ITZEL showed speed between rivals then made a clear lead up the backstretch, moved over and showed the way along the rail through the
turn, spurted away in upper stretch but got run down late. PROCRASTINATION showed early speed then chased the pacesetter outside a rival, rounded the
bend three wide and lacked a bid in the furlong grounds. ALVINA (FR) was off slow to begin, ran up on heels early, steadied early on the turn, came four
wide the lane and earned a minor award. WITH LOVE (GB) was off slow in the beginning, traveled along the inside then tipped two wide into the lane and
improved position. LONG MAYSHE REIGN had early speed from inside then ceded command to the pacesetter, chased a bit off the rail through the turn
and weakened. PORT ELLEN (IRE) broke slow and bobbled, trailed into the turn, came two wide into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and never
threatened. HAVANA ANGEL (IRE) broke awkwardly, chased between into the turn, got boxed in near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out to a clear path
and could not rally. ANYBODY'S CHOICE was off slow to begin, tracked near the inside and weakened.

winner in upper stretch and got edged for the place honors. ST IGNACIO pulled and steadied off heels early, tugged on the inside, put to right-handed
urging in the lane and kept on to round out the superfecta. MEGA MOON forwardly placed two wide into the first turn, bumped outer rival and checked
around the bend, chased two wide into the lane and needed to find more late. QUALITY WINS was keen early stalked off the rail, got bumped three wide on
the clubhouse turn, stalked three deep into the second bend, lost ground while continued three wide to the stretch and failed to rally. HULA CANDY broke a

turn and improved position. DEFENSOR FORTIS tossed his head, shifted out and bumped rival at the start, chased wide through the first turn, bid four then
three deep on the second bend but flattened out in the lane. ARROMAX broke a step slow on the outside, unhurried in the early going and moved into the
two path, raced near the inside then two wide on the far turn, lugged inward in upper stretch and failed to menace. BRING HIM HOME got bumped from
outside and had to check early then became rank prior to the first turn, trailed early then went outside a rival, moved in on the backstretch, ridden along
through the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and failed to make an impact. HEARTBREAK KID traveled in mid-pack outside a rival, came three wide into
the lane and failed to menace. BIG ATTITUDE came in and bumped rival early, trailed into and around the far turn and had little left for the stretch run.
