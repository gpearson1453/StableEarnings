Footnotes
SILVER DASH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the
quarter pole and edged clear in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT ROYAL trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend,
began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground late. BIRDIE MACHINE tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend
from the two path, drifted out entering the stretch, bumping with BIG BOY MCCOY in the process, and gained ground late from there. DISTORTED PRO
stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and in
upper stretch and weakened late. SAINT CHARLES dueled on the inside through the early going, continued to battle while saving ground around the bend
and tired in the lane. BIG BOY MCCOY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three
path, bumped lightly with BIRDIE MACHINE entering the stretch and was empty from there.

Footnotes
BUBBA BOB raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn and
kicked clear while drifting out mildly in the lane. PROTONIC AND GIN bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, saved ground around the first
turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole,
bumped lightly with MYSTIFIER in upper stretch and gained ground late from there. MYSTIFIER raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch
off the pace between horses, began to move up while racing in the four path around the second turn, drifted in in upper stretch, bumping with PROTONIC
AND GIN in the process and gained ground to the wire. NORTH ARM BAY bumped with the horse to his outside at the gate, saved ground around the first
turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and finished evenly. SMART
OXIE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and showed no kick. COLOR
ME LEGENDARY led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second bend and in upper

opening half mile, moved up from the three path headed into the far turn, was cut off entering the stretch and stumbled when MYSTIFIER drifted into his
lane and took up from there. THE RIDER OF HORSE FOUR, BURNING LEAVES, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE THREE, PROTONIC AND GIN,
AND HORSE SEVEN, MYSTIFIER, CITING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE SAME INCIDENT.
