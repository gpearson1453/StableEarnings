Footnotes
AFERDITA was forwardly placed from the start racing along the inside, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole, assumed command nearing the
eighth pole and quickly drew clear. THEA'S THEME disputed the early pace set by PROSPERA, took the lead from that one before going a half mile, was
unable to resist the winner but continued on well for the place. PROSPERA saved ground setting the pressure pace to near the quarter pole and weakened.
MOON ME AGAIN prompted the pace while racing three-wide, was four-wide entering the stretch and tired. PLAYERA dropped well back early, lost contact
with the field and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
STONECOLDWARRIOR saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased his advantage. MARTINI MARTIN was allowed to settle in stride early,
move up three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly. LONG LIVE NOW prompted the issue to the stretch while racing two-wide and
weakened. RESPIRATOR saved ground talking the pace but lacked a response when called upon. DEFINE was forwardly place for six furlongs while racing
three-wide and tired. PRINCIPE raced five-wide while being unhurried and was not a factor.

MISSION KEY saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the inside to take the lead before going six furlongs and proved best
under strong handling. GAMBLING TZAR was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, caught the leaders nearing the quarter pole, came in slightly
nearing the sixteenth pole and earned the place in a game effort. JUST PLAIN ORNERY set the pace racing slightly off the rail, responded when challenged
and was tiring when steading from between horses when GAMBLING TZAR came in. UNORTHODOX was reserved off the pace, raced five-wide on the
backstretch and failed to threaten. GRECIAN PHAROAH was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and tired. THE RIDER OF JUST PLAIN
ORNERY LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST GAMBLING TZAR BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

GRAND PICK was prominently placed while racing three-wide, caught HUSBAND MATERIAL entering the stretch, dueled with that one and was drawing
clear late. HUSBAND MATERIAL prompted the early pace set by MAKOTO, took the lead from that one before going six furlongs, responded when
challenged and held on gamely during the drive for the place. ALVY was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch to offer a bid entering
the stretch and then hung. DELTA RIDGE saved ground while being reserved off the pace, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch but lacked a rally.
MAKOTO saved ground setting the pace for nearly six furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
GHOST OF KHOZAN prompted the pace set by POP SOCKS from along the outside, took the lead from that one entering the stretch and drew clear while
drifting in during the drive. BUSHWICK BRUISER saved ground while being close up early, angled out 3-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished
strongly. POP SOCKS saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and weakened during the drive. ALLIWORSHIPNADORE saved ground while being
allowed to settle and gradually improved his position racing along the inside. ENTRUST was three-wide while between horses in the middle of the field and
lacked a rally. SHIP MASTER settled in stride while racing four-wide and tired during the drive. RAY OF LIGHT was five-wide early, had his rider lose the
whip nearing the eighth pole and gave way. PER RULING #2023-00494 FROM HISA, ALLIWORSHIPNADORE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 4th TO
UNPLACED PER HISA RULE ON EXCESSIVE CROP STRIKES.

ELEGANT TASTE prompted EXPECT TO BE READY from along the outside, took the lead from that one entering the stretch and edged clear. CHALK
HILL saved ground while racing close up, came out sharply leaving the three-sixteenths pole bumping with MONIQUES DAREDEVIL while looking for room
and finished fast when straightened. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MONIQUES DAREDEVIL, CHALK
HILL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE. EXPECT TO BE READY saved ground setting the
pace, angled out nearing the eighth pole after being headed and held on gamely to the wire. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL was allowed to settle in stride, rallied
four-wide into the stretch, was bumped by CHALK HILL inside the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly when clear. REINA LA KELSY was unhurried
early, came six-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. SUIKO was reserved off the pace, moved up four-wide on the turn but lacked a late response.
REDWHITEANDTACOS was prominently placed while racing four-wide for six furlongs and then gave way.

BERKS saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased his advantage. TUNE IN saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through on the
turn and finished well for second in a steady effort. FLAT OUT FLYING was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
SUPER CONSTITUTION was prominently placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. FORTUNE'S FOOL prompted the pace from along the outside
to the stretch and tired. WOW WHATA SUMMER was off a step slow, then was rank to place early, saved ground when settled and failed to menace.

Footnotes
YOU'RE THE ONE vied with CHILD PROOF for the lead from along the inside, responded to shake that one off in upper stretch and drew clear. CHILD
PROOF vied with YOU'RE THE ONE from along the outside, was unable to match strides with that one late but continued on well for the place in a game
effort. ALICE HARPER was reserved off the early pace while racing five-wide and was along for third in a steady effort. LINAHASPECSHOES saved ground
while being allowed to settle, slipped through during the drive and then went evenly late. UNBRIDLED SASS was unhurried early, came six-wide into the
stretch and passed tiring rivals. LUNITA prompted the issue while racing three-wide and weakened during the drive. MY TRUE PASSION was prominently
placed early while racing four-wide and tired. CREATIVE CADENCE gave way after showing brief speed from between horses.
