Footnotes
LIFE IS A BANQUET broke out but on top, showed the way out of the chute toward the inside, continued to set the pace into the turn, shrugged off the
runner up when straightened for home, drew out while being kept to task. BILOXI in mid pack early, moved closest to the winner late in the turn, saw that
progress stall in upper stretch while drifting out, proved no match for that same foe the final furlong, remained clear of the others. MOTAWAAFEQ chased
the winner from along the inside, also proved no match in the drive, saved the show. LULOS in the main group while outside up the backstretch, four wide
into the turn, three wide exiting, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. ASHAAB off a step slow, trailed early as a result, was four wide
out of the turn, made little impact in the run to the wire. MUSTAFA broke out, faded through the stretch, trailed home.

Footnotes
MUCHO MARVIN bumped with MINISTER'S MEDAL at the break, raced back early as a result, made a quick five wide move into contention late in the turn,
challenged the leader past the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. WAR SONG with the pace up the backstretch while between foes,
showed the way through the turn just off the inside, continued to hold the advantage upper stretch, responded and raced on equal terms with the winner
inside the furlong marker, relinquished to that one late, held the place. BAYOU BEAUX last away, lacked early foot, came four to five wide out of the turn,
raced widest through the stretch, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. GENIUS broke back, lacked speed, rallied through traffic and was also
going well at the end. QUEST FOR AVETTE with the early pace inside, shuffled back into the turn, improved position while continuing along the rail into the
stretch, flattened out the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. B B MOODY vied up front while three wide, fell back through the turn, no menace stretch.
MINISTER'S MEDAL bumped with the winner at the break, recovered to contest the pace while four wide and between horses up the backstretch,
weakened after four furlongs. WYOMING CONQUEST with the pace while widest in the run up the backstretch, five wide into the turn, also backed up after
a half. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL fell back to trail after the start, was never a threat.

Footnotes
SPELLBINDING in the second flight early while between horses, moved closer second turn, dueled into the lane on the outside, got out a bit in upper
straight, was righted, edged away the final furlong under steady handling. WORLD WAR away in good order, alternated up front for five furlongs off the
inside, shook off the other speed far turn, was joined by the winner soon after, raced on equal terms with that into and through upper stretch, gave ground
stubbornly until late, remained clear of the others. MY LITTLE JEN in the second flight early, fell back the middle half, two path into the lane, late run to be
getting to the runner up late. BEAUTIFUL ENDING broke back, void of speed for five furlongs, angled out four wide turning for home, staged a mild rally
while widest down the lane. GATOR PROUD broke back, trailed most the the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
GLANCE reluctant to load, settled in mid pack, had little for the drive. EXACTA broke on top, helped set those quick early fractions, gave way far turn.

Footnotes
SARAH'S COURT forwardly placed early while three wide, fell back a bit off the two leaders late in the turn and into the stretch, set down, late surge to be
up in time outside that same pair of rivals at the wire. TAP GALORE moved up to contest the pace along the inside up the backstretch, dueled out of the
turn and through the stretch, held the advantage late,nailed in the final strides by the winner. CRUSIN LIKE A CAT away in good order, vied early outside
the running up dueled with that one through the latter portion of the turn and through the stretch, weakened between that same foe and the winner late.
CUSTOM SUNSHINE back off the early pace, moved closer four wide turning for home, flattened out the final furlong to post no threat to the top three.
EMILYHASHERTURN in mid pack outside, raced five out to six wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick as well. HART'S PRETTY GIRL void of speed,
moved well outside, five wide into the stretch, improved position with some belated interest. LONG LEGGED LADY in the second flight well wide, five path
into the lane, tired in the run to the wire. CAJUN ROCK STAR broke on top, with the early pace, shuffled back from between foes into the turn, continued to
fade. ONE LINE RULER broke back, moved up in some traffic early, had little for the drive. ZOSIAS SHIP fell back soon after the start and was not a factor.
BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY broke inward and a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
US SECOND CUTE PIE unhurried early while clear along the inside, continued to patiently handled into the far turn, called on for some run with just over a
quarter remaining, swung out five wide into the lane, late bid outside, up in time. COINMAKER forwardly placed from the start, closer before a half, ranged
up and took over late in the final turn, clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner. SERIOUSLY SAM settled behind a moderate pace, picked up the
tempo while three to four wide into the lane, proved no match for the top two late, clear of the rest. IRON BANNER worked way clear before a quarter,
showed the way up the backstretch, continued to hold the advantage into the far turn, began to weaken when headed by the runner up soon after.
PSEUDOSCIENCE in the second group between horses past the wire the first time, continued off the pace, four wide into the lane, remained one paced to
the wire. BARBIE WARS chased the early leader, moved on that one between foes and inside the runner up while between horses second turn, weakened
down the stretch. MSCHITCHATTOUR bumped and bothered at the break to be last away, remained back in failing to rally. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS broke
out, bumped foe, failed to menace. SUGAR STAR broke back and was never a factor. CAJUN TWO STEP mid pack, began to fade after a half.

Footnotes
ISOLATION close from the start out in the strip, moved on the winner and took over late in the turn, shook clear by the time she was straightened for home,
held the runner up comfortably at bay the final furlong under steady handlng. PEACEFUL VISION forwardly placed in the two path and inside the winner,
asked along turn but failed to keep up with that entering the stretch, chased past the furlong marker, modest late gain on that same rival while clearly
second best. COUNTRY DREAM lacked early foot, came five wide for the drive, proved no match for the top two to the wire, held sway for the show.
YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY broke on top, cleared toward the inside early, continued to show the way into the turn, offered but brief resistance to the winner
midway on the bend then began to weaken when headed. GEE GEE forwardly placed out of the chute inside, fell back before a half, went evenly through
the stretch. CAJUN SHOTS broke back, void of early foot, moved out a bit for room past the furlong marker then displayed a modest amount of late interest.
BE A BANDIT in the second flight outside, four wide into the stretch, had little for the run to the wire. KEHRON'S CREED in mid pack, backed up while
racing in the three path. MISSGREELEY'SSONG last away, trailed.

Footnotes
ANDIAMO GIACOMO broke well, fell back off the issue while racing outside, came five wide for the drive, set down, challenged outside the leader with a
sixteenth remaining and edged clear. CUSTOM BOBBY'S behind the lead pack outside, stalked those leaders four wide through the turn, called on for some
run into the lane, challenged and took over with less than a furlong remaining, could not contain the winner late while inside that one. SADIE'S LIGHT in mid
pack while racing off the inside, evenly paced past the midstretch point, late rally to be up for the show. HUFFS TAZ A BOO last to leave, void of speed for
three furlongs, was six wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally to improve position. FREE FROM GUILT lacked speed after breaking near the rear, angled
out to be five wide into the lane,improved position by passing tiring rivals. CHARLI MICHAEL vied up front while three wide, continued to hold a narrow
margin past the furlong marker then gave way. LION HEART LEGEND set or forced the early pace along the inside and gave way. ADIEU ACES with the
pace between foes early, dueled along the inside late turn, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
DAT GUITAR in mid pack early while racing outside, rallied three wide out of the turn, closed with good energy to win going away at the end. TONI'S M
broke outward but with the leaders, stalked that pair into the turn in the three path, challenged energy the stretch, vied late between foes and inside the
winner, proved no match in the final strides, clear for the place. REQUITE THE EFFORT broke alertly, dueled early in the two path, disposed of the other
speed by late in the turn, briefly responded when challenged by the runner up past the furlong marker then could not keep up, saved the show. SHOOTING
STICK lacked speed, four wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally to improve a bit, not a threat to the top three. CHUCHI had a one paced effort while
racing off the inside. REMEMBERIN RONALD also went evenly in lacking a rally. TOP CON fell back to trail after the start, passed some tiring rivals after
the issue had been decided. QUEEN'S SOLDIER broke back and was not a factor. KRAZY KATIE dueled early along the inside, began to give way before
three furlongs. VEGAS ON MY MIND was finished early, trailed home.
