Footnotes
LEAVEITONTHEFIELD sprinted out to the lead soon after the start and crossed over to the inside, led the way under some pressure from REVINER in the
opening quarter then widened to a clear advantage, continued to pull away from the field up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn,
drifted out wider, encouraged right handed, remained unchallenged and finished in hand. SKYLINE was off to a good start and raced two wide into the first
turn, rated off the clear pacesetter up the backstretch, came under a ride around the far turn, swung three wide into the lane, was no match for pulling away
winner but sustained bid and finished clearly second best. REVENIR raced in striking distance of LEAVEITONTHEFIELD in the opening quarter before rival
pulled away from the field, chased the clear leader up the backstretch and around the far turn, came two wide into the stretch run and churned on for a
share. GABRIEL'S LEGEND was unhurried and raced in the back around the first turn, continued reserved up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
turn and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
U CAN DO U broke sharp and quickly came under pressure from GRACIE"S BOY ROY, dueled inside of rival around the turn, raced in a bit tight in upper
stretch, failed to match strides with aforementioned rival approaching the eighth pole, continued to chase after the leader then found more in reserve in the
final sixteenth, surged gamely up the inside and nailed GRACIE"S BOY ROY on the wire. GRACIE'S BOY ROY quickly advanced to engage U CAN DO IT
for the lead soon after the start, dueled outside of rival around the turn, came two wide into the lane, shook free nearing the eighth pole, stayed on willingly
but got caught when winner surged up the inside in final stride. RUN FIRE RUN tracked the top trio four wide around the turn, hustled along the outside into
the lane, gathered momentum when called upon and finished strongly. SECRET STRATEGY raced off the early pace, swung four wide into stretch run and
had a mild improve. BELL DOZER got bumped at the start, raced in range tracking the top pair, hustled along two wide into the lane then flattened in the
final furlong. MR. BENNY was forwardly placed in the early going, chased three wide around the turn then tired in the drive. BORDINOS broke in and
bumped with rival at the start, lacked speed and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
BROKEN HEARTS BAY was allowed to settle out of the gate and rated off the early leaders, edged a bit closer late on the backstretch, let out a notch and
circled up four wide in hand to put a head in front at the quarter pole, shook the reins in upper stretch, responded willingly, pulled away from the field and
finished ridden out. TRUE EMOTION got bumped a bit at the start and rated off the early pace, edged closer leaving the backstretch, moved up three wide
to challenge for the lead approaching the quarter pole, could not kick on with eventual winner turning for home but sustained a steady effort and cleared
second best. JILL'S LEMON DROP dueled inside a duo up the backstretch, took on added challengers late on the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, was
no match for pulling away winner but ran on and cleared a share. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY was away in good order then briefly drifted in strides out of the
gate, quickly straightened out and advanced to duel for the lead, battled three wide around the turn then came up empty in the lane. FREE WILL got
bumped at the start, raced in range tracking the top flight, chased four wide around the turn then weakened in the lane. SHADE dueled between rivals up
the backstretch, could not match strides past the mid-way point on the turn and gave way. SUPER CINDY broke out and bumped with rival at the start and
never moved into contention.

OUR LAST CHANCE broke on top then conceded position to TOPPER T, remained forwardly placed tracking the leader up the backstretch, advanced to
engage TOPPER T for the lead mid-way around the turn, briefly dueled for command then shook free entering the lane, widened to a clear advantage and
kept to task under steady encouragement. MOLLIES ROCKET tracked the pace three to four wide up the backstretch, edged closer on the top pair late on
the turn, swung four wide into the lane, responded under left handed pressure and sustained bid to finish second best. BASIC CHANCE raced three wide in
range in the opening quarter, picked up- the tempo midway around the turn, shifted out five wide turning for home, ran on with response and secured a
share. TIME GOES ON was allowed to settle through early stages, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner and edged closer along the rail to the
eighth pole then flattened out. TOPPER T cleared the lead and crossed over soon after the start, continued to lead the way up the backstretch, took on the
challenge of OUR LAST CHANCE at the five sixteenths pole, matched strides around the turn then got collared by the eventual winner heading into the lane
and gave way.

Footnotes
ARRESTED was forwardly placed and tracked the leader up the backstretch, edged closer late on the turn, given cue two wide and took over the lead
heading into the lane, responded under pressure, widened to a clear advantage and held late under a driving finish. RUNNINTHESTREETS raced off the
pace up the backstretch, picked up the tempo midway around the turn, shifted out four to five wide leaving the quarter pole, swung into action entering the
lane, finished strongly and closed on the winner. HOT SUMMER DREAM sped to the lead at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside, held firm
around the turn, got collared by the eventual winner at the head of the lane and weakened to show. DELTA MOON was not too far back in early stages,
chased three wide around the turn, got carried out five wide entering the stretch run and failed to move on. LOVE AMPLIFIED raced off the early pace, was
ridden along three to four wide around the turn and failed to respond. I BILEVE raced in contention up the backstretch, weakened around the turn and
continued to tire in the drive.
