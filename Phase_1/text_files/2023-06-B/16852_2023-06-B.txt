REBELDE stalked the pace three wide, took over leaving the eighth pole and powered clear under left-handed urging. PERFECT CUT set the pace in the
two path, drew clear around the turn, led past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner from there but held clear of the rest. IT'S FATE saved ground off
the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show. GOLD WING pressed the pace two wide and faded after five furlongs. SHA TIN was up
close inside and faltered in the lane. LONG BEACH KID trailed inside.

Footnotes
HOT FOOT SUSIE brushed with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, was under confident handling around the turn, cued to open up from
the five path at the top of the stretch, and was kept to task. MARTINI'S AMICA chased in the three path, was under right handed urging around the turn, and
ran on from the four path into the stretch for place. SOPHIA LAUREN brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, was coaxed
from the two path rounding the turn, angled out to the five path in upper stretch, then tipped back inwards into the final furlong, and kept on for show. OUR
LA DOLCE VITA stalked in the five path, ranged up in the four path around the turn, but floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and flattened.
OVERRUN tracked along the rail but made no impact. BREAKING BULLET brushed with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, was
in the three path turning into the lane, but lugged in twice down the lane while fading. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT brushed with an outer foe at the start, was behind
in the five path early and did not threaten. MY REAL DREAM was wellback in the two path and never menaced.

COCO tracked the pace three wide, moved to the front leaving the five-sixteenths marker and drew off under a drive. CALLING ALL ANGELS (IRE) stalked
the pace two wide, bid between foes midway around the far turn, briefly led, but was no match for the winner. LADY AZTECA raced off the pace two wide,
advanced two wide between rivals around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and held the show. ZOSTEROP chased the pace inside, could not keep
pace rounding the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and improved position. STUCK IN MALIBU failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BLACK
ICE was outrun inside. X Y LADY set the pace in the two path around the first turn and along the rail into the far turn and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

STARSHIP AGENDA trailed in the three path early, tipped out to the six path passing the five-eighths, advanced from the four path early into the far turn, bid
passing the quarter, took the lead while in the three path in upper stretch, and was driven clear. TO THYSELF B TRUE tracked inside, was cued while
tipping out to the three path into the far turn, briefly lead passing the quarter, but was overtaken by the winner while in the two path in upper stretch, and
held place. DREAMS FLOAT rated in the three path, was roused into the far turn, angled out to the five path into the stretch, and stayed on for show.
ETNA'S NAPPER was in the six path around the first turn, raced off the pace on the four path down the backside, and made no impact. STARSHIP
PHOENIX raced up close in the three path but faded around the far turn. CANDY STRIKE set the pace in the two path, was coaxed early into the far turn,
but yielded into the lane. SEEK stalked in the five path but started to backup after a half.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING TONES was devoid of speed, edged closer in the two path around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, closed with a rush and was up on
the wire. KHOZEIRESS was off a bit slowly, advanced between foes down the backstretch, raced in range three and four wide around the turn, steadily
gained on the leader through the lane, took the lead in deep stretch and was nailed on the wire. SUPER CHOW prompted the pace four wide down the
backstretch, took the lead near the half-mile pole, drew clear and angled into the two path early on the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and led
until the final strides. SWIRVIN dueled three wide between foes down the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch,
re-rallied between foes and steadied late. MR. PEEKS chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. ZYDECEAUX raced up close at the rail,
continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. SOUND DOCTRINE vied between foes down the backstretch, stopped around the turn and was eased in
the lane.

Footnotes
LOCO ABARRIO brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the five path, bid under coaxing in the four path around the turn, took the lead while in the
six path at the top of the stretch, and went clear under a drive. BIG MARTINI prompted the pace in the four path, briefly led while under a ride in the three
path approaching the quarter, but lost the lead at the top of the lane, and ran on to hold place. REDDINGTON was held up along the rail early, advance into
range going into the turn, was roused midway around the turn and angled out to the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. CROSS HASTE stalked
between foes in the three path, was cued midway around the turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, and finished evenly. SONG RUNNER set the
pace in the two path, was roused into the turn, but faded turning into the stretch. MORGAN POINT steadied passing the five-eighths, raced in midpack
around the four path, was coaxed early into the turn, urged from the three path into the lane, but flattened. DIAMOND COOL chased from the six path into
the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no threat. KNOX was behind in the four path and never menaced. AXCEL brushed with an
outer foe at the start, was wellback in the seven path and never got involved. NOWITZKI steadied early and raced off the pace in the two path, was pulled
up rounding the turn, and walked off.

Footnotes
MILLENNIUM CONDO raced off the pace three wide, made some progress three wide between foes while often in tight quarters, angled four wide turning
for home, continued on the left lead, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under drive. AMBUSHED saved ground off the pace,
angled four wide near the quarter pole, took the lead in midstretch, was collared near the sixteenth pole but fought on inside of the winner. GUNMAN raced
off the early pace four wide, made a quick move around the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led past the eighth pole but was no match
for the top two in the final furlong. LEOPARDI pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes near the five-sixteenths marker and faded in the lane. SOLAR
TAP broke in a tangle, trailed in the three path, advanced six wide around the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. MINELLA set the pace along the
rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. BLUE LIEUTENANT
hit the starting gate, raced up close while six wide around the first turn, chased outside down the backstretch and retreated around the far turn. MONEY
MAP failed to menace while racing four and five wide. DANLEY was outrun inside. BIG BUCKSALOT tracked the pace four wide, checked off heels turning
for home and was eased from there.

Footnotes
KISLOVODSK tracked in the three path, ranged up in the four path under a ride around the turn, took the lead while in the five path at the top of the lane,
and was driven clear. GREAT KOSTAS stalked along the rail, steadied passing the half, was stymied approaching the quarter, angled out to the center in
upper stretch, and ran on for place. TIK TOKABLE prompted the pace in the four path, bid between foes in the three path rounding the turn, but evened out
for show. MIRO trailed in the three path, was coaxed in the two path midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path into the lane, but was no factor.
CASH IT raced off the pace in the six path but made no impact. CORPORATE AFFAIR set the pace in the two path but gaveway down the lane.
