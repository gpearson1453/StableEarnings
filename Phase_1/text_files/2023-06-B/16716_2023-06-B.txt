Footnotes
A LITTLE GRACE vied for the lead with VANDULIE from along the inside, responded to pressure and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. CALIFORNIA
HALO stalked the pace racing along the outside, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled with the winner from that point but was
unable to get by that one in a game try. BIKINI NATION saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, slipped through entering the stretch, angled
out three-wide nearing the sixteenth pole and picked up the show in a steady effort. VANDULIE disputed the pace for a half mile from along the outside and
weakened. PISTA GIRL was close up early, drifted out on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.

dueled with the winner from along the outside, wasn't quite good enough but held on gamely to the wire. SHELBY SHORTSTOP saved ground while being
forwardly placed and earned the show in a steady effort. DREWY was never far back, came five-wide into the stretch to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole
and then flattened out during the drive. SPECIAL DIVA hopped in the air at the start to get away behind her field, then was wide on the turn, came six-wide
into the stretch and showed some interest late. ATHENA D'ORO saved ground early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ZENDU
dropped back early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
AMERICAN GRIT saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed nearing the eighth pole, regained the lead when SOCAL RED ducked out
nearing the sixteenth pole and prevailed. WARRIORS HERO was allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished fast. ALTITUDE
was forwardly placed while racing two-wide and finished in a mild rally. C JAXON saved ground chasing the early pace, angled out to be three-wide entering
the stretch and then went evenly late. SOCAL RED was prominently place early while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid leaving the three-eighths
pole, gained the lead nearing the eighth pole, ducked out sharply nearing the sixteenths pole and finished willingly when straightened. VALIDATE dropped
back early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. MARKSMAN ON TARGET saved ground while being unhurried and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY was allowed to settle in stride, rallied five-wide the final quarter and finished fast to be up in the final strides. CONTEJAS bobbled
at the start, then moved up to prompt the issue while racing two-wide, gained the lead nearing the eighth pole and just failed to last. PERFECT ONE was
pinched back at the start dropping well off the early pace, then saved ground into the stretch before angling out nearing the sixteenth pole and gained his
best stride too late. MISTER MAFIOSO was prominently placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. AGRIGENTO broke in, then saved ground setting
the pace into the stretch and weakened late. THE THIRD RING was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and went evenly. REIGN OF SPEED
broke out, then saved ground while being forwardly placed for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
BABY FRANKIE was reserved off the pace, moved up between horses on the turn, angled out to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly
to be up in the final sixteenth to win going away. ANNA'S IRON MAN saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
responded when challenged and while unable to resist the winner held on gamely for the place. PLAYOFF BOUND saved ground stalking the pace, slipped
through along the inside to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole and then hung. BEL RAGAZZO saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during
the drive and was gaining slightly late. DYF settled in the middle of the pace, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch but lacked a rally.
WARFRONT FIGHTER disputed the issue while racing three-wide and weakened during the drive. KINGSTEN'S GOLD dropped back after stumbling at the
start, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position late. POPPY'S C NOTE prompted the issue for a half mile while two-wide and tired.
COMMAND SGT MAJOR was unhurried after breaking in the air and failed to menace. ALPINE HYPNOSIS raced four-wide and gave way after a half mile.
