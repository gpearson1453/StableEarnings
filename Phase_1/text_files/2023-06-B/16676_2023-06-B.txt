Footnotes
HAD THE NOTION rated a short lead inside, kept the edge over SO RED THE ROSE through the backstretch, came under pressure leaving the five
sixteenths pole and dug in under steady handling to hold on. The latter stalked two deep, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on
the far turn and finished well at the outside poll of the winner. MOJO MATTERS settled in good striking position off the rail, gave chase toward the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. UPSY DAISY DO saved ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the
rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. A BLONDE THING settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
HIERRO settled in the three path on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and closed to even terms in the three path midway on the far turn,
drifted leaving the turn but dug in from the head of the lane, came between horses in deep stretch and got up the final yards. ELVIRUS raced well off the
pace and off the rail the first turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, took the nod approaching the head of the
lane, was carried out leaving the far turn and dug in under steady handling but was caught in the final yards. MY MIRACLE MAN settled just off the rail on
the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. WE B
SHACKIN saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled widest into the lane
and passed rivals. REY O REYES rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the
far turn but was met toward the head of the lane and flattened inside the eighth pole. JOHNNY SWISH saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. MI GUSTO ES tapered in and raced with the early pace two
deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. BIG DADDY D R rounded the
opening turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed little response. BERNIE'S ON FIRE came away awkwardly, rounded the first turn in the
four path and showed little response through the backstretch. PARISHIONER saved ground then faded through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed,
then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Hierro for alleged interference leaving the far turn, lodged by the rider of Elvirus.
