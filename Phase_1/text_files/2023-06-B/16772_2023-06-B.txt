Footnotes
BIG BELLA BROWN stalked the pace, raced on the rail through out, had a well timed clean trip, was asked at the eighth pole and willingly passed rivals on
the inside getting up in time for the win. GOLD MERRITT used his natural speed and vied for the early lead on a loose rein, set the fractions willingly,
showed the way almost to the wire but was caught after the sixteenth pole by a stalking closer, was able to hold on to second. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG
stalked while racing in the three path, was in contention but had no late kick. PEPPER JACK raced in the three path on the outside of another ocmpetitor,
shifted out into the five path nearing the three eighths pole but made no impact late. J B GRAY broke into the two post position path, was quickly corrected,
settled in along the rail and was never involved. PERFECT PERIGEE showed little.

BROADWAY PEARL was in the middle of the pack on the outside of horses in the four path, improved position along the outside by the half, was cued at
the three eighths pole and willingly responded by circling the field, was encouraged in the stretch, continued to respond well and closed magnificently,
finished with a lot of horse and easily got by her rivals and up for the win. DAISY DE ORO raced in the middle of the field on the rail early on, slowly but
surely inched up into a stalking position, split foes nearing the three eighths pole, smartly waited for racing room leaving the turn, stayed on the rail and
closed down the stretch, shifted out after the eighth pole to pass a tired rival and was kept on point and focused while still closing and earned a nice second.
MARK WITH AN E was off a bit slow, trailed early on in the three path, gained ground, shifted out near the three eighths pole, shifted out again entering the
upper stretch, raced six wide down the stretch, responded well to urging and encouragement, willingly closed got up in time for third.
SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW vied for the early lead, raced in the two path while setting the early pace, was encouraged at the quarter pole, struggled to switch
leads and tired along the rail late. CAT B CAUSE raced from off of the pace near the back of the field on the rail, settled in hands, shifted into the six path
after the five sixteenth pole, had no finish. LOVELY JOYCE raced along the rail, off of the pace in the second flight of horses, maintained that position into
the furlong ground, struggled to switch leads and hung late. KISS UPON A STAR was mid pack early on, raced in the three path in the third flight of horses,
as cued and advanced before the half mile pole, responded well and passed horses, raced in between foes entering the turn, was within striking distance
but had no late kick. PINCHING PENNIES was well off the pace, raced in the three path, improved position. THE X FACTOR raced mid pack from the three
path, maintained position through out. COURT COSTS raced mid pack early on, settled in on the rail, fell back and had no rally. HOLIDAY FLOWERS was
mid pack early on and racing three wide, advanced on the outside and stalked through the turn then faded. PENNIE'S MAGIC trailed through out.
