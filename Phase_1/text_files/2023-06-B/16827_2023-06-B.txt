Footnotes
SIGMUND chased the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the two path on the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously in the
drive. SAGE RUNNER stalked the pace between horses down the backstretch, eased out to the four path in upper stretch and rallied outside SIGMUND to
come to even terms at the finish. GETTIN'DOWNONIT , a forward factor along the inner rail, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and finished gamely
inside the top pair. FROG PRINCE , unhurried down the backstretch, raced in the three path entering the stretch, swung outside for room in mid stretch and
rallied. EDDIEMUSH , three wide both turns, was fanned four deep at the head of the stretch and failed to rally. SNIP THE ROSES , taken to the inner rail
after sprinting clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace to the stretch then gradually weakened. TOAST TO COAST , always inside horses,
weakened. PERFECT PEACE , four wide both turns, lacked a rally. SRIVIJAYA trailed and was eased.

Footnotes
DOWN COLD tracked the leader while two to three wide, was coaxed along leaving the far turn, moved to engage mid turn, spurted clear entering the lane,
responded to firm right handed asks and widened. HELLMAN settled four wide and outside rivals, took closer order leaving the three eighths, raced as the
closest pursuer leaving the three sixteenths, flattened out late and just saved the place. MAILMAN'S A FLYER , between rivals while off the rail, remained in
last nearing the lane, swung six wide for the drive, finished with good energy and just missed second. DAREDAVITE , three to four wide stalking the early
pace, dropped back some around the turn, came back a bit near mid stretch then failed to sustain. WONDER WATER saved ground and came up empty.
OROCOVIX stalked while racing to the inside of a rival, had aim two wide into the stretch, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and gave way. HE'S ON
FIRE cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, was taken on by the winner mid turn, stayed on past the quarter pole then faltered.

HAZELMOOR BEACH broke a bit awkwardly, moved up in the two path on the far turn, drifted in approaching the stretch, raced erratically through the
stretch, gained the lead in mid stretch and lasted. TANKA TOUGH , rank at the break, was pinched back soon after the start, got carried wide by WINDS OF
FORTUNE entering the first turn, circled four wide into the stretch and rallied outside rivals. PEACE FIRE , carried wide by WINDS OF FORTUNE entering
the first turn, raced along the inner rail on the far turn, eased out entering the stretch, was caught in narrow quarters outside HAZELMOOR BEACH in mid
stretch and finished gamely. CALL ME VIVIAN , three wide the far turn, failed to rally. GAVE set the pace along the inner rail, opened up on the far turn and
faded. LACEY UNDERALL broke slowly and was outrun. AHSOKA chased the pace and weakened. ALICORN hugged the inner rail leaving the backstretch
and was not a factoe. WINDS OF FORTUNE bumped with SUPER MONEY leaving the starting gate, bore out entering the first turn then was outrun.
SUPER MONEY bumped at the start, prompted the pace, drifted out leaving the far turn and walked off after being pulled up. An objection by the rider of
PEACE FIRE against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
BOSS LOGIC , urged three deep heading to the turn, angled out a bit and gathered momentum five wide nearing the lane, was floated out by a rival leaving
the three sixteenths, straightened and responded to right handed asks, was guided in a few paths, surged past the leader leaving the sixteenth marker and
eagerly drew out. AIR TOKEN prompted the pace outside MUCH BETTER, moved to the attack into the turn, took over between rivals near the three
eighths, shook clear an while guided three wide into the stretch, kept on under solid encouragement past mid stretch, drifted in late, faded but remained
clear of the rest. GREAT DAYS AHEAD broke inward and bumped with a rival, corrected and settled off the inside, gained five wide nearing the lane, shifted
in for the final furlong and churned on. CLUBMAN was squeezed back soon after the break, regrouped and settled well back while saving ground, eased out
nearing the lane with an advance, was guided inward for the final furlong and kept on with interest. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN , bumped at the start, edged up
early and stalked about five wide, dropped in and bid three deep leaving the far turn, chased AIR TOKEN into the lane, drifted outward nearing mid stretch
and gave way. GALLANT GOLD rated in the two path, swung out about six wide for the drive but lacked a rally. SPONSORED , three wide between runners
leaving the far turn, dropped back mid turn, angled out but failed to respond. MUCH BETTER sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, ceded
command near the three eighths, chased to about the quarter pole, faltered and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
RESPECTFULLY broke on top despite drifting out, corrected and had speed outside rivals to take a slim early lead, moved clear leaving the five eighths
pole and dropped down to the two path to set a rated pace, edged away around the turn, came three wide into the lane, opened up under a right handed
ask in mid stretch then continued to widen while minimally ridden the final sixteenth of a mile. I'M GITTIN THERE , three wide under urging leaving the far
turn, angled in mid turn, saved ground with an advance in mid stretch, kept on with effort and saved the place. DRY WELL settled off the pace while saving
ground, gained to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, briefly waited off the heels of I'M GITTIN THERE near the five sixteenths, angled three wide in
upper stretch, swung out wider near mid stretch and churned on. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , four to five wide pursuing the winner, faded through the final
furlong. GOLDEN EFFECT edged up between runners early, gave hard chase three wide mid turn, came four wide for the drive and weakened. IN MY
OPINION lagged well back, swung seven wide for the drive and lacked a rally. CHAMPAGNE TOAST broke a step slow, was urged along in the clear and
failed to menace. HASHTAG LUCKY rushed up to the inside of rivals nearing the five eighths and prompted the pace, eased back off the winner soon after,
chased two wide leaving the far turn and faltered. An objection by the rider of DRY WELL against I'M GITTIN THERE for alleged interference around the
turn was not allowed

RUTHANNE vied under rating and to the outside of MAJOR HOULIHAN, was roused clear nearing the quarter pole, opened up under firmer asking in upper
stretch then continued to widen under a steady hand ride. LA VITA SOFIA settled off the pace but not too far back, edged up between runners nearing the
far turn, continued progress past the five sixteenths, angled four wide for the drive, gave willing chase from there and held down the place. JUST NORTH ,
well wide into the first turn, dropped in a bit and settled, moved up behind foes around the far turn, waited briefly, swung out wide into the lane, chased to
mid stretch then flattened out. SOLVING PROGRESS , five wide into the first turn, stalked four wide outside rivals past the five eighths, was under a solid
ride leaving the far turn, failed to seriously kick on past the five sixteenths and faded. MAJOR HOULIHAN vied inside the winner, was pushed along to hold
position near the five sixteenths, failed to keep up leaving the three sixteenths and gave way. SIX THE HARD WAY , well placed stalking towards the inside,
remained in range to the quarter pole then retreated. LIL SPINNER prompted the pace three wide between foes, dropped back leaving the three eighths and
wandered outward approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
GOGO CHANEL , patiently handled early, hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch, bid for the lead near the
sixteenth pole and determinedly prevailed. FIVECOMMATWO saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail in mid stretch and closed gamely inside the
winner. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR sped to the early lead, set the pace near the two path and weakened. BALLYHOOLY lacked speed, swung very wide
turning for home and showed a late move outside horses. IRISH LACE lacked speed, raced inside horses throughout and was not a factor. SWEET SHUGS
, checked when getting out entering the turn, raced wide and failed to rally. AMERICAS WOMAN was outrun. PRINCESS PALMER , three deep chasing the
pace around the turn, faltered. ODINA was not a factor.
