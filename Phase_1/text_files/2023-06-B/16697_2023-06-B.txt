Footnotes
COPPER KAN broke alertly at the head of the pack, settled in hand to track the leaders from two wide in the second flight while patiently handled, angled
out at the head of the lane and reeled in the game pacesetters in deep stretch to be going away at the wire. BRINGONTHEBUBBLY pressed the pace from
two wide, exchanged bobs on the lead with RUNWAY HIT to mid-stretch, was passed late by the winner and the show horse but battled back gamely near
the wire to garner the place. RUNWAY HIT sped up the fence to duel on the lead shortly from the gate, battled willingly on the lead to deep stretch, could
not hold off the winner and surrendered the place in the final strides in a good effort. TAPITSGOTAPISTOL broke with the field, dropped to race in the back
pair and never menaced. COUNTRY VISION trailed in the back pair and never was a threat. SHEZ DA BEEZ KNEEZ chased the pace from the rail in the
second flight and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
TRES SOLES tracked the pace while being well rated along the inside throughout the first three quarters, then was urging on the far turn, dug in gamely in
the early stretch and rushed to the wire to prove best. READY TO ROLL chased the pace from the inside into the first turn and into the second turn, then
gained command in the early stretch and was closing gamely but was outkicked in the end by an inner rival and was second best. COLOR FAST saved
ground while racing behind the field throughout the backstretch, was gaining steadily on the far turn from the three path, then rallied in the upper stretch and
was closing strong in the end. HOLY EMPEROR stalked the pace while two wide, then menaced throughout the far bend and into the early stretch then
gave way in the end. SUMMER LOVER settled in the two path down the backstretch, then came out four wide on the far turn to rally in the late stretch but
came up empty. MANOR BORN settled along the inside throughout the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to close well in the stretch but it wasn't enough.
EXETER chased the pace while three wide on the backstretch, was in a hard drive throughout the far turn then continued to close gamely in the home
stretch but it wasn't enough. CANATLAN set the pace into the first turn, then lead the way into the second turn under a steady hand ride, then faltered in the
stretch.

Footnotes
FEARLESS PRINCE pressed the pace from shortly out of the gate, dueled from two wide with the runner-up, repelled early challenges at the quarter pole
and out-finished the pacesetter late in the lane to draw clear. WILL THE THRILL sped to the lead along the fence, dueled with the winner to mid-stretch
while separating from the rest of the field but was out-finished late in the lane. SILENCE D'ORO raced up the fence just off the early lead, could not
establish a rail position and was forced to steady behind the two dueling leaders repeatedly for over a quarter mile while unable to find room between horses
or on the fence, angled out at the top of the lane and finished willingly. STANS HOME RUN dropped to nearly the tail of the field shortly from the gate and
showed mild late interest rallying in the stretch. MY GOLDEN M reared as the gates opened spotting the field several lengths, rushed up five wide to be
prominent in the turn and flattened out coming home. TAPITS KASH well placed early on but lacked a response when called upon in the turn. TEXAS GOLD
RUSH trailed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
BLING DANCER vied for the lead while four wide, was in a steady drive to gain the lead leaving the turn, then held on well down the stretch to succeed in
the end. ALL AMERICAN LADY chased the pace while three wide, then was urging steadily throughout the bend to gain second position, continued to rally
in the stretch but could not catch the leader in the end. SHAKE THOSE DICE raced behind the field into the turn, then angled out four wide, dug in gamely
in the early stretch and closed willingly. DULCE AMANECER YG vied for the lead while three wide, then settled back on the turn, then re rallied in the
stretch to close well in the end. TEXACANA chased the pace while two wide, then settled back throughout the turn to rebid in the upper stretch from the five
path but was no threat. CREAM PUFF REAPER vied for the lead from the inside, was in a strong drive throughout the bend then gave way on the stretch.
CRESSONS LIL CHARM was fractious in the gate after being reloaded, then vied between rivals under a hard drive into the turn then flattened out in the
stretch. LITTLE ELLIE sat in the gate prior to the start and had to be reloaded, then chased the pace from the inside into the turn and did not respond in the
stretch.

Footnotes
BYE sped to the lead from between horses to duel to head of the lane, shook clear of the pace pressers to open a clear advantage and held the closer safe
to the line. DARK AFTERNOON unhurried in the early going, rallied midway on the turn circling six wide to mount a fast closing rally and came up two
strides short. AARON'S SPIRIT settled off the pace from between horses, responded when called upon and finished well in the lane. WILL TAKE CASH
sent up the rail for the early lead, dueled from the fence under constant pressure to upper stretch and weakened deep in the drive. TUNGSTEN saved
ground along the fence racing at the head of the second flight, threatened turning for home and flattened out down the stretch. TOO MUCH INFO tracked
the leaders while well positioned two wide, raced with head cocked to the inside around the turn and lacked a response when called upon turning for home.
RODEO CHAMP trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the lane. DOSE'S DREAM went evenly as no threat. MUD ON MY BOOTS used early to
be prompting the pace from three wide into the turn and came up empty.

throughout the first half then surged down the lane from the sixth path to be up for the place prize. TOOTIE was rated along the inside down the backstretch,
then bid on the turn to close belatedly in the stretch. ITS A GEE THING raced in the second group of rivals while three wide, was moving up on the turn to

MAJOR CONTENDER stalked the pace from three wide into the turn, took the lead at the quarter pole, was headed in mid-stretch by the runner-up and
fought back gamely to prevail at the wire. KISS PRINCIPAL settled near the rear of the field in the early going, steadily gained ground down the backstretch,
rallied five wide in the turn to engage the leaders, rider lost whip leaving the quarter pole, overtook the leader in mid-stretch but was out-finished late in the
lane. DENS DEVILLE rated in mid-pack to the head of the stretch, angled out and made a good belated rally to be gaining late. VICTOR VALENTINO
unhurried for the first half mile, gained ground in the turn to threaten in upper stretch and finished evenly. GIST slow early to trail, gained some ground in the
turn and passed weakening rivals down the lane. BIG STORY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, moved up entering the first turn to press the pace and
weakened turning for home. SOMEBODY IN TEXAS took control of the pace into the first turn, set a pressured pace down the backside and retreated
through the stretch. BRAZIL NUT went evenly and was never a threat. PLUTONIUM well placed for the first half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
IBERIAN RUNNER tracked the pace while being well rated along the inside, was moving up on the second turn, gained command mid stretch then held on
to prove best in the end. TEAM GORMLEY dueled for the lead from the inside throughout the first three quarters, was in a long drive heading into the
stretch, continued to rally gamely and held onto the place prize in the end. KING ARTHUR RIDGE settled along the inside under a steady hand ride from the
first turn and into the second then rallied in late stretch to close gamely for the show prize. EAGLEFORD tracked the pace while two wide down the
backstretch, was gaining swiftly on the far turn then closed willingly in the stretch. JOHN LOUIS' BEVO settled in the two path, then made a mild bid on the
far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. TEXAN FARMER raced in the middle of the pack while three wide, was urging on the far turn to vie for the lead
heading into the home stretch then gave way in the end. MODOC was unhurried early, then raced behind the field, bid on the far turn from the inside and
was no threat. GOD'S GOLD was unhurried early then raced in the four path in the back of the pack, made a mild bid on the far turn and into the home
stretch and was no threat. SECOND BATTALION dueled while two wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, was in a hard drive, then was used up
and weakened in the stretch.
