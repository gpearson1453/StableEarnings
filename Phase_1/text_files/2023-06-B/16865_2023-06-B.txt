Footnotes
MISS CONTINENTAL broke out and bumped at the start, saved ground, bid along the inside on the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and
held safely. PANDORA WHO stalked the pace while racing towards the outside, challenged three across on the turn, fell back and finished second best.
UPDIP was slow early, got through along the rail on the turn and closed well to get up for show. SAGANAKI broke out, raced outside, swung wide leaving
the turn and offered a mild bid to improve position. FIRST FROST bumped at the start, came out near the gap, set the pace to the turn, fell back and faded
through the stretch. SKYSPEIGHT showed good early speed, fell back to race in traffic mid pack and lacked a stretch response. WESTLAND dropped
inside to save ground, angled out on the turn, swung wide and lacked a response. KATZIE BABY raced outside and had brief speed only. GONE KAT was
in tight at the start, vied early, fell back into the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SWITCHERONIMO stalked the pace, challenged three across on the turn, assumed command and drew off in the drive. B A CHAMPION was sent to the
front, set the pace, was headed leaving the turn and was no match for the winner. MS. LEA was rated back at the start and unhurried early, closed steadily
under left handed urging and got up for show while no threat to the top two. GATLING GOLD was never far back, raced outside, rallied on the turn, went
widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only. SOUTHERN SUMMER stalked the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, fell back, came up empty
late and lost positon. MT. TAYLOR raced mid pack inside, angled out on the turn and lacked a stretch response. STELLARSBLUERIBBON stalked inside,
fell back after a half and steadily faded from contention. JEDI WARRIOR failed to contend.

PASSION BELLE settled off the pace, rallied outside on the turn, closed steadily and inched clear late. INDIAN EXCELLENCE raced three across to the
turn, vied to deep stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY vied to deep stretch, was unable to sustain her bid and held safely for
show. DESTINY WHO saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn and lacked the needed rally. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T bumped at the start and was
crowded soon thereafter, was never far back, bid off the rail and failed to rally. OUR SOARING ANGEL vied between horses while in tight, was checked on
the turn, dropped back, swung wide and gave way.

WHO bumped at the start, raced outside, showed good early speed and steadily faded. PECOSVALLEY STORMN was outrun. FLOWER POWER vied
inside, was taken back into the turn, stopped, was eased and vanned off.
