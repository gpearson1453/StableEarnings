Footnotes
TIZ'A STELLAR DUDE pressed the pace three wide while racing in hand, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held well.
FLYING PHANTOM was pinched back at the start, never far off the pace, closed steadily and gained late. ILLUMINATE D STORM stumbled at the start, led
to the turn, dropped back, finished evenly and held for show. NEW CUT ROAD vied inside to the turn, dropped back and lacked the needed late response.
WEALTH N HEALTH was crowded at the start, start, stalked the pace between horses and weakened in the drive. CANDY RASCAL was not a factor.
LAUGHING STORM was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. CHIPPSTER passed tiring rivals. FLAG THE FOOTNOTE showed
speed to the turn and gave way. STORMIN L D saved ground, showed brief speed only and steadily faded.

Footnotes
CREME DE LA CHROME pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in an all out effort. HOORAY
AUSTIN dueled throughout and was outfinished in a long drive. ESPIONAGE dueled past the sixteenth pole,was unable to sustain his bid and held safely
for show. AMERICAN OUTLAW pressed the pace while racing outside, rallied four across on the turn to loom a threat, fell back and faded from contention.
AXEL STEEL raced mid pack, lacked a stretch response and did not threaten. GREY STORM saved ground to the turn, shifted out and lacked a bid.
THIRSTY ECHO pressed the pace, was through early and dropped back steadily. BACK TO WORK raced in the back, swung wide leaving the turn and
lacked a response. EAST RAND was slow early, swung wide on the turn and outrun. BRUIN MAGIC raced outside in an even effort and was not a threat.

MAKE UP A STORY pressed the pace three across, closed steadily and wore down LATIGO ELLIS to get up in the final strides. LATIGO ELLIS set a
pressured pace, inched away leaving the turn and was caught near the wire. OUR VALENTINO vied early, fell back to stalk, bid inside on the turn, altered
course mid stretch and surged late to get up for show. JUANA RUMBLE pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back leaving the turn, continued
willingly to the wire and was caught for third. COMFORT J BYRD vied early, fell back, put in a steady effort and narrowed the gap. BEACH STORM put in
an even effort in an inside trip and failed to menace. EVERYROSEHASATHORN was crowded and steadied after the start, trailed the field and was not a
threat.
