Footnotes
ELITE FORCES pressed three wide, dueled around the turn, led nearing the lane and drew off through the final furlong. STUDY COMMITTEE took bumps
from rivals on both sides, vied two wide and between horses, dueled around the bend, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart leaving the furlong
grounds and held place. BOURBON FEVER stuttered a step leaving the gates while shifting ground outwardly, tracked the leaders from the two path,
chased the embattled leading trio from the three to four path entering the final furlong, drifted out slightly while hanging on his left lead approaching the final
sixteenth, changed over at that marker and ran on to gain show late. STORMIN ARMY set the pace inside of a pair of prompting foes, dueled with them
around the turn, then weakened in the final furlong. MACHO VILLA leaned inwardly and created contact with an inner rival while off slow, lagged behind in
the two path, then moved up three wide entering the lane before narrowing the gap on the rest. HINENI lacked speed along the inside and faded. AUTO
DIAL leaned outwardly into a rival at the start, then chased in the three path early on and weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
TWIRLING QUEEN set the pace in the two path via a clear margin around the turn, but hung on her left lead as an inner rival offered a bid in the final
sixteenth, yet dug in and held sway. DANCING PRINCESS was reluctant to load, chased outside of the leader and from the three path around the turn,
hung on her left lead and lugged inwardly from a right handed crop at the furlong grounds, but changed over in the process, sustained stride to bid inside of
the leader entering the final sixteenth, but was denied. PARTAKE tracked the leaders from the two path and held show from an outer bidder in the final
furlong. LIAM'S MESSAGE lacked speed along the inside, split foes two wide at the quarter pole, bid for show in midstretch but was fended off. NAUGHTY
MISS lunged into the outer part of the gate while breaking multiple lengths behind the field, lagged behind in the four to five path, rallied nearing the lane,
but leveled off without menacing. BOOMIN' BELLE laid off of the pace in the five path and tired. CAT ONE chased in the four path and weakened between
horses at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE dueled for the lead two wide, wrestled an advantage at the quarter pole, inched clear in upper stretch and held sway from a pair of
pursuers thereafter. PURPLE DREAM tracked two wide, ranged up three wide nearing the lane, then chased the clear leader through the final furlong and
edged place. LET MY PEOPLE GO broke inwardly and brushed an inner rival, stalked along the inside, awaited racing room behind the leader while in the
two path entering the lane, then chased that foe from between horses in midstretch, but was fended off by an outer foe for place. TULANE TRYST threw his
head at the start, lacked speed in the three path and stayed on to gain fourth lat. FIELD DAY broke a bit awkwardly while taking slight contact from an outer
rival at the start, dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, got headed by that one at the quarter pole and weakened through the final furlong. FRIAR
LAURENCE lagged behind and was outrun.

Footnotes
FLOKI'S FLIGHT set the pace inside of a prompting foe, inched subtly clear of that one in upper stretch and fended him off through the late stages. DON'T
FORGET pressed two wide and outside of the eventual winner, but briefly failed to keep pace in the three path in upper stretch, kept on while sustaining a
chase through the final furlong but was kept at bay late. FIFTY CENT DOLLARS stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn before briefly yielding
leaving the five sixteenths pole, yet regained stride in upper stretch to reclaim show at the furlong grounds, then took aim between the leaders while inching
closer, but did not have enough to catch them. ALLEGE tracked two wide, chased outside of the leading pair around the far turn, but drifted to the five path
in upper stretch and lacked a bid. JUST CALL RAY laid off of the pace along the inside, swung out turning for home, tipped to the six path in upper stretch
and failed to menace. SHORTLIST raced at the rear in the three path and tired nearing the lane.

CLASSY SOCKS set the pace along the inside, was hounded inside of a group of rivals around the turn, shook free of them in upper stretch and drew off.
CAMP DADDY broke outwardly and bumped a rival soon after the start, chased the leaders from the two path, split them three wide with a heads-up move
at the five sixteenths pole to bid nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace with his innermost vying rival in upper stretch, wrestled place in midstretch and
held that position from an outer rival late. LEMON DROP SHOT bobbled at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, closed in turning for home to loom
a danger behind the leaders at the quarter pole, shifted out four wide for clear sailing entering the lane, but only sustained a grinding charge in the final
furlong to attempt a bid for place late and was fended off. NITROMAN vied for the lead two wide and between horses, sparred turning for home, but failed to
keep pace with the leader in upper stretch and yielded through the final furlong. BORN FLAWLESS bumped with an outer rival before taking contact from an
inner foe at the start, raced at the rear in the three to four path, then fanned to the eight path in upper stretch and moved up. TROPIC STORM stalked
forwardly four wide and between horses early on, sustained prompting position around the turn,, but weakened five wide entering the lane. MISTER
SHARPIE bumped with an inner rival upon leaving the gates, pressed three wide and between horses, but weakened while getting outmoved by an inner
rival at the five sixteenths pole. BACK TO NORMAL broke outwardly, tracked five wide, but failed to sustain position entering the turn, then failed to factor
after floating six wide entering the lane.

Footnotes
GLORIA'S PRINCESS set the pace in the two path around the first turn before tucking the to the rail down the backstretch, showed the way around the far
turn before meeting FIDDLE's challenge turning for home, yet repelled that foe in upper stretch, inched a clear margin and held sway. MISREAD tracked
along the inside before moving two wide and between horses nearing the backstretch, tipped three wide and outside of the leaders in upper stretch and
sustained a grinding charge to gain place in the final sixteenth. FIDDLE stalked outside of the leader, but was keen from restraint to lay off of the pace setter
around the first turn, pursued before bidding at the quarter pole, but was turned away in upper stretch, then lost place to an outer rival in the late stages.
HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES stalked along the inside and chased evenly through the lane. AIN'T BROKE pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited
racing room while racing well in hand in the two path around the far turn, fanned four wide in upper stretch, but only ran on evenly. MO SHIRO laid off of the
pace along the inside while resenting restraint around the first turn, continued to save ground around the far turn, then chased the main group from the two
path through the lane while lacking a bid. WORK OF FICTION settled two wide, took the far turn in the four path before fanning to the five path entering the
lane and ran on. HELENS WELL (IRE) broke a step slow and spotted the leaders multiple lengths soon after the start, raced at the rear along the inside,
gained three wide and outside of foes passing the half mile pole, but failed to factor. LADY COMMANDER was outrun in the two to three path. SWISS
FRANC tracked three wide and weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BLUE LIGHT prompted the pace two wide and between horses, dueled with rivals on either side leaving the three furlong pole, inched away from them at
the furlong grounds and held sway from an outer pursuer late. ZAMBEZI bumped with an inner rival at the start, prompted the pace three wide and between
horses, but failed to sustain pressure entering the turn, chased the leading trio from the three path around the bend, tipped outside of them in upper stretch,
chased while on his left lead through midstretch, then changed over approaching the final sixteenth, secured place in the late stages and was slowly closing
in on the clear leader. SWEET CHERRY PIE pressed four wide into the turn, bid three wide at the three furlong pole, dueled turning for home, but failed to
keep pace with his most immediate inner counterpart at the furlong grounds and was surpassed by an outer rival for place in the final sixteenth. BOHEMIAN
BO set the pace inside of a trio of pressers early on, dueled with a pair of outer bidders leaving the three furlong pole, got headed entering the lane and
weakened through the final furlong. BOURBON BASH laid off of the pace in the four path, gained turning for home, but flattened out entering the lane
without reaching contention. BRAZEN BOY failed to factor from the three path. GOLD LUCK bobbled and bumped with an outer rival at the start and never
got involved. EDDIE M lacked speed along the inside and weakened.
