Footnotes
DO IT FOR DAVE settled outside of rivals into the first turn, tracked the modest pace from a three wide path through the backstretch run, was roused two
wide heading to the quarter marker, confronted APPLE WARRIOR nearing the top of the stretch, battled with that foe to the furlong grounds, shook free into
the final furlong and drove clear under moderate late urging to prevail. APPLE WARRIOR was sent leaving the start and dictated terms into the first turn, set
modest fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, maintained a clear lead to the quarter marker, was confronted by DO IT FOR DAVE nearing
the top of the stretch, met that bid to mid-stretch, gave way in the final furlong but held well in the late stages to be second best. SILENT BULLET settled off
of the early pace then advanced to stalk the pacesetter through the backstretch run, lost ground while chasing from the inside on the far turn and was outrun
to mid-stretch, weakened in the final furlong and just held for third at the wire. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF was unhurried in the early stages, maintained a two
wide path through the backstretch run, lost ground heading to the quarter marker, ran evenly in the stretch drive and just missed for third. LUCKY RAPPER
bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, settled in the second flight early on and saved ground into the backstretch run, could not keep pace along the
far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
WILD JEWELS broke a step slowly but showed good early speed and vied for the lead in the opening furlong, took command into the turn and set a
pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead approaching the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady
late urging and was ridden out in deep stretch as much the best. HAYWOOD contested the early lead and pressed WILD JEWELS into the turn while inside
of that rival, lost ground nearing the top of the stretch while three wide, was no match for the winner in the drive and ran on in deep stretch to best the rest.
CORAL CAT stumbled leaving the start but recovered to vie for the early lead, raced close to the pace heading into the turn, chased from the rail along the
bend, was outrun into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and held for third in a dead heat for show. BOOK EM TAMO vied for the lead leaving the
break with a host of rivals, took back off of the fast pace and chased to the turn while green and climbing, gave chase while two then three wide along the
turn, lacked the needed response in the stretch drive but kept on in the final sixteenth to dead heat for third. REGAL REDWOOD raced close to the early
pace and vied for the lead leaving the break, lost position into the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and
gave way. SIR GEORGE ARTHUR lacked early speed, chased two wide along the turn, was coaxed four wide into the drive and did not factor.

Footnotes
BEA MISCHIEF broke alertly and dictated terms in the early running, shifted from the three path to the two path entering the first turn and set the pace off of
the rail into the backstretch run, was well rated through moderate fractions to the half-mile marker, maintained a clear lead to the quarter pole, drew off into
upper stretch, felt mild late pressure from the oncoming runner-up and kept to task in deep stretch to hold safely for the win. TIZ MY PRINCESS was
shuffled back leaving the start, was away a bit slowly and was allowed to settle in the early running, took up entering the first turn when
MOHAYHAYTHEBOLD clipped heels and raced four wide into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, maintained a four
wide path along the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, chased BEA MISCHIEF to the furlong grounds, re-rallied in the final stages to put mild late
pressure on the winner but could not reel that one in and was clear at the finish for second. I'M GONNA SHINE stalked the early pace from the inside, ran in
pursuit of BEA MISCHIEF through the backstretch run, maintained her position while three wide into the far turn, lost ground to BEA MISCHIEF into upper
stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong and was outkicked while well clear of the rest for third. JACQUELINE COCHRAN settled
inside of rivals in the early stages, gained ground along the backstretch run and was well placed heading to the far turn, chased from the rail approaching
the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the stretch and tired. MOHAYHAYTHEBOLD was prominent in the early running, clipped heels with BEA
MISCHIEF entering the first turn, took up and lost position heading to the backstretch run, raced outside of rivals while five wide through the backstretch run,
came four wide into the far turn and did not offer a response in the stretch. SILVER FLIRT settled in the second flight in the early stages, angled three wide
into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, dropped back along the second turn and was not persevered with in the
stretch. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING MOHAYHAYTHEBOLD ENTERING THE FIRST TURN. IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH BASED ON THE INCIDENT.

GETAWAY CHARM off a step slow but never far back, was on the outside as the field spread across the track going into the turn, swung five wide into the
stretch and engaged a stubborn and game SQUARE FUN for a battle down to the wire, gained a slight advantage inside the furlong pole and held sway for
the victory. SQUARE FUN broke well and took the early lead racing well off the rail, then was joined before passing a furlong by STANDFORGRIT to the
inside,was in the middle of a tight four-horse fan going around the turn, came into the stretch with a slight lead but had GETAWAY CHARM rallying to the
outside. battled gamely to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly near the wire. STANDFORGRIT rushed up near the rail to vie for the early lead, gained a
brief lead at the half, struggled to keep up with the top two from the five-sixteenths pole and gave way but was able to hold third. STAR SO FAR was
prominent early on while racing four wide, came under heavy pressure passing the five-sixteenths marker and was unable to improve then faded down the
lane.

Footnotes
MORNING ADDICTION was sent leaving a good beginning and set a pressured pace to the turn, shook free along the bend and drew to a clear lead into
upper stretch, extended the lead heading to the furlong grounds and drew off under moderate urging in the final stages to be much the best. NEVER SWAY
pressed the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced five wide into the turn then angled to the three path along the bend, chased MORNING
ADDICTION into upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and bested the rest. GET'EM TIGER chased the decent early pace while
four wide and between runners, came in tight entering the turn and was shuffled back at the three-furlong marker, was steered outside of rivals and came
four wide into the stretch, was not able to impact the top pair in the drive and kept on to get up for third in the final strides. HAYDEN'S ANGEL chased the
early pace while between rivals, lost ground while two wide on the turn, ran in pursuit to the furlong marker, tired in the final sixteenth and was just edged for
third. LIAM'S SECRET chased from the rear in the early stages, raced in the three path to the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch. PERFECTLY
JULIE was prominent in the early running and pressed the pace to the turn, lost ground along the bend and gave way in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SPEED GRAZY was allowed to settle in the early running, settled outside of rivals along the backstretch run and came three wide into the far turn, was
roused four wide nearing the top of the stretch, made a steady gain to the furlong marker, closed determinedly in the final sixteenth, confronted ROARING
TIGER in deep stretch and wore down the runner-up in the final strides to prevail. ROARING TIGER stumbled leaving the break and was off a step slowly,
settled in the second flight along the first turn and raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained his position through the backstretch run, advanced
three wide on the second turn, was set down for the drive and took command in upper stretch, responded to urging through the lane and led to the
sixteenth-marker, felt pressure from SPEED GRAZY in deep stretch, met that bid to the final yards and was bested at the wire, while holding safely for
second. SUGAR BEETS was unhurried while saving ground in the early stages, inched closer along the backstretch run then gained ground while two wide
on the far turn, came in tight at the quarter marker and lacked racing room into upper stretch, angled five wide nearing the furlong marker and was gaining in
the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair at the finish and was clear in the end for third. GORDY'S BOY broke alertly then took back to track the
decent pace into the backstretch run, was well positioned while saving ground to the far turn, gained ground along the rail into upper stretch, could not
sustain that bid into the final furlong and flattened out. STORMIN GALILEO was forwardly placed into the first turn and assumed command of the early lead,
set decent fractions through the backstretch run while off of the rail, showed the way to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the
furlong marker and tired in the final stages. DR PESCADO was prominent in the early running and vied for the early lead with STORMIN GALILEO, took
back off of that rival along the first turn and stalked the pace into the backstretch run, kept attendance to the pacesetter to the far turn, inched closer while
three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave way in the stretch run.

SHOUT IT OUT broke well then allowed the pace scenario to play out while tracking from a couple of lengths behind, bided time to the turn, responded
when asked to go after the pacesetters approaching the quarter pole, swept to the lead entering the stretch and continued the rally to the wire to win by a
comfortable margin. TIZ A TIGER stumbled at the break, took some time to recover and spotted the field several lengths head start, made up some of the
ground on the backstretch run but was still last going into the turn, launched a rally following TIZ A TIGER into the stretch, chased that one down the lane
but was unable to threaten the eventual winner while easily second best. JAYS ANGEL veered inward at the start, joined the pace battle early then settled
right behind the duel, saved some ground through the turn, came under a ride near the quarter pole but kept to task to gain the third position mid-stretch
while never a threat to the top two. SMILING SALSA was hustled early then was on the three wide and on the outside of the trio dueling into fast fractions,
came into the stretch with a slight lead and held on well until weakening the final furlong. BOLD MISTRESS broke a little awkwardly, rushed up to be part of
the early pace duel, responded when asked to quicken before the turn, held a slight lead at the head of the stretch but was quickly overtaken by the
eventual winner then had nothing left to offer in the last two furlongs. LADY GREGORY managed to avoid JAYS ANGEL when that one came over at the
break, rushed up to establish the rail position and vied for the early lead, held a slight advantage to the seven-sixteenths marker then struggled to keep pace
on the turn and was outrun the rest of the way.
