Footnotes
SASQUATCH RIDE tracked the decent pace into the turn, maintained a two wide path between rivals along the bend, was roused three wide into the
stretch, confronted PHANTOM DROP approaching mid-stretch, battled with that rival to deep stretch, took command at the sixteenth-marker and kept to
task in a drive to prevail. PHANTOM DROP broke through the gate prior to the start, was away in good order and set the decent pace to the turn, was
pressed to the quarter marker by TRABIESO AVELITO, shook free into upper stretch then was confronted by SASQUATCH RIDE nearing the furlong
marker, resisted against that rival's bid into deep stretch but could not match strides in the final stages and was outfinished, while besting the rest.
TRABIESO AVELITO stumbled leaving the break and was off a step slowly, stalked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, pressed the pacesetter
from the three path to the quarter marker, swung to the four path for the drive, re-rallied and vied for the lead at mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages
and held clearly in the end for third. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE was away a bit slowly and chased from the inside early on, could not keep pace into upper
stretch and did not offer a response in the drive.

Footnotes
QUE SERA SIR RALPH broke alertly and assumed command in the early stages, set a moderate pace while prompted through the backstretch run, was
well handled while carving the fractions into the far turn, spurted clear in upper stretch, drew off under moderate urging in the drive and was wrapped up in
the final yards as much the best. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE settled along the inside in the run into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from a ground
saving position into the far turn, angled three wide into the drive, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and ran on to be best of the rest. LIL
MIRACLE MAN was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, kept attendance to QUE SERA SIR
RALPH to the quarter marker, could not match strides into the drive, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for second, while clear in the end for
third. SUNNY SPOT settled just off of the early pace, was well positioned while in the two path through the backstretch run, slipped to the rail along the
second turn, lacked the needed response in the drive and gave way. IL CAPITANO was hard to load prior to the start, lunged at the break and was off a
step slowly, was hard to place while a bit rank into the first turn and chased outside of rivals into the backstretch run, ran in pursuit to the half-mile marker,
could not keep pace on the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
TAMARA MINE raced close to the decent early pace, stalked the pacesetter while three wide along the turn, made a steady advance on MUCHA WOMAN
in upper stretch, drew to even terms with that rival inside of the furlong marker, took command heading to the sixteenth-pole and drove clear in the final
stages. LADY'S SERMON took up and was bothered leaving the start and was off slowly, chased the decent early pace while outside of a rival, gained
ground while three wide along the turn, was coaxed along in the four path into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, finished well in deep stretch
and was up in the final strides to secure second. MUCHA WOMAN broke out at the start and bothered neighboring rivals leaving the break, showed early
speed and set a pressured pace into the turn, shook free along the bend and carved out decent fractions to the quarter marker, held TAMARA MINE at bay
to mid-stretch, could not match strides with that rival into the final furlong, weakened in deep stretch and was just edged for second, while holding clearly for
third. CRYSTAL PROOF was prominent in the early running and pressed the decent pace to the turn, lost position while saving ground on the turn, chased
the leaders into upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. DRAW ME was bothered at the start by MUCHA WOMAN then in turn bothered LADY'S
SERMON and was off a bit slowly, chased the decent early pace from the rear, saved ground to the quarter marker while trailing, angled two wide into the
stretch and could not muster a late response.

Footnotes
KRISTIN LEE broke sharply and showed good early speed, dictated terms to the turn and was well handled through the bend while carving solid fractions,
extended the lead into upper stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth in a good debut. CRYPTO CRUSH broke out at the start and was away slowly,
trailed into the turn then advanced position along the bend while two wide, swung five wide for the drive, made a mild gain at mid-stretch, rallied in the final
stages and could not reel in the winner but was up in the final strides to secure second. BIG CATTY was prominent in the early running and raced close to
the quick pace while outside of rivals, ran in pursuit while three wide along the turn, chased KRISTIN LEE to mid-stretch, lacked the needed response in
deep stretch and just missed for second while clear of the rest for third. SMILE BABY SMILE was forwardly placed early on and chased the solid pace from
the inside, pressed from the rail along the turn, lost ground into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. OUTER SUNSET chased the solid early pace,
ran in pursuit while outside of rivals along the turn and came four wide into the stretch, was a bit green in the drive while racing on the left lead and did not
offer a late rally. MISS PERU chased the solid early pace, raced two wide along the bend, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired. HANG ON lacked
early speed, dropped back on the turn, lost contact into upper stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
THE SANDY SURPRISE bobbled at the start then lagged behind the field while racing four or five wide down the backstretch, launched a bid with three
furlongs to go while still racing wide, came into the stretch in the six path and sustained the rally through the stretch to just get up in the last jump. MIGHTY
MATT tracked the early pace between a trio of horses down the back stretch, was being ridden from the half-mile marker but made steady forward progress
through the turn, found a seam four wide turning for home, rallied strongly down the stretch, briefly had the advantage but lost the bob at the wire.
SURPRISE FASHION bobbled at the start, recovered well then raced mid-pack through the early stages on the inside of a trio chasing the leaders, moved
in tandem with MIGHTY MATT through the turn to get into contention, took the inside path into the stretch, got clear run at the leader and ran on well but
was outfinished in the shadow of the wire. DAD BOD broke in a bit but quickly corrected, was hustled to the front and opened up a clear lead before running
a quarter mile, was in hand through the turn, responded briefly when roused at the top of the stretch but could not hold on and weakened in the final furlong.
DUMB LUCK broke sharply, dueled to the inside of DAD BOD early, switched to the three path before the turn, chased that foe to the stretch, came under
pressure approaching the three-sixteenths marker and had nothing to offer down the stretch. RUNNING ON EMPTY outrun to the turn, had one beat with
three furlongs to run then came up empty in the stretch.

MICRO SHARE settled just off of the early pace, raced outside of rivals and came four wide into the backstretch run, advanced to stalk the moderate pace
to the far turn, was asked for run three wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker, was
kept to task under firm urging to deep stretch, dug in in the final stages and held off the oncoming runner-up to prevail. STOIC LUNA was allowed to settle in
the early running, improved position while outside of rivals along the backstretch run, raced four wide along the far turn, rallied while widest into the stretch
and loomed approaching the furlong pole, closed willingly in the final sixteenth, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and was well clear of
the rest for second. WORK TO LIVE was prominent into the first turn and attended to the pace while outside of rivals into the backstretch run, prompted the
moderate pace to the far turn, confronted MADEIRA WINE approaching the quarter marker, battled with that rival into upper stretch and vied for the lead at
the furlong marker, could not match strides with MICRO SHARE into the final furlong, weakened in the final sixteenth and just held for third at the wire.
MADEIRA WINE broke alertly and established the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, was challenged by WORK
TO LIVE along the far turn, fought back against oncoming rivals to mid-stretch, faded in the final stages and just missed for third. BANDEENA bobbled
leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried while running in the three then four path along the first turn, settled along the backstretch run and
came two wide into the second turn, was coaxed along three wide into the drive and did not threaten. LA REINE'S LEGACY stalked the early pace from the
inside, raced close to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost position while two wide on the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and
gave way. BOLD DAUGHTER settled along the inside early on, was well positioned along the backstretch run while saving ground, was outrun along the far
turn and tired in the stretch drive.

ASCENDANCY took back off of the contentious early pace and settled inside of a rival into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, was
given her cue leaving the three-furlong pole and loomed two wide nearing the quarter marker, collared ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA in upper stretch, drew to a
clear lead at the furlong marker and pulled away in the final stages. TWILIGHT EMPIRE was unhurried in the early running, settled outside of a rival and
raced three then four wide into the backstretch run, maintained that four wide path into the far turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker and came
three wide for the drive, continued to advance approaching mid-stretch, could not keep pace with ASCENDANCY in the final furlong and was outkicked,
while clear of the rest for second. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA was asked to show early speed leaving the break, engaged with TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL and
dueled through fast fractions into the backstretch run, continued to battle on the front end with that rival to the half-mile marker, shook free along the second
turn, was collared by ASCENDANCY in upper stretch and chased that rival to the furlong grounds, yielded in the final furlong and was outfinished for
second, while holding clearly in the end for third. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE settled off of the quick early pace, maintained a two wide path through the
backstretch run and into the far turn, swung widest and came five wide into the stretch drive, was not able to impact the leaders in the stretch and passed
tiring rivals in the final furlong. BUYBACK was forwardly placed while outside of rivals into the first turn, tracked the rapid pace through the backstretch run,
raced two then three wide to the quarter pole, could not muster the needed response in the stretch and gave way. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH was allowed to
settle in the early running, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, trailed into the far turn, was coaxed along two wide into the stretch and did
not factor in the drive. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, engaged with ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA soon after the break
and contested the pace with that rival along the first turn, dueled through fast fractions along the backstretch run, lost ground to ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA
along the far turn, dropped back in the stretch and faded in the final stages. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) tracked the rapid pace from the inside, raced closest
to the dueling pacesetters through the backstretch run, lacked a response along the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HYDRO FROST hustled out of the gate but settled behind the pace, was prompted to keep up as the pace quickened before the turn, responded when
asked in earnest to go after the leaders at about the five-sixteenths marker, swung five wide into the stretch, had difficulty changing leads for the length of
the stretch but was able to sustain the run to win by a comfortable margin in the end. MY BUCKET LIST broke well, was able to press the issue on the front
end but backed out of a potential speed duel to a tracking position, re-bid approaching the quarter pole, took the lead at the top of the stretch and ran on
well under right handed urging but could not hold off the fast closing winner while well clear of the third horse. WESTERN SIERRA broke well, sat off the
flank and to the outside of JERSEY BABE to the quarter pole, got the best of that rival before the stretch then had to contend with a challenge from MY
BUCKET LIST to the outside, was unable to match strides with that one in deep stretch but held third. OUR NORTH STAR stumbled slightly then was
bumped by SON OF SHANGHAI after the break, made up a bit of ground in the backstretch run, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths marker but stalled
before mid-stretch and tired. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE got off to an awkward start, chased from an inside position down the backside and through the turn,
continued to run at the same pace through the stretch and never made an impact. MIGHTY RULER hustled from the gate but was unable to challenge the
early leaders, was kept to task while racing four wide through the turn, showed little. JERSEY BABE broke well, set a contested pace to the turn with
WESTERN SIERRA applying pressure to the outside, hit a wall passing the quarter pole and was not persevered with from there. SON OF SHANGHAI
veered out and bumped OUR NORTH STAR coming out of the gate, did not appear comfortable in the early going after that and was climbing down the
backstretch, was allowed to setting into stride going into the turn but trailed the field throughout.
