NAUGHTY NIKO settled just off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn, was roused along the bend and moved up nearing the quarter marker,
continued that bid heading into the stretch, confronted DOGE OF VENICE in upper stretch, took a narrow lead on that rival approaching mid-stretch,
disposed of that foe into the final furlong, was confronted nearing the sixteenth-marker by TEE SHOT, dug in in deep stretch and determinedly turned away
the runner-up and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. TEE SHOT settled off of the decent early pace, raced outside of a rival while gaining ground on
the turn, was steered three wide into the drive, closed well inside of the furlong pole, confronted NAUGHTY NIKO nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not
get by the determined winner in deep stretch and was turned away, while besting the rest. DOGE OF VENICE was sent to establish the early lead, set
decent fractions to the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker while setting the pace off of the rail, was confronted by NAUGHTY NIKO approaching the top
of the lane, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was outfinished for second, while clear in the end for third. NEVER HAD I
EVER was asked to show early speed and was forwardly placed in the early running, raced three deep into the turn and pressed the pacesetter to the
quarter pole, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, lost position nearing the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages. THECHIEFHASTRICKS
lacked early speed, trailed through the turn, raced in the two path into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
LADY WOLF broke alertly and showed speed leaving the start, dictated terms to the turn while setting a decent pace, carved out the fractions on the turn
while off of the rail, drew to a clear lead into upper stretch, felt pressure inside of the furlong marker from HEY BARMAID, kept to task in the final stages
while under firm urging and held safely for the win. HEY BARMAID broke through the gate prior to the start, settled just off of the decent early pace and
saved ground into the turn, angled three wide approaching the top of the stretch, chased to the furlong grounds, was able to close into LADY WOLF's
margin in the final stages but could not reel in the winner and bested the rest. RAFANELLI was off slowly, was hustled to chase the decent pace into the
turn, chased outside of rivals along the bend while gaining ground, raced four wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker, could not muster a
final bid in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure third. GENTLE JULIA raced close to the decent early pace, advanced along the inside on
the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch, gave way in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final strides for third. GRASPY broke slowly, lacked early
speed, trailed into the stretch and did not have an impact.

Footnotes
BOSS OF THEMOSS broke well then was bumped lightly from the inside, dueled with MOB BOSS for a quarter, gained a clear advantage before the turn,
responded when asked at the top of the stretch and drew off to win by open lengths under intermittent urging while drifting out slightly. MOB BOSS broke
well then stumbled a couple of strides from the gate veering out and making light contact with BOSS OF THEMOSS, recovered and raced to the inside of
that rival to the half mile marker then switched to the outside approaching the turn, bid for the lead with a quarter mile to run and was repelled but held the
place. BIG DON'S SMILING raced close to the dueling leaders early, then was pressed to keep pace through the turn, ran on somewhat evenly to the wire
well clear of the next horse. NUESTRO ENGREIDO stumbled at the break, giving the field a bit of a head start, was forced to chase the field throughout and
gave a good account but was unable to make up any ground.

TWIRLING DERBY settled outside of rivals in the early stages, tracked the modest fractions while four wide into the backstretch run, gained ground nearing
the half-mile marker, was roused four wide along the far turn, overtook JERRY JEFF WALKER in upper stretch, responded to steady urging heading into the
final furlong and drew away in deep stretch. JERRY JEFF WALKER was sent to establish the early lead, set a moderate pace into the backstretch run, set
modest fractions while well handled into the far turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by TWIRLING DERBY in upper
stretch, chased that rival into the final furlong, could not muster the needed late response and was outfinished, while clear of the rest for second. FAR
WEST stumbled leaving the break but recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the pace from the three path into the backstretch run, kept
attendance to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, vied between runners while three wide on the far turn, could not keep pace into the drive and
gave way in the stretch while just holding for third at the finish. TEX HANLEY was a bit fractious prior to the start, settled along the inside in the run into the
first turn, stalked the modest pace from a two wide path through the backstretch run, slipped to the rail heading into the last turn, could not keep pace
heading to the quarter marker, tired in the drive and just missed for third.

Footnotes
AWESOME DUDE settled off of the early pace while not far back, tracked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, inched closer along the
second turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed fast into deep stretch, came within aim in the final yards,
surged in the final strides and won the nod on the wire to prevail. POUR ON THE COLE was prominent into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace while
three then four wide into the backstretch run, raced close to the pace heading to the half-mile pole, lost a bit of ground on the far turn, was roused three wide
into the drive and took command into upper stretch, drifted to the middle of the track nearing the furlong grounds, held a narrow lead to the final sixteenth,
continued to drift into deep stretch, was confronted by AWESOME DUDE in the final strides and was nailed on the line for the win, while just holding for
second. BRONZE WARRIOR broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, carved out moderate fractions into the backstretch run, set a pressured pace to
the quarter marker, lost the lead in upper stretch to POUR ON THE COLE, battled from the inside in the drive, gamely fought back to deep stretch and was
outfinished by the top pair in a good effort. UNION GIG settled off of the early pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide into the backstretch run then
tucked in to the two path heading into the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, was gaining in deep stretch but was
outkicked in the final stages. WINE AND WHISKY tracked the early pace from the inside, was coaxed three wide into the backstretch run and prompted the
moderate pace to the half-mile pole, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, lost ground into the drive, remained within aim to the
sixteenth-marker and lacked a final response in deep stretch. WALKING BOSS was bumped by a neighboring rival then shuffled back at the start and was
off slowly, was unhurried while in the three path into the backstretch run, maintained that three wide path to the far turn, was steered five wide into the
stretch and did not rally.

Footnotes
HANDR'SDREAM showed good early speed and was prominent leaving the break, ceded the early lead to AUTISM BLUE and pressed that rival through
solid early fractions, drew to even terms at the quarter marker, took command into the stretch, was kept to steady urging through the drive, drew to a clear
lead into the final sixteenth and pulled away in the final stages to prevail. WINTER FALCON chased the solid early pace, advanced two wide between rivals
on the turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, was not able to match strides with the winner in the final
stages and stayed on to be best of the rest. AUTISM BLUE was sent leaving the start and set solid fractions into the turn, was confronted by
HANDR'SDREAM nearing the quarter marker, lost the lead to that rival into upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds, weakened in deep stretch and was
outfinished for second while holding safely for third. BLAZE OF DREAMS was a bit slow into stride early on and settled toward the rear, raced two wide into
the turn, was asked for run three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, could not muster the needed late response in deep stretch and
passed tiring rivals in the final stages. THUNDER OF ZION chased the solid early pace while outside outside of rivals, gained ground while three wide on
the turn, was steered five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and tired in the final stages. ALEXANDER'S DREAM chased the solid early
pace from the inside, made a mild advance while inside of rivals along the bend, was coaxed two wide into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not
offer a late rally. AMANOFMYSTATURE lunged at the start, was away slowly and spotted the field in the early stages, trailed into the turn, saved ground to
the top of the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
HAPPY DOES reserved early, saved ground to the stretch, was still far back through the far turn, came under a hard ride near the five-sixteenths pole,
swung out to the three path for the stretch run, dueled with SEA DOG down the the lane, lost the lead briefly when that one came out a bit in deep stretch
then inched ahead in the late stages. SEA DOG was brushed by RODRIGOKNOWS at the break, spotted the field a length or two but was quickly
contending for the lead through the first turn while under some restraint, held a short lead down the backstretch, kept RODRIGOKNOWS to the inside near
the rail to the stretch, had something left when HAPPY DOES made a strong challenge in mid-stretch, gained a short lead then gave way grudgingly in the
final yards. DOS VICIOS broke well and contended for the early lead then eased back in order to move outside of the pacesetter through the first turn,
dropped back to a tracking position down the backstretch, lost some ground when the pace quickened but kept to task down the lane and was able to grab
the third position near the finish. RODRIGOKNOWS broke in at the start and brushed with SEA DOG, inherited the lead into the first turn then was joined by
a trio of challengers after the first quarter mile, was kept near the rail by that foe until the stretch, battled to the furlong grounds then weakened in deep
stretch. GROSS PROFIT was forwardly placed into the first turn while outside of rivals, settled off of the decent pace into the backstretch run and
maintained a four wide path to the far turn, raced within aim while four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the stretch and gave way.

maintained his position to the half-mile pole, advanced three wide on the second turn, was roused four wide into the drive, vied for the lead in upper stretch,
took command inside of the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady left-handed urging and drew clear in the final sixteenth to prevail. COOLCROSS

ground, came in tight and was blocked nearing the top of the lane, found room in upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not match strides
with BROKEN FINGER in the final furlong and ran on in deep stretch to get the nod for second. MASHHAD FLATS was prominent in the early running and

not keep pace with the winner in the final furlong, was outfinished for second in the final strides and just held for third at the finish. AWE settled off of the

quarter marker, was steered five wide into the drive, could not sustain that bid in the stretch and flattened out, while just missing for the minor awards. DI

to the half-mile pole, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and battled to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace in
the final stages and faded. SYNC brushed with SAFE COMBINATION at the start and was away a bit slowly, saved ground while unhurried in the early
going, trailed to the far turn and did not offer a response in the stretch. SAFE COMBINATION brushed with SYNC at the start and was off a bit slowly, was
asked for speed into the first turn and became rank and hard to place while between runners, settled along the backstretch run, lost ground along the
