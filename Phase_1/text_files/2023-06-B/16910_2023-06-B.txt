ALONZO MOSELY dueled inside, shook off challenges and pulled away while kept to his task. LET IT FLOW JOE raced off the dueling leaders inside and
was easily second best. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE alternated for the advantage outside and gave way in the stretch. WEGOTTAGUY dropped back in the
clear outside and offered a mild rally. SECRET THUNDER lacked speed, moved very wide and was no factor. CLASSY UNION dropped back inside and
was never in contention. SUNSANDDRINKINHAND trailed throughout racing along the inside.

Footnotes
INDIRECTLY raced three wide in striking range, bid after half a mile then gradually moved clear driving. MY DEVILS CHILD raced close up inside, moved
wide in the stretch and closed well. SOUPER FLY OVER lacked speed, moved inside and offered a mild stretch rally. SOCIAL GROUP prompted the pace
to the stretch and weakened slightly. MACH TRIAL chased wide on the turn and lacked a rally. SOMEBODY dropped far behind then passed rivals without
menacing. CAPTAIN CHAZZ set a clear pace under a rating hold then stopped in the stretch. OPEN LENGTHS raced wide and far back throughout.

Footnotes
AGGRANDIZE hustled to a clear lead, widened on the turn, drifted out badly in the stretch but remained safe. STEELY DANZA chased pacesetter wide
early and continued well holding the place. KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO dropped far behind then closed strongly too late in the stretch. BOOM BOOM
KABOOM broke slowest, rushed up inside and was just up for the show. BUFFALO SHUFFLE bid along the inside on the turn then flattened out.
THREEPETE trailed to the stretch and was never a factor. SPIRIT'S HERO lacked speed and failed to menace. KIDMAN KERRY flashed speed outside
and stopped abruptly.
