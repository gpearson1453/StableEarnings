Footnotes
SUITABLE broke a bit outwardly at the start, set a clear and uncontested pace in the two path, was set down in the three path entering the lane as a pair of
outer foes gave chase and held sway safely. HILL OF TARA stalked along the inside, took aim between the top pair from the four path nearing the lane,
sustained a grinding charge in pursuit of the SUITABLE in the final furlong, but was kept at bay and was found to have bled. BIG BOSS BEN was antsy and
restless in the starting gate, stalked the leader from the three path, but was floated out to the five path by an inner rival approaching the lane, yielded to the
top pair in upper stretch, but sustained his chase to hold show from an inner rival in the final furlong. SUPERCOOL tracked in the three path, shifted out to
the five path at the quarter pole, then tipped inwardly and chased the leading trio home while fended off by an outer rival for show. COLOR FIELD laid off of
the pace in the four path, got floated to the six path turning for home and made little impact. ROAN FOR THE ROSE was last away, trailed in the four path
around the turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
FAMILY FACTOR took light contact from an inner rival leaving the gates, chased along the inside, bid for the lead two wide at the five sixteenths pole as a
pair of outer foes moved to press, sparred with the early pace setter entering the lane, wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear.
WHO'S SNOW TROUBLE sped clear early on, tucked to the rail entering the turn, met an outer challenge from FAMILY FACTOR at the five sixteenths pole,
resisted that bid entering the lane, but was headed at the furlong grounds, gave way shortly after yet lasted for place. EXPRESS CRUISER leaned out and
bumped a rival at the start, chased two to three wide while between horses into the turn, crept closer to within striking range among foes at the five
sixteenths pole, but failed to sustain that position at the quarter pole, yet kept on along the inside through the lane to regain a minor share. DES DOIGTS
broke a step slow before taking contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked four wide and between horses, ranged up outside of rivals at the five
sixteenths pole but flattened out in upper stretch. PATCH O'BRIEN broke a step slow, tracked five wide but gave way at the three furlong pole. THE RUSH
IS ON brushed an outer rival before nudging an inner foe at the start, then trailed in the two path and failed to factor. IMPERIAL THUNDER received slight
contact from an outer rival soon after the start, then checked subtly behind foes at the half mile pole, laid off of the pace in the three to two path around the
turn but tired.

Footnotes
VIOLENT POINT set the pace inside of a vying rival, inched free nearing the lane, kicked away from pursuing foes entering the lane and held sway from a
chasing OWEN'S PLEASURE through the final furlong. OWEN'S PLEASURE raced forwardly under urging along the inside, tipped to the four path entering
the lane to take aim outside of the clearing leader, but only managed to chase that one through the final furlong while drawing away from the rest. RELIANT
bumped the inner part of the gate and spotted the leaders multiple lengths soon after the start, trailed along the inside, then sustained stride along the rail to
improve inside of rivals in midstretch, vied for show with an outer DONYA KNOW IT entering the final sixteenth and prevailed. DONYA KNOW IT laid off of
the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five, then six, path nearing midstretch, ran on to vie for show with an inner rival entering the final sixteenth, but
got outfinished. SHOW ME GRACE stalked the embattled leading pair from the three path, ranged up outside of them to offer a mild bid at the five
sixteenths pole, but weakened entering the lane. LA V. vied outside of the eventual winner, then from between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but
weakened passing the quarter pole. HOLDONTOYOURTIARA lacked speed in the four to three path and faded around the turn.

Footnotes
DRE ME LESS vied two wide, led in the three path nearing the five sixteenths pole, drew off under confident handling turning for home and was ridden out
under mild urging. WICCA WISDOM was void of speed in the three to four path, lacked a response to urging around the far turn, yet ran on entering the
lane, bid for place at the sixteenth pole and edged that position late. ELLIE DELI tracked in the three to two path, gained place in the three path leaving the
quarter pole after the leader kicked away, but lost that position to an outer bidder in the final sixteenth. TAP THE LINE broke slowly, trailed off of the rail and
surpassed tiring rivals in the final furlong. SNOWCREST tracked along the inside, shifted off the rail entering the lane, but tired. BEACH KITTEN set the
pace inside of a vying rival, proved no match for that one at the five sixteenths pole and caved through the lane.

Footnotes
KUPP leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing foe while a path off of the rail, shook free of that one at the five sixteenths
pole and drew off through the lane. RATE CONFIRMATION raced forwardly along the inside, gained place from outer rivals while entering the lane in the
two path, hung on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over while meeting an outer challenge for that position leaving the furlong grounds and fended off
that rival thereafter. LUNDBERG bobbled slightly before receiving contact from an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear in the two path, launched an
advance while tipping out between horses at the five sixteenths pole, took aim in the four path entering the lane, but leveled off while attempting a bid for
place in the final furlong and was kept at bay. RABBIT HOUND broke a bit awkwardly, raced at the rear in the four path, tucked down to the two path
nearing the lane, took a bump from an outer rival at the furlong grounds, yet sustaiined stride to improve late. SUPREME SONG tracked two wide and
between horses, shifted out to the four path nearing the five sixteenths pole, but was outmoved by an inner rival and gave way soon after, drifted inwardly
and bumped a rival at the furlong grounds, and made little impact. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN prompted the leader form the three path, but failed to keep pace
with that one at the five sixteenths pole and weakened between horses entering the lane. MAFIA broke half a beat slow, chased in the four path and
weakened once floated to the five path at the five sixteenths pole.

STREAMING NOW set the pace along the inside, drew clear under confident handling in the two path entering the lane, responded well to a shoulder tap
and crosses passing the furlong grounds to inch further away before being put to wraps entering the final sixteenth. LADY MOSCATO stalked along the
inside and from the pocket around the turn, gained place from an outer rival entering the lane while vacating the inside to take aim on the clearing leader,
but only managed to chase on her left lead while holding place. PINOTSLILGIRL stalked two wide, pressed around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the
leader before losing place to an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, yet kept on well to manage show. SAVANNAMARIE pursued from midpack in the
two path, gained in the three to four path turning for home, but leveled off after entering the lane in the five path. FOOLISH FRONT FIFI bumped with an
outer rival at the star, tracked along the inside, but saved ground to no avail. CRUISE MISSILE tracked three wide, turned for home in the four path, but
drifted in while yielding in upper stretch. LYRICAL PARDON bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates, tracked two wide and between horses, chased
turning for home but faded. BEAUTIFUL DANCER broke a step slow and trailed early on, gained two wide and between horses at the three furlong pole, but
failed to factor. MORETASTIC lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. PURE CONNECTION was outrun in the three to four path. SHAKE IT
BABY laid off of the pace in the two to three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and tired. JUDY ELAINE was tough to load, pursued from midpack
in the five path, but steadied from restraint entering the turn as the rider began to ease, then jogged home.

Footnotes
KLIMT'S MUSE trailed in the two path, paused behind foes at the five sixteenths pole, swung to the six path to be outside of foes entering the lane, then
rallied under confident handling in pursuit of the leading trio in midstretch, strolled past them in hand at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. WITS AND
WAGERS laid off of the pace two wide, pursued in the three path around the far turn, launched a rally in the four path turning for home, sustained a grinding
charge to offer a bid along with an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, but was swiftly outkicked by that one and edged place. I FEEL THE NEED stalked from
the three path, bid in the four path at the five sixteenths pole, vied with an inner rival while tucking to the three path turning for home, sparred through upper
stretch while wrestling an advantage, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and lost place soon after. YO PUEDO popped open the
gate pre-race without leaving it, set the pace in the two path, dug in to resist a challenge at the five sixteenths pole, got headed by that one nearing the
furlong grounds and yielded to outer rivals passing the sixteenth pole. LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD pressed two wide and between horses, chased into the far
turn, then weakened at the five sixteenths pole. POUT popped open the gate while remaining in it before the start, tracked along the inside, but lacked a rail
bid through a narrow seam nearing the five sixteenths pole, checked as that hole closed leaving that marker and caved through the lane.

Footnotes
INTO CHAMPAGNE stalked the embattled leading pair from the three path entering the turn, loomed a large danger while offering a bold bid outside of them
at the five sixteenths pole, took charge entering the lane and drew off under moderate urging. VIBE CHECK tracked along the inside, chased in the three
path turning for home, then sustained stride to bid for place along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth and fended off that foe late. BUCHU broke a step
slow at the start, pursued the main flight from the two path, crept closer before fanning to the five path entering the lane, and ran on to bid for place in the
late stages but was denied that position. LATE NITE MISTRESS vied two wide, then between horses turning for home, but proved no match for her outer
counterpart entering the lane, maintained place through midstretch, but was surpassed by an outer pair in the final sixteenth. SINTRA was antsy awaiting
the start, then bumped the inner part of the gate when the stalls sprung, lacked speed along the inside, then improved inside of foes nearing the final furlong
and stayed on. GIRLS WEEKEND set the pace inside of a vying rival, sparred with a pair of outer rivals turning for home, proved no match for her outermost
counterpart entering the lane and weakened through the final furlong. BACKSTRETCH ROSE broke a beat slow, trailed early on, moved out of last while
taking the turn in the four to three path, shifted out to the six path entering midstretch and moved up. END OF INNOCENCE was fractious in the gate, then
hopped while off slow and made little impact from the four path. RIPAROUND stalked in the four path but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. BAYTOWN
KITTY CAT chased briefly and folded approaching the turn.

Footnotes
SOUPER MUNNINGS laid off of the pace along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch, rallied two wide and between horses in the final furlong to offer
a late bid and prevailed over an outer rival. NEW BOSS raced towards the rear two wide and between horses, shifted outwardly to take aim outside of the
leaders in upper stretch, but was herded further out in the final furlong, yet sustained a grinding charge to produce a bid in the closing stages, but was
outfinished by an inner foe. SPICY MARG set the pace along the inside, shook clear of an outer presser in upper stretch, but drifted outwardly at the furlong
grounds and was caught by bidders on either side in the final sixteenth. LADY GOLDSTART stalked along the inside, offered a rail grind to produce a mild
bid in the final sixteenth, but flattened out after getting outkicked and was denied show. THUNDERING CREED raced at the rear three wide, fanned to the
six path entering the lane and moved up late. SHARP HERO nudged the gate upon leaving it, chased two wide, but yielded in the five path and between
horses entering the lane, yet kept on thereafter. PRETTY BIRDIE pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then got herded
outwardly by that foe while weakening between horses at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
CRONUS laid off of the pace in the three path, chased around the far turn, then rallied outside of the top pair in the final furlong to drive past them in the
closing stages. BOOSTER SHOT tracked three wide, stalked into the far turn, bid outside of the leader nearing the lane, led leaving the furlong grounds, but
was caught by an outer bidder late. TIME TO MEDDLE bumped squarely with an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, inched a clear margin
around the far turn, but met an outer challenge nearing the lane, got headed passing the furlong grounds, fought on into the final sixteenth but yielded late.
RISKY CHOICE lacked speed, took the far turn in the two path, drifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, yet stayed on in the final furlong to catch an
outer rival for fourth at the wire. STORM STRATEGY exchanged solid contact with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to three path,
fanned to the five path entering the lane, improved to gain fourth passing the furlong grounds, but drifted out and was nailed by an inner rival at the wire.
CRUSADER CONRAD bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, then lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead.
NORTHWIND pressed two wide, chased the leader from between horses around the far turn, yielded turning for home and gave way. SCHMEAR took a
bump from an outer rival before being pinched between horses at the start, and never got involved. PERFECT THUNDER stalked along the inside and
weakened.
