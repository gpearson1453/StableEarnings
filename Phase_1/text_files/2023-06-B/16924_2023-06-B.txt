Footnotes
PRINCESS EMMA JO stalked the pacesetter, led into the stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and drew clear driving. BE WATER quickly moved clear,
dueled on the turn inside then yielded late. SIRENETTA lunged at the break, raced far back then closed well too late. HOWMUCHAREYOUWORTH raced
wide down the backstretch and turn with a mild gain. INCOMPARABLE dropped back early then advanced inside with a gradual gain. LA LA LUCY broke
sluggishly and was never in contention. ROSE LEGACY was urged close up inside for half a mile and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the runner-up
against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

TITANIUM RECKAGE forced the pace outside, took over on the final turn and held rival safe in a game score. FIRST SQUAD settled close up inside,
angled out in the stretch but could not get by the winner. LAST DREAM moved closer four wide before half a mile then flattened out. MERGING TRAFFIC
chased in midpack and lacked a solid rally. NORLANDER hustled to the front inside for five furlongs and gave way. JUNGLHERLY LOVE lagged far behind
then passed fading rivals. SPARTAN BOY broke slowly and raced far behind and was never a factor. SHARP SENSATION moved just off the pace wide to
the final turn and faded. FRUGAL JUDE steadied on the first turn and was always far back. JSK PHARAOH'SREIGN lacked speed and weakened steadily.

ROADTRIPTONOWHERE stumbled at the start, quickly recovered, set a pressured pace then drew off through the stretch. SUIGU STAR saved ground
close up, bid at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner. PREDOMINATE moved wide off the pace, moved briefly closer before half a mile and
faded. MIDNIGHT CHROME prompted the winner outside for three quarters and stopped.

SCREEN SAVER stalked the pacesetter outside, took over at the quarter pole and pulled away under moderate urging. KITH moved clear inside early, vied
through the final turn and was easily second. JUMP FOR ALEX reserved wide off the leaders and lacked a solid response. CALL FITZROY trailed far
behind then offered some late energy. MISSISSIPPI raced close up inside before half a mile then gave way. AMOUNT saved ground just off the pace early
then stopped abruptly. GRIT'N'GRIND injured himself in the starting gate and was ordered a late scratch.

Footnotes
BIG CITY BOB hustled to the front in the two path, bumped rival into the far turn, was challenged in midstretch and came out repeatedly holding off
challenger. GENGHIS forced the pace inside, was bumped into the far turn, angled out, was carried out very wide in the lane and could not get by.
PUTTHEGLASSDOWN steadied into the far turn then recovered with a mild rally. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE chased outside off the pace and flattened out in
the stretch. OSPREY saved ground close up, angled out in the stretch and was no factor. HIDE THE RANSOM urged wide down the backstretch and
weakened. U U STAR raced close up inside then began fading on the turn. STRIKE ME DOWN dropped back early inside and was always far behind. An
objection by the rider of the second finisher against the winner was allowed and BIG CITY BOB was disqualified and placed second.
