FIGHT bumped at the start, rated inside the leader, angled out down the backstretch, gained position three wide through the turn, bid outside, then made a
steady gain and drew off late. KENJI'S EMPIRE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held command to the furlong marker, then was no match for the
winner, while clearly best of the rest. ON AN ISLAND well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and
flattened out. QUICK QUICK WHIT unhurried, looped three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and got up for a share. RED GUN hopped
at the start, passed tiring rivals. TWELVETWO broke out, bumping a rival at the start, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and had no
stretch rally. DOUBLE WARRIOR well placed, faded through the turn.

DO YOU LOVE ME sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off late and was kept to the task. YANKEE DOLLAR
rated off the rail, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then drifted in late and could not
threaten. BALI KUTA never far back, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, evened, while gaining the show.
LOVELY EVER AFTER unhurried, saved ground moving up through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. VILLAGE QUEEN well placed and inside, angled out into the second turn, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane
and faded. ANNA ROCKS was never involved.

Footnotes
WILD DELIGHT unhurried, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off in the late going.
MOTOWN MISCHIEF sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held command to the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best
of the rest. ZIP CODE ENVY well placed and inside, moved to position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out, then
drifted in and had no late gain. CAN I GET AN AMEN well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch then drifted in and weakened. REVEILLE SONG hopped at the start, was no factor.
