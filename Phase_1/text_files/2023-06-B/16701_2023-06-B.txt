duo nearing the half mile marker, vied for command along the inside around the turn, fought back in upper stretch then flattened in late stages. HACKER
roused forward to engage rivals for the lead mid-way near the half mile marker, dueled between rivals around the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then

Footnotes
THE AWFUL TRUTH was allowed to settle out of the gate, raced two to three wide into the first turn, remained unhurried in the back up the backstretch,
edged closer late on the far turn, given cue four wide at the head of the lane, responded willingly, rallied through the stretch run and surged by late. RUDY
TOOTY dueled for the lead along the inside around the first turn, continued to battle for command up the backstretch, shook free leaving the quarter pole,
widened to a clear advantage in upper stretch, continued clear into the final furlong then got caught late. MOLLY BYE O dueled three deep around the first
turn and up the backstretch, could not match strides for the lead late on the far turn and steadily weakened. KAMEA dueled between rivals around the turn
and up the backstretch, could not maintain equal terms past the midway point on the far turn and steadily faded. MY FOUR POINT OH was well placed
tracking the embattled trio up the backstretch, came under a ride two to three wide around the far turn, swung wider for the drive and retreated.

Footnotes
DOUBLE THUNDER stalked the pace near the inside up the backstretch, made a move along the inside with three furlongs left to run, dueled with
TEMPTED MISSION around the far turn, shook free to a slim lead in upper stretch, kept under steady urging and held clear. TEMPTED MISSION took over
the lead entering the first turn and angled inside, set the pace up the backstretch, dueled with DOUBLE THUNDER around the far turn, could not match
strides in upper stretch but stayed on with good effort to finish clearly second best. JOHN R lacked speed and raced well off the early leaders, swung three
wide into the lane, showed run in final furlong and gained a share. GRAZEN IN THE PARK raced off the early pace, came under a ride along the inside at
the head of the lane, showed some mild interest and improved position. HUNKA BURNING LOVE broke on top then conceded position to TEMPTED
MISSION soon after the start, stalked rival up the backstretch, came under a ride mid-way around the far turn, failed to respond and steadily faded through
the lane. BUZZER raced in range three to four wide up the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure around the far turn and retreated in the lane.

NOT ROCKET SCIENCE rated off the embattled trio up the backstretch, edged closer late on the turn, given cue three to four wide at the top of the lane,
responded willingly, surged to confront OSCAR WINNER WALLY in the final sixteenth, gained a slim lead and edged away. OSCAR WINNER WALLY
dueled for the lead along the inside in opening stages and continued to battle up the backstretch, shook free mid-way around the turn, widened advantage
in upper stretch, continued to lead the way under steady encouragement then got overtaken in deep stretch. A BRUSH OF LUCK rated off the early pace,
saved ground around the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane, responded when called upon and captured show. SHUT UP MAN dueled three deep
in opening stages, battled for command up the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then lacked closing
response and lost show. MY BOBBY MCGEE raced in the back through early stages, swung four wide into the lane and showed response in deep stretch.
GIANT GAMBLE dueled between rivals up the backstretch, ran on two wide around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
JUST JOHNNY was well placed sitting just off the embattled duo, tracked rivals around the turn, swung into action three to four wide entering the lane,
accelerated to the front past the eighth pole and finished clear. TWIRLING CHIEF rated off the early pace, picked up the tempo midway around the turn,
hustled along four wide into the lane, drifted inward a couple paths and produced a solid finish. SWAMPDRAINER was unhurried and raced in the back,
swung four wide into the lane and closed willingly. LURCH rated off the pace in early stages, prompted two wide at the head of the lane, steadily edged up
closer but needed more for late impact. OPPOSITION raced in the second flight midway up the backstretch, flattened under urging around the turn, shifted
three wide for the drive and had no late response. PURE CRYSTAL dueled along the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, cut the corner and
shook free entering the lane, got collared past the eighth pole and had nothing left in reserve. NIGHT TERROR dueled up the backstretch and around the
turn, came up empty in the upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SMART N INTUITIVE tracked the pace up the backstretch, edged a bit closer late on the turn, swung three to four wide into the lane, dug in under right
handed pressure and forged clear in the final sixteenth. RED WHITE AND LOUD vied for the lead in the opening quarter, held clear around the turn,
continued with the advantage into the final furlong then got overtaken by the winner in late stages. MILTON STREET vied for the lead in the opening
quarter, chased in contention around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, sustained bid to the eighth pole then gave way. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE raced
near midpack up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. APOLLO BAY hopped at the start and raced in the
back, hustled along two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. STORMIN' J. J. raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and failed to respond.
LUCKY LOUIE was forwardly placed in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
PINK PARTY PANTS broke sharp and quickly cleared the early lead, came under pressure from inside running rival near the half mile marker, let out a
notch and quickly widened advantage entering the turn, swung wider for the drive, shifted in a couple paths, turned back bids and kept clear. IRON LOTUS
raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into the lane, advanced into contention but could not reach the eventual winner and settled for second
best. RELENTLESS ROCKET tracked the pace three wide up the backstretch, got carried out five wide heading into the lane, sustained an outside bid and
cleared the rest. CHARACTER COUNTS got bumped at the start, chased up close two wide, angled inside late on the turn, ran on in upper stretch then
steadily faded. MRS. MACOMBER pressed the pace along the inside in the opening quarter, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
FLAT OUT HOT lacked speed, raced in the back, came wide into the lane and never threatened.
