Footnotes
ICONIC LEGACY well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch, moved briefly clear and held on gamely. HE HATE ME dropped well behind,
moved very wide in the stretch and offered a strong finish. QUICK RETURN urged off the pace inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. MR.
ROUNDTREE lacked speed, moved out in the stretch and finished willingly. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY dueled along the inside to the stretch and weakened.
DATHOSS raced just off the leaders outside and proved empty in the stretch. BIG BROWN SHOES forced the pace in the two path, led briefly at the quarter
pole then faded.

raced just off the pace outside and flattened out in the stretch. KISSES FOR EMILY settled inside off the leaders and lacked a rally. MEMENTO MI trailed
