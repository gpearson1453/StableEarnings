START SINGING tracked the early pace from the inside, checked near the three eighths pole, angled out through the turn and got up under strong pressure.
LADY ASTRID stalked the early pace three wide, challenged for the lead through the upper stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. YANKEE AGATE
showed good early foot along the inside and weakened in the drive. MERLIN'S SISTER was void of early speed, raced near the inside around the far turn
through the stretch and had no rally. KIRA FEVER settled off the early going, raced off the inside around both turn, was wide into the upper stretch and
never threatened while racing from the outside.

Footnotes
WEST ISLAND showed good early foot to set the early pace and drew off to be well clear while being kept to pressure. TOTAL SURPRISE was coaxed
along between rivals, raced well off the inside in the stretch and kept on but was no match for the winner. WIN OVER WYATT bobbled at the break, raced
four to five wide around the far turn and weakened in the drive. ARTIE BELOW ZERO was off slowly, chased the early pace from the inside and weakened
through the drive. RAMBLINGAMBLINMAN settled off the early going, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. CAUSEWAY
SURPISE was slow early on, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and never menaced. PRESTIGIOUSLY WILD dropped back early, saved ground
around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened.
