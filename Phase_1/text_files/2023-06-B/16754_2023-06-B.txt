Footnotes
NEUTRAL , patiently rated in the two path between horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, moved to the three path turning for home, worked
between horses, eased outside SOLOMON'S CHOICE in upper stretch, bid for the lead between horses in mid stretch and prevailed under pressure.
AWESOME STRIKE , rank and checked in tight quarters entering the first turn, swung outside leaving that turn, was four deep the fart turn, challenged for
the lead outside the winner in mid stretch and flattened out. HIALEAH NATIVE hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace throughout and finished
willingly. LONGWORTH , three wide the first turn, was well back down the backstretch and in to the stretch, swung to the six path approaching the eighth
pole, raced on his left lead and passed tired foes. SOLOMON'S CHOICE , checked in close quarters behind ICANDOTHAT entering the first turn, chased
the pace on the far turn, entered the stretch in the three path, gained the lead in upper stretch and weakened late. LONG RAP SHEET , up close along the
inner rail to the stretch, weakened. ICANDOTHAT , angled in to the three path entering the first turn, dueled outside HIALEAH NATIVE down the
backstretch, and was done in upper stretch. PAY THE SQUID raced along the inner rail on the far turn and through the stretch while weakening.
THUNDERHOUSE was outrun.

Footnotes
MARIA FROM MIAMI , coaxed along saving ground and in range of a contested pace, eased out three wide into the stretch, closed in under a drive, took
command outside rivals in deep stretch and drew clear. ELLIE VICTORINA , sent up to the inside early on and joined I HAVE COURAGE, disputed the pace
into and around the turn, dueled on near even terms leaving the eighth pole and kept on well to be second best. I HAVE COURAGE sped to a short early
lead, was hounded from her inside by ELLIE VICTORINA, clung to a slim advantage sparring in mid stretch, raced between foes heading to the sixteenth
marker and weakened late. MERGER OF EQUALS chased off the rail, shifted out four wide and came up empty. MY BOSS broke sharply then rated just off
the leaders while three wide, was under pressure four wide pursuing into the lane, lacked a punch in mid stretch and weakened. HARPER'S DO broke a
step slow and was outrun. EXCLUSIVE ROSE drafted back off the leaders in the opening furlong, failed to go on under asks near the five sixteenths and
retreated.

Footnotes
U S CONSTITUTION disputed the pace outside KING'S HONOR down the backstretch, sprinted clear mid way on the far turn and was under urging in the
drive. PAPAL LAW , three wide both turns, chased the winner throughout in a game effort. SPEAK UNITY , five deep turning for home, rallied mildly. TWO
BY TWO raced in the four path inside SPEAK UNITY entering the stretch and had a mild gain between horses. SAMUI SUNSET , lightly steadied in traffic
between horses entering the far turn, raced inside foes in the stretch and weakened. JIMMY DAN raced in the three path turning for home, lacked the
needed response and was checked in tight quarters between TWO BY TWO and SAMUI SUNSET near the sixteenth pole. FERMAT , outrun, swung wide
turning for home. KING'S HONOR (IRE) showed speed along the inner rail, dueled to the far turn, faltered in upper stretch and was eased. Objections by
the rider of JIMMY DAN against TWO BY TWO and SAMUI SUNSET for alleged interference in the stretch drive were not allowed.

Footnotes
BAHAMA CHANNEL angled out nearing the three quarter pole and stalked a loose leader, edged up in hand near the half mile marker, went on the attack
soon after and wrested command moved away past the five sixteenths, opened up under solid hand ride in mid stretch and proved much the best while
taken in hand for the final yards. SASSY KING settled well back, gathered momentum under a ride around the final turn, circled five wide into the stretch
and continued on willingly to gain the place. UNEQUIVOCAL broke a step slow, recovered and moved up nearing the first turn, rated in the clear near the
five eighths, gained off the inside past the five sixteenths, shifted in some while continuing pursuit in upper stretch then flattened out. CAMP PENDLETON
steadied off heels nearing the first turn, settled outside a rival, was in a bit tight entering the lane then finished with interest. ERAWAN steadied off the heels
of CAMP PENDLETON after that one was forced in a bit, dropped well off the pace, swung out for the drive but lacked a rally. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO
dropped in bothering foes heading to the first turn, saved ground through the backstretch run, came out past the five sixteenths and faded. HAYNE'S
FEVER rushed clear early, angled in to set the pace, could not contain the winner leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SIEGE OF BOSTON , bumped at the break, recovered and settled in the clear, angled out when taking closer order into the far turn, responded when called
upon and moved boldly four wide wide to engage the leaders into the lane, forged clear leaving the three sixteenths then powered away from rivals while
under intermittent right handed asks. SERIFOS , taken to rate while saving ground, eased out near the five sixteenths then crept closer between foes,
shifted out wider in upper stretch, advanced between runners near mid stretch and finished up willingly to gain the place. WICKED PRANKSTER cleared
early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by a pair of rivals entering the lane, stayed on willingly past mid stretch, faded late but managed to save the
show. EYES ON TARGET , three deep stalking the pace, moved up and bid under asking nearing the lane, raced between foes in upper stretch and faded.
TREASURE TROVE , under a firm hold off the rail into the backstretch, raced three wide into the lane, angled in past the three sixteenths, came back out
and offered a belated response. SARANAC (FR) settled off the pace and removed from the rail, gained four wide approaching the stretch, remained on his
left lead and flattened out through the final furlong. POWER BACK drifted out at the break and bumped with ONE TEN, corrected and tracked inside, took
closer order past the five sixteenths, had aim into the lane, lacked a punch and gave way. ONE TEN , bumped at the break, was outrun. COLBALOAF
prompted the pace two wide outside WICKED PRANKSTER then faltered after six and a half furlongs.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT CHASE , angled out entering the first turn, was three wide on the bend, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, moved up three
deep to take the lead mid way on the far turn, was challenged on his outside by BOB MARCO in upper stretch, responded to urging and drew off. BOB
MARCO , a forward factor in the two path between horses down the backstretch, swung four wide approaching the stretch, challenged for the lead in upper
stretch, finished willingly but was no match for the winner. DIXIE DRAWL lacked speed, circled the far turn four deep and had a slight rally. KRUG , four
wide the first turn, raced in mid pack down the backstretch, was in the three path turning for home and gave way. JASONTAKESLONG chased the pace
along the inner rail down the backstretch, swung out in upper stretch and faltered. NEVER CHANGE , bumped leaving the starting gate, chased the pace
inside horses, hugged the inner rail on the far turn and gave way approaching the stretch. NORTHERN THUNDER , outrun, floated to the six path turning
for home and was eased through the stretch. GOODLUCKCHUCK bore out at the break, sped to the early lead, saved ground around the far turn, faltered
and was eased.

Footnotes
BOSSERATI cleared early and was nicely rated setting the pace towards the rail, continued under confident handling into the lane, responded when roused
leaving the three sixteenths, switched over to her left lead late, wandered outward and held sway under a drive. MY SWEET AFFAIR , bumped and pinched
back at the break, regrouped and settled off the pace, was put to urging while off the rail mid turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, closed outside
rivals, switched over to her left lead near the sixteenth marker and continued on with good energy to gain. AFTER EIGHT drifted in at the break bumping a
rival, corrected and was snugly rated between runners nearing the turn, steadied back soon after then stalked, saved ground into the stretch, came back out
with progress in mid stretch, chased and hung late. APPLE PICKER , off the pace, raced two to three wide in upper stretch, dropped in towards the rail for
the final furlong and churned on. CAROLINE KRYSTYNA , bumped and forced in by AFTER EIGHT at the break, was taken to rate then edged up to the
inside of runners nearing the turn, eased out to pursue the winner into the lane, altered in near the sixteenth marker and faded. SWEET HARMONY , three
deep early stalking the pace, circled four wide into the lane, lacked a punch past the quarter pole and tired. An objection by the rider of MY SWEET AFFAIR
against the winner for alleged interference leaving the gate was not allowed. An objection by the rider of SWEET HARMONY against the winner for alleged
interference around the turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
OXIDE set the pace in the two path down the backstretch and around the turn, responded to urging in the stretch and drew away. EKATI'S VERVE lacked
speed, moved up four deep leaving the turn and was up at the wire for the place. NASHVEGAS , three wide chasing the winner around the turn, finished
willingly. REMEMBERING WILBUR came out at the break, raced in the three path on the turn nd failed to rally in an even effort. FIVE STAR PHIL , pinched
back leaving the starting gate, swung very wide for the stretch run and was never a factor. SPRING THE BEAST pressed the early pace while hugging the
inner rail, gave way in upper stretch and was eased the final sixteenth of a mile.
