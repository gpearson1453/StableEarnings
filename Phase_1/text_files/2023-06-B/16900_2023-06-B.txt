turn, vied through the turn and finished gamely. PONTIFFANY dueled in two path then pursued inside and finished willingly. FRAME THIS broke sluggishly
and raced far back then offered some late energy. GOD STILL LOVES ME earned a narrow advantage outside in the opening quarter then weakened in the
stretch. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES raced wide just off the pacesetters and retreated. MS. MALEVOLENCE dropped back outside and lacked a response.

HEY MAMALUKE pursued inside the pacesetter, bid to the front after the eighth pole, moved briefly clear and lasted driving. HIDDEN CACHE dropped well
behind inside then closed strongly wide in the stretch too late. TAPPIN JOSIE trailed inside on the turn then split foes with a powerful late surge. MIDNIGHT
IN ALASKA sluggish at the start, rushed up wide, bid on the turn, loomed a threat and continued willingly. EMPRESS DEONA broke alertly and moved
clear, was collared after the eighth pole and tired in the final furlong. CASTILLEJA broke a step slowly, dropped back outside and was never a factor.

MOVISITOR reserved inside the dueling leaders, rushed to the front passing the half mile pole then pulled clear under pressure to the late stages. TIME TO
CRUISE trailed for half a mile then finished well wide to be easily second best. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE prompted the pace outside then began fading on
final turn. WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS drifted out into the first turn, stopped abruptly and lost contact with his field. RABBIT ran off on the way to the paddock
and was ordered a late scratch.
