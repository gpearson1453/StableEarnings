Footnotes
NAUGHTY CHILD vied for lead three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered lane in the lead, dug in and edged away late to win
clear. LAMPY chased trio along the rail on the backstretch, continued well placed on the turn, angled out into the four path in the lane and responded to get
up for second. PAUL L broke in and bumped rival at the start, vied in between rivals for the lead, continued to duel for lead on the turn, entered lane along
the rail, in range approaching the final sixteenth, gave way and lost second at the wire. CLUBHOUSE CAT bumped in at the start, contested early pace on
the the inside of a pair of rivals, had trouble cornering and had to forcibly steady after being taken under a strong hold, appeared to be ready to be eased,
but gathered back momentum and managed to beat two other rivals to the wire. HOLYJAZZ failed to show customary early speed, settled for a wide stalking
position, jockey chose to stay five wide on the turn and had nothing left in the lane when asked. A BIT MUCH away well, contested pace four wide early,
settled into a stalking four wide position on the turn, floated out a touch when rival took up and lugged out, entered lane in the four path and had nothing in
the lane.
