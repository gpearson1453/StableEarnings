PREACHER broke well and went to the front to vie for the lead down the backstretch then shared command in the turn and edged away midway through the
turn and drew off in the stretch. YHA YHA chased the leaders through the turn from the inside then moved out to three wide in the stretch drive to be second
best. JUST CALL ME KEN raced near the back on the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn and moved out to four wide into the stretch to be
along for show. WILLTOBELUCKY had no early speed and passed tiring rivals. FLY BUDDY FLY was off slow, moved up from two wide into the turn then
made a rail bid in the stretch but flattened out. CATS GOTTA CHANCE went to the lead from under pressure on the inside then shared command to mid
turn then vied for the lead to the top of the stretch and gave way. FERRARI ROAD was off slow then moved up the rail to be in contention on the
backstretch but was not a factor.

the leaders from the inside then moved out to three wide in upper stretch to give late interest but was out finished. THREE BALL had no early speed, then
made a three wide bid at the seven sixteenths pole, moved out to five wide into the stretch and improved position. TIGER THE MAN was off the pace from
the two path but had no response. NORTHRNDANCRSGHOST chased the leaders and was never a threat.

KATAR went to the front to set a pressured pace to early stretch and drew off. MY MAN BIGGIE had no early speed through the turn then moved between
horses entering the stretch, was coaxed at the three sixteenths pole and found his best strides late. BRAYBRAY was hustled along to press the pace to
early stretch and was out kicked in the final furlong but was a clear third. BIG JACK tracked the leaders from the two path but was not a threat. LOOPY
DUDE saved ground to no avail.
