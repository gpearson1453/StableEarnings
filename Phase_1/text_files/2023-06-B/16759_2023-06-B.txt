driving. BINGO STAR chased inside and was in a bit tight leaving the chute, then chased inside, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside and was
gaining at the end. SPOILS OF WAR raced four wide in the chute, chased outside, bid two wide on the turn, could not stay with the winner, then dug in to
save the show spot. JAMS TOP SHELF chased on the inside, saved ground on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail. LONDON LADY raced four wide in the
chute, stalked, three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and gained mildly outside. STONE IN LOVE was bumped at the start, had a three wide
trip off the pace and failed to threaten. SONNY AND MAX was bumped at the start, steadied early, raced inside, steadied at the half mile pole, continued
inside and had no rally. ONLY GIRL raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and passed tired foes. FAIR AND TRUE was outrun early and did not

forged to the front nearing the eighth pole and then held well under urging. OUR SHOT raced off the rail, off the pace, chased two wide on the turn, rallied
five wide into the stretch, angled in behind the winner in midstretch and closed well inside. ALOGON raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn,
waited for room behind horses at the top of the stretch, angled in and rallied inside. BELGRANO trailed the field, advanced at the quarter pole, angled out
and rallied mildly outside. FULL DISCLOSURE dueled inside in a three way pace dispute, dueled on the turn and weakened in the stretch. JUST JEREMY
dueled between rivals for the opening three furlongs and faded in the lane. THAT'S RIGHT dueled three wide for command, dueled on the turn and faded in

Footnotes
MIRANDA'S ROCKY raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, dueled with SOCIAL LADY turning for home, put a
head in front and edged away in the final hundred yards. SOCIAL LADY raced off the pace inside, advanced two wide on the turn, bid nearing the quarter
pole, dueled with the winner into the stretch, dug in gamely inside of that rival and yielded. BLUEBERRY INDYGO broke in bumping a rival at the start,
pulled in the early stages while showing good speed, opened up a long lead, showed the way to the quarter pole, then weakened and held on for third.
BODIL bobbled and was bumped at the break, raced off the rail off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole, then lacked a stretch rally. LUV U MARY JANE
broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. CUPIDS PAYDAY pulled in the early stages, then settled off the leader, chased inside on
the far turn and gave way.
