Footnotes
MR GOLD MAN vied inside to the turn, inched clear and held safely under mild urging. DISCREET TIGER vied between horses, fell back leaving the turn,
lacked a late rally and finished second best. CAIRO KING raced close to the pace along the inside, angled out in the upper stretch, drifted out, lost ground
and just lasted for show. SIDNEY'S HOPE was unhurried early and trailed the field, angled in mid stretch, closed well late and was outnodded for third.
BURNZ DA BOSS pressed the pace while racing four across to the turn, fell back and gave way. SOLID GOLD BAR pressed the pace between horses,
backed up entering the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
MARK THE WINNER vied to the turn, drew off and extended the lead while ridden out. ATTILA'S ACE was never far back, raced inside and got up for place
in an inside trip while no threat to the winner. WAY TO RULE vied inside, was steadied on the turn, dropped back, went evenly late under mild urging and
was outfinished for second. HOLY BULLET rallied into the turn to loom a threat, was steadied at the top of the stretch, fell back and faded. AWESOME
ACCOUNT raced in the second flight between horses, fell back into the turn and stopped. STORM CENT put in an even effort in an outside trip and failed to
threaten. EL HUARACHE PRIETO broke a step slowly, failed to contend and showed little. FOOL ON A STOOL broke slowly and was crowded at the start,
fell far back, was eased and walked off. I'M A DREAMER TOO broke in, raced far back, was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
SEXY DEXY set the pace, drew off into the far turn for a long lead and held off the late charge of GLENDORA MINECAT. GLENDORA MINECAT was
restrained leaving the gate, unhurried early, rallied after a half, closed willingly and was gaining fast late. KIRBY DERBY was unhurried early, raced wide
throughout, finished well and gained late to earn show. BEAR BRIAN settled mid pack, had nothing left for the drive and lacked a bid. STRYDER brushed at
the start, raced in the back, saved ground to the turn and improved position in the drive. SIGALERT brushed at the start, pressed the pace, fell back into the
turn and was not urged late. SAMURAI JACK raced in the middle of the pack and was outrun in an even effort. BLUEGRASS FAITH vied around the first
turn, stalked to the second turn, tired and stopped. TRIPP A MATIC failed to contend, showed little and was not urged late.

Footnotes
MARKED MONEY was pushed out at the start, held a good position, challenged three across on the turn, assumed command, inched away and held under
pressure. WARRIORS MARK pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, went willingly to the wire, couldn't gain on the winner and finished
second best. Z MARKS THE SPOT was pushed out at the start, dropped inside, bid along the rail on the turn, shifted back out, rallied four wide, hung late
and settled for show. SMARTSREALGOOD lagged early, swung wide leaving the turn and offered a mild bid to improve position. DISCOVERY N SIGHT
dropped inside, was crowded along the rail entering the turn and came up empty when clear. THATGIRL'SONFIRE trailed the field, went widest in the drive
and improved position. MARKED BY A STORM veered out at the start, dropped inside and raced evenly. TRICAR MISS set the pace while racing well off
the rail and stopped on the turn.
