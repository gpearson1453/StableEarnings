Footnotes
AUCHINCRUIVE was well rated throughout, two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and made a bid under left handed crop urging to draw clear
late to prove best. THE MAN TO SEE steadied into the first turn while under a tight hold, then pulled while on the first turn, finally settled on the backstretch,
made a two wide bid off the turn and fought it out with the pacesetter through the lane but was outfrinished by the winner while winning the battle for the
place award. RED DEVOLUTION set the pace on the inside and was well handled, dug in through the lane and gave way grudgingly, bested rest. LAST
SECOND LOUIE was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three to two wide, made a bid on the turn but drifted out and came four wide into the lane
and weakened. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL tracked the pace two wide and tired. DON'T QUESTION ME was settled early and stopped. DR GREENTHUMB
showed little. Race was HAND TIMED due to operator error.

then drew off in the lane to prove much the best to score under a hand ride. CATTY'S UNCLE stalked the winner three wide, made a two wide bid on the
turn but could not go with the winner while saving the place award. LUCKY RUNNING CAT was well placed on the inside and weakened, bested rest. EYE
ON THE CANDY chased the early pace, three wide on the turn and weakened. SHIFTINGGEARS was dwelt at the start, far back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
POLITICAL was settled early, advanced two wide on the turn, eased out and came four wide into the lane, closed well on the outside and drew clear to
prove best, driving. TRIPLE A. PLUS was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then was
headed by the furlong marker, dug in but could not go with the winner, held place award. CHARGING LION was well rated early, made a three wide move
on the turn, loomed boldly off the turn and was between rivals by the furlong marker but flattened out. HE CAME TRUE steadied into the first turn, settled on
the outside, three wide on the turn and weakened. ALL TIME CLASSIC set a pressured pace in the two path, between rivals by the half mile marker, then
gave way on the turn. VISHNU pressed the pace on the inside and tired.
