evenly throughout with no late response in stretch. NANA ROZE between horses on the backstretch, never a menace throughout. SWEETER THAN

SPELLCAST well rated to the turn, roused into the stretch, responded well and spurted away in the final seventy yards in a good effort. NUEVO
AMANECER quick speed to the front from between horses, clear turn out of the turn into stretch while no match for the winner while clear best of the rest.
MANSION PARTY reluctant to load, chased leader from between horses and stayed on for the show spot. GUESS AGAIN had inside speed from the gate,
could not keep up to the turn and weakened in the lane. ROYALLY FLUSHED was through early and dropped back readily. ONORE broke poorly from the
gate and never menaced throughout.

Footnotes
WEST COASTER good position to half, moved up shut off stumbled badly at the five sixteenth pole, recovered quickly and came running in the final furlong
proving to be tons best. VAGARIES (IRE) steadied along early, troubled to the stretch and ran on for place and might have been best today. LASERJET
bounced around from the gate, troubled into far turn and quarter pole, ran on gamely through the stretch run. BLOSSOM DIVA speed to the front, stayed on
gamely to furlong pole, wilted late. MY BLUE VALENTINE good position throughout stayed to the eighth pole, gave in late. DELOVELY saved ground to far
turn, no room to quarter pole, faltered late. AMERICAN ODALISQUE raced evenly along to far turn, faltered into the stretch run. COZEE MAGIC good
position to the half while declining from that point. LADY BIRD KISSES reluctant to load, never a factor. HOP SNIP ANDA JUMP dueled to the half with a
steady fade from the far turn. MORE THAN ROSES dropped far back from the half readily.
