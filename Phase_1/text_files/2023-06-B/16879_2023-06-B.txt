PENALTY TO RANGERS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail in the run
down the backside and through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late while finishing two wide in the drive. TEXAS LEGACY away alertly
and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide midway down the backstretch, was unable to
match strides with the leader entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to prove second best. LENT ME TWENTY away well and tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive to
garner a share. SWEET AS HONEY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the
rail entering the final turn, but needed more of a closing response when called upon. STOLO SPIRIT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always
well back and failed to make a late impact.

GORKY PARK tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the stretch the first time while under snug restraint, continued to race up on heels at the rail
entering the second turn before finally settling off the leaders entering the backstretch, saved ground at the rail through the final turn, shifted three wide for
the drive and ran down YOU DON'T OWN ME late to prove best. YOU DON'T OWN ME away well and pressed the pace from the outside of CALAMAZEUS
through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue in the run down the backside, held a narrow advantage into the final turn, increased his lead
through the turn, but was unable to fend off GORKY PARK late while proving clearly second best. CALAMAZEUS away alertly and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, struggled to match strides with his
pace rival entering the final turn, and was outfinished late. PADDY D'ORO broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing
three wide, continued with a three wide trip in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and finiished one out from the rail in the drive while unable to
mount a late bid. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two wide from between rivals, dropped back to
trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
ARIKARA away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of ANOTHERSUNNYDAY in the
run down the backstretch, shook clear of her pace rival and quickly opened a clear lead through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late.
RACINO settled well off the early contested pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail
approaching the final turn, and finished with interest from just off the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. ANAAMY broke sharply and was allowed
to settle off the dueling leaders while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three
wide in the drive to garner a share. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY dueled for the lead two wide entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of
ARIKARA in the run down the backside, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. TIMELESS
SHRUG unhurried early while trailing well behind the field entering the backstretch, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run to the final turn, saved
ground through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. KANDY KATIE away well and settled
off the early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, was carried wide turning for
home, but had little to offer late.

SLOOP JOHN B broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch
and held a clear advantage into the final turn, and finished determinedly one out from the rail in the drive while fending off a late surge by ERLICH to prevail.
ERLICH tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, dropped in behind the pacesetters entering the second turn
while racing two wide, tipped three wide approaching the final turn to launch his bid , and closed steadily three out from the rail in the drive to just miss. ONE
FIFTY ONE away alertly and tracked the leader while racing two wide entering the lane the first time, forced the issue from the outside of SLOOP JOHN B in
the run to the final turn, dropped back into a tracking trip behind the pacesetter approaching the turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished from
along the rail in the drive to garner a share. EYE BE SEEING YOU trailed the field into the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time at the back of the
pack in the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide through the turn, and improved his position late while finishing three
wide in the drive. TRAPALIS stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the run
down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DEBATABLE away well and tracked
the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had no late impact.

the outside of that rival in the run down the backside and through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and inched clear late to prove best.
STAY FANTASTIC broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of JUST
