Footnotes
SWAGGISH broke outwardly, vied two wide, inherited a clear advantage entering the turn after gradually putting his inner counterpart to crowded quarters
passing the half mile pole, then drew off under a moderate drive through the lane. KING OF KENTUCKY vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but
steadied when put to tight quarters by that rival at the half mile pole, chased along the inside around the turn and was second best. SCOTCH NO ROCKS
saved ground off of the pace, then improved along the rail to narrowly reach show at the wire. VALUABLE CARGO leaned outwardly and broke a step slow,
laid off of the pace in the three path, then improved between horses to miss show at the wire. CAMP GRAY tracked two wide, but veered out from a left
handed crop nearing the sixteenth pole and was surpassed by a pair of inner rivals late. LOCO lacked speed in the four path and never got involved.
COUSIN ODELL trailed in the two path and showed little.

Footnotes
FIFTH AVENUE set the pace inside of a pressing rival into the turn, then shook clear turning for home. LAMBO broke outwardly while last away, recovered
to prompt outside of the leader entering the turn, needed to be shown a right handed crop to sustain pressure in the three path approaching the five
sixteenths pole, but bore out to the five path inside the quarter pole, failed to keep pace with the leader in the process and was second best. HEY JOE JOE
broke a step slow, lacked speed in the three to four path around the turn and moved up in the final furlong. EL PELIGRO was antsy in the starting gate, then
chased along the inside and faded. TECHNE showed little.

Footnotes
HEARTBREAKER brushed with an outer rival leaving the gates, set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge from EVERSO
MISCHIEVOUS around the far turn, sparred with that one entering the lane, subtly shifted out while inching an advantage coming to the furlong grounds and
tenaciously clung to it thereafter. EVERSO MISCHIEVOUS exchanged light contact with an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the pace setter,
prompted into the far turn before bidding at the five sixteenths pole, sparked a duel turning for home, got slightly herded outwardly while failing to maintain
even terms coming to midstretch and was fended off through the late stages. TEPEU tracked along the inside, vied for show with an outer rival through
upper stretch and edged that position nearing the final sixteenth. GRAPHIC DETAIL tracked two wide and between horses, chased outside of the top pair
around the far turn and gave way. COMMUNICATION MEMO pursued the leaders three wide and outside of foes, but faded in the four path around the far
turn.

Footnotes
HARRY HOOD set the pace along the inside, showed the way from an outer presser around the far turn, shook free while shifting out to the three path
straightening for home and held sway thereafter. BABA VOSS laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, displayed good courage by splitting rivals
through a narrow seam in upper stretch, vied for place with an outer rival in the final furlong, tipped outside of the clear leader in the closing stages, but did
not have enough to offer a bid while securing second. BRIGADE COMMANDER pursued from midpack two wide, took closer order before chasing outside
of the top pair from within striking around into the far turn, took aim on the clearing leader from the four path in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick to
offer a bid and got outfinished by an inner rival for place. NOISES OFF laid in midpack along the inside, awaited racing room behind traffic nearing the lane,
altered course outwardly in upper stretch to be four wide entering the final furlong, and stayed on between horses. MO SATURDAYS settled well back along
the inside, moved between horses at the half mile pole, took the far turn in the two to three path before swinging to the five path and between foes entering
the lane, but only offered a mild kick. NOW THAT ICAN ROCK laid off of the pace three to four wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane and lacked the
needed kick to offer a bid. BOONE'S PATH stalked two wide, prompted outside of the pace setter around the far turn, but lost place to an outer rival entering
the lane, and gave way between horses. CREATIVE WAY tracked along the inside, but caved entering the final furlong. TESTIMONY TIME laid off of the
pace along the inside, but checked entering the far turn, trailed soon after, then steadied along the inside in upper stretch. DAI VERNON was slow into
stride and trailed early on, moved out of last in the three path around the far turn, but floated to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor.

Footnotes
SUMMERTIME ROSE bumped an outer rival at the fifteen sixteenths pole, opened up a wide margin down the backstretch, came back to the field around
the far turn, met an outer challenge entering the lane and held sway. PADDY GAL took contact from an inner rival passing the fifteen sixteenths pole,
pursued from midpack along the inside, was roused for gain leaving the three furlong pole, took aim outside of the leader nearing the lane, offered a bid
entering it, but was turned away in upper stretch and fended off thereafter. CATHERINE BLAZE was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the fifteen
sixteenths pole causing her to steady, settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the six path entering the lane and ran on to gain show late. TRUISM
chased the run-away leader from the two path, crept closer around the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival while floated three wide nearing the lane,
yielded thereafter and lost show late. MIKITA shied from the inner railing leaving the mile chute, then failed to factor from the three path. AUTISM
COMMUNITY broke outwardly, pursued three wide, but weakened turning for home before being floated to the seven path entering the lane. MALIBU
SMART bobbled outwardly at the start, lacked speed in the four path, but was through at the five furlong pole, eased while detaching from the rest around
the far turn, got pulled up in upper stretch before being escorted back to her handlers by an out-rider and walked off.

Footnotes
GROUP EIGHTEEN set the pace inside of a prompting foe, disposed of that one while meeting another outer challenge at the quarter pole, yet repelled that
bid in upper stretch and kicked away. MASTER GAME steadied after getting rank between horses around the first turn, trailed, launched a rally inside of
rivals at the three furlong pole, swung four wide while gaining on the top trio turning for home, but leveled off while failing to keep pace with the clearing
leader in upper stretch and gained place at the sixteenth pole. JAY VEE BEE tracked along the inside, ranged up outside of the leading pair around the far
turn to offer a bid at the quarter pole, but was turned away in upper stretch, yielded to the clearing leader and lost place to an outer rival at the sixteenth
pole. LONGSHADOW prompted the pace two wide, pressed in earnest down the backstretch, then between horses around the far turn, but gave way
passing the quarter pole. CIRCLE BACK JACK stumbled at the start, laid off of the pace in the five to three path around the first turn and failed to factor
while hanging on his left lead. BERNIE LOMAX pressed three wide early on, but failed to sustain pressure entering the backstretch, began to falter with
eleven sixteenths to go and steadily weakened thereafter.

LINGUISTIC stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair to take aim from between horses in upper stretch, bid at the sixteenth pole along
with an outer rival, led soon after and held firm. LAURA'S CHARM laid off of the pace in the two to three path, fanned five wide entering the lane, sustained
a grinding charge to bid outside of the new leading inside the sixteenth pole, but was kept at bay. AMERICAN STARLET dueled for the lead inside of a rival,
shook free of that one in upper stretch, but was bested by an outer pair at the sixteenth pole. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE raced forwardly two wide, floated four
wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by rivals on either side coming to midstretch and chased thereafter. FROZEN SOLID broke a touch outwardly,
dueled for the lead two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart in upper stretch and yielded between horses at the furlong grounds.
ABOUKIR BAY made little impact two wide. FANNIE AND FREDDIE broke a step slow while last away, saved ground towards the rear, but to no avail.
ALTERED SHOT tracked three wide but weakened in the four path around the turn. ALARM CLOCK pursued from midpack four wide and faded in the five
path around the turn.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA READY vied for the lead two wide, led around the far turn and drew off entering the lane. ROMAN CENTURIAN broke slowly, lacked speed in
the three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on to gain place late. BOURBON HEIST tracked in the two path, then in the five path
and outside of the leaders around the far turn, inched closer to gain place entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the leader while hanging on his left
lead in upper stretch, and lost that position to an outer foe in the final sixteenth. COMMANDPERFORMANCE pursued from midpack along the inside,
surpassed an inner weakening rival nearing the lane and chased along the fence thereafter. ICARUS trailed in the two path, shifted out to the four to five
path entering the lane and moved up. GILDED AGE laid far back along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch and failed to factor. MAJOR FED stalked
four wide and outside of foes, gained place leaving the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an outer rival for that position entering the lane and
weakened between horses. KING OTTOMAN stalked three wide and between horses, chased between horses into the far turn, but faded turning for home.
BRIGADIER GENERAL set the pace inside of the eventual winner, but was headed entering the far turn and folded through the lane. COASTAL DEFENSE
broke outwardly while off slow, laid off of the pace in the five to four path and weakened while floated to the seven path entering the lane.

Footnotes
BERRETTINI pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted outside of the top trio entering the lane to offer a bid at the furlong grounds, then
edged ahead while shifting out. ORBI ONE leaned out at the start, pressed two wide and between horses, sparred with those rivals around the far turn, but
drifted out in the final furlong while being bested by his outer counterpart. ROYAL SALUTE broke slowly while leaning in, trailed along the inside, then two
wide around the far turn, fanned to the five path in upper stretch and ran on well while hanging on his left lead. ATLANTIC DANCER was slow into stride,
settled off of the pace two wide, then between horses around the far turn, tipped to the four path in upper stretch and stayed on while shifting in. SIX
MISSIONS set the pace along the inside, dueled with an outer pair around the far turn, sparred gamely through midstretch, but weakened in the final
sixteenth. BRAGGADOCIOUS laid off of the pace along the inside, awaited racing room turning for home, split foes two wide in midstretch and ran on mildly
while under light urging. CURLINS INCHARGE tracked four wide but gave way around the far turn. ST. NEOTS stalked three wide, vied around the far turn
but weakened between horses in upper stretch. UNWRAPPED was keen to place early on while achieving an inside tracking position, but only managed to
chase around the far turn before fading. CALL ME CASSIUS made little impact from the four to five path.
