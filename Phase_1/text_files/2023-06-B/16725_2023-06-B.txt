Footnotes
HIGH HEATER saved ground through the turns when never far back, guided into the three path for the drive, gained the lead inside the sixteenth pole and
held. ENGLISH CHALLENGE was in the three or four path through the far turn, swung into the lane from the five or six path and rallied from mid-track to just
miss. CASANOVA KITTEN stalked the pace from the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane two wide, gained a clear lead with an eighth to go then
yielded late. GREY STREAK was along the inside early, moved in the lane from the four path, angled in to the two path and was gaining to the end. MAJOR
SPARKS trailed for three-quarter, angled into the five path for the drive and gained belatedly from mid-track. NEPAL UP never a factor while saving ground.
ENGLISH TIDE set the pace while near the inside through the turn then gave way. PADDY'S HOUSE raced in the three path while in mid-pack, came into
the lane four wide and tired. BARRISTER TOM chased the pace from the three path, moved three wide through the turn when not far back then was empty
into the lane.

Footnotes
OH POLLYANNA saved ground through the far turn when not far back, guided into the three path into the lane then finished with good energy to clear late.
FLURR was unhurried while near the inside, gained momentum in late turn, angled into the five path for the drive and finished willingly to be second best.
MADRE DI GRANDEZZA was in the two path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, had aim on the top ones with an eighth to go but lacked
the needed response. MISS BRIGHTSIDE pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, bid into the lane, gained a clear lead with an
eighth to go and weakened late. BELLA MORNING raced in the four path through the far turn when near the back, came into the lane from the seven path
and moved up a spot while never a threat. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART trailed into the far turn while near the rail, came off the rail through late turn, came
into the lane from the five path and passed tired ones. BLUE BLUE BAYOU chased the pace along the inside into the far turn, was asked for more near the
three-eighths pole then tired through the lane. DARTIGA set the pace along the inside through mid-turn then was done entering the lane. GET STORM
AWAY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn then faded. LADYONTHEHILL not far behind while off the inside into the far turn, was asked for
more after mid-turn and was suddenly done.

Footnotes
ADMIRAL RETURNS was well back early while unhurried, began moving closer into the far turn while coming off the inside, bid four wide in late turn while
continuing to gain momentum, swung in the lane from the five or six path then swept past. VERSATILE was in the three path through the far turn when near
the back, continued in the three path entering the lane, guided to the five path and finished with good energy. TIZ A BEAST chased the pace from the three
path through the far turn, was asked for more approaching the quarter pole, moved closest to the leader into the lane then was no match for the top two.
SHAZIER trailed into the far turn, angled into the eight path and moved up while not a threat. FIERCE ASSAULT saved ground into the lane, was asked for
more into the lane then weakened late. MAMBA FOREVER raced three wide through the far turn when a contender, came into the lane from the four path
and weakened. PLAIN OR PEANUT set the pace along the inside then gave way entering the lane. PONTI PRIDE saved ground into the lane and tired.
EVEN MONEY never a factor while off the inside. MOON MISCHIEF pressed the pace two wide through the far turn then was empty through the lane.

never far back and gained the show spot late. RIGHTEOUS FREEDOM stalked the pace in the three path, then faded in the stretch. RAMSEY bumped a
foe at the start, then improved position late. CAMBIASO passed tired rivals. BOOGIE BODE stalked the pace in the three path, then faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHANISA was off to an alert start to gain the lead at once, cleared well before the first call, continued clear under a snug hold, widened into the lane, was
roused three times inside the eighth pole and extended the end. CHROME RACER was along the inside through the turn, came off the inside into the lane,
was under a strong drive late and just got up for the place spot while in the three path. SUPER CHRISTIE chased the pace while in the three path through
the turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the leader then weakened late and lost the place spot. PREEMPT saved ground through the turn
and into the lane when never far back, raced in the two path through the final eighth and was outfinished for the place and show spot. HONORABLE
WOMAN was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and proved to not be a threat. GRAY VIXEN stumbled badly at
the start, raced near the back while in the two path , came into the lane from the three path and never was a factor. AIRFORCE ANNIE chased the pace
from the four path into the turn then steadily faded.

ME AND CHILI stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole and went clear late under steady urging. ROTARY DIAL stalked the pace in the
three path, shifted four wide in early stretch, bid but couldn't get to the winner. TURBO SIX O bobbled the start, led inside, then yielded late. JEOPARDY
THEORY stalked the pace four wide, then had no late bid. SCOTTY'S ON EDGE was off awkwardly and then faded. ZOLO stalked the pace inside for a half
mile before giving way. FIRING RANGE pressed the early pace in the three pace, then faded between foes.
