BOOTSIE'S GALAXY chased the pace while three wide down the first quarter, was moving up on the turn to challenge for the lead with inner rivals, was
menacing gamely down the lane and was up at the wire to prove best. GOOD SCOUT dueled for the lead with an inner rival down the stretch and into the
turn, then battled between rivals down the early stretch, continued to dig in grudgingly but hung in the end. PUNCH EM dueled for the lead from the inside
into the turn, then vied with outer rivals heading into the stretch, menaced gamely but hung in the end and was best for show. SWEET RIVER BAINES
chased the pace from the inside, then bid on the turn to rally in late stretch but it was too little too late. IMA BLING CAT chased the pace while two wide,
then moved up to vie for the lead leaving the turn and into the stretch, was used up and gave way late. PALATIAL TIMES raced behind the field then bid
from the inside on the turn came out six wide in the stretch and was no threat.

Footnotes
GOLD BARON broke alertly to duel on the lead from two wide with the runner-up, pulled clear in upper stretch while still in hand and drew off as much best.
PANDEMIC CAT pressed the pace from the fence through the turn, failed to match strides with the winner in the lane but kept on gamely to be second best.
OFF TO THE RACES stalked the leaders from three wide in the turn in striking distance and failed to close ground on those two while clearly the best of the
rest. MR. VALENTINO broke outward bumping rival leaving the gate, chased in mid-pack and remained one-paced. RAH ORPHANA raced up close early in
the second flight and flattened out in the stretch. SHAMEFUL ALLIANCE bumped leaving the gate impeding his start, dropped off the pace and went evenly
as no threat. LEVY BILL crowded at the start to drop back to trail the field and was never a factor.

in the end. DARYLSLITTLEDIABLO lunged at the start, then raced behind the pack, was in a steady drive throughout the bend then rallied in the stretch but

BENDELENE pressed the pace from two wide, moved up leaving the quarter pole to engage the leader, dueled through the stretch with that one and inched
clear late in a determined drive. MY GOLDEN BLING broke sharply to take command from the gate, set a pressured pace through the turn, responded when
challenged by the winner and battled that one to the wire in a game effort. MAINLINE stalked the pace from the rail saving ground, angled out for the drive
but could not close the gap on the top two. LA MORENA tracked the leaders from a striking position, rallied wide into the lane and lacked a closing
response. RANEEM went evenly never posing a threat. STORMIEIS BLUE trailed the entire way as a non-factor.

Footnotes
ONTHESTAGE saved ground throughout the first half, was gaining steadily on the far turn from the three path then drew off in the stretch and held sway to
prove best. MANO DURA chased the pace while three wide, was steadily gaining on the far turn to battle for the lead while heading into the stretch, gained
the place position but could not catch the leader in the end. GAMETIME GLADIATOR stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the
far turn to rally in the stretch but came up evenly. FAST TRAFFIC chased the pace from the inside, then made a mild bid on the far turn then flattened out in
the stretch. OLE CRAZY BONE stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn to vie for the lead between rivals
then gave way in the stretch. CABALLO FELIZ chased the pace while two wide, was urging on the far turn then flattened in the stretch and needed more.
EXCAPING THE BLUES set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive heading into the far turn then faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
MY BUDDY MEL tracked the leaders from the fence through the turn, waited patiently for racing room, split horses turning for home, was set to a drive
battling the runner-up down the lane and prevailed in the final strides. SPRINKLE TAP broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, was under constant
pressure on the lead, shook off the pressers and responded when challenged by the winner and dueled with that one to the wire in a game effort.
UBSINGINTHEBLUES pressed the pace from between horses through the turn, could not keep pace with the top two but kept on to hold the show.
BUBBA'S RECKLESS tracked the leaders from five wide down the backside, rallied in the turn wide to threaten and lacked a closing response. OZZIES
WINGS Y G raced prominently three wide through the turn prompting the pace and faded in the lane. CASINO MO raced mid-pack along the rail and never
picked up his tempo, finishing one paced. TIME BEAN passed tiring rivals in the stretch having never been a threat. GLORY OF THE CROSS went evenly
as a non-factor. TIGER MAN MCKOOL reared leaving the gate to be last away, rushed up down the backside and tired.

Footnotes
POWER TO PLAY stalked the pace down the backside, rallied four wide in the turn to engage the leader in upper stretch, dueled with that one to deep in
the drive and pulled away late. DAPHNE'S FIRE ranged up three wide to duel on the lead, shook off the presser turning for home, responded to the new
challenge of the winner gamely but could not hold that one off late in the lane and was a clear second best in a game effort. RUN FOR MRS RIGGS
pressed the pace from between horses to the quarter pole and kept on down the stretch to hold the show. MAYWON rated in mid-pack off the pace and
failed to respond when called upon. HELLO MARYLOU stumbled badly leaving the gate to break in a tangle, recovered stride and made a steady gain on
the back of the field having lost all chance at the start. IT'S STORMY went evenly as no threat. IZEADISTORTEDLADY flashed brief speed to lead for the
first quarter and was through after three-eighths of a mile.

ATRAS stalked the leaders from three wide, rallied in the turn to take the lead turning for home and drew clear down the lane convincingly. OCELOT
reserved off the early pace down the backside, swept up four wide through the turn when put to an early drive and finished well. MISTER CHAIRMAN
pressed the pace from between horses to the head of the lane and finished willingly. PUTMAN raced in mid-pack well within striking distance to the quarter
pole and failed to gain ground in the drive. RIBBONS AND MEDALS ridden up the rail to take a short lead, dueled on the pace for the first half mile and
weakened in mid-stretch. UPTOWNEAGLESLANDED unhurried early on to be near the back of the field, angled out for the drive and showed late interest in
the lane. MORE LIKE IT trailed most of the way and never threatened. CLEAT flashed brief speed and gradually faded to the rear of the field.
