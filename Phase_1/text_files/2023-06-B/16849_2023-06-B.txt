Footnotes
RAISE THE PRAISE off a step slow, fell further back to lag early, continued well back despite coming under a right handed crop through much of the turn,
came widest for the drive, closed with a rush to be up in time. HIGH ARABIAN back off the pace in the two path, crept closer along the inside upper
stretch,moved out, split foes a sixteenth out, finished willingly but was no match for the winner. CANT ATTACK ARCH pressed the issue early, chased the
clear leader through the turn, remained closest to that one past the furlong marker, mild bid three wide late, could not match the top two in the waning
strides. FUNKYLITTLESHACK broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch off the inside, shook clear through the turn, continued to hold a daylight
advantage past the midstretch point after some glib early fractions, caved in late. MISSHEARTBREAKER flashed early foot in the first flight along the inside,
fell back into the turn, continued to save ground turn, went evenly through the lane. CRYPTO BRAVE back off the pace, moved out, four wide into the
stretch, failed to muster a rally. CUSTOMIZED TWIN flashed early foot between foes, gave way late in the turn.

Footnotes
BARRANCA broke on top, cleared the opening furlong, continued to show the way through the turn under light restraint, drew off steadily under token
encouragement to win ridden out. ROARING QUINN in mid pack in the run up the backstretch off the inside, two path turn, proved no match for the winner
the final furlong, edged clear for the place. SHO NUFF chased the winner while racing outside, could do little with that rival through the lane, outkicked for
the place, comfortably saved show. FINISHWHATUSTARTED behind the pace and inside the runner up, checked up in apparent tight quarters late in the
turn, went evenly through the stretch after recovering. BYE BYE BIG BABY last away, remained always back while racing outside. ROADSIDE GIRL fell
back to trail after the start and was never a factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
FINISHWHATUSTARTED AGAINST THE RUNNER UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO
STAND.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S HARVEST away in good order from the inside, showed the way out of the chute, set a moderate set of early fractions while rating, picked up the
tempo into the far turn, slight drift through the lane, held late to narrowly prevail. GLUCKSTADT closest to the winner, continued to pursue that one into the
straight, crept a bit closer past the furlong marker, saw that progress stall then was coming again late to just miss. BOURBON DAY lacked early foot,
advanced off the inside to be closest to the top two upper straight, dove inside late, closed the gap late. TARAASHOQ void of speed for over six furlongs,
displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position. ZAICI settled behind the pace,had little left for the drive. RUN ON ACES also retreated
through the stretch.

Footnotes
SMOOTH COLLIERY fell back after the start, began to advance three then four wide late in the turn, challenged outside of the lead pack when straightened
for home, kicked well clear under steady handling. LT. BONURA lacked early foot, floated out five wide by the winner turning for home, late run to finish
willingly and earn the place. BUNKIE'S SONG in the second flight while off the inside, came three wide for the drive, set down, late bid for the place
between foes, not enough. DAAHERS BULLY forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, challenged three wide late in the turn, weakened the final
furlong. CURTIN'S UP sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way into the turn, vied closest to the inside into the lane then gave way when headed.
PRAY IDE SING chased the early leader, advanced and vied between horses late in the turn, weakened stretch. MOVE IT last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TWOFEXUSNEXUS broke alertly, showed the way early, joined by the runner up before a furlong, dueled outside that one into and through the turn,
continued to battle through the lane, joined by a third foe from the outside, proved best in game fashion between those foes. ANGELIC KNIGHT moved up
after the start to duel inside the winner, continued on equal terms with that one, held a narrow advantage in mid stretch, proved stubborn to the end.
APRIORITY AVENGER in the second flight outside, slowly advanced and reached a striking position outside the top two by the furlong marker, late bid, not
enough. RED IDOL in the second flight toward the inside, lost contact with the top three when straightened for home, finished up evenly. WHISKEY RED
lacked early foot, improved four wide through the turn, flattened out through the stretch. MECKES PRIORITY fell back to trail after the start, five wide out of
the turn, passed some tiring rivals well after the outcome had been decided. SAMURAI'S GRANDSON off a step slow, remained back. ALL COUNTRY in
mid pack for three furlongs, backed up through the lane. VERDUNVILLE tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
GOTMY MO JO WORKIN took command after the start, clear before a quarter, all the pace, drew out through the lane under steady handling. VIKING
LEGACY void of early foot after being last away, saved some ground into the lane, steered out nearing midstretch, closed with a rush to be up for the
second spot at the wire. GOLDENLUTE in mid pack early, some traffic into the turn, angled out to be five wide into the stretch, took over the second spot
with less than a furlong remaining, caught by the runner up in the final jump. DIAL UNCLE JOEY chased the winner off the inside, proved no match for that
one in the drive, faltered final furlong to lost a couple of positions. FIELD OF VISION went one paced throughout while saving ground. SMOOTH RIVER
raced off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally through the lane. MEET KEVIN remained always back in failing to threaten.
LITTLE PUCK forwardly placed for three furlongs, gave way three wide into the lane, vanned off.

Footnotes
CAJUN AMI brushed at the start to be last away, continued to trail early, advanced four wide through the turn, widest for the drive, finished full of run to be
up in time. GOT ME A CHRYSLER behind the leaders toward the inside, patiently handled through the turn while continuing behind the first flight, split foes
to challenge and lead late, nailed in the final strides. HAWAIIAN ARGUMENT within striking distance well out in the strip, challenged three wide late in the
turn, showed the way past the furlong marker but could not last. CATCH ME T lacked speed off the rail, three wide for the drive, improved position a bit
without posing a serious threat. SHAWN'S SOLVING in a bit tight at the start, moved up to set the pace, faltered when headed. PAL'S ALARM broke on top,
relinquished the advantage, chased the leader into the turn, bid between horses, gave way in the drive. HEZA SEXY ZONG forwardly placed early, faded
inside. REACH FOR THE ACES finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
ROSE PALACE away in good order, pressed the leader out of the chute to that one's outside, continued to prompt the issue through the turn, challenged
three path into the lane, took over, quickly drove clear. DIANNA'S JET broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, continued set the pace into and
through the turn while in the two path, offered but brief resistance to the winner when that one took over in upper stretch, proved no match, saved the place.
LADY DREAMER settled off the pace and the inside, three wide exiting the turn, slow but steady gain on the runner up late. SHE A HOT MESS moved
inside backstretch, saved ground turn, evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. SHELLI'S ANGEL failed to menace while racing four wide through
the turn. BROKEN PROPOSAL finished early, trailed home to be well beaten.

Footnotes
DIXIE FARMER broke in and a step slow, lacked speed in trailing, steered out to be four wide late in the turn, split foes nearing the furlong marker, kicked
strongly clear. TDZ WHAT A DEAL away well, pressed the issue four wide turn, five wide into the stretch, challenged while widest and outside the winner
with a furlong to run, could not match strides with that one to the wire, clear for the place. TDZ CORRIENDA STAR back off the pace, raced three wide into
the stretch, rallied mildly through traffic, up late for the show. NON BINDING broke back, lacked speed, moved closer turning for home, bid a furlong out,
faltered in the late going. APRIORITY GIRL broke on top, vied up front three wide, held a small advantage in the turn, weakened through the stretch.
DRIFTING MELODIES moved up to vie up front along the inside, continued to battle through the lane, backed up steadily through the stretch. ALL
AMERICAN PAT was never involved. ASTRO FLASH flashed brief speed between foes and gave way after three furlongs.
