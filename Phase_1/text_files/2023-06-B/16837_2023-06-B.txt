GUEST CHECK went to the front to set all the pace, was headed at the quarter pole and matched strides with outside rival down the stretch but was
determined and won the nod. I'M A COOL CAT floated out on the first turn then was under wraps to the five and a half maker then moved between horses
at the five furlong maker to be just off the leader, drifted out slightly at the half marker and brushed outside rival, kept on and engaged the leader at the
quarter pole and matched strides in the stretch but was denied the win. GRIFTER was off the pace around the first turn then was brushed at the half maker
when inside rival moved out slightly but was no match for the top two. ABRIERWIN saved ground to no avail. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE
JOCKEY OF GRIFTER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF I'M A COOL CAT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE HALF MILE POLE,
AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED, AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

NO LIMITATION raced near the back in the early stages then made a three wide bid at the half pole to vie for the lead around the turn and engaged the
leader at the quarter pole, matched strides down the stretch and clear in the final jump. DIVINE TASK set the pace for the first half then was collared at the
quarter pole, dueled down the stretch and gave way grudgingly but was a clear second. OH SNAP had no speed through the turn then made a mid track
rally to be up for the show. ROUGE SUNSET was of the pace down the backstretch then faded on the turn but was no a threat. BARLOWS PRIDE tracked
the leaders down the backstretch from the three path then saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid in early stretch but hung.

CHAMPS SUCCESS was forwardly placed down the backstretch on the inside, fell back on the turn but moved out to two wide at the top of the stretch to
make a late rally, was brushed in the final yards but kept on to draw clear. TOO LATE went to a clear lead to mid stretch then drifted out, brushed outside
closer in the final yards and was outkicked. KEENEYE GEORGE was off the pace down the backstretch, raced evenly but was a clear third. ORDER OF
THE DAY was not a factor. CLAIMJUMPER was not a threat.

COCKTAIL SLIPPERS was rushed to a clear lead, challenged at the five sixteenths pole for a furlong then dug back in and drew off to prove best.
MISFIRED had no early speed then moved between horses at the half pole and kept on, angled out at the three sixteenths to make a late run but was no
match for the winner. CAJUN TRINITY sprinted away to be off the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leader at the five sixteenths for a furlong but
weakened. CREES VALENTYME saved ground but failed to menace. BRING THE POSSE raced near the back and passed tired one but was never a
threat. AMY D tracked the leaders from three wide and retreated. ISLAND BEAUTY was pulled up and vanned off.

PRINCESS JAYLEEN tracked the leaders on the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the turn and engaged the leader entering the stretch,
matched strides to deep stretch and drew clear in the final yards. DAHLIA'S DANCER sprinted to a clear lead to mid turn then was engaged at the top of the
stretch, battled to the final yards and gave way grudgingly. LOTTA PRADA prompted the early pace, fell back on the turn then made a three wide late run in
the stretch to be up for the show. KNIGHT EYES was off the pace but failed to menace. EXPECT THE BOSS was always back. YA THINK was close up to
the turn and retreated.
