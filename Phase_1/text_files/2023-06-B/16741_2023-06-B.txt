Footnotes
WINE ON TAP chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, gained to take the lead into upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong
marker and proved much the best under steady urging. ILIKEFUNSIZE bumped soundly with a foe while last to commence, dropped back quickly under
urging then fell further back into the turn, went around that bend in the two path while well behind the rest of the field, picked up stride while three wide into
the stretch then angled out around the three-sixteenths, gained with good courage in the final furlong and finished well to garner the place. DEVIL AT
MIDNIGHT broke awkwardly but with the field, went to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead to the winner into upper stretch, fought inside
that foe into the final furlong and weakened then was caught for the place while able to get the show. LOOKS FIRST was hustled from the gate then urged
along on the outside, went around the turn in the four path and lacked the needed response. JUST THE OAKS bumped soundly with an opponent at the
start, was ridden along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
FOR THE FLAG away well and to the front, showed the way rated along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in holding well and safe to the finish. VERONICA GREENE chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. PLEASANT PASSAGE stumbled at the start and was
bumped by I'M BUZZY, who broke outwards, chased along the inside before tipping briefly to the two path nine-sixteenths from home, tucked back inside
before tipping back to the two path at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure
the show honors. CUPID'S STRIKE tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. I'M BUZZY broke out at the start bumping PLEASANT PASSAGE, chased two to three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BRENNAN'S WAR three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong from home, edged clear under a drive to prevail. TIE BREAKER broke in at the start bumping ACADEMY CHOICE in tandem with WAFLR, chased
just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors.
ACADEMY CHOICE got bumped between foes who each broke his way, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. VAUNTED showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from FORTY
ONE TALES to the outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared a furlong out, kept on clear of the rest for the last major share. WAFLR broke out at the start bumping ACADEMY CHOICE, chased
along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. THATSMYBOXER broke in
at the start brushing SUBVERSIVE, chased just off the inside, tucked inside near the three-eighths forcing RENT CONTROL to be taken up briefly nearing
that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no kick. IMPULSIVE SPENDING three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch hand offered no response. SUBVERSIVE got brushed at the start by THATSMYBOXER, chased three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. RENT CONTROL broke out at the start and was corrected,
chased along the inside, got checked briefly along the rail when THATSMYBOXER drifted in nearing the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and
tired. FORTY ONE TALES coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and tired. A LISTER chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch, tired. MILAGROSO crossed to chase
just off the inside down the backstretch, tipped out four wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
RAMBLIN' WRECK broke out and bumped the hindquarters of a foe while last away then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths while slow into stride
due to the trouble, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and
closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth and prevail. TWENTY SIX BLACK was rated under a snug hold on the outside, went four wide on the turn,
was asked with three furlongs to run, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole, took a short lead inside the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final
sixteenth then was overtaken while able to get the place. ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, prompted the pace on the
outside, drew even with the leader in the three path on the turn, was asked while taking a short lead at the quarter-pole, battled inside of the runner-up
under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. VACATION DANCE was rated between foes, drafted in the two path on
the turn, was given his cue in the four path into the stretch, pursued the leaders under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. GEM MINT
TEN settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, spun three wide at the quarter-pole then moved a bit further out, raced behind a foe under some
urging in upper stretch, was driven into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. THETHRILLOFVICTORY was reserved towards the rear of field,
came under urging in the three path on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. VINCE THE PRINCE was
hustled from the gate then well placed while rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came off the inside while dropping back
into upper stretch and capitulated. TEN CENT TOWN went to the front, showed the way while in hand, was asked in the two path on the turn, lost the
advantage near the quarter-pole and gave way.

LUCKY LUCKY LUKE coaxed from the gate, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced on the front taking over
command swinging four then three wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. GLOBALIZATION prompted the pace five paths off the inside
down the backstretch before advancing tucked three wide into the turn to press the leader, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top
one while running on safe for the place honors. STEADY PROGRESS coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide, tucked inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors narrowly over a late charging rival. OLD
POINT got bumped at the start by SHARPOON, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly to just miss for the show honors. SIXWILLBERICH showed the way in hand three paths off the inside under some pressure to the
outside, tucked to the two path and came under increased pressure from GLOBALIZATION through the turn getting placed to coxing at the five-sixteenths in
response, spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from command by the eventual winner, then kept on under a drive but was outfinished in the
late stages. UNION TAP six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. SHARPOON broke out at the start bumping OLD POINT, chased four then three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and folded. MISTER MOORE lost his hind footing at the start stumbling
awkwardly, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch in retreat and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
STELLA MARS tossed her head while taken under restraint early, dropped to the two path on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, moved closer in
the two path on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, steadied while blocked at the three-sixteenths, altered in for room outside the furlong marker,
rallied inside of the leader in the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up in the final strides. MORE MANGO saved ground on the first turn, was rated in
the second flight, moved closer leaving the backstretch, made a bid while three then two wide on the far turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, shook
clear into upper stretch, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught nearing the finish while able to get the place. HOME FOR
CHRISTMAS veered out at the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved closer between foes leaving the
backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn, chased the runner-up under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the show. SYNONYMOUS
settled on the inside, dropped back a bit while behind a tiring foe coming to the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. REDZILLA went to the front while in the four to five path on the first turn, bobbled inside the seven-eighths pole, opened up a sizable advantage,
shortened stride while dropping from the two path to the rail on the far turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths and tired. JUST A NYQUIST had the rider lose
his right iron at the start, checked near the inside while the rider tried to regain the iron on the first turn, had the rider get his foot back in the iron late on the
backstretch, lagged at the rear, went three then four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. RACING COLORS traveled around the opening bend in the
two path, was rated outside in the second flight, moved closer leaving the backstretch, was asked in the four path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch
and came up empty. CROWDING OUT reared at the start and was off slow, went four wide under a tight hold on the first turn, was reserved on the outside,
moved closer leaving the backstretch, drafted three wide early on the far turn then shifted five wide, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to
respond.

narrowly prevailed. HOOEY bumped lightly with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, rallied to get the lead into upper stretch,

inside on the turn, waited while blocked into upper stretch, was asked briefly near the three-sixteenths but was still blocked, bumped the hindquarters of
