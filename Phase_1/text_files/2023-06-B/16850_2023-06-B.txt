BUREAU vied for the early lead from between rivals, gradually angled in approaching the end of two furlongs, had the rail on the bend, battled through the
lane, edged ahead under urging inside the last eighth then held TRUIST back under a hand ride. TRUIST broke alertly, was challenged from both sides after
a furlong, fought gamely two wide in the stretch but had to settle for second best. ON THE MONEY RED overcame a step slow start to dispute the pace
from outside, was three wide through the bend, lacked the extra needed the last three-sixteenths but proved easily best of the others. U S HONOUR NAP in
contention from inside, angled out nearing the quarter pole, came into the lane from path four and flattened out. I'M YOUR VALENTINE was in hand behind
traffic shortly after leaving the chute, did not keep up two wide on the turn, swung out widest for the drive and had little to offer.

Footnotes
GREAT PLAINES took the lead into the first bend, showed the way just off the rail in hand, was let out on the second turn, put to urging with two furlongs to
go, widened command under urging in the lane and proved much the best while kept to task to the wire. OKLAHOMA HEAT was settled early running
widest, picked up his pace after a half mile, stayed in path three through the second bend, took over second inside the last eighth and gradually opened up
on the rest. ARGYBARGY BUCK settled just off the inside, commenced his bid into the stretch, altered out four wide inside the final furlong and caught
COPPER CROSSING for third in the waning yards. COPPER CROSSING chased from path three, moved clear for second just off the rail on the second
turn but could not sustain his bid in the stretch. I CAN'T TELL YA was a contender from inside for a half mile then steadily yielded along the rail.
INDEFENSIBLE chased from inside or just off the rail and showed little.

MINI DRESS in contention early just off the inside, waited for room on the bend, squeezed through three wide between rivals leaving the turn and moved
clear inside the last furlong. WARM BEAUTY broke somewhat slowly, trailed, staying well off the inside, commenced her bid while widest through the turn,
moved clear for second inside the final eighth but could only make up minor ground on the leader in the waning yards. LORI ATTACK pressed the early
pace, was three wide on the bend, was forced out and steadied leaving the turn, lacked a significant late bid but edged ahead for third. AMARI S. was
hustled to contest the pace between horses, did not keep up two wide on the bend, floated out some leaving the turn, bumped LORI ATTACK and continued
to gradually yield. VIVA VIOLENCE vied for the early lead from inside, moved ahead on the turn, floated out some leaving the turn and began to wear down.
SENORITA AURORA hesitated and made a leap from the gate, came into contention along the rail on the bend but flattened out the last furlong. The rider
of LORI ATTACK lodged an objection alleging interference from MINI DRESS leaving the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of
foul

Footnotes
AWESOME WILLY was sent to the lead, angled in entering the first bend, allowed to relax on the backstretch, let out some on the second turn, put to urging
entering the lane, steadily opened up on the rest and was kept to task until the final forty yards. TWO COOKIE RULE broke a bit inward, advanced two wide
to vie for the lead midway on the backstretch, did not stay with AWESOME WILLYT on the second bend, was no match for the latter when set down for the
drive but was unchallenged for second. SUPER SILVER bumped at the break, was settled outside, picked up his pace after a half mile, progressed along
the rail on the second turn, swung out three wide into the lane, drifted out as he moved clear for third upper stretch, was corrected with a furlong left and
finished evenly. LASTFORTINOFAMILY a step slow at the start, was sent up between rivals, did not stay close through the first bend and only improved
position slightly while just off the inside in the stretch. MEMORY BANK angled in some when crowded by TWO COOKIE RULE at the start, bumped SUPER
SILVER, was settled and soon far back of the rest and only passed outside tired ones in the lane. READTHETRANSCRIPT was checked briefly when
AWESOME WILLY took his path into the first turn, pressed the latter from outside for a half mile then steadily faded. CAMARGO was checked behind traffic
into the first bend and steadily gave way from inside once on the backstretch.

Footnotes
D' YANK raced in the second flight between horses on the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide on the bend, angled in some at the quarter pole, was
forced out by TAP'S BIG SHOT a couple times as he battled for the lead in the lane and edged ahead in time. PAPA ROCKET slow and somewhat awkward
at the start, found his stride after the first sixteenth of a mile, angled out to be three wide as he came into contention on the turn, altered in for a clear path
upper stretch, vied for the lead inside the final furlong and was outfinished. TONYS MORNING LINE broke on top, was bumped off stride leaving the chute,
settled outside in the second flight, went for the lead four wide on the bend, was forced out a bit wider a couple times in the stretch, rallied belatedly but
caught TAP'S BIG SHOT for third near the wire. TAP'S BIG SHOT was hustled along to dispute the early pace while just off the inside, moved ahead on the
turn, drifted out some upper stretch, was soon challenged from both sides, drifted out again briefly inside the final furlong and did not have enough left in the
waning yards. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY chased from well off the inside, lost ground through the bend and also rallied belatedly in the lane. MAC PANDOWDY
forwardly placed inside, gave way the last eighth. FULL MAGAZINE displayed early speed outside TAP'S BIG SHOT, began to yield two wide on the turn,
was checked when D' YANK took his path at the quarter pole then steadily gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry into PAPA ROCKET'S start and an
objection lodged by the rider of FULL MAGAZINE alleging interference from D' YANK at the quarter pole. After their review, there was no action taken by the
stewards regarding either incident.

Footnotes
STUMP stalked the early speed from outside, was roused three wide on the bend, took over upper stretch then steadily lengthened command under urging
the final furlong. PEACOCK MAN void of early speed, though urged along, was just off the inside on the turn, swung out to path five at the top of the lane,
lodged his bid and got up for second in the waning yards. JOEY B was well back early, commenced his bid along the rail on the bend, fanned three wide
into the stretch and passed between weakening rivals to gain third late. MY LITTLE TIPSY vied for the lead outside R H SMOAKEM on the backstretch,
moved ahead on the turn, could not stay with STUMP in the stretch and gradually wore down inside the last eighth. CRAPS SHOOTER contested the early
pace from inside, retreated after two furlongs, angled out four wide upper stretch and failed to have a late bid. R H SMOAKEM displayed early speed
between foes, gained the rail on the bend and flattened out the last two furlongs. SOME DUDE hesitated then made a slight leap from the gate and showed
little.
