Footnotes
BREW CASA tracked the pace in early stages, edged up closer two to three wide around the turn, hustled along four wide into the lane, inched up to a slim
lead a furlong out then kicked clear. GLAMOROUS LIFE was never too far back while saving ground off the early leaders, rode the rail around the turn,
hustled along two wide into the lane, briefly vied for the lead with BREW CASA then failed to move on with eventual winner and settled for second best.
JACK'S PARTY GIRL raced near midpack in early stages, drifted wide entering the stretch run, sustained a steady outside bid and gathered a share. TRIP
TO FREEDOM raced just off the early leader and remained up close near the inside around the turn, tipped out four wide entering the lane and steadily
weakened. JAZZ BRUNCH sped to the lead at the start, held firm over pursuers around the turn, coaxed three wide into the lane, got collared in upper
stretch and faded in the final furlong. YANKEE PRIDE raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to respond in the lane.

LEAPIN TY MAN was nicely rated near the inside while too far off the early leaders, tipped out three wide mdi-way around the turn, given cue four wide
heading into the lane, responded willingly, rallied while shifting in a couple paths and swept by while ridden out. PURE CRYSTAL inched up the inside and
dueled for the early lead with FRANKLY EPIC, battled on around the turn, shook free entering the lane, widened to a clear advantage then got outkicked
when the winner swept by in the final sixteenth. UNCLE SINGH tracked the top pair up the backstretch, loomed three wide nearing the quarter pole, could
not kick on for the lead at the head of the lane and evened out in late stages. FLEET OF HOOF raced in range in early stages, chased four wide around the
turn, swung five wide and weakened entering the lane, came in a couple paths and lacked a needed rally. SOLE SURVIVOR lacked speed and raced in the
back, continued unhurried around the turn, saved ground entering the lane and failed to kick on. FRANKLY EPIC vied outside of PURE CRYSTAL up the
backstretch and battled around the turn, could not move on with rival at the head of the lane, ran on briefly then faded leaving the eighth pole.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S RUN was unhurried out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, remained well reserved and trailed the field up the backstretch,
began to pick up the tempo late on the far turn, swung into action five wide entering the lane, rallied along the outside, reached the leader in deep stretch
and edged away. EVIL KNIEVEL raced off the top flight leaving the first turn, tugged a bit and moved up to challenge rivals for the lead midway up the
backstretch, dueled for command around the far turn, took a slim lead near the eighth pole, edged ahead the got overtaken in final stages. CINCO DE MO
held a slim lead around the first turn then taken under slight restraint and edged back to rate off the early pace, saved ground up the backstretch and around
the far turn, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, advanced to race in striking distance mid-stretch then evened out late. I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL
tracked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along four wide around the far turn, continued in range a furlong out but lacked the needed kick for impact.
KOBE'S CAUSE dueled up the backstretch and continued to battle around the far turn, remained in contention into the final furlong then gave way. TALONS
TIME vied for the lead up the backstretch, battled for command around the far turn, continued to race in striking distance a furlong out then came up empty.

Footnotes
BIG HEARTED FACTOR was forwardly placed on the inside around the first turn, continued to save ground and stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, made
a two wide bid leaving the quarter pole, took over the lead turning for home, widened to commanding advantage and kept to task under steady
encouragement. BILLY YANK raced up close around the first turn and remained forwardly placed up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide late on
the far turn, was no match for pulling way winner but ran on and finished clearly second best. GRAZEN IN THE PARK was unhurried out of the gate and
raced three wide around the first turn, continued well reserved and trailed the field, remained well back around the far turn, swung three wide into the lane,
shifted out wider for the drive, surged in final stages and captured show. APOLLO BAY was unhurried and raced well off the early pace, hustled along two
wide around the far turn and failed to rally. MARQUEE THUNDER sped to the lead around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, led the way into
the far turn, got overtaken by the eventual winner turning for home and retreated. BREAK FREE was unhurried, saved ground around the final turn and
failed to move into contention.
