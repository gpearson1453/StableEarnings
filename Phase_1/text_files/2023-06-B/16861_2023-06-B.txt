Footnotes
SUPER INTENSE showed early speed, relaxed and stalked on the outside in the five path, was allowed to moved at the half, willingly gained ground and
passed rivals, was given more head through the turn, he still responded well and happily circled into the lead near the five sixteenth pole, allowed another
competitor to stay beside him into the stretch,, then he drew off as he pleased. CHIEF HARLAN raced off of the pace in the two path, shifted out into the five
path in the upper stretch, was under heavy encouragement and closed willingly, was no match for the winner but was definitely second best today.
TRAFFIC BOSS was off a bit slow, raced four wide, was well off the pace, was in contention at the quarter pole, launched a bid and showed a tremendous
turn of foot, getting up for third. DIESEL FUEL vied for the lead, set the pace, was pressured by outside foes, was challenged and tried to match strides with
the eventual winner but gave way early in the stretch drive. DOCE DE LA NOCHE stalked the early pace, raced four wide, was passed by the eventual
winner entering the turn, tried to match strides with that rival, dropped into the turn establishing position, but tired before the stretch. DEE'S LEGS vied for
the early lead, tried to take advantage of the one post position, raced on the rail while setting the early fractions, the stopped. HE'S TROUBLE showed early
speed, stalked the pace while racing three wide on the inside of another rival, this set was passed on the outside by the eventual winner, when the horse to
his outside tried to g with the eventual winner entering the turn HE'S TROUBLE had to check to make room, then faded after that. SOCIAL APPEAL trailed.,
SOCIAL APPEAL WAS PULLED UP BEFORE THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE AND VANNED OFF.

Footnotes
PINK HIGGINS showed speed early on, raced in the two path between horses, was in control but rated on the front end in company setting the pace, put
away the horse to the inside who co led at the quarter pole, was uncontested and chased until the wire. LOWER CRETACEOUS raced in the three path,
vied for the lead, settled into a staling position, launched a bid at the quarter pole, chased the eventual winner through the stretch, being second best today.
LIT A SHUCK vied for the lead, raced on the rail, chased the first two down the lane and was good enough to take third. SHANKINSTINE stalked the
leaders from the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, gained ground on the outside through the turn, but to no avail. SWIFT N TRAFFIC raced
off of te pace, three wide and made no impact. PERFECT STRIKE was forwardly paced early on in the four path, settled into a stalking position, was kept
close and in contention, was urged and encouraged with a right handed crop, backed out and had no finish late. TOOCAN DANCE trailed through out.

back side and through the turn, was in contention in the stretch and in the four path, shifted out into the six path at the eighth pole and was given the cue,
responded with a big turn of foot and closed with long fluid strides, taking the win easily in the last few jumps. PRINCE COSMO vied for the lead, pressured
the inside leaders for the first set of fractions, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, matched strides and battled for the win with an inside rival, was under
heavy urging into the upper stretch, cleared that rival after the eighth pole, was in command and on the lead, was caught late by a fast closing outside rival
and just missed. MR. TEXAS CHARM raced four wide, followed in the second tier to the outside, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled the field on
the outside, responded well to a left handed crop, was in contention at the eighth pole, struggled to switch his lead, held on for third. EL GABRIELO vied for
the lead from in between horses, helped set the early pace, cleared the inside foe in the turn, hooked an outside challenger and battled though the lane and
into the stretch, then faded after the eighth pole. KISSOFTHENILE raced in the two path and in between horses in the second tier of horses, stalked the
