MATSQUI settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced quickly from along the rail midway down the
backstretch to force the issue from the outside of B C CHRISTIE entering the final turn, and wore that rival down in the final strides to prevail. B C CHRISTIE
broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, assumed command approaching the final turn, was quickly
tackled by MATSQUI entering the turn, and just failed to last following a stretch long battle. C C SUNRISE away alertly and raced to the lead while drifting
two out from the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace into the backstretch, was overtaken nearing the final turn, saved ground through the final turn,
and finished one out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. PETERSON LANDING away well and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the
early pace while racing two wide entering the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response while finishing four
wide in the drive. HIGHER IMAGE settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, trailed the field in the run to the final turn, and
failed to make a late impact.

FINDING WAYS away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, turned
back a challenge from VALUABLE COWBOY through the final turn and into the lane, and held sway late. PARKER POINT unhurried early and trailed the
field into the backstretch while racing out from the rail, rallied smartly from just off the rail entering the final turn, split rivals entering the lane, and closed
determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides. VALUABLE COWBOY away well and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, battled through the final turn and into the stretch from the outside of FINDING WAYS, was unable to match
strides with that rival in the stretch and just failed to miss the place. COUNTRY COWBOY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at
the rail, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide in the drive. BLACK METAL broke sharply and
stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, checked briefly entering the lane,
but failed to make a late impact.

SHAMRA unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush five wide in
the drive to prove best. VIVA LA VINO away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of
BUNNY in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of her pace rival leaving the turn, and finished three wide in the drive.
BUNNY was leaning in the gate prior to the start and got away awkwardly, rushed up to duel two wide entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the
run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the lane, but closed determinedly four wide in the
drive to just miss the place. KAPALUA CANDY was fractious prior to the start, and raced up to stalk the dueling leaders into the backstretch, rallied along
the inside entering the final turn, but had little to offer late while finishing three wide in the drive. QUALITY COMMAND settled off the contested early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid.

commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to prevail. PAY MY WAY settled at the back

smartly three wide through the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and closed willingly through the stretch to just miss. FLORIDA GATOR away
well and dueled for the lead from the outside of SIR BREGOVIC entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival
in the run down the backside and through the final turn, put away his pace rival leaving the turn, but was quickly tackled by AT ATTENTION and PAY MY
WAY, but battled gamely two wide in the drive to just miss. ROOKIE YEAR broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time
while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly just out from the rail through the final turn while awaiting room, and finished evenly three wide in the drive. SIR

Footnotes
DYNAMITER away well and sprinted to a clear lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while holding SOMTHING ELUSIVE safely at bay late to prove best. SOMTHING ELUSIVE settled
off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, pulled himself into a tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied
three wide through the final turn to loom a danger, but needed more late while proving easily second best. MILO'S COMMAND broke sharply and was
allowed to settle off the early pacesetter while racing two wide entering the lane the first time, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly to
garner a share. BE SPARKY unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time, rallied along the inside from the back of the pack entering
the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late charge. WELLSLEY away alertly and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time, struggled to hold his
position in the run down the backside, began to drop back in the run to the final turn, and wasn't persevered with late.
