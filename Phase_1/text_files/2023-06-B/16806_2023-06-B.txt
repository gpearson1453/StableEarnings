Footnotes
TENSAS ALL OURS took command soon the start, rated while setting a pressured pace early, shrugged off nearest pursuer to quickly extended advantage
through the second turn still lightly in hand, not threatened through the stretch to win geared down and ridden out. KAT'S SOLDIER broke back, void of early
foot, began a four wide advance onto the backstretch, chased winner into the stretch, proved no match for that one to the wire, clearly second best. R T'S
IRON MAN last to leave, raced back early, floated out five wide into the lane when making a modest rally, finished up best of the rest. ANGOLA VACATION
raced in the second flight, came up empty for the drive. INDEFENSIBLE TOWN raced back and outside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a
serious threat. GLITTER STORM moved up to press the issue while well wide early, continued outside, lost contact with the winner far turn, gout out to be
four wide into the lane, continued to back up top to the wire. DIXIELAND STORMING away in good order, settled in mid pack for four furlongs then began to
fade.

Footnotes
FIREINTHESTORM broke outward but on top, showed the way up the backstretch, shook off a rival turning for home, larger lead a furlong out, held the
runner up comfortably safe late. AHIMAAZ off a step slow to trail early, came five wide for the drive, rallied willingly down the center of the course to be in
time for the place. TIZ THE BIG ONE sandwiched at the start, lacked speed toward the inside, steered out when straightened for home, staged a mild rally
inside the runner up, was unable to match that rival late while prevailing for the show. HALF MAGIC bumped at the break, one paced early, closest to the
inside while in the second flight turning for home, chased the winner past the furlong marker, went flat late to be caught for the runner up spot. TEXAS
TURBINE in the second flight outside, was four wide into the lane, also lacked a closing kick. MR LIBERTY went one paced to lack a rally. KAHAAL broke
out to bother a couple of outer rivals, chased the winner for three furlongs and gave way. FREEWHEELER forwardly placed early off the inside, bore out
through the turn to fall back, trailed home.

Footnotes
JOEY'S GAME back off the pace while between rivals, asked along in the two path turning for home, split foes when straightened in upper stretch, late
surge to be up in time. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN void of speed while off the inside, was four wide and outside the winner turning into the straight, unable to
keep up with that one late, up for the place in the final strides. OLDER AND WISER also was outrun in the early, made a five wide move to challenge far
turn, showed the way into the stretch, led late, failed to contain the top two. TRADER PRICE broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside, vied midway
on the far turn, began to weaken soon after and continued to gradually give way through the stretch. PAYOFF CYCLE within striking distance off the inside,
challenged four wide and between horses far turn, had little left for the stretch run. CAJUN CONNECTION four wide into the first turn when forwardly placed,
continued to prompt the issue up the backstretch in the three path, brief bid three wide and between horses with three furlongs to run, faltered in the drive.
CARLOS'S MAMA finished early, not a threat. DEMON HUNTER used away from the gate to duel in the two path, stopped second turn, well beaten.

Footnotes
WAITIN' ON A WOMAN settled off the pace while out in the strip, four wide exiting the turn, roused, idled past the furlong marker, late push in the waning
strides to be up in time. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS away in good order, stalked the leaders up the backstretch, advanced and challenged three wide into the
stretch, got out a bit in upper stretch, clear a furlong out, led until very late, nailed final strides. GALAXY BUILDER lacked early foot while racing outside,
four wide out of the turn, continued rally mildly to be well clear of the others, no threat to the top pair. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE broke on top, dueled up front
off the inside, gave way into the stretch. CHARLIE'S TOWN narrowly set the pace for a half along the inside, faltered. HEARTTHROB HALO broke outward
and a bit slow, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. KING MARVIN failed to menace. ZENDELPHIAN staged
a steady retreat and finished far back.

Footnotes
MYSTIC CREED came in slightly just after the start to brush with the runner up, moved up to narrowly set the pace from between foes after the start, dueled
into the turn, shook clear into the stretch and steadily drew away to win ridden out. THISONEISFORYOU brushed slightly just after the start with the winner,
dropped inside, raced in the second flight along the inside up the backstretch and through the turn, proved no match for the winner through the lane, held
sway for the place. EXPECT A DANCER in the second group outside the runner up and between rivals, fell back off that one when straightened for home,
was slowly getting back to that same for late while also no match for the winner. AVIE J lacked speed while four wide into the turn, improved position with
some mild interest in the final furlong. GOLD PLUS prompted the issue early from the three path, began a steady retreat before three furlongs. BANK ON IT
pressed the winner from the outside for three furlongs and gave way. MEAN DREAMER broke with the leaders, fell back to trail before a quarter, always
outrun. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF THE RUNNER UP AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE OUT OF THE GATE
WAS NOT ALLOWED. PER RULING DATED 7/26/23 FRONM THE LOUISIANA STATE RACING COMMISSION (RULING #25401), MYSTIC CREED
WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

BIG MONEY MACHINE with the early pace along the inside, dueled onto the backstretch, held a narrow advantage into the far turn, disposed of that foe
soon after, was joined by the runner up turning into the stretch, headed, regained the advantage a furlong out and was edging away late in a game effort.
MIAS MOONBEAM lacked speed, moved out, advanced four wide into the contention by early in the far turn, engaged the leader late in that bend, put a
head in front,continued on equal terms past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going, fully extended to hold the place. HUMPHREY settled in mid pack
while off the inside, roused three wide into the lane, finished with good energy to be getting to the top two late. TWITTY CITY broke back, lacked speed,
raced four wide when put to pressure turning for home, displayed some mild interest to improve position. TAKEN BACK last to leave, devoid of any early
foot, continued to lag into the far turn, came on the outside for the drive, found best stride too late while improving position. GETCHA raced in mid pack
while out in the strip, lacked a closing kick. BAND BOSS chased the dueling leaders, began a steady fade before a half. OVERTHOUGHT dueled up front
outside the winner for five furlongs and gave way.

CHARLIE T away in good order, dueled up front for almost three furlongs in the two path, gained a slightly larger advantage late in the turn, responded
when confronted by the runner up from the outside soon after, spirited stretch duel, proved best in determined fashion. EVE'S DELIGHT chased the dueling
leaders, moved out, challenged three wide and outside the winner into the lane, extended duel to the wire, outgamed to miss late. FINAL QUEST one paced
outside, proved no match for the top two through the stretch. BROKE FINANCING last to leave, trailed most of the way and failed to menace. CONDESA'S
HANDMAID dueled up front inside the winner for almost three furlongs, first to blink.

Footnotes
GLAMOROUS STAR broke back, lacked speed, moved outside, five wide into the lane, challenged just inside the furlong marker while widest, wore down
the leader late under firm handling. SAINT MARY with the pace while racing closest to the inside, headed while continuing to vie through the turn, regained
a slight advantage when straightened for home, showed the way until the final strides before giving way stubbornly to the winner. TAKING PICTURES off
the early pace and the inside, ranged up to challenge while four wide through the turn, failed to sustain that effort through the stretch, narrowly gained the
nod for the show. GYPSY JACKPOT vied up front while horses, continued to contest the issue through the turn, equal terms with the winner past the furlong
marker, gradually weakened late, narrowly missed the show. LA LOLA broke in, was quickly straightened to set or force the pace for almost five furlongs,
caved in stretch. HALO'S SONG off a bit slow when bothered slightly, continued to trail, five wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally while drifting in.
