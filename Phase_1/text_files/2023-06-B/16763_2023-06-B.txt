with response and gained show. UNCLE SINGH tracked the top pair up the backstretch, edged closer late on the turn, hustled up three wide at the head of
the lane, raced near the lead but could not move on with the winner then weakened in final stages. LAWLESS JOHN dueled outside of FRANKLY EPIC in
opening strides, battled on up the backstretch and around the turn, got overtaken by the rail running winner at the head of the lane and gave way. FRANKLY
EPIC vied inside of LAWLESS JOHN up the backstretch, battled on around the turn, was no match when the winner took over at the head of the lane and

KAYLA was away in good order and briefly vied for the lead then edged back into tracking position, picked up the pace three wide nearing the quarter pole,
hustled along three to four wide into the lane, gained command near mid-stretch and pulled away. BAYLEYWICK vied inside of RAINBOW DASH leaving
the first turn, dueled for command up the backstretch, battled on around the far turn, shook free at the head of the lane then failed to hold off the winner in
the final furlong. REBEL RISING raced five paths wide into the first turn then settled into tracking position two wide, launched a four wide bid near the
quarter pole, swung four to five wide into the lane, ran on with response and captured show. SASSY AIN'T I raced four wide around the first turn, settled in
the back through the backstretch, hustled along two wide in upper stretch then shifted to the inside, edged closer then finished evenly and got edged for
show. RAINBOW DASH dueled outside of BAYLEYWICK up the backstretch and battled back around the turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and
gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NEW STRIPE tracked the top duo racing two wide, prompted three wide approaching the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into the lane, advanced
along the outside and forged clear. HOLIDAY TICKET was forwardly placed up the backstretch, engaged CAPTAIN DON for the lead with three furlongs left
to run, dueled around the turn, could not match strides with the leader in upper stretch but remained in striking distance, continued to put in a good effort
then got outkicked by the winner. CAPTAIN DON set the pace through early stages, dueled with HOLIDAY TICKET around the turn, shook free and held a
slim lead a furlong out then weakened late. KOSELIO raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane, finished up fast but ran out of time. HUNK OF
A HIT raced off the top two flights entering the turn, hustled up four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. AWESOME FAMILY tracked the pace
along the inside, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and failed to move on. GOD'S PICK raced off the pace, swung three wide into
the lane and never threatened.

forced to the inside when rival launched a two wide rebid entering far turn, dueled turning for home, could not move on with the winner at the head of the

stretch run and secured a share. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) settled through early stages, hustled up four wide around the far turn and lacked a needed
rally. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn, urged along the inside in the stretch run but failed to move on. THREE

NATIVE HELLRAISER raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide around the turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied while shifting inward
and finished clear. RAYS BIG DREAM led the way in the opening quarter, dueled with POE MANS RIDE around the turn, shook free in upper stretch,
battled on into late stages then got outkicked by the winner. SPANISH KISS raced near midpack through early stages, continued in range three to four wide
around the turn, swung into action entering the lane, gained ground between rivals, raced up close at the sixteenth pole, was no match when the winner
swept by but continued to dig in and got nipped for place. WILY WADE rated through early stages, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner and
launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, moved up into close contention a furlong out then finished evenly. POE MANS RIDE was forwardly placed in
opening stages, dueled with rival around the turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and came up empty in the final furlong. MACHO FORTY FIVE
raced up close up the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn then weakened in the lane. TEMPLE CITY RUN was not too far back in the opening
quarter, steadied near the seven sixteenth pole, weakened and failed to move back into contention. TAP ON BY raced in range up the backstretch, flattened
around the turn and continued to tired in the drive.
