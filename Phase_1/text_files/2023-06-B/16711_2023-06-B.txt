Footnotes
PAULINA'S STAR sat just off the pace while two to three wide, gained a slim advantage in the final turn over SOCIAL CUES, was overtaken entering the
stretch, dug in late under handling, and won the bob. SOCIAL CUES brushed leaving, contended the early pace, responded gamely to challenge from
PAULINA'S STAR, but was out finished. MOHAYMEN DAY was under a stronghold from along the rail, shifted outside in the far turn, and lacked the kick
needed. FAMOUS LAST WORDS was never far back and was done early.

SMILIN EVIE took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, responded to pressure from PONY GIRL at the head of the stretch, and held under light
handling. LETS GO ALL THEWAY shifted outside in the backstretch, was hustled in the final turn gaining closer order, closed steadily through the stretch,
and missed. PONY GIRL stalked the pace from the three path, was brushed leaving the backstretch, loomed boldly nearing the eighth pole, and was run
down late. COUNTESS CAT sat in range while five wide, brushed PONY GIRL while leaving the backstretch, and came up empty in the drive.

ESCROW STYLE saved ground off the pace, fanned three wide in the far turn, was roused near the three-sixteenth, and won driving. SPOT ON DUDE
raced wide through the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader in the final turn, and was out finished. DOC COPE raced near the back of the back, drove
three wide nearing the quarter pole, and was along in time for show. DOUSEAWHATISEA asserted the early lead, held good margins in the far turn, rider
lost whip at the head of the lane, then saw margins diminish quickly and weakened. ROCK CHALK lacked a bid. CARRERA CABALLO broke in leaving the
gate, chased three wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
QUINTO SOL pressed the pace outside of RUMOHR REIGNS, dueled through the far turn, gained a short advantage nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the
rail into the stretch and kept alert late. GREEK GEEK tracked inside early, angled out to the three path nearing the eighth pole, and edged clear to secure
second place. RUMOHR REIGNS contended the pace inside of QUINTO SOL, dueled to the quarter pole then was unable to match strides into the stretch,
lost his path along the rail, shifted out, and gave way. WAR GIANT fanned three wide in the opening turn, settled in striking range outside, and closed
gradually but was unable to improve position in the stretch. ROCKTILLYOUDROP tracked from between foes, and offered a mild late rally outside of
VIATURE. VIATURE rallied belatedly. EXACTLY raced at the back of the pack and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
HYPERFOCUS sat in striking position from along the rail, overtook the lead willingly, turned back a strong challenge from SMART AS ME, and edged away.
SMART AS ME raced four to five wide entering the opening turn, fanned four wide into the far turn, advanced quickly outside moving up alongside
HYPERFOCUS to challenge the lead, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed, and weakened late. ZICATELA set the early pace from the two path,
was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and was no match in the stretch for the top two finishers then held for show. SIMMS chased the early pacesetters
while three to four wide, lost ground in the final turn, and finished evenly. FATHER O'FLAHERTY showed little response late. PARKING PERMIT raced in
traffic in the backstretch and bid belatedly. CLANCY'S PISTOL tracked inside, and faded in the stretch. BORKAN raced wide through the backstretch, and
tired.

Footnotes
WITHIN REASON showed early outside speed, crossed over on the field to the rail, saved ground while showing the way, was given her cue at the head of
the stretch, and kept alert. JELLI rated well off the pace, drove three to four wide at the head of the lane, drifted in at the head of the stretch, and finished
gamely. SASSY CINDERELLA vied inside, dropped back in the far turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch and finished evenly. SUBLIME
EUPHORIA raced in closest pursuit, was roused at the quarter pole but lacked the closing response that was needed. STUBBORN LOVE chased toward
the outside, and faded in the drive. WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE settled outside early, chased under urging into the lane, and improved position. REBATE
chased inside and passed tiring rival late. ANNA'S IMAGE set for early speed, sat in range from the four path, and faded. SAYGE'S SPIRIT showed little.

Footnotes
MUDINATOR sat in striking position outside, fanned four wide into the far turn, advanced quickly nearing the quarter pole then struck the front, turned back
a challenge from FOUR O SIX CREED, and held on. FOUR O SIX CREED tracked from the three path, swung out in the final turn, moved up menacingly at
the sixteenth pole and kept the pressure to the wire but missed. NORTHERN JEWEL saved ground along the rail, lacked room at the head of the lane,
rallied inside through stretch and held for show. KAUAI DAN raced four-wide in the backstretch, raced wide in the final turn, and closed late missing out.
FLASHIN ACES trailed early, chased through the stretch, and improved position late. MOHAMAD sat midpack, hustled four wide in the final turn, then
yielded. BIG BAD INTAGLIO chased outside, trailed into the final turn while wide, and lacked a closing response. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) contended the
pace from the four path, was unable to keep pace with the field approaching the quarter pole, and stopped. SMART CAT vied inside, inherited the lead and
was soon overtaken.
