Footnotes
SWEET DYNASTY was allowed to settle around the first turn and continued unhurried up the backstretch, edged closer then let out a notch near the three
eighths pole, circled up three to four wide to challenge for the lead, battled for command three deep in upper stretch, cleared command at the sixteenth pole
and edged away. ELI'S GIRL was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader in the early backstretch, moved up to engage rival for the
lead nearing the half mile marker, vied for command around the far turn, battled back two wide in upper stretch then failed to kick on with the winner late.
BOOTLEGGING GIRL led the way around the first turn and into the early backstretch, took on the challenge from a duo nearing the half mile marker, dueled
inside around the far turn, fought back into the final furlong then gave way. CAYMAN QUEEN rated off the top trio to the far turn, let out a notch and circled
up into striking distance at the five sixteenths pole, failed to sustained bid entering the lane and steadily weakened. EUROWENDI lacked speed, raced in
the back and failed to move into contention. ALTERNATE ABBY was stubborn to load then raced up close around the first turn, dueled for the lead up the
backstretch, came up empty around the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
ESPE'S GUY sped to the lead heading into the first turn, set the pace under some pressure from PRIZED TAP, edged away from rival while still unasked
around the far turn, came two wide into the lane, tapped a couple times approaching the eighth pole, responded willingly, drew off to an easy victory and
finished wrapped up in the end. COUNTY JAIL raced off the pace in early stages, hustled along three wide into the lane, was no match for pulling away
winner but sustained a solid bid and finished second best. TACTICAL REBEL raced in range just off the pair pair up the backstretch, hustled along the
inside around the far turn, sustained bid along the rail and cleared the rest. EDGY LOVER rated off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn and
improved position without threatening. GLOME trailed in the back of the field, swung three to four wide into the lane and failed to move into contention.
PRIZED TAP was forwardly placed racing just off the eventual winner up the backstretch, continued to chase after rival around the far turn then retreated in
the lane. QUARTERNIGHT raced three to four wide entering the first turn, stalked the pace up the backstretch, failed to respond when called upon around
the far turn, weakened and continued to tire in the drive.

LEADING THE CAUSE was off slow at the start and allowed to settle while steadily edging up into closer contention, raced up close but lacked racing room
around the turn, continued behind a wall of pursuers at the head of the lane, tipped out four wide, kicked in gamely and got up late. GOLD TAPPER dueled
three deep for the lead up the backstretch, shook free approaching the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane, remained the leader deep stretch then got
caught in closing strides. MADETHEDEAN'SLIST rated three to four wide up the backstretch, circled four wide around the turn, hustled along the outside
into the lane, advanced into striking distance but lacked the needed surge to get by. BILLY BOB ROCKET tracked the top trio up the backstretch, launched
a three wide bid at the quarter pole, angled in a path and hustled along into the final furlong then flattened out. BILLY WHO rated three wide through early
stages, swung five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. MACH SWEDE dueled inside a duo up the backstretch, ran on in close contention around
the turn then weakened in the final furlong. FRANKLYGREAT raced in range in the opening quarter, failed to sustain bid mid-way around the turn and gave
way. NINETEEN HUNDRED vied between rivals up the backstretch, weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
LIVINGONTULSATIME was nicely rated racing three wide just off the top trio, hustled along four wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer under right
handed encouragement and edged away in deep stretch. CHICAGO CHROME stalked the pace up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid late on the
turn, took command past the eighth pole then got outkicked in deep stretch. LOVER BOY was forwardly placed in early stages, took over the lead at the
head of the lane, fought back when challenged mid-stretch then lost the lead to CHICAGO CHROME and flattened out. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP settled off the
pace in early going, chased three wide around the turn, tipped wider for the drive and had a mild improve. MINE MY TIME was not too far back in early
stages, saved ground then shifted out leaving the turn, gained position then ran on evenly late. MUCHO GIFTED raced in the back, swung four wide into the
lane and lacked a needed rally. SOUTHERN MOJO raced in range, chased two wide around the turn then faded in the stretch run. GETTINHOT'NHERE
vied briefly the set the pace running up the backstretch, continued to lead the way around the turn, got collared at the head of the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
HENNY'S CHICK was off awkwardly and lost iron at the start, trailed far back up the backstretch, made up a bit of ground late on the turn, swung four wide
into the stretch run, exploded down the lane, finished willingly and swept by with ease, impressive victory. ALMA'S PRINCESS stalked the pace along the
inside in the opening quarter, remained settled around the turn then shifted out a path near the quarter pole, shifted back to the rail upper stretch, cleared
the lead a furlong out, stayed on with good response then got outkicked when the winner swept by. ALTAR GIRL raced in range, moved up four wide to
engage rivals for the lead mid-way around the turn, remained in contention 3wd into the final furlong and captured show. SOPHIE'S STAR tracked the pace
through early stages, moved up to duel for the lead midway around the turn, sustained bid into stretch then flattened in late stages. PREORDAINED stalked
the early leaders, moved up to engage rivals for the lead around the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, could not match strides top stretch but
remained up close to the furlong marker then gave way. INDIAN ACES raced off the pace, saved ground, came two wide into the lane and never
threatened. I GOT A NAME set the pace up the backstretch, got collared for the lead around the turn and tired in the drive.

COLLECTED GLORY sprinted out to the lead at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside, turned back bids while still unleashed around the turn,
came two wide into the lane, roused for more, responded willingly, quickly widened to a commanding lead and finished ridden out. GO GO GO was
forwardly placed along the inside up the backstretch, shifted out four wide leaving the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on determinedly
under firm handling and finished clearly second best. PEACH STREET was allowed to settle early although never far off the early pace, let out a notch and
advanced into striking distance of COLLECTED GLORY late on the turn, was no match for pulling away winner in upper stretch but churned on and cleared
a share. STAY FABULOUS tracked the pace in the opening quarter, was ridden along three to four wide around the turn, failed to respond and faded in the
lane. HER NAME WAS LOLA was not too far back in the early going, chased two wide between rivals then came up empty late on the turn and retreated.
TAPICITA chased in contention in the opening quarter, came up empty around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
ADDABABY sprinted to a clear lead out of the gate, widened to a commanding advantage around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, continued with a
clear lead into the final furlong and held safe. BATTER UP BETTY rated off the clear leader up the backstretch, hustled along three to four wide into the
lane, finished with good response and closed the gap on the winner. ROCKETS SISTER was the closest pursuer of the clear leader up the backstretch,
hustled along three wide into the lane, sustained bid and secured a share. DIAL SUM IN raced in range two in early stages, hustled along two wide into the
lane and produced a mild bid. ESPIRIDION raced near midpack, saved ground around the turn, urged along the inside and needed more for late impact.
LUCKYHOTSTUFF raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and lacked needed rally. GARBO SPEAKS raced near midpack in middle
stages, saved ground around the turn and failed to kick on in the lane. HARD SPIRITS raced near midpack up the backstretch, swung four wide into the
lane and had no late response. ADD IT ALL UP raced in contention in the opening quarter, failed to advance under urging three wide around the turn and
steadily weakened. SING LUCY SING failed to move into contention.

wide in upper stretch and set sights on the leader, dug in under right handed pressure, reached rival at the sixteenth pole then kicked clear. KYLIES HOPE
vied for the lead in the opening quarter, shook free and held clear around the turn, held clear into the lane, fought back briefly when eventual winner moved
up at the sixteenth pole but had no kick left in reserve and had to settle for second best. HAPPY STROLL raced in range in the opening quarter, launched a
three wide bid approaching the quarter pole, sustained four wide bid into the lane and cleared a show. LAZY N LUCKY was off slow at the start, lacked
speed and raced in the back, showed some interest in the final furlong and passed some rivals. FARRAH FOWLER raced up close three wide in the
opening quarter, continued forwardly placed along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and failed to keep pace. NATIVE QUEEN broke on
top then settled back just off the compact flight, was ridden along tow wide around the turn then faded in the lane. UNGLUED raced up close in the opening
quarter, flattened out around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. SMACKIN GOOD TIME vied for the lead in the opening quarter, failed to sustain bid
