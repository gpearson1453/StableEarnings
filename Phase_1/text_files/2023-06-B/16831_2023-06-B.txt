Footnotes
KAREN'S HONOR came over causing some crowding entering the first turn while clearing the field, set the pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn,
drew clear and held well under urging. CHERU steadied nearing the first turn, then tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, angled out at the eighth
pole, closed late and got up for second. POWER AND GLORY steadied slightly early, then pressed the pace in the two path, chased on the far turn, dug in
gamely in the lane and lost second at the wire. EXCLUSIVE CHAMPION checked nearing the first turn, then pulled and was steadied on that turn, settled off
the pace and failed to respond when asked. BABY CAKES was off slowly, raced three wide on the clubhouse turn, stalked close up three wide, chased and
faded. LADY TRIXMEISTER raced three wide and gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of CHERU against the winner was dismissed.
