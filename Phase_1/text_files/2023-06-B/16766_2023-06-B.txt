Footnotes
MIGHTY SEA took command from the onset, was content inside just a head behind the leader at the half, was let out a notch on the rail at the quarter pole
to regain the front, put away his early speed rival in upper stretch and had something in reserve to repel the late closing bid in deep stretch. JIM'S HOPE
broke in at the start to trail in the early stages, made steady advance while well in hand through the backstretch, angled off the rail midpoint on the far turn to
loom the threat three wide at the top of the lane, was gaining slowly in mid stretch but could not wear down the winner at the finish. GUARD OF HONOUR
prompted two wide in the beginning, engaged for the lead sticking his neck in front down the backstretch, battled outside at the quarter marker, could not
match strides between runners in the final furlong to threaten the top two and settled for a clear third crossing the wire. CHASING TROUBLE was bumped
at the break, stalked three wide near the rear in the first turn, offered a mild turn of foot three wide at the three eighths marker outside foes, passed tired
runner at the top of the stretch and edged away late to capture a small share of the prize. TWIXTER was reined in to track the top pair on the fence through
the first turn, had a good position inside watching the co-leaders down the backside, was coaxed to go after the leading pair at the three eighths marker,
could not sustain the rally and faded in upper stretch. STREET SERENADE was steadied early when travelling under the wire for the first time, tracked just
outside in the middle of the pack down the back straight, lost positioning entering to final turn to trail the field and could not improve on the fence running
down the lane.

Footnotes
RELOAD'S REBEL was a bit restless in the gate, broke sharply whilst bumping with a rival and went straight to the lead to dictate terms racing on or just off
the rail, shook off challengers to move clear turning for home, held the nearest rival at bay through the stretch as well as the late charge of MORSTACHY'S,
who settled off the pace outside, began to pick it up on the turn, came into upper stretch five wide, continued to gain steadily but missed.
DISSECTOLOGIST stalked from outside, advanced four to five wide on the turn, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but evened out in the drive.
RENEGADE SERENADE broke a step slowly, shifted in and was encouraged forward to maintain contact with the main body of the field, came out near the
midpoint of the turn, swung out further to be seven wide at the three-sixteenths, improved position widest of all. GIVE ME MY MONEY was just a bit
reluctant to load, broke a half-step slowly, was ridden along past the half, raced near the inside and improved in the stretch. CLASSY BOY raced mid-pack
between runners two to three wide on the turn, angled six deep at the top of the stretch, ran on evenly. LOBBY BAR bumped with a foe and bobbled at the
start, moved forward three to four deep between runners stalking the leader and eventual winner, faltered and faded. NORTHERN PASSAGE tracked from
inside, checked sharply near the five-sixteenths, was not a late threat. TRIGGER'S BAY switched outside the leader early, moved forward to press that one
two to three deep up the backstretch, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
ONE MORE BREW pressed the issue with runners on either side down the back straight, continued to contest for the lead two wide outside at the quarter
pole, began to edge clear at the furlong marker and was improving the advantage at the finish line. SOUPER SUNSHINE had a short lead in a group of
three down the backside on the fence, battled inside for the top position through the turn, fought gamely on the rail in upper stretch but needed more late
and had the settle for second best in a hard fought loss. TORY'S HOLIDAY tracked on the rail having good position watching the top three up front, slipped
up the fence at the two furlong marker, shifted out three wide for the drive and finished with interest to be a non threatening clear third at the wire. DIXIE'S
FLATTER was bumped at the start by the inside rival, settled near the rear at the half mile marker, crept closer up the fence in upper stretch and passed
weary horses to garner a minor role in the end. BIG RANSOM contested for the pace outside three deep in the early going, was the first of the front
threesome to give way at the three furlong marker and ran evenly through the stretch. WONT FORGET YOU had a good spot outside in the second flight
watching the top three engaging for the lead down the backside, offered a mild rally four wide at the three sixteenth pole and levelled off in mid stretch.
MANAGED FOREST broke out at the start , trailed the field down the backstretch, saved ground through the turn but could not reach contention and was
not a factor on the fence running to the finish.

start, unhurriedly brought up the rear saving ground inside, came out on the far turn moving from two to four wide on that bend, angled eight deep in upper
stretch, bid outside the eventual winner taking a narrow brief lead about the sixteenth pole but was outfinished in a duel to the wire. REPEAT THE HEAT
was caught outside foes three wide through the first turn racing mid-pack, edged closer outside four deep up the backstretch into the far turn, took the lead
by the three-sixteenths, was overtaken nearing the sixteenth and outfinished. JUST START ME UP bumped a rival lightly at the start, was intent on the lead
from outside, cleared and shifted in entering the first turn, set the pace racing just off the rail and extending the advantage early up the backstretch, was

shifting in heading to the first turn, saved ground inside, moved out and passed a rival two deep on the far turn, carried on evenly. OCTOBER FROST was
lightly bumped at the break, raced outside two to three wide toward the rear early, continued three wide on the far turn, ran on evenly. GENDRAGON

to the midpoint of the far turn, faltered and faded in the stretch. THREE SONNY SIDEUP came in just after the start following breaking outwardly a bid, was
forwardly-positioned inside but took up on heels heading to the first turn, tracked from inside, dropped back on the far turn, came out in the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MY BOY PRINCE had a short lead on the rail down the backside, began to inch away from the other speed rival two furlongs from the prize, opened up on
challengers turning for home and cruised to the finish comfortably in the final eighth. FOUR STRONG WINDS travelled in the middle of the pack two deep in
the early going, began to lengthen stride going after the leaders midway on the turn, shifted out six wide for the drive to the line and closed to be second
best while on the wrong lead to the finish. WAGNER broke slow to trail the field down the backstretch, was on hold on the rail entering the turn, slipped up
the fence with five sixteenths to go and finished up to close in and capture third money. BABBO was last three wide outside at the three furlong pole , began
to put in a strong move five wide circling horses midway on the turn, was fanned out seven deep at the top of the stretch and was one paced late to the
finish. TWO GHOSTS pressed two wide outside throughout the turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and retreated between foes at
the furlong marker. DYNAMIC STRIKE settled on the rail in mid-pack in the beginning, offered a brief run between foes nearing the quarter pole and made
little impression running to the finish line. BEDARD stalked between rivals at the back with three eighths remaining, made no headway running on the turn
and could not get involved in the stretch run. VALLEY VICTORY tracked behind the top duo on the rail at the half, could not keep up with others running
inside through the turn and backed away with five sixteenths to run.

VICTORIA'S CHIEF settled off the pace shifting in three wide racing at the back early, began to pick it up moving out from three to five wide on the far turn,
took aim, drifted in a bit then hooked up with the leader in mid-stretch and edged past that one late. FANORE (IRE) set the pace racing off the rail into the
first turn facing outside pressure, moved nearer the rail early up the backstretch before coming back out off the fence for the far turn, edged clear late on
that bend, was challenged by rivals at the top of the stretch, edged away from those but was collared in late stretch by yet another foe while clear of the rest.
JUNIPERO SERRA broke inwardly, was unhurried early switching off the inside in the two to three path bringing up the rear, slowly edged closer willingly
while moving out a bit on the far turn, came out further to be five to six deep in upper stretch, rallied inside a rival to get up for show honors. RUNAWAY
CHARLIE was caught four to five wide early with forward position heading to the first turn, eased back off the leaders on that bend and up the backstretch,
continued wide on the far turn further back from the leaders, swung out six to seven deep for the stretch run and kept on evenly. THE THUNDERER settled
mid-pack off the rail in the two to three path early, advanced outside on the far turn, bid five wide at the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit, faltered. HANK
OLLIE lacked some running room while a bit keen heading to the first turn, saved ground, tried to get through inside in mid- to late-stretch and was again in
tight as a rival drifted in, needed more. BILL NEEDLE pressed from between runners early, continued the pursuit two to three wide, dropped back and came
out for the drive and ran on. GIOVANNINO pressed from outside three wide early, eased back to stalk racing off the inside, bid four wide turning into upper
stretch could not sustain the effort, drifted in through in mid-stretch and faded. SPIRITWOOD shifted in, saved ground inside at the back, was ridden along
midway on the far turn but had no late response.

Footnotes
STANLEY HOUSE travelled four wide into the first turn, settled nicely through the backstretch to have a good trip at the half watching the top pair, took up
the chase with three eighths to go, took control two deep at the quarter pole and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish. CALL CURT tracked in the
third flight following the path of the winner down the back straight, continued to keep pace with rivals outside running on the final turn, chased the winner
down the stretch, was inching closer in the late stages but could not get there in the end. TECUMSEH'S WAR tracked in the two path between runners in
the first turn, assumed command outside four furlongs from the wire, was headed outside by the winner two furlongs from the finish, battled until mid-stretch
and held for the show money in the end. FULL EXTREME was situated near the back the wide in the beginning stages, began to advance outside four deep
midway down the backside, circled around foes with five sixteenths left to go, angled six wide to be involved for a share of the prize at the top of the lane
and evened out the final furlong. LAC MACAZA travelled in mid-pack early on, three wide with a quarter left turn run was asked for more, shifted six wide in
upper stretch and showed some late energy running to the finish line. EMBRACE MY UNCLE stalked near the back on the rail into the first turn, could see
the field down the backstretch, was roused three wide five sixteenths from the finish, angled six wide in upper stretch and passed stragglers to the wire.
SAND DANCER trailed early between foes just off the rail, settled near the rear down the backside, shift outside off the tiring early leader on the far turn and
had no run to give through to the finish. SOUPER COHIBA travelled in the middle of the pack on the rail in the early stages, was ridden for more weaving
between foes at the three furlong marker and showed little in the stretch run. SILENT MIRACLE tracked on the rail in the first turn, was situated nicely on the
rail in the second flight down the backstretch, took closer order to be in range of the leaders midway on the final turn, shifted in to the rail in upper stretch
and tired in the final eighth. SILENT FORTUNE took this field on the rail into the first turn, was collared outside at the half mile marker, could not keep pace
with others with three eighths remaining, backed away midpoint on the far turn and galloped in the stretch crossing the wire.

Footnotes
PALAZZI broke well then settled in to stalk from outside, went four to five wide on the turn in range of the leader, took over just past the quarter pole while
drifting out a path, was engaged in mid-stretch, dueled late and just held to get the nod. DANCIN IN DA'NILE settled mid-pack between runners about three
wide into the turn, angled out about six to seven deep in upper stretch past the quarter pole, rallied outside the eventual winner, dueled with that one late
and just missed. READY FOR THE LADY was unhurried at the back racing outside rivals, traveled four wide on the turn, came out seven wide at the top of
the stretch, was gaining late but missed. LIKE THE KING settled mid-pack inside tracking the leaders, saved ground on the turn, angled out past the quarter
pole, rallied about four wide and was gaining inside of the top trio but too late. A THREAD OF BLUE was forwardly-positioned tracking inside, came out a
path to advance by a rival, ran on. ENGLISH CONQUEROR got away well, settled off the leaders racing outside, was forced four to five wide on the turn,
ran on evenly. ELUSIVE KNIGHT was unhurried at the back, saved ground inside through the turn, moved out in mid- to late-stretch for room and improved
position about three to four wide. SIR SEAMUS went straight to the lead to set the early tempo racing off the inside, moved nearer the rail heading into the
turn, saved ground, weakened in the stretch. ENCHANT ME raced toward the back, was near but off the rail through the turn, shifted five wide into upper
stretch, kicked on mildly. DAY TRIPPER stalked just off the leading pair three to four wide, dropped back and faded. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was outside
foes at the rear in the early going, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten. BREAKING ALONE was not a factor racing off
the inside part of the course. PERFECT SPEIGHTY broke well and tracked the early leader from inside, switched outside that one to go two to three deep in
pursuit on the turn, faltered and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
LUCKMAN was allowed to settle at the back early on, started to lengthen his stride while still trailing the field down the backstretch, was swooping around
runners four wide two furlongs from the finish, continued gaining momentum in the six path in upper stretch and was full of run the last sixteenth to draw
away for the victory. MALIBU MAMBO tracked two wide into the first turn, rated kindly down the backstretch watching the contesting duo up front, crept
three wide to the lead at the quarter pole, braced for the outside challenge in upper stretch and determinedly ran on through the lane but could not hold the
winner off late. MONEY PRINTER was taken a hold of in tight quarters under the wire for the first time, stalked outside near the rear at the half, was ridden
three wide three furlongs from the finish, angled five wide for the drive to the wire, shifted to the rail with a sixteenth to run but could not find another gear
late to threaten the top two in the end. DUN DRUM tracked the top pair on the rail in the early stages of the race, was roused on the fence into the far turn,
had to tap on the brakes inside coming up to the tiring early leaders two furlongs from home, shifted out for clear run in the four path with three sixteenths
remaining and finished up to capture a minor share crossing the wire. HADDASSAH took the field into the first turn on the rail, set the pace while hounded
outside running down the back straight, was headed but multiple runners outside in upper stretch and yielded on the fence in the last eighth. FROSTED
OVER pressed for the front on the first turn just outside, continued to engage outside for the lead down the backside, was collared in the three path by
runners at the top of the lane and showed little for the drive weakening in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MOONQUEST switched off the inside stalking the leading pair, advanced three wide on the turn, drifted seven wide into upper stretch and took a narrow
lead, turned back an outside challenger, moved clear and was kept busy. QUIET SPEED settled off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, shifted in
a bit in mid-stretch, rallied inside rivals to get the place. PREETZAH'S STAR was in tight and squeezed back at the break, made an early advance outside
foes up the backstretch to gain contact with the leaders, raced in behind and between runners three deep on the turn lacking a bit of room past the quarter
pole, angled five wide leaving that bend and had room between runners, ran on evenly. HARPER CITY was just off the early leaders, moved outside those
leaving the backstretch, advanced rapidly past the five-sixteenths moving out from five to six wide, was floated eight wide into upper stretch making a mild
bid, lacked the needed late kick. QUIET VISTA lacked early speed, raced outside foes at the rear into the turn, went four to five wide on that bend, shifted in
through mid-stretch and gained mildly. VIDEO VIDA broke a tad awkwardly but recovered to get forward position tracking the leaders, saved ground on the
turn, was held up in behind rivals at the top of the stretch, found room between past the five-sixteenths and ran on. INFINITELY KATZ was up close stalking
the leader, edged nearer to force the issue from outside two to three deep coming to the seven-sixteenths, floated four wide leaving the turn, faded in the
stretch. CHICAGO FREDDY quickly moved clear to set the pace, raced inside through the turn, drifted to the three path turning for home then drifted back to
the rail in upper stretch, came up empty. ECHO WITH LAUGHTER steadied after the break, lacked early speed, swung six wide, was not a threat. PIDIN
was bumped at the start, chased briefly from mid-pack near but off the rail, dropped back between runners two to three wide, tired. THIS CAT IS BY JAX
bumped the outer rival at the start then came in, saved ground on the turn racing at the back, was never near enough to threaten and eased through the
lane, walked off.
