Footnotes
KITTY'S PRETTY prompted the pace from inside into the turn, took the lead along the rail midway around the turn, opened up from the three path into the
lane, and continued to go clear under a drive. DONE ENOUGH hit the inner side of the gate, chased in the three path, ranged up in the four path around the
turn, took aim from the six path into the lane, and chased on for place. ARE YOU SINGLE trailed from the six path into the turn, tipped inwards to the rail
turning into the stretch, and moved up for show. JUST TAKE NOTES rated along the inside, was under coaxing early around the turn, angled out to the
seven path into the stretch, but flattened. APRIL APRIL tracked in the four path, was driven around the turn, floated out to the nine path into the stretch, but
was no threat. MISS ATHLETIC led in the three path early, but lost the lead midway around the turn, and faded down the lane. BIANCA LUNA was pushed
along from up close in the five path but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
HARLAN'S LEGACY raced off the pace two wide, was under urging while still well back down the backstretch, edged closer under a drive around the far
turn, swung out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead, closed outside, took over near the sixteenth pole and drew clear while drifting in a bit. BEST
SELLER prompted the pace two and three wide, took over midway around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole and fought on to hold the place.
RESONANCIA hit the starting gate, raced off the pace four wide around both turns, bid in upper stretch but was outkicked between the top two finishers late.
SHE'S SO BEARRISH stalked the pace three and four wide and faded in the stretch. ROYAL JUBILEE chased the pace inside and came up empty in the
lane. DULCE AMBICION trailed inside, angled out near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. MUSICAL JOURNEY set the pace inside, was collared midway
around the far turn, checked while tiring nearing the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
FLAG WOMAN set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside midway around the turn, opened up into the lane, was much the best, and
wrapped up late. GUARDIAN ANGEL was fractious in the gate and popped the door open, chased in the four path, was cued right handed midway around
the turn, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for place. DOVE IN CHARGE broke out and bumped an outer foe, prompted the pace in
the three path, but lost ground around the turn, and evened out in the five path down the lane to show. PUPPET MASTER was bumped hard by an inner foe
at the start and raced well off the pace in the five path, lost the whip while being fanned out to the nine path into the stretch, and made no impact. SHEZ
SPEIGHTFUL broke out an bumped an outer foe, tracked inside, was under a drive in the three path midway around the turn, but flattened from the six path
down the lane. MADEFORSUMMER was factious in the gate and got bumped by an inner foe leaving, stalked in the two path, lost ground while floating out
around the turn, and was empty from the eight path in the stretch. SHE KNOWS IT ALL broke slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RACKET was bumped at the start, moved two wide to the lead around the first turn, drew clear early on the backstretch, set the pace in the two path from
there and held safe under a drive. BELLY OF JELLY led at the rail early, stalked inside down the backstretch and around most of the far turn, angled three
wide turning for home and was gaining on the winner late. DOLLAR BILL bumped with the winner at the start, raced off the pace inside, went three wide
around the far turn, fanned widest in upper stretch and rallied outside. CARSOWN stalked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane.
NETWORKING chased the early pace two and three wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and finished evenly. DONTONIO was off slow and failed to
menace while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
EMPRESS ELLIE set the pace under a hold in the two path, was cued right handed from the three path at the top of the stretch, opened up and held sway.
OCEAN SAFARI prompted the pace in the four path, was driven between foes around the far turn, lost place position and was in the three path entering the
lane, but dug in to get back up for place in the final furlong. FREE DATA tracked around the four and five paths, was ridden along outside of a duo rounding
the far turn, and finished evenly in the four path down the lane for show. LOVE HER LOTS stalked in the two path, was roused inside of rivals early around
the far turn, stayed on in upper stretch, but flattened late to miss minor placings. LALOBA FEROZ laid off the pace inside, tipped out to the six path into the
stretch, but did not threaten. PENS STREET rated in the three path but never menaced.

Footnotes
MOGALU raced in range outside down the backstretch, bid four wide between foes midway around the turn, dueled outside of GRAND ROCK from there to
the wire and narrowly prevailed. GRAND ROCK dueled inside of foes, drifted out under left-handed urging in the lane, battled to the wire and just missed.
FORT ATTITUDE raced off the early pace outside, launched a five wide bid around the turn, reached near even terms nearing the five-sixteenths pole but
flattened out in the stretch. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH was bumped at the start, saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch, bid near the eighth pole
but was outkicked late. RUNAWAY TOM came in and bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. ALLAGASH RUN dueled
two wide between foes and faltered nearing the quarter pole. IT'S ME AGAIN was outrun while racing four wide. LEGEND was bumped between foes at the
start and made little impact while racing two wide.

Footnotes
HAPPY RUNNER stalked from the four path into the turn, ranged up under coaxing in the five path around the turn, bid while tipping inwards into the stretch,
took the lead while in the three path before the eighth pole, and held safe. LORD EDDARD STARK bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the
three path, steadied slightly into the turn, swung out to the six path into the lane, and ran on for place. WOW WISH broke out at the start, pressed from the
five path into the turn, bid in the four path around the turn, and fought on between foes from the two path in the stretch for show. CRUZIN MAN set the pace
in the four path, was challenged by an outer foe while in the three path rounding the turn, lost the lead while shifting to the rail in upper stretch, and faded in
the final furlong. BEST DEFENSE chased in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, but was one paced from the four path in the stretch. GOTTA
LIKE HIM had to check passing the five eighths point, raced off the pace in the five path, floated out to the seven path into the lane, but was no factor.
BART'S DREAM bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the three path but did not threaten from the five path in the stretch. BOURBON
THERAPY brushed with an outer foe passing the five eighths point, was behind in the two path early and never menaced.

TRUST ME pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the quarter pole, drew off under a drive in upper stretch, drifted in in midstretch and
widened at the rail. GITANA raced in range inside, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but finished willingly for the place.
MAMA MARIA chased the pace four wide, could not match strides with the winner and was along for the show. SONICUS set the pace along the rail and
weakened through the lane. MILES OF SMILES lacked early speed while racing four wide, angled widest in upper stretch and never threatened. DIVINE
CONNECTION played no factor while racing two wide. OLGA failed to menace while racing five wide. TAP'ER LIGHT was outrun inside.

SPICY stalked in the three path, was roused between foes midway around the turn, and ran on from the rail in the stretch for place. DAN'S CANDI GIRL
brushed with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, was pushed along rounding the turn, and kept on in the four path down the lane
for show. SILVIA V'S HEROES brushed with an outer foe at the start, was behind in the five path into the turn, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch,
and stayed on down the center. HITS DIFFERENT laid off the pace in the three path, was driven between foes around the turn, and mildly gained from the
four path in the stretch. MARILYN chased in the four path, was under a heavy drive in the five path rounding the turn, and finished evenly. REE got pinched
and had to steady passing the half, rated in the two path, shifted out to the five path turning into the lane, but was no factor. BURN THE BREEZE pressed
inside of the eventual winner from the two path but faded turning into the stretch. OVERRUN tracked inside but backed up early around the turn.
