Footnotes
IZZY'S MONSTER was unhurried early while never far off the pace, raced outside, rallied into the turn to challenge, dueled briefly and drew off under steady
urging. HOLY STAR was sent to the front, led around the first turn, pressed inside when headed, bid on the turn to duel briefly, fell back and was no match
for the winner. LIL CARRIE D moved up to assume command along the backstretch, bore out badly on the turn, dropped back, went evenly late and held
safely for show. BUNNY SHINE settled off the pace while racing inside, lacked a stretch response and did not threaten. PRETTY IN PRADO held a good
position to the second turn, tired and gave way. SHE APPEALS HOLY hit the gate and was steadied at the start to be off slowly, fell far back, trailed the field
and failed to contend.

Footnotes
SIERRA HOTEL stalked the pace along the inside, awaited room on the turn, shifted out, bid willingly to duel and drew clear late. LAVENDER EARL vied
inside, inched away briefly on the turn, responded to duel to late stretch, yielded and was all out for place. LAND MARK DEAL was checked hard entering
the first turn, stayed close to the pace, got through along the rail on the second turn, closed willingly, altered course late and was gaining for second. STAR
OF KODIAK broke slowly, was crowded and steadied at the start, was allowed to settle and saved ground while racing in the back, advanced on the turn
and offered a mild bid only. KENNESAW stalked the pace, was carried out leaving the turn, fell back and gave way. PAYSTER veered out at the start, vied
to the second turn, swung wide and gave way. WEST COAST CHROME raced outside while never far off the pace, showed speed to the second turn, tired
and stopped. The rider of LAND MARK DEAL claimed foul against the rider of LAVENDER EARLY for alleged interference into the first turn. No change was
made.

I'M BOX OFFICE was never far back, raced inside, shifted out turn, rallied into the stretch and drew off in the drive under steady urging. PATIENCE
WORTH ducked out at the start, raced close to the pace, advanced inside to the turn, shifted out to challenge, dueled briefly, was no match late and finished
second best. J Z'S FINE WINE was unhurried early, bid inside on the turn, angled out, offered a mild bid and was along for show. THEMISCHIEVOUSONE
set the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. VOSTRA broke slowly, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. JOYZELLA was crowded at the start,
showed speed to the turn, tired and stopped.

pace to the second turn, was outclosed and finished second best. SOUL COAXING pressed the pace to the second turn, fell back, leveled off and held for
show. MILLARD'S SMILE had the rider lose an iron briefly on the first turn, pressed the pace along the inside, tired into the second turn and dropped back.
SPORT PEPPER veered out at the start and showed little in an outside trip. SILVER QUARTERS broke slowly and was pinched back at the start, trailed the
field and failed to contend.

Footnotes
GO STORMIN GIRL broke in the air to be off slowly, rallied between horses on the turn, went five wide into the stretch, closed willingly and drew clear.
LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT was slow early, bid inside on the turn, altered course at the top of the stretch, closed once straightened and was gaining ground.
SHEZ RECKLESS was never far off the pace, was pushed out on the turn, swung very wide, finished well and earned show. PLAY TWENTY veered in at
the start to be off slowly, vied to mid stretch and was unable to sustain her bid. RUNNERS HEAT raced close to the pace, fell back on the turn and finished
evenly. ORDAINED KISS bid along the rail on the turn, closed inside and hung late. TRIP TO FREEDOM vied to the turn and gave way. Following a
stewards' inquiry, GO STORMIN GIRL was disqualified and placed third for causing interference on the turn.
