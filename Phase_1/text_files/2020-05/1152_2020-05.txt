GARDEES WORLD had good speed, was headed briefly at the three eighths by PROOF OF JAZZ, pushed away from that one to the stretch, was clear to
mid stretch then was all out to hold MISS EVER READY safe. MISS EVER READY got outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then closed
steadily in the final furlong but was too late. I'M SO ANNA broke slow and lost about four lengths to begin, was three then four wide on the turn and closed
the gap in the final furlong. RACHEL'S LADY was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. PROOF OF JAZZ
hustled to attend the pace outside the winner, had a head in front at the three eighths then was outrun to the stretch and weakened. THE HENRIETTA was

Footnotes
MY MAN DRAYMOND was unhurried to the second turn, bid two wide then swung out widest and five deep into the stretch, rallied to catch the leaders
leaving mid stretch and drove clear. POPPY'S C NOTE attended the pace from the rail to the second turn, edged clear to the stretch then was collared
leaving mid stretch but saved second. CLARENCE HEADS dueled three wide to the backstretch then took back and chased to the second turn, raced two
wide to the stretch, rallied in the drive but was too late for second. MR. PAPAS settled mid pack to the half, came three wide to the stretch, loomed boldly in
mid stretch then weakened. CATS OUT TONITE hesitated then hopped at the start and lost about four lengths, had no speed and saved ground to no avail.
GIMME SPACE was chasing to the second turn, rallied inside to the stretch, was a threat to mid stretch then also weakened. UR NOT MY PRESIDNT had
no speed and was not a factor. WHEN JESUS WALKED attended the pace to the half, was three wide on the second turn but gave way in the drive.
HARDY CHISEL dueled between rivals for six furlongs then also gave way.

Footnotes
TAKE A TIME OUT broke out and bumped KISS OF CONGRATS at the start, had no speed, settled to the half, rallied three wide on the second turn then
continued to respond, caught OLIVE YOU MORE in mid stretch and pushed away driving. OLIVE YOU MORE pressed the pace for a half mile, responded
when asked for speed and drew clear on the second turn then was tiring in the drive but had enough of a cushion to save second. STARS IN THE SKY (GB)
was chasing to the half, raced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but was gaining for second. MIME also chased the pace to the
second turn, was outrun two wide to the stretch and lacked a closing response. KISS OF CONGRATS was bumped by the winner to begin, trailed to the
second turn, came three wide to the stretch then had to steady when OVERWHELMING LOVE lugged out into her path in mid stretch and was not a threat.
OVERWHELMING LOVE was settled to the half, raced two wide on the far turn, lugged out into KISS OF CONTRATS' path in mid stretch and weakened.
DOGGY DREAMS was sent for speed, set the pace for a half mile, tired on the second turn then stopped in the stretch, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
SLOANE GARDEN (GB) was unhurried to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then angled out for room nearing mid stretch, rallied when clear and
closed fast to catch her stablemate late. GOLDEN IRIS (GB) chased the leader to the second turn, rallied two then three wide to the stretch, edged away to
mid stretch then could not stall the winner. FAIRY TALE BLISS tracked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, got outkicked to mid
stretch and finished evenly. CASINO GAMES had no speed, was off the rail on the far turn and lacked the needed late response. ROSE PRINCESS settled
mid pack to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. OUR BOLD PRINCESS had no speed and was never a threat.
NOBLE CONTESSA pushed to the lead, set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then tired. SUNBLESSED (IRE) pressed the pace to the second turn, was
two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then also tired.
