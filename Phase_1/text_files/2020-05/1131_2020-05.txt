Footnotes
TICKLE BUNNY was off very slow, raced towards the inside down the backstretch into the far turn, angled five wide through the stretch and just got up in his
final strides under all out pressure. DECORATED FOR GOLD was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide in the stretch and just missed in a game
effort. BELLA KRISTINA tracked the leader while racing two, took command while building a clear late, led nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened late.
GP'S AMAZING GRACE stalked the pace, raced three wide and had no final winning bid. SATTERSFIELD stalked the early going, raced towards the inside
and weakened in the latter stages. SHAKER BAKER was allowed to settle early, lacked racing room nearing the eighth pole, angled out to race four deep
late and had not enough. SHE'S GOT MOXY settled off the early pace, raced three deep in the stretch and never was a factor. LUCIA GAL was slow early
and never threatened. QUIET SPRING showed good early speed, took bad steps and was pulled up at the three quarters pole. Quiet Spring was vanned
