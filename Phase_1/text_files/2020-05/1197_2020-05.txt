Footnotes
BRITTLE AND YOO stumbled and bumped with SAINTSATION at the start, pressed the pace setter from along the inside, rated under tight restraint from
the pocket into the turn, committed to the rail while others were making wide bids turning for home, surged through a narrow opening at the quarter pole,
then drew away from the field through the lane under driving pressure. HANDS UP saved ground while off of the pace before shifting to the four path turning
for home to rally between horses, sustained a bid and forged place at the sixteenth pole while no threat to the winner. OUR SECRET AGENT was forwardly
placed outside of the leader while in the three path, made a three wide bid for the lead while between horses turning for home, but was no match for an
inner foe in upper stretch, then got outfinished by an outer foe in the late stages for place. TRAPPED N MY MIND was away awkwardly and trailed the field
down the backstretch, advanced slightly in the three path around the turn before swinging six wide turning for home, but finished evenly. SAINTSATION
brushed the gate then bumped with BRITTLE AND YOO at the start, tracked from midpack three wide and outside of horses, made a four wide bid turning
for home, came into the lane in the five path between horses, but weakened at the furlong pole. DANCEWITHTHEDEVIL quickly cleared after a sharp start,
held an advantage into the turn while a bit off of the rail through the bend, which allowed BRITTLE AND YOO to make an inside bid turning for home
simultaneously with multiple outer foes, was swallowed up between horses at the quarter pole, and stopped.

Footnotes
LADY CLEOPATRA prompted the leader while between horses and kept in the three path through the first turn, made a two wide bid for the lead at the
seven sixteenths pole, forged an advantage turning for home, and drew off in upper stretch under driving pressure. OPERATIC settled off of the pace two
wide between horses through the first turn, advanced in the three to four path while outside of foes through the far turn, then sustained a mild kick through
the lane to get up for place in the final sixteenth. ABSOLUTE LOVE stalked the pace three wide while being kept on the four path through the first turn,
failed to keep pace with the dueling leaders into the far turn and chased them from the three path through that bend, then stayed on late, but was
outfinished for place. SUN DRESS set the pace while staying a bit off of the rail around the first turn, dueled inside of the eventual winner into the far turn,
but was no match for her at the quarter pole and weakened. FUN PADDY was caught three wide around the first turn, took the far turn in the two path
before shifting to the inside turning for home, but failed to menace. COLORINCOLONEL advanced along the inside to stalk from the pocket down the
backstretch, but came under urging at the half mile pole, was put to an all out drive into the far turn, but failed to respond.

Footnotes
ELLE M'A SOURI (FR) settled off of the pace while saving ground around the first turn, advanced to midpack in the three path into the far turn, waited
behind the leading group turning for home, tipped five wide straightening into the lane, then produced a good late kick after showing a stout turn of foot at
the furlong pole, wore down the clear leader in the final strides, and won the photo for win. FLYING THE COLORS was caught four wide in midpack through
the first turn, advanced outside of rivals while in the three path through the far turn to make a bid for the lead turning for home, took over in upper stretch
and drew off, but was worn down by ELLE M'A SOURI (FR) in the late stages and nipped at the wire. DADDYMADEMEDOIT was far off of the pace while
caught three, then four, wide around the first turn, advanced four wide and outside of rivals around the far turn to make a bid in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by FLYING THE COLORS in upper stretch, then was outkicked by ELLE M'A SOURI (FR) at the furlong pole for place. MALIBU MARLEE was
forwardly place while three wide around the first turn, but came under a drive to keep pace into the far turn, then produced a mild rally after shifting to the rail
turning for home, but flattened out late. HEAVENLY PEACE saved ground far back, shifted to the three path into the far turn, then stayed on mildly.
FASHION MO raced off of the pace in the four, to five, path around the far turn, then failed to threaten thereafter. BASTET set the pace while being
pressured by MESSINA, was headed by other rivals at the quarter pole, then gave way in the two path at the furlong pole. EXCEBLADES had a slow start,
trailed while saving ground, and passed tired rivals. MESSINA prompted the pace setter two wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. PAU
HANA took the first turn in the three path and was through early. TOURIST LIKE ME failed to factor from the two path. MILLE FLEURS stalked along the
inside, but weakened into the far turn, and stopped.

Footnotes
JOHNNY CAB prompted the leading duelers from the three path while inside of IMPROBABLE STORY, inched forward to make a three wide bid for the lead
at the quarter pole, then battled under a long drive through the lane as ARCH ABILITY dug in and HIDDEN PROMISE rallied along side, and prevailed
between those foes at the wire. HIDDEN PROMISE trailed along the inside, came off of the rail and advanced around the turn, swung to the six path turning
for home to rally outside of rivals, produced a bid at the furlong pole, but hung late. ARCH ABILITY dueled inside of CREEKMORE through the early stages,
dug in turning for home inside of multiple rivals, shifted outwards after repelling his early counterpart at the furlong pole, was game inside of JOHNNY CAB
and HIDDEN PROMISE late, but it was not enough. ITS MY BAG BABY broke inwards, then saved ground while rating off of the pace, came under a drive
to keep pace into the turn, held position turning for home while a few lengths off of the leaders, but lacked a kick through a large rail opening through the
lane. ALBERT'S BARN rated off of the pace in the three path, was in range between horses and behind the leaders turning for home, but was blocked
behind a wall of horses in upper stretch, shifted in for racing room at the furlong pole, but came up empty. IMPROBABLE STORY chased four wide, but
weakened between horses at the furlong marker. CREEKMORE dueled two wide and edged a slight lead turning for home, but stopped between horses at
the furlong pole.

Footnotes
NATURAL HISTORY rallied from far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, sustained his rally with
a stout kick at the furlong pole to make a bid at the sixteenths pole, and finished strongly to win by open lengths. DIGITAL STAR rallied from off of the pace
in the four path around the turn to make a bid for the lead at the furlong pole, held a slight advantage, but was outkicked by the gallantly finishing NATURAL
HISTORY at the sixteenth pole. SUSPECT dueled outside of JERRY'S GOT ACES early on while staying in the three path, forged a lead at the five
sixteenths pole, held an advantage from multiple foes to the furlong marker, but was headed there, then kept on for a minor reward. BEGIN THE BEGIN
pressed the pace from the two path while inside of the dueling leaders early on, stalked along the inside into the turn, made an inside bid for the lead at the
three sixteenths pole, but yielded late. DONTNEEDANAME cut the corner turning from home while in midpack, shifted to the three then four path at the
furlong pole, and finished evenly. FORBETTERORWORSE advanced to stalking position three wide into the turn, but tired at the furlong pole. CHILI
NELSON had a slow start, pulled his was between horses to be forwardly placed at the half mile pole, but weakened in upper stretch. MR. CLASS bobbled
a bit at the start, saved ground before coming into the lane in the three path, but failed to factor. WHY WHY PAUL WHY raced off of the pace outside of
horses, bore from the five to eight path around the turn without rider correction, then failed to factor. MAGIC MO was forwardly placed along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with the leaders at the half mile pole, and weakened in upper stretch. JERRY'S GOT ACES dueled inside of SUSPECT early on, but
weakened at the five sixteenths pole, subsequently stopped, and was eased. LOVER BOY was off slowly with a rank start, trailed throughout, and showed
little.

Footnotes
SPANISH KINGDOM stalked three wide, inched forward around the far turn to make a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, kicked clear in upper
stretch, then held sway through the lane and was ridden out through the final stages. ANGELUS WARRIOR broke outwards, raced in midpack three to four
wide and outside of rivals through the first turn, advanced to striking range between horses in the four path through the far turn, forged place in upper stretch
while proving no match for the leader, then fended off TIESTO through the final furlong to hold that position at the wire. TIESTO was void of early speed and
caught three wide into the first turn, advanced five wide around the far turn to be in range of the leaders turning for home, but flattened out and only
produced a mild kick in midstretch, then hung late and failed to achieve place. JURGEN raced midpack two wide among rivals, shifted to the three to four
path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. STRONG TIDE swung from the three to the six path in upper stretch, and produced a mild kick but
failed to threaten. KID MERCURY prompted the leader two wide and between horses early on, took back to rate in the pocket into the far turn, waited for
racing room passing the five sixteenths pole, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked. BUY ME CANDY saved ground, waited for racing room
into the far turn, split foes in the two path in upper stretch, but flattened out inside of rivals in the final furlong. LETMENO stalked along the inside early on,
but retreated between horses down the backstretch. PREFECT saved ground while far off of the pace, and produced a mild kick but was no threat. TABLED
vied three wide early on, forged a lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch, then further weakened at the
furlong pole. NOBLE ORDER was taken back when a bit crowded between horses at the start, trailed in the two path, and never got involved.
CZECHMIGHT set the pace along the inside of multiple foes through the first turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, stopped, and was eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
BELL'S THE ONE was unhurried early on, roused near the quarter pole, rallied down the lane, drove past the leaders three wide and drew away in the final
stages. BREAK EVEN set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, remained clear nearing the eighth pole then was overtaken while no match for the
winner but was second best. MIA MISCHIEF tracked the pace early, had dead aim on the leader nearing the lane but lacked a response in the stretch and
weakened late in the drive. UNIQUE FACTOR chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run.
SNEAKING OUT stalked the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. SPICED PERFECTION was
slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced along the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. PRINCESS CAUSEWAY was never a
threat. TAKE CHARGE ANGEL was through after a half.
