Footnotes
COWAN broke sharp and set the pace along the rail, dueled with a pair of rivals through the turn, dug in gamely inside of SHERIFF BLANCO in upper
stretch, repelled that foe at the furlong pole, and edged away under driving pressure. SHERIFF BIANCO had a slow start but quickly recovered and rushed
to vie for the lead four wide at the half mile pole, shifted to the three, then two path around the turn as other foes tired, dueled with COWAN for the lead in
upper stretch, but was repelled at the furlong pole and held place. LITTLE ALEX prompted the pace three wide, got outpaced between horses to a stalking
position into the turn, then kept on in the four path through the lane for a minor reward. BREAKING THE BANK saved ground from midpack and made a
mild advance along the rail through the lane. PETIT VERDOT vied two wide between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace between rivals at the five
sixteenths pole, and tired. CANDY MOVER had a slow start, saved ground before tipping to the three path turning for home, then offered a mild rally on his
left lead. CUZ broke well and was forwardly placed two wide, but faltered to midpack when a bit awkward switching leads into the turn, and failed to make an
impact. SEGURO was in range outside of rivals in the five path into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. BAYTOWN BEAR was squeezed
back early on, took the turn in the five to seven path, and failed to menace. BACK RING LUCK midpack four path, no factor. KISSIN ALEX was jostled
between horses early on, trailed in the three path and never got involved. REALLY SLOW was bumped between horses early on, then was outrun and
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
RUNNIN' RAY stalked in the three path through the first turn, inched forward and dueled outside of DADDY'S ON STRIKE into the far turn, drew off to a
clear advantage approaching the furlong pole, and held sway under driving pressure. GALINDO stalked from the pocket around the far turn, attempted to
angle out at the quarter pole, but was given no ground from ORO DE TEJANO, bumped with that foe while trying to force his way out, found clear racing
room in the four path at the furlong pole, edged place, and held off MARTIAL EAGLE late. MARTIAL EAGLE saved ground while trailing, advanced inside of
a rival around the far turn before shifting to the four, then five, path in upper stretch, and rallied mildly outside of rivals to miss place at the wire. DADDY'S
ON STRIKE set the pace while staying a bit off of the rail, came into the backstretch under a tight hold to slow the pace, dueled inside of the eventual winner
around the far turn, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, and gave way late. ORO DE TEJANO stalked in the four path, shifted down the to three
path when trying to keep GALINDO hemmed in behind the leaders turning for home, took a bump from that foe passing the quarter pole, then weakened
between horses in the final sixteenth. HOLY MUCHACHO raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turns, shifted to the six path in upper
stretch, and weakened. WHATA SHOW OFF tracked two wide from midpack, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
LIONITE tracked from the four path around the turn, shifted to the five path turning for home, rallied outside of inner rivals to bid for the lead at the furlong
pole, and drew off under driving pressure. SPOKANE EAGLE prompted the pace setter from the three path, inched forward and dueled for the lead around
the turn before building a clear advantage passing the quarter pole, but tired approaching the furlong pole, was headed there, and yielded. TOP BRASS was
bumped between horses early on, raced in midpack in the two to three path, then just edged show from an outer rival while between horses at the wire.
HARDLY A SECRET broke outwards, shifted off of the rail to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, tried for force his way to clear racing room but was not
allowed ground by SHAKES CREEK, bumped with that foe multiple times from the five sixteenths pole to the three sixteenths pole, sustained a bid once
clear, but was nipped at the wire for show. SHAKES CREEK was bumped early, settled off of the pace, was forced to the six path by HARDLY A SECRET
at the five sixteenths pole, bumped with that foe multiple times while trying to keep him in behind horses from the five sixteenths pole to the three sixteenths
pole, then got outfinished for minor rewards. AROUND THE DIAL stalked two wide, but lacked a bid inside of the leaders in upper stretch, then gave way
late. CALIFORNIA SWING shifted off of the rail to rally in upper stretch, but found traffic in the five path and had to steady briefly, then lacked a kick after
angling outwards. HE TAKES CHARGE was squeezed back at the start, trailed in the five to six path around the turn, then failed to menace. WAGON BOSS
chased four to three wide, and weakened. TAP FEVER off pace three wide, four path upper, no menace. SEVIER set the pace early on, dueled inside of a
rival around the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. FLAT LUCKY was no factor from the five path.

Footnotes
RIVERS OF LITE vied three wide early on, came under a drive to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, responded and made a three wide rebid turning for
home, drew off in upper stretch, and was kept to task to the wire. SPELLING BEE took the turn in the two path in midpack, split foes two wide at the furlong
marker to forge place, and held that position to the wire. ARCHRIVAL advanced in the four to five path at the five sixteenths pole to make a bid turning for
home, but only produced a mild rally, then missed in place. BROTHER AARON set the pace into the turn while inside a pair of rivals, but weakened
approaching the quarter pole. COMMISSARIO broke outwards, then vied two wide between horses, but failed to keep pace with his outer rival in upper
stretch, then weakened at the furlong pole. TAINO HOUSE took a slight bump at the start, angled from the four to the two path into the turn to stalk from the
pocket, waited for racing room behind the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, shifted four wide turning for home to attempt a bid between horses in upper
stretch, but came up empty, and weakened. JERZEES ONE had a slow start, trailed in the four path into the turn, then passed tired foes without making an
impact. TRUENO saved ground far off of the pace, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. ARCH DREAMER raced midpack early on,
but weakened into the turn. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS was midpack along the inside early on, but weakened into the turn.

Footnotes
PRINCESS TRINA had a shoe repaired in the paddock, stalked from the pocket while a bit off of the rail into the turn, angled inwards turning for home as
the inner leader left plenty of racing room along the rail, shot through and built a clear lead in upper stretch, then was ridden out to the wire. DARLIN ROSIE
stalked three wide while in the four path, forged ahead and made a bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was no match for her inner ground saving
rival in upper stretch, then kept on to secure place. STURDY ONE was squeezed back at the start, advanced from off of the pace in the four to five path to
be in range of the leaders while between horses turning for home, then sustained a mild rally for show. GO STELLAIRE settled far off of the pace in the two
path, them rallied mildly inside of horses through the lane. SWEET CARLI was bumped and bothered by her outer rival at the start causing her to stumble
and almost lose the rider, raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, shifted to the seven path into the lane, and failed to menace. PURE
SUGAR dueled inside of multiple rivals while a bit off of the rail around the turn, but drifted a bit wider straightening for home, allowing for ample running
room for the eventual winner, was surpassed by that foe in upper stretch, and subsequently weakened. TOLLY HO took the turn in the four to five path
before shifting to the six path turning for home, but weakened at the furlong pole. CHAMPAGNE BLING trailed in the three path around the turn, swung to
the six path turning for home, but was no factor. DRAMA RUN dueled outside of the leader through the turn while being kept in the three path, but was
swallowed up between horses at the quarter pole. BIT MONEY was forwardly placed along the inside early on, but weakened at the half mile pole and
steadily faded thereafter.
