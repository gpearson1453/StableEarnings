Footnotes
NOONSIGHT was rated inside rivals stalking the pacesetter under light rating to the far turn, tipped out midstretch and produced a steady late response to
wrest the advantage under firm right handed pressure. AGRIPINO went readily to the lead, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail, was roused
clear in upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner. NO REGRETS, reserved off the second flight three deep between foes racing to the backstretch,
swung out five wide entering the lane and produced his best stride late to gain a share. ABSALOM, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, continued in pursuit through the far turn and faded in late stages. RARE HUE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the
second bend, shifted three wide nearing the stretch while being roused to challenge but had no late bid. I AINT TELLIN, bumped at the start, was settled last
to the backstretch, switched out entering the lane and improved position four wide in late stages. CHIEF OF JOY broke out, bumping, was righted to track
off the second flight between foes to the far turn but lacked a late response. YADI, urged to a forward placing racing three deep in second flight, steadily
faded nearing the lane. MR. MAURICE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. MYSUREWINWILLIAMS
worked his way to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the backstretch but retreated early. SOUL KITTEN, caught four wide racing to the
backstretch, dropped out nearing the lane. MAYBEYESMAYBENO tracked just off the second flight inside, then between foes in the opening half but gave
way early.

Footnotes
LARGE, pulling against firm restraint four deep between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail through the opening quarter, came through close
quarters leaving the half mile marker to wrest the advantage, then held sway on a clear advantage to the end under firm steady pressure. TITHED broke
inwards bumping WILD ENOUGH, was righted while angling to the inside while being held up just off the eventual winner, tracked the leaders inside foes
racing into the turn, shifted off the inside while being roused to advance through the stretch but proved no match while edging a rival for the place honors.
INITFORTHELOVE, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, shifted off the inside nearing the half mile marker, continued in pursuit of the
winner to upper stretch and weakened late. STRUM AND PLUCK, reserved off the second flight racing outside a rival to the turn, split foes three deep
nearing the lane, shifted four wide entering the stretch and continued to gain position in a belated effort. MAGICAL ILLUSION, reserved off the second flight
near the inside, saved ground through the turn to the lane and made an effort to gain position inside foes. COURAGE DE LION, off a bit slowly, recovered
while being rated between foes in second flight racing into the turn, then faded into upper stretch. GOLDEN V C, forwardly placed three deep in the opening
stages, continued in pursuit in that path into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. THE EQUINEST tracked off the first flight racing four wide in the
opening quarter but soon retreated. BUC'S INVESTMINT made brief pursuit of the leaders five wide on the backstretch and dropped out early. WILD
ENOUGH, bumped, then shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, was reserved while dropping out last and trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
BATTLE CREEK, reserved off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position between foes after a half, angled to
the rail when presented an opening nearing upper stretch to challenge inside the leaders, came through to wrest the advantage entering upper stretch,
drifted out under left handed pressure but maintained a clear margin to the end. MY CHITU tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half,
advanced on the leaders racing four wide into the far turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch contesting the lead, couldn't match terms with the winner
late but edged rivals for the place honors. APPRAISED stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out nearing the far turn
to bid between foes entering the second bend, continued in a protracted skirmish to upper stretch while being bumped by JANGADA nearing the furlong
marker but kept on for a share while failing to match the top pair. TOLD IT ALL, caught a bit wide leaving the chute while being prompted to a forward
placing, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival into the backstretch, was prompted to challenge racing three deep entering the far turn, pressed the issue
between foes in that path to upper stretch while racing in close quarters but came up empty in late stages. JANGADA sprinted to the lead along the rail
leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin after a half to the far turn, briefly resisted several challenges while shifting off the rail nearing upper
stretch, ducked out bumping near midstretch and emptied out. GLACIER PARK switched well to the outside dropping well off the leaders racing four wide
into the backstretch, continued five wide into the lane but made an effort to improve position. BELIEVEITORNOT tracked off the second flight inside inside
foes under rating to the first turn, made brief progress midway through the backstretch racing nearest the rail but emptied out entering the far turn. EYES OF
GLORY tracked off the second flight three deep between foes, was prompted to lodge a brief bid five wide between foes nearing upper stretch but soon
flattened out. BAHAMIAN STAR proved no factor. CLEARING WAIVERS broke slowly, was settled between foes while shifting about in the opening half and
soon retreated. MISSUMAXWELL trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AMERICA'S QUEEN broke readily to gain a narrow advantage dictating the pace between foes under light rating, continued to attend the pace in hand
shifting off the rail racing into the turn while being headed momentarily midway through the bend, was prompted to regain a clear advantage under some
mild hand urging racing into upper stretch and drew away late under her own power in a ridden out effort. UNBRIDLEDMOONLIGHT, urged inside foes
prompting the pace from the outset into the bend, struck the front midway through the turn but proved no match for the winner in the last quarter. FOOT
RUB LOVE broke out bumping ROYALGLITZ at the start, angled sharply to the inside while being roused to gain a contending position behind the first flight,
continued along the inside into the lane but had no closing bid. TIDAL FIELD joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, continued to prompt the
leaders while being fanned four wide into the turn and faded nearing the lane. MARGIE'S ROUXBEE broke readily, then raced in pursuit of the first flight
four wide through the backstretch, shifted inwards on the turn while being urged to advance but had no late response. ROYALGLITZ, off slowly, then
bumped at the start, angled to the rail while settling last, saved ground through the bend and passed inside some tiring foes late. DISCRIMANATION,
bumped, then shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start, shifted inwards while being roused to gain contention but never seriously menaced. BLAZING
RUBY, off a step behind the leaders, angled to the inside early but failed to menace. TRAP GIRL, reluctant to load in the starting gate, raced six wide
through the backstretch and soon dropped out. SOY CELESTE proved no factor.

PROJECTED (GB) was rated between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail on the first turn to track just off the second flight, steadily drew into
contention after a half, briefly awaited an opening nearing the second bend, came through close quarters to bid for command between foes racing through
the far turn and went clear under firm handling. MR WRENCH IT, reserved along the rail racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn
steadily gaining position, then shifted out midstretch to split foes and prevail for the place honors. BUNSTER, urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing
into the first turn, shifted to the rail once clear, dictated the pace to the far turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge but gave way nearing midstretch.
QUALITY STEP, caught widest leaving the chute while being prompted to a contending position, tracked just outside the second flight to the backstretch,
was prompted to advance three deep between foes racing into the far turn to challenge for command but flattened out in upper stretch. NO CENTS LEFT
was settled between foes dropping off the second flight, shifted nearer to the inside approaching the stretch and continued evenly between foes in late
stages. STREET CODE tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the far turn. POWER WALKER, caught
four wide tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, made brief progress in that after a half but came up empty entering the far turn. MR LIGHTNING
BOY, urged to a forward placing along the rail, shifted out entering the backstretch to track just off the pacesetter between foes to the second bend but gave
way early. SEGISMUNDO broke slowly, was soon outdistanced but walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
LADY LOVE was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing the far turn, circled foes four wide
entering the second bend, angled inside the leaders nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. BLAZING
BROOKE tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight, advanced along the inside to bid for command inside the pacesetter midway
through the far turn, gained a brief advantage nearing the lane but proved no match when confronted by the winner. LUNA, reserved while angling inside
early, shifted outside a tiring foe to gain some position, shifted back to the rail entering the lane and prevailed for a share. FUN PADDY was settled between
foes racing to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside entering the stretch and was just outkicked for a share. DENVER settled last along the rail racing
to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into the stretch to gain some position but made no real impression. DARLINDIVA, forwardly placed just off the
inside tracking the pacesetter, was urged to bid for command three deep between foes entering the second bend but soon came up empty. PLEASANT
BUFFY sprinted to the lead racing to the first turn, held sway on a clear margin to the far turn and gave way once headed. HANDSOME GIRL tracked off the
second flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. OUR PETUNIA switched outside foes early gaining position in the second
flight, made pursuit of the pacesetter four wide to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
SUMMER LOVE prompted to a forward placing along the rail, conceded the lead to stalk a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering the far
turn while advancing to challenge, was floated three deep in upper stretch contesting the issue outside PURE RHYTHM but continued with a game
response to just edge that foe on the wire under firm handling. The latter tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out
nearing upper stretch to bid for command between foes, struck the front midstretch but couldn't contain the winner's final bid. ALL OTHERS FOLLOW (GB)
settled outside foes racing behind the third flight to the first turn, shifted out four wide while avoiding some traffic entering the backstretch, steadily advanced
four, then five wide into the stretch and edged rivals for a share. TOMORRA tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out
nearing the lane and continued with interest to gain some position four wide between foes late. COMPLETE SURPRISE tracked the leaders outside a rival
in second flight, shifted out three deep nearing the lane and continued between foes while lacking the needed final kick. PAU HANA tracked off the second
flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and was outkicked for a share. GLOBAL BRAND, reserved three deep between foes tracking off the
second flight in the opening half, shifted out racing into the lane but offered no late response. PYTHONESS settled while angling to the inside in the opening
half, made steady progress saving ground into the lane, then was checked avoiding traffic leaving the furlong marker. MIJET sprinted to the lead outside a
rival, angled to the rail once gaining, held sway to upper stretch and gave out abruptly. FASHION MO was settled outside foes, raced wide to the
backstretch and failed to menace. GALWAY STAR, pulling a bit between foes under restraint in the last flight racing to the backstretch, emptied out early.
HYPERLOOP, caught four wide tracking just off the second flight to the backstretch, retreated early.

Footnotes
KITCHEN FIRE broke sharply, sprinted away to a clear advantage racing into the turn, held sway under steady pressure and was gathered up approaching
the wire. PHILOSOPHY tracked the leader three deep between foes racing to the bend, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and finished with interest to
edge rivals for the place honors. STORM ADVISORY tracked off the second flight three deep between rivals in early stages, was held up avoiding close
quarters racing into the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch and improved position inside foes in the closing stages. STONE CARVER made pursuit
of the pacesetter four wide, then three deep between foes racing through the turn and gave way in the drive. LOST IN LIMBO, reserved outside foes behind
the second flight in early stages, angled inwards to split foes nearing the lane and continued evenly in late stages. CUESTION DE TIEMPO tracked off the
second flight between foes, angled to the rail entering the turn, came through when presented a opening nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but
quickly came up empty. ZORB tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight, shifted off the rail nearing upper stretch and quickly emptied out. LESS
THAN PERFECT, outpaced along the rail racing to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but failed to menace. LUDINGTON dropped out last in early stages,
angled five wide entering the stretch and proved no threat. IMA WILDCAT, caught four wide in early stages pursuing the pacesetter as part of the second
flight, emptied out racing into the turn.

Footnotes
VAUNT gained a forward placing from between foes attending a rival's pace under light rating racing into the turn, pressed the issue through the bend to
wrest the advantage nearing upper stretch, then went clear under right handed pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. WOWEE tracked off the
second flight along the inside into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady effort between foes to prevail for second in
the closing stages. FEBRUARYSEXCLUSIVE, bumped by SYZYGY, then forced in to the path of CALL ME LUCKY at the start, was settled into stride,
shifted inwards while being urged to split foes just off the inside racing into the turn, came through tight quarters into upper stretch to bid along the inside but
was outkicked for second. THEY CALL ME LUCKY, off a bit slowly, was bumped, then was shuffled back at the start, dropped well off the field to the turn,
swung out six wide gathering momentum nearing upper stretch and made some mild progress late. MERMAID KISSES ducked inwards making contact with
SYZYGY at the start, was urged to gain a forward placing outside foes, shifted in nearing the turn to track the leaders between foes in second flight but
faded into the stretch. MONJA was settled off the second flight early, raced five wide into the turn and lacked a rally. MY LITTLE FIRE, urged to gain the
lead while angling to the rail racing through the backstretch, dueled for command inside the winner into upper stretch and gave way. SYZYGY, bumped from
both sides at the start, was settled outside foes and failed to menace. LITTLE NATALIA, urged to contend while angling to the inside pursuing the leaders
racing through the backstretch into the turn, emptied out nearing midstretch. NOT REGRET tracked off the second flight along the inside to the turn but
never gained contention. ROMANTIC GIZMO proved no factor. TESSIE'S RED SOX flashed brief pace three wide in the opening quarter but gave way
abruptly racing into the turn.
