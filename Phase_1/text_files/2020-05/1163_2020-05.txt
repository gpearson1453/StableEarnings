GLITTER LAKE was outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide to mid turn then swung out five deep into the stretch, rallied when set down and wore down MISS
VANJIE NATION to win going away. MISS VANJIE NATION stalked the pace to the turn, bid four wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid stretch
then was outfinished but not threatened for second. PERFECT MOOD also stalked early, saved ground to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and
finished evenly. TAHOE BLUE hustled to the front, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. AUTISM BRILLIANCE pressed
the leader early then was brushed by SHAWNEE PASS leaving the seven sixteenths, raced three wide to the stretch then weakened. BIG FUN had no
speed, took up away from SHAWNEE PASS near the three eighths and was not a threat. SHAWNEE PASS was green early then ducked out leaving the
seven sixteenths, brushed AUTISM BRILLIANCE, steadied sharply and was outrun.

TOM'S SONG had good speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded in the drive and held. MANDO pressed the winner two wide to the
stretch, could not make an impact in the drive but was an easy second best. BRONY BOY chased the top two three wide to the stretch then lacked the
needed late response. MAGNIFICENT MAGS was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and came up empty. DENNIS CELERY had no
speed and was not a factor. WEAPON hesitated, broke slow then refused to stride out while racing very green and was outrun.

the pace early, inched away on the turn while saving ground, responded to mid stretch then resisted to deep stretch but was caught. TIZ THE STANDARD
was bumped on both sides at the stretch, got outrun to the turn, came three wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two. EARLYNTHEMORN was
chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. VIA ALPINA tracked the leaders early then saved
ground to no avail. CLASSIC KITTY was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then lacked a closing response. VENERATION had no speed, was
four wide on the turn and not a factor. ANGELS HOLIDAY hustled to contest the pace, got outkicked on the turn, gave out and was not persevered with late.

LIGHT pressed the winner two wide, loomed a threat to mid stretch then was outfinished while never in danger of second. HAMMERING LEMON was
chasing to the turn, shifted off the rail and came to wide to the stretch, got oukicked to mid stretch and did not rally. KALINE had no speed, was fanned four
wide to the stretch and was showing a bit of interest late. SARGENT LENZINI tracked the leaders three wide, was outkicked on the turn and came up empty
in the stretch. BODEGA broke inward, bumped AL MILLON BOB, had no speed, was two wide but did not rally. POGO got outrun to the turn, also raced in
the two path to the stretch but weakened in mid stretch. AL MILLON BOB was bumped by BODEGA at the start, had no speed and was always outrun.

ASSETS INCLUDED stalked the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then shifted off the rail, rallied between rivals and was along in time. SILENT
MOVIES also was never far back, raced three wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms in mid stretch but was outkicked for the win. PEPPER SINGS had
no speed, raced two wide to the stretch and was gaining ground belatedly. MANITOU attended the pace outside a rival, was two wide to the stretch, stayed
to mid stretch then weakened. JOEJOE'S KINGDOM hustled to be a pace factor from the rail to the stretch, also remained a threat to mid stretch but was
tiring late. TUSCAN WARRIOR chased the pace to the turn, was outkicked to the stretch and did not rally. BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY was always outrun.

READY FOR A FIGHT pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied when roused to collar LET'S REJOYCE in mid stretch and inched away under
steady urging. LET'S REJOYCE had the best speed but could not shake loose from the winner, saved ground to the stretch then was caught in mid stretch
but held the place. RUNKERRY tracked the top two while off the rail on the turn, shifted out for room in mid stretch and was closing steadily.
BEAUDACIOUS hesitated and broke slow, trailed to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch and finished with interest. TOM'S SURPRISE got
outsprinted early, shifted out and was four wide to the stretch then could not offer a closing response. INSANIAMANIA was chasing the leaders three wide
to the stretch then tired. REDACTION had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MANILA MISCHIEF lagged to the second turn, swung out five then six wide into the stretch, responded when clear while widest in the drive and closed with
a rush to be up in time. ALL GOOD tracked the pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, dueled to mid stretch, took a short lead in deep
stretch then could not stall the winner. KLONDIKE CREEK was unhurried to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch then was closing steadily
but outfinished. ON RAGLAN ROAD stalked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then responded in the drive but was also outkicked.
HOOTIE settled mid pack to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch, closed willingly but was outfinished. IRREFUTABLE set the pace under pressure
for six furlongs, saved ground and stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. MAJOR KONG had no speed, was three then four wide on the far turn, swung
out with the winner and six wide into the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. BIG BUZZ was allowed to settle for a half mile, came two wide
to the stretch but lacked a closing bid. RIVER OF CHAMPAGNE pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, also stayed on to mid stretch then gave way.

SHARP WARNING was hustled to contest the pace, dueled from the rail to the stretch, responded to edge clear to mid stretch and held stubbornly. BALIUS
was well placed off the leaders, came two wide to the stretch, looked to rally inside in mid stretch but shifted out and closed some ground. ALBANY FRONT
was chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and finished willingly. SYNTHETIC JOE was outsprinted early, raced three wide on the turn,
swung out widest for the drive and showed some late interest. YOU LIGHT ME UP attended the pace between rivals and two wide to the stretch, was
outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. QUAZE VIPER had no speed and was never a threat. OLYMPIC SILVER attended the pace outside two others,
was three wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and tired. SOUTH RIM trailed throughout.
