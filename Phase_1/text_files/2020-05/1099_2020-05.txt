Footnotes
MULBERRY pressed the pace, raced three deep through the lane and finished well to be clear late under strong encouragement. MISS PERFECTA set all
the pace from the inside and finished second best. BARONET stalked the pace from the inside, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had not enough late.
SOARING NOW was slow early, moved up along the far turn into the lane while racing towards the inside and never was a serious threat. SETTLE DOWN
EILEEN stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper lane and never was a factor. SEYNATAWNEE dropped back early and failed to
have a response. INDIAN GEM raced five wide around the first turn and never was a factor. HIGH CLASS EURO failed to sustain a bid.

DEJA SUE set all the pace from the inside, built a clear lead and held gamely under a steady hand ride. SUNDAY'S VISION stalked the pace along the
inside and was no match for the winner. RIGHTEOUS MOVER stalked the leader from the outside, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no final
winning bid. SHERRY BABE was allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside and had not enough late. SLIDAN was squeezed back at the break, raced
five deep in the lane and never was a serious threat. HUSHED stalked the pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no response. LETTER RIP was
unhurried early, raced towards the inside around the far turn into the stretch and failed to have a response. AWESOME SPARKLE settled early and never
threatened. KEANNA stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SKIPPERLITTTLEGIRL failed to
menace. KUCHEN settled off the early pace, raced six wide into the stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
ALEX'S BOURBON stalked the pace, moved up three wide through the far turn into the stretch and held gamely late under strong handling. PAPA MAMBO
stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. VERONICA'S DREAM was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and gained ground in the latter stages. TEN COUNT OUT pressed the pace and weakened through the drive. AUBREY was off slowly, raced four
wide through the lane and never was a factor. I'M SO MUNNY broke awkwardly, raced three wide down the backstretch, checked just past the three eighths
pole and weakened a bit late after a troubled trip. CHRISTIAN MISS showed good speed and gave way. SILVER MOON RISING settled off the early pace,
saved ground and never was a factor.

HUNKA BURNING LOVE was hard sent from the inside early, set all the pace along the inside, built a clear lead into the lane and was well clear late under
steady handling. SORRYABOUTNOTHING settled off the early going, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and was no match for the winner. STEPHEN'S
ANSWER stalked the pace, raced four wide in the stretch and weakened late. APALACHEE BAY was allowed to settle early, saved ground and had no
response. EAGLE PASS dropped back early, raced towards the inside through the far turn into the lane and never was a factor. TOUR DE FORCE settled
early, raced inside and failed to have a response. HERBIE stalked the pace and weakened through the drive. BROADWAY COUNTY showed good early
speed and tired readily.

final winning bid. TOTALITY raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SEAHAWK WAVE saved ground and never was a factor. ON THE
BRIDGE was slow early, raced five wide into the stretch and never threatened. HONOR DEPUTY failed to sustain a bid from the outside. GINGE raced four
wide in the lane and never was a factor. AQUAMARINE dropped back early and failed to menace. N C C JACK raced seven deep into the lane and never
threatened.
