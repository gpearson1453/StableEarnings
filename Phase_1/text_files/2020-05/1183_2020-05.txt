Footnotes
ALEXACRAT, reserved between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside while settling into stride racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide
leaving the far turn, then found her best stride in the closing stages to rally to the lead in time under firm right handed pressure. TIDAL FIELD sped clear of
her rivals to open a comfortable advantage, dictated the pace off the inside to the far turn, resisted several challenges racing past midstretch but was
collared by the winner late. I AM A. LURING, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking position under light rating, was prompted to
advance three deep racing into the far turn, then moved to challenge midstretch but was outkicked. BIZ MAKER, off slowly, was settled outside foes racing
to the backstretch, was fanned five wide leaving the far turn but displayed some late interest to gain some position. SHE BROKE MY HEART tracked the
leaders between rivals from just out of striking distance, was prompted to split foes gaining position after a half, angled to the rail racing into the far turn,
lodged a brief bid inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch but soon flattened out. COMMISSION tracked the leaders outside foes just off the second
flight, made brief progress racing four wide into the far turn but proved empty in the drive. TRINNI SUNSET tracked the pacesetter inside foes to the
backstretch and faded after a half.

Footnotes
COTTON TOOYAH raced three deep between foes under light reserve racing to the backstretch, was prompted to commence a steady advance racing in
the four path on the far turn, moved to challenge for command three deep between foes racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage and held CROWN
OF JOY on a safe margin to the end under firm encouragement. The latter settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched
out entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, swung out five wide entering the lane while moving to challenge but was outkicked. SUNSET
EMPIRE broke sharply, sprinted well clear of her rivals into the backstretch racing in the two path, held sway to upper stretch but faltered nearing the furlong
marker. SPEEDING STARLET tracked the leader inside a rival as part of the second flight, was prompted along the inside racing through the far turn, then
shifted out in the closing stages while making an even effort. ANDITSAFACT ducked out at the start, raced four wide into the first turn, then passed between
tiring rivals in the closing stages. LAPULGA, reserved while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground throughout but made no
impression. NIGHTSTORM settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. PUT POSITION, forwardly placed
between rivals tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance, was prompted to make a brief bid nearing upper stretch but soon flattened out.

Footnotes
DRILLOMATIC was prompted to a position outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the second bend, then
was prompted through close quarters to advance three deep on the far turn, moved to wrest command in that path racing into upper stretch and kicked clear
under firm encouragement. GATE CREW was settled last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide in upper stretch and
continued willingly outside foes to close the gap while prevailing for the place honors. LION CHARMER tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the
backstretch, was held up mometarily while being fanned four wide racing into the far turn, continued in pursuit just outside the eventual winner into upper
stretch but had no final kick. FLY NIGHTLY tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, angled to the rail on the far turn to advance inside
foes nearing upper stretch, steadied in close quarters nearing midstretch and had no late response. DIZZY SIGHT, reserved near the inside racing to the
backstretch, passed only tiring rivals. NO REGRETS was settled outside foes in the last flight, shifted inwards nearing the lane to split foes but had no
closing bid. DRIFTWOOD sprinted to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, set the pace to the far turn and emptied out nearing midstretch. HUBBA
BUBBA tracked off the second flight inside foes and dropped out early. CALIFORNIA SUN, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival to the first turn,
eased off that rival through the backstretch, was urged to bid for command between foes nearing upper stretch but quickly gave way entering the lane.
PAPA RALPH J tracked just off the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight and steadily faded racing into the far turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE RIDER OF LION CHARMER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE FURLONG
MARKER BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
HAY HAY MY MY, pulling against restraint tracking the pacesetter inside foes racing into the first turn, was held up while shifting off the inside entering the
backstretch, switched out three wide after a half while commencing his advance, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and responded to firm handling
to wrest command and go clear in late stages. PRIZED WARRIOR broke readily, was rated stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted
inwards nearing the second bend to bid for command inside the pacesetter entering the far turn, contested the issue between foes into upper stretch but
proved no match for the winner while prevailing for the place honors. ODESSA GOLD tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was caught, four,
then five wide racing through the far turn but continued with interest in that path to gain some position late. OLD FORT tracked off the second flight between
rivals, angled to the inside entering the far turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. RICKY RUN, reserved off the second
flight, shifted inwards nearing the backstretch while pulling his way to contention between foes after a half, then faded along the inside racing into the
stretch. CHADS CHOICE was briskly roused to gain the lead while shifting off the rail racing to the backstretch, set the pace to the far turn and gave way
between foes nearing upper stretch. WHEELBARRELBROTHRS, caught wide early, proved no threat. STERLING JUDGE tracked off the second flight
three wide between foes and retreated early. DISTINCTLY BREWED proved no factor.

Footnotes
SUGAR FIX was rated outside foes tracking just off the leaders into the backstretch, shifted four wide nearing the far turn while being prompted to
contention, continued in that path to upper stretch making steady progress and wrested the advantage from JOYOUS TIMES in the closing stages under
firm handling. The latter gained a forward placing stalking the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted three deep entering the backstretch
while steadily moving to terms with the leaders, was urged to bid for command in that path nearing upper stretch, gained the advantage midway through the
lane, resisted the winner while shifting out brushing that foe but came up second best. QUEENS EMBRACE, reserved off the second flight along the inside
to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the stretch and closed the gap on the top pair in a belated rally. REAL DOOZIE stalked just off the
pacesetter along the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out entering the backstretch while moving to close the gap after a half, pressed the issue between
foes racing into the far turn to gain a brief advantage but gave way entering the lane. WHISPER SLOW tracked off the second flight outside foes to the
backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leaders while shifting out three wide in the stretch but had no closing response. VOLADOR was rated off the second
flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn but steadily faded into the stretch. FORTUNATE CAT sprinted clear while
angling to the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, briefly dueled inside foes but gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
NICOLE MUNNINGS raced between rivals stalking just off the leaders under light reserve into the backstretch, continued under patient handling to the
second bend, tipped out three deep leaving the midway point of the far turn to bid for command nearing upper stretch, drifted out under pressure racing
through the lane but went clear under firm encouragement. OSVALDO tracked off the second flight racing three deep to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance four wide racing into the far turn, shifted inside the winner while being roused to challenge that foe in upper stretch but proved only second best.
AMERICA'S SIMMARD tracked off the second flight outside rivals, was caught five wide on the far turn while coming under pressure to advance, continued
in that path through the stretch and made mild progress while gaining a share. CAPE MARCO DRIVE, reserved in early stages racing just off the inside,
split foes three wide gaining position racing into the stretch but finished evenly late. PRISON PADRE settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, was fanned six wide through the stretch but continued with an effort to improve position. BIG YES switched off the inside tracking the leaders
as part of the flight racing to the backstretch, angled inside rivals entering the far turn and steadily faded. CPL. DIONICIO, in touch with the pacesetter from
the outset prompting that rival to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes through the far turn but came up empty in the drive. UPPER CROWN was
settled near the inside and never gained contention. SUNSHINES OUT urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, dueled for
command just off the rail racing into the far turn and gave way into the lane. MIDNIGHTONBROADWAY dropped out early.

Footnotes
DUBBY DUBBIE shifted inwards while gaining a forward placing stalking just off the pacesetter leaving the chute, switched outside the leader racing into the
backstretch stalking that foe under light rating, was urged to press the issue leaving the far turn into the lane and edged forward in time under firm
encouragement. COLTRANE sped to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, skirmished
inside the winner resisting that foe to late stages but came up second best. BLUE SKY KOWBOY, reserved between rivals dropping off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into the far turn while continuing under patient handling, saved ground through the far turn, then angled
out four wide racing through the stretch to edge a rival for a share. TOTAL TAP tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, steadily
drew into contention nearing the far turn, shifted three deep midway through that bend while being urged to challenge nearing upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. FRENCH GETAWAY, reserved off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and finished evenly late. DAZZLING
TRUTHS tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, was fanned five wide racing into the lane but had no late bid. THE CURT FOX (GB)
was settled last outside a rival to the backstretch, then shifted out to split foes three wide in the closing stages while making no real impression. HOPE
AGAIN (GB) was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside nearing the lane but never gained contention. LESS THAN PERFECT,
urged to gain a forward placing racing three deep into the backstretch tracking just off the pacesetter, came up empty racing into the far turn. MR WRENCH
IT dropped out early.

Footnotes
PURE RHYTHM, reserved along the inside tracking off the second flight in the opening stages, gathered momentum splitting rivals nearing the far turn,
continued with a sharp rally to challenge for command three deep nearing upper stretch, moved well clear under pressure racing into the lane and was
taken in hand late. EVER SMART, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch, pressed the issue through the far turn but proved no
match when confronted by the winner while best of the others. COMPLETED was rated three deep between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch,
was held up momentarily when racing in close quarters midway through the far turn, shifted inwards entering the lane while being prompted to gain some
position, then steadied in close quarters late while continuing well enough to prevail for a share. TIMELESS ROSE tracked the leaders four wide in second
flight racing to the backstretch and continued evenly outside rivals into the stretch. COMMAND POINT, shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start, settled
into stride shifting a bit off the inside, angled out nearing the lane to gain some position, then altered course avoiding traffic in late stages. BAND
SWEETHEART, urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dueled for command racing into the far turn and gave way into the stretch.
CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. BABY GIRL, urged to forward placing three deep racing to
the backstretch, steadily faded between rivals nearing the lane. DARK LIGHTNING was rated inside rivals in second flight in the opening half but came up
empty entering the far turn. BLAZING DIVA proved no factor.
