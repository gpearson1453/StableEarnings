Footnotes
JULIARD HONOR pressed the early pace, raced two wide throughout and finished well to prevail under all out pressure. JOLLYVILLE was allowed to settle
early, moved up four wide into the lane and gained ground in the final stages. BADADDATUD showed good speed from the inside and weakened through
the drive. DO YOU BILEVE settled off the early pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. OLIVE COUNTY stalked the pace,
raced evenly and had no rally while racing three deep. ITSAGRUFFWHIRL was off slowly, raced six wide into the lane and improved his position in the
drive. AIN'T NO FOOL raced three wide in the stretch and never was a factor. GOINGTOBE PLEASANT stalked the pace and tired along the inside.
VANTABULOUS raced five wide around the first turn and never was a factor. LUCKILY failed to sustain a bid.

KOTTONCANDY KISSES stalked the pace, moved up along the inside in the stretch and just got up under strong encouragement. MAUI JANE was allowed
to settle early, moved up five wide into the stretch, raced between rivals late and finished gamely to just miss. FOREIGN CREATION was slow early, moved
up five wide at the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. BILLIE G stalked the pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no final winning bid.
EUTYCHIA was slow early, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had not enough late. SHEZA HOT FLASH stalked the early going and tired. QUEEN OF
ALVA stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide through the stretch and never was a factor. MIZZ MATTIS pressed the pace and tired along the
inside. DREAMING SILENT showed good early speed and tired readily.
