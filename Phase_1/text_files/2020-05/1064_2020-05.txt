Footnotes
C P QUALITY close up early inside, fell back early turn, picked up and moved out to be three wide by late in the bend, engaged the leader past the furlong
marker and drove clear. GIRO KATE stalked the pace off the inside, two path through the turn, fell back off the top two in upper stretch, came back for the
place while not a threat to the winner. MOONLIGHT TRAIN void of early foot, swung out to be six wide turning for home, closed with good energy to be up
late for the show. DESTINY'S LOVE broke sharp, sprinted clear early, dropped to the inside, continued to show the way by daylight in upper stretch, faltered
when confronted the final furlong. COOK MEMORIES settled in mid pack in the three path, continued to race evenly into the lane, managed to improve
position slightly with some mild late interest. WILLOW MOON behind the first flight out in the strip, continued four wide through the turn, lacked a late punch.
MISS OCEAN EXPRESS raced back, improved a bit while saving ground, no real threat. AS FAST AS YOU CAN in the second flight while racing just off the
inside, had little left for the drive. MOLLY'S GAME void of early foot, angled out to be six wide turning for home, managed little in the way of a rally. GEMINI
JOURNEY five wide through the turn, tired. POINT STREAK used early to move up to head up the second flight, gave way in the turn. WESTLODGE
INTRIGUE was finished after a half.

Footnotes
TEZ void of early foot while three wide into the first turn, moved inside, improved while saving ground through the second turn, steered out a bit for room
turning for home, kicked down leader under firm handling. PRAETORIAN closest to the leader, collared that foe midway on the final turn, well clear past the
furlong marker, could not contain the winner, lasted for the place. SO ALIVE off a step slow, raced back off the early pace, two path second turn, three wide
into the lane, finished well to be getting to the runner in the late going. ROAR OF THE LION void of speed, trailed for over a half, steered out sharply to be
widest for the drive, finished well while too late. POST CLOSE forwardly placed off the inside, had little left for the drive. PEPPERED settled in mid pack well
out in the strip, continued outside, four wide through the final turn, lacked a closing kick. COWORKER lacked early foot, fanned six wide turning for home,
also failed to muster a closing kick. COLOMBARD tracked the leaders while off the inside, three wide through the final turn, backed up through the stretch.
MR. ANKENY broke on top, clear into the first turn, continued hold a daylight advantage up the backstretch, gave way when headed by the runner up
midway on the final turn. C H JAY settled toward the inside, gave way in the drive. BAQUERO FLIES was finished early, well back.

Footnotes
TIDDLY settled early while just off the inside, angled out four wide turning for home, set down, late bid, determined. BETTYANN forwardly placed while just
off the inside, angled three wide turning into the stretch, took over just inside the furlong marker while widest of the first flight, led late, second best. TOO
PRETTY bothered at the start, in mid pack for a half while racing along the inside, angled out for the drive, along for the show. LIL TATER bothered at the
start to be last to leave, dropped inside to save some ground through the turn, improved position in the drive. R MARIE away in good order, dueled up front
in the two path for a half, gradually weakened through the stretch. ALL ABOUT CLARA lacked speed in the two path, made little impact in the drive. NAPILI
went one paced while racing four wide. JEWELED CROWN raced in the three path turn, had little for the drive. PRESLEY dueled up front along the inside,
gave way in the drive. THE MARY ROSE bothered start, remained always back in failing to threaten. BLUE MERMAID broke out, trailed most of the way,
outrun. LUCKY EVERY DAY behind the pace off the inside, four wide turning for home, stopped, eased, jogged in.

Footnotes
PARCHED moved up to vie three wide into the first turn, continued to contest the issue the in the run up the backstretch, dueled through the latter half of the
final turn, long drive, proved narrowly best in a game effort. BUBBAS DIXIE settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground into and through most of
the final turn, steered out slightly for room exiting that bend, challenged outside the winner nearing the furlong ground, outkicked in the late going. KRISTO
steadied into the first turn when a bit rank, rated back, advanced when asked along late in the final turn, late while widest at the wire, not enough in the
waning strides. DAPPER JACK broke on top, set or forced the pace while closest to the inside, gradually weakened. SATELLITE broke slowly, void of early
early foot in trailing, three wide through both turns, found best stride too late while finishing up willingly. MALLARD'S BRO void of speed, four wide through
the final turn, improved position while not a serious threat. HINTON moved out to be four wide through the first turn, continued four wide in an even effort.
PLUMBAGO failed to menace. CANDY MY BOY in mid pack for a half, tired. DREAM BABY DREAM vied up front while between rivals, began to give way
in the second turn, moved out to be four wide turning for home when weakening, continued to tire through the stretch. TITOCHIP was always outrun. H. M.
S. PINAFORE steadily faded, finished far back.

Footnotes
HIGH PROOF broke in good order, set or forced the pace inside, long drive, dug in late to prevail in game fashion. SUPER CONSTITUTION pressed the
issue early while three wide, challenged on the outside in the turn, dueled to the wire outside the winner, outfinished in the late going. FLEETWOOD SHAC
in the second flight just off the inside, up for the show late, no match for the top two. SILARDI pressed the winner early off the inside, moved up to vie
between the top two in the turn, weakened in the drive, lost show late. ONAWAY back off the pace and the inside, steadied in some traffic into the turn,
remained four wide through the bend, improved slightly with some mild late interest. INIS GLUAIRE off the pace and the inside, four wide into the turn, three
wide exiting, evenly through lane. THE FEATURE broke back, made little impact while racing off the inside. VASARIANO lacked speed well out in the strip,
floated out six wide exiting the turn, failed to muster a rally. KICKIN' KIRBY in pack off the inside, angled out to be five wide late in the turn, came up empty
as well for the stretch run. MUNDACIOUS off a step slow, remained always back. FAST CASH within striking distance while racing along the inside,
retreated. SERBIAN SAILOR was always back.

Footnotes
MAN IN THE CAN forwardly placed from the start, advanced on the leader into the far turn, dueled with that rival into the lane, shook clear past the furlong
marker, responded when the winner came alongside late, dug in the final strides to narrowly prevail. K J'S NOBILITY bumped start, unhurried in the early
going, saved ground through the the second turn, angled out for the drive, drifted in and brushed with HAMAZING VISION past the furlong marker,
challenged outside the winner late, outkicked in the final yards. PROSPECTOR FEVER last to leave, void of speed early, rallied four out to five wide exiting
the final turn, finished up willingly to earn the show. BANDIT POINT lacked early foot, three wide out of the final turn, displayed some modest late interest ot
improved position a bit. HAMAZING VISION bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, moved closer while four wide late in the final turn, appeared to be
flattening out in midstretch, when brushed and bothered slightly by a drifting runner up, continued to weaken. SOUIXPER CHARGER broke on top, set the
pace inside, responded briefly when challenged by the winner late in the final turn, then began to falter when headed by that same rival. PROMISING
SHOES broke back, void of any early foot in trailing well back, continued to trail second turn, moved out three wide then improved by passing mostly tiring
rivals. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN settled in mid pack while racing off the inside, failed to respond when called on for the drive. GLACKEN'S GHOST forwardly
placed in the early going, faded. HERITAGE PARK settled off the pace three wide, faltered in the drive. DESTINY WAY four wide in the first turn, continued
well out in the strip, four wide again in the second bend, tired in the drive. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, THE
RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
PIECE OF MY HEART broke sharp, narrowly showed the way into the first turn, got clear onto the backstretch, was given a breather in the far turn, some
her margin diminish late in that bend, clear again into the lane, drifted out under a left handed stick, held the runner up comfortably safe late. COMICAL
pressed the early pace, fell back after a quarter, saved ground through the second turn, crept closer turning for home, could not get to the winner late,
clearly second best. ANTOINETTE forwardly placed, stalked the issue from the second flight while three wide the middle half mile, closer in the two path
turning for home, flattened out to finish up best of the rest. DAPHNE MOON off a step slow, raced back, moved closer while four wide in the second turn,
also failed to sustain that advance in the drive. GINGHAM moved outside in the first turn, continued three wide in the run up the backstretch, three wide
advance in the second flight late in the second turn, lacked a further response in the drive. STRONG FLAG lacked early foot, moved inside to save ground
through the final turn, no real threat in the drive. TURNSTONE back off the early pace, inside, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. HIS
GLORY pressed early, chased the winner off the inside the middle half mile and gave way, well back. SHANGHAI KEELY broke out, five wide into the first
turn, continued to race wide, far back.

Footnotes
SWISS SKYDIVER closest to the leader while off the inside, went after that rival into the far turn from the outside, dueled into the stretch, extended drive,
wore that same rival down under firm handling. VENETIAN HARBOR broke in good order and quickly sprinted clear, set a quick set of fractions while under
light restraint, responded when the winner challenged far turn, dueled into the lane, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker before giving ground
grudgingly, remained well clear of the others. SHEDARESTHEDEVIL broke in to bother KANSAS KIS, in some traffic well off the inside through the first
turn,dropped inside for the second bend, moved out a tad midway on that bend when beginning to advance, moved back to the inside for the drive to annex
the show, no match for the top two. ALTA'S AWARD four wide into the first turn, raced well back off the pace, three wide turning for home, was bothered by
LAZY DAISY nearing the furlong grounds when that rival came out, drifted in soon after to put that foe in tight, improved position, outkicked for the show.
FIRE CORAL clipped heels then lost irons past the wire the first time, fell far back, remained in the back for the run up the backstretch, swung out five wide
turning for home, improved position while finding her best stride too late. LAZY DAISY moved inside to save some ground in the first turn, mid pack the
middle four furlongs, raced along the inside into the lane, came out to bother ALTA'S AWARD, brushed with that one when the latter came in soon after,
steadied then finished up evenly. LAKE AVENUE settled in the second flight while racing in the two path, continued to chase the leaders into the stretch,
had little left for the drive. RING LEADER chased the two leaders through those quick fractions while three wide and weakened. ICE PRINCESS void of
early, saved ground in the second turn, came up empty for the drive. BRITISH IDIOM void of early speed, four wide through the final turn, weakened in the
drive. HARVEY'S LIL GOIL lacked speed and was not involved while racing off the inside. KANSAS KIS bothered and bumped at the start to be off slowly,
raced back, came five wide into the stretch when moving a bit closer, lacked further bid. NEW YORK GROOVE lacked speed while four wide through the
first turn, continued outside to be also four wide in the second bend, tired in the drive. LADY GLAMOUR behind the pace off the inside, three wide into the
far turn, gave way soon after, far back, jogged in. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LAZY DAISY AGAINST ALTA'S REWARD FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SPEND SPEND SPEND broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, asked along when confronted past the furlong marker, dug in
late to prevail in game fashion. UNIQUE FACTOR behind the pace outside, circled up to be five wide into the lane, challenged outside the winner entering
the furlong grounds, dueled to the wire, outfinished. STIRRED forwardly placed outside, pressed the issue in the four path through the turn, could not keep
up with the top two in the drive, comfortably saved the show. PROFOUND LEGACY with the pace off the inside, pressed three wide and between rivals
through the turn, weakened in the drive. WHOLEHEARTED went evenly while just off the inside. LA CHANCLA moved up after the start to forced the pace,
weakened in the drive. SARA SEA within striking distance inside, steadied into the turn, in tight, steadied again turning for home, backed up. RAHWAY last
away, raced back, not a threat. FUGITIVE LADY lacked speed, failed to muster a rally while three wide. RAINTREE STARLET was finished early.
