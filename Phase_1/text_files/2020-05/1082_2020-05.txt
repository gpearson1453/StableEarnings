JANE stalked the early pace, raced three deep around the far turn into the lane and just missed in a game effort. KOTTONCANDY KISSES was unhurried
early, angled three wide at the eighth pole and gained ground in the latter stages. MIZZ MATTIS sprinted clear early and was empty in the drive.
WHIMSICAL TALE stalked the pace, raced two wide and had no response. EMILY ELIZABETH raced six wide around the first turn and never was a factor.
OH NO WATA stalked the pace and tired. FFURGIE failed to sustain a bid. TOCDIRTYTOME settled off the early pace, saved ground and never
threatened.

Footnotes
KEENA showed good speed while racing just off the inside, kicked on gamely into the stretch and was clear late under a steady hand ride. THE ONE FOR
FUN showed good speed from the inside and was no match for the winner in the final stages. SEEING DOUBLE stalked the pace, raced towards the inside
and had no final winning bid. TICKLE BUNNY stalked the pace, raced four wide through the lane and had no response. FOREIGN CREATION was allowed
to settle early, saved ground and never was a factor. POLLY TIZ stalked the pace and tired in the drive. MIGHTY HEIDI was unhurried early, raced along
the inside in the lane and never threatened. FLYRTIE ROCKETTE trailed throughout.

PLATINUM NIGHTS stalked the pace, raced four wide in the lane and finished well to prevail under all out pressure. RECORDER stalked the early pace,
saved ground throughout and finished well through the drive to finish second best. YOUNG HENDRICK showed good speed from the inside and weakened.
BLAISING GUITAR stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no response. BAYSIDER settled off the early pace, raced three wide at
the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. NACOGDOCHES was off slowly, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. CAT ADDICTION was
allowed to settle early, raced four deep nearing the eighth pole and never was a serious factor. JAZZ MUSIC was hustled early and faded.

COMMUNICADO stalked the pace along the inside, angled out near the upper stretch to the four path and just got up in his final strides under strong
encouragement. TAYLA stalked the pace, raced three wide in the stretch and just missed in a game effort. SATTERSFIELD settled off the early pace,
moved up five wide into the upper stretch and closed in on the latter stages. DIAL EM IN stalked the pace, saved ground throughout and weakened a bit
late. ANY OLE THING was slow early, moved up two wide through the far turn in the stretch and had not enough late. SHAKER BAKER stalked the pace
while racing between and weakened. BELLA KRISTINA showed good speed and gave way. SIN CITY failed to respond.
