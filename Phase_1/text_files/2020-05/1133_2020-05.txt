Footnotes
SEBASTIANNA stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide into the the stretch and finished well to be clear late under strong handling.
SITONYA'SSPIRIT stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside in the drive and finished second best. MY PASSWORD showed good early speed,
raced just off the inside and weakened a bit late. MISS GEMMA B pressed the pace while racing between rivals and weakened in the latter stages.
GODDESS OF WONDER pressed the pace, raced four deep at the eighth pole and weakened. SHADYNGRAY was allowed to settle early, raced five wide
into the upper stretch and had not enough late. ZIPPED settled off the early pace, was bothered near the three eighths pole by loose horse, raced three
deep in the stretch and never threatened. SUNNY BUNNY was off slowly, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. PULPIT'S PRINCESS dropped
back early, took up sharply at the half mile pole and never threatened. JUST WHAT I NEEDED stumbled at the break and unseated his jockey.

R V T THUNDER ROAD raced five wide around the first turn, stalked the early pace and drew off to be well clear late under a steady hand ride. PULPIT PIE
stalked the pace, raced towards the inside and was no match for the winner. MAYFAIR HEIGHTS stalked the leaders, raced three wide in the drive and had
not enough late. GONE CRUISING was slow early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and made a mild late gain. SMILIN CAT was off slowly, raced
along the inside and had no response. WHAT THINKING was unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. REAL EASY
settled off the early pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never threatened. MIDNIGHT DRAMA showed good speed and gave way. PRESLEY
CHIME failed to respond. LITTLE BUBS failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
SWEET MARY M set all the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear under all out pressure. BRIGHT BLING pressed the early leader while racing
two wide, took aim inside the eighth pole but couldn't get by to finish second best. FRUGAL BETTY stalked the pace, moved up three wide and finished
willingly to the wire. BREW CASA stalked the pace, saved ground and had no final winning bid. JUSTABOUTRIGHT was allowed to settle early, raced five
deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. BETWEEN THE ARCHES was slow early, raced seven wide into the stretch and never was a factor.
APPLE COUNTY settled off the early pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and menaced. ROYAL SOPRANO bobbled at the break, raced three deep
and never was a threat. SHANGHAI SALLY saved ground and never threatened.
