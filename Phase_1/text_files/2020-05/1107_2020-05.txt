Footnotes
THUNDEROUS bumped with MARYLEE not long after the start, saved ground well back through the opening half-mile, rallied between rivals in the two path
around the far turn, swung four wide nearing the lane, closed between rivals and was up in deep stretch. MARYLEE bumped with the winner soon after the
start, settled well back two wide, circled four wide around the far turn, was pushed further out when the winner swung out nearing the eighth pole, rallied
widest and was narrowly outkicked. TINA'S SONG set a pressured pace along the rail for five furlongs, kicked clear nearing the lane and led until deep
stretch. LADYS CROSS FIRST was devoid of speed while saving ground for a half, advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. SING
FROSTY dueled two wide for five furlongs then tired. WEST VIRGINIA PAM had some speed four wide, angled to the rail midway down the backstretch and
faded inside. LIL TROUBLE saved ground and failed to menace. BREAK DANCIN stalked the duel in the clear three and retreated around the far turn. THIS
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
ROCK ON pressed the pace two wide, seized a short lead nearing the lane, continued on his left lead and edged ahead under a drive. BULLGRATS set a
pressured pace inside of the winner to upper stretch and was second best in the lane. KULANI was bumped at the start, saved ground well back, angled two
wide nearing the lane and rallied for the show. LUCKY NED PEPPER chased the top two while racing two wide and lacked the needed the rally. HEY PREZ
was severely impeded at the start, advanced three wide around the turn and finished with interest. NOT A TRICK was slammed into another at the start,
raced in midpack two and three wide and never threatened. WINDSOR CALLING chased the pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane. SYNERGY
UNBRIDLED veered in at the start, slamming into NOT A TRICK causing that one to shut off HEY PREZ and bump KULANI, raced mostly wide and was
always outrun. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and took no action.

READY TO CHARM dueled two wide to midstretch and drove clear. BRET'S LEGACY raced off the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch, rallied and
gained the place in the final strides. TUN TUN dueled inside of the winner to midstretch, could not keep pace with that foe from there and lost second in the
final strides. RIVER FLYINRED RVF gave distant chase outside down the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn, angled back out in upper stretch
and made a mild gain. BRILLIANT BOLT lacked speed while racing two wide, swung five wide nearing the eighth pole and improved position late. JUST GO
WITH IT raced off the duel two wide and faded around the turn. MAD MINER was outrun inside. ANTAGONIZER failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
CALADAN led at the rail early, was content to let a rival speed off to the lead and stalk the pace two wide, regained command near the three-eighths pole,
cleared entering the far turn, quickly drew off then widened while ridden out through the lane. THE PREDICTOR settled off the pace while saving ground,
moved into second while racing two wide around the far turn and bested the rest. POSHSKY settled off the pace while racing two wide around the first two
turns, was angled to the far outside early on the backstretch, advanced four wide around the far turn and was along for the show. EL EMANUEL was
unhurried inside early, went three wide around the clubhouse turn, raced four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. SCHLOSSER had early speed
between foes, cleared off and angled in the first time through the stretch, set the pace around the clubhouse turn, vied inside of the winner down most of the
backstretch and could not keep pace from the quarter pole. WHISKEY CREEK broke slowly, saved ground throughout and never threatened. CHARITABLE
HERO was outrun while racing two wide. CHARMING DEPUTY chased the pace three wide and was through after three-quarters. I NEED YOU was always
outrun.

Footnotes
SNIFF was hustled from the gate, led early, ceded the lead late on the first turn, stalked inside, angled out nearing the far turn, re-bid two wide, seized
command near the three-sixteenths pole, drew clear near the eighth pole and held safe to a diminishing lead under a drive. BACKCAT broke outwardly,
raced two wide in midpack, advanced three wide around the far turn, continued on her left lead in the lane, closed widest and ran out of ground. FLOATING
BY was unhurried while saving ground early, made some progress two wide around the far turn, continued on her left lead in the lane and rallied for the
show. THESWEETESTTABOO had early speed between rivals around the first turn, took a clear lead near the five-sixteenths pole, angled in entering the
far turn, was collared near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened inside. SAINTE THERESE failed to menace while racing three wide. RETURN TO
DENIS was bumped at the start, saved ground and played no factor. VONDA saved ground in midpack, went three wide around the far turn and lacked a
closing bid. IM A TRICKY ONE was squeezed back at the start, saved ground and played no further factor. TOTO'S DARLING rushed up three wide to the
lead, cleared early on the backstretch and stopped soon thereafter.

Footnotes
OUR DIAMOND GIRL engaged in a protracted duel inside of THREE BOPS, lost the lead in upper stretch, battled back inside and prevailed. THREE BOPS
dueled outside of the winner throughout, battled on gamely through the lane and lost the head bob. PEACEFUL CHILD saved ground off the pace, swung
four wide nearing the lane and rallied for the show. PIPERS GOLD chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. COPELANQUIKZIP had early
speed outside, dropped back two wide around the turn and finished evenly. TAPTAP was shut off at the start, saved ground and never threatened. ELAINE
was outrun while racing two wide. MEET MS BOBBI RAE steadied near the three-eighths pole, raced two wide around the turn and never menace.
KNOBIE'S SONDE played no factor while racing four wide. GOT ANY steadied along down the backstretch, raced three wide around the turn and made
little impact.

Footnotes
TALKBACK stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole, drew clear around the far turn, continued on her left lead in the lane and
held sway under a drive. COOL MO was fractious in the start, was caught four wide between foes nearing the first turn, steadied entering the bend, dropped
back and angled into the two path, made progress two wide around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and continued on willingly to narrow the gap.
RIGHT NOTION saved ground off the early pace, moved up three wide around the far turn and clearly bested the rest. NURSE TOMPKINS was bumped
just after the start, saved ground off the pace early, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. TRUE PURPOSE failed to menace while
racing two and three wide. NORTHERN HEAT raced four wide throughout and played no factor. HERAWAY was bumped at the start, disputed the pace
along the rail and was through after a half. DANCING DESTINY was bumped just after the start, was hard sent to the lead between foes and retreated
around the far turn. SINGINDOWNTHELANE was caught four and five wide around the first turn, saved ground rounding the far turn and was outrun.

JACOB T set a heavily pressured pace two wide between rivals, was collared in upper stretch, fought on outside of that rival and regained command in deep
stretch. FEAR THE LATI stalked the four ply duel in the two path, angled to the rail nearing the lane, bid inside of the winner turning for home, briefly led in
upper stretch, drifted out a bit under incessant left-handed urging and was outfinished late. BRO LATTE settled off the pace while racing two wide,
advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. LASS MOMENT dueled three wide between foes to upper stretch and weakened. MINI
BOLT dueled along the rail inside of the winner to the quarter pole, dropped back a bit while in somewhat tight leaving that marker and had no further bid.
