Footnotes
CARDIAC KID saved ground on the turns within range, swung out four wide at the top of the stretch, and rallied steadily to overhaul the leaders from
outside. BUDGET BUSTER moved up five wide into the far turn, rallied just inside the winner through deep stretch and finished gamely. LE COSTE was
outrun to the stretch, split foes late and finished willingly. RAGS FOR BRITCHES raced two wide on the turns, lodged a bid on the rail through the drive but
was outkicked. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT lagged well back for six furlongs, and passed tired horses outside. OFFICER COUNTRY pressed the pace
outside RINGLE BELLE, took over after six furlongs, but weakened through the lane. LIMETINI broke out at the start, went along under a firm hold early,
advanced three wide on the far turn, took over outside OFFICER COUNTRY in upper stretch, but faded through the final stages. OXBURGER was no factor
two wide. RINGLE BELLE set the early pace inside, and gave way once displaced for command. WATER WALL raced four wide and was through early.
APACHE tracked the leaders three wide, and was done before reaching the stretch. PLENUM got pushed out a bit by LIMETINI at the start, and lost contact
with the field early while well out in the course.

Footnotes
MACHO D'ORO sped to the front after the start, built a commanding lead turning for home, and was driving to stay in control on the rail.
VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ advanced outside around the turn, had aim at the leader through the lane, but could not reach him while clearly best of the
others. CONSILIUM broke awkwardly, moved up along the inside after six furlongs, and did enough to go clear of the rest on the wrong lead. CAPITAN
FOFO chased the winner for six furlongs, and faded. HONOR THIS broke out at the start, raced two to three wide on the turn, and tired. MONEY HOUSE
bobbled at the start, moved off the inside around the turn, and was finished before reaching the stretch. IMPERIAL GREATNESS chased the winner to the
far turn, and tired. WILSHIRE DIAMOND bumped with PUMP ROOM and was squeezed back between that one and MONEY HOUSE after the start, and
was no factor four to five wide. AMAZING MOMENT veered out at the start, and showed little. SKY'S SON drifted wide leaving the turn, and dropped far
back while eased up. PUMP ROOM went wrong near the half-mile pole, was pulled up into the turn, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
LET'S BE HONEST pressed the pace three wide, got out-moved by WELL BRUSH MYTOOTH through upper stretch, moved out and kicked in late to
overhaul that one from outside. WELL BRUSH MYTOOTH advanced four wide past the three-eighths, took over from outside through upper stretch, then
yielded to the top one in the last 70 yards. MY SISTER'S KEEPER pressed the pace inside, and lacked a solid closing response on the wrong lead. GREY
JAZMINE raced two wide on the turn, and could not gain late outside. SMITTEN FOR SMITTY dashed to the front after the start, was under pressure from
both flanks for a half-mile, and weakened through the drive. BION MAGIC trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WITCH HUNTER broke outward, prompted the pace three wide, took over outside LIZA near the five-sixteenths, and drew away under pressure.
CRYSTALINA was devoid of speed for a half-mile, improved position five wide around the turn, and was along for second on the wrong lead. UPSY DAISY
DO swung four wide edging closer approaching the stretch, but flattened out. WATER WIZARD put in a mild run along the rail turning for home, but could
not sustain the rally. ZANDREA'S hit the right side of the gate at the start, was unsettled widest early, and failed to menace. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL stayed
in range two to three wide, and tired after six furlongs. AMBER PRINCESS got nudged out by LIZA at the start, and was outrun. LIZA took an awkward first
step breaking outward, set the pace to midway on the turn, and faltered. LOLA WANTS unseated the rider and ran off after coming on the track, was
apprehended and brought back to be remounted, went to post without further incident, showed brief speed and retired. DAKOTA BEACH dropped well back
after a half-mile.

the far turn, challenged for command outside MR. DISCRETIONARY in upper stretch, and stayed on with good courage between horses. PROJECTED

Footnotes
WELL CONNECTED pressed the early pace three wide, dueled outside IMA PHAROAH late on the turn while confidently handled, drew off approaching the
furlong grounds under a busy drive, and was kept to pressure until 70 yards out. IMA PHAROAH vied early outside GETTHE MUNY BERNIE, got the best
of that dispute after a quarter-mile, battled for command inside WELL CONNECTED through most of the turn, could not match strides by upper stretch, then
dug in late to hold the place. MAN OF HONOR raced two wide around the turn, appeared poised to go by IMA PHAROAH from outside in deep stretch, but
was outfinished for that position. WAR DETONATOR stayed in range early two wide, and faded after a half-mile. MY FIRST GRAMMY raced four wide and
posed no threat. CURLINGO lagged far back early despite urging, and remained outrun. HIDDEN STYLE took the turn three wide, and dropped far back
into the lane. GETTHE MUNY BERNIE became fractious in the gate prior to the start unseating the rider and briefly sitting down in the stall, got backed out
and reloaded, contested the early pace inside, and was finished midway on the turn.

Footnotes
LEGENDARY PRINCE pressed the pace outside MIAMI CROCKETT from the start, stayed on task through mid stretch and wore that rival down, and drew
clear late. MIAMI CROCKETT vied early between rivals, moved inside dueling with LEGENDARY PRINCE around the turn, fought on gamely through upper
stretch, and yielded grudgingly. REMASTER (IRE) raced between horses around the turn in easy striking range, and lacked the needed closing bid.
SURPRISE FACTOR swung four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly. JADES GELLY was no factor three wide. FACTORINO vied briefly inside
MIAMI CROCKETT and LEGENDARY PRINCE, eased back a bit and followed close behind on the rail to the end of the turn, and faded in the lane.
MASTERDAY was in range three wide heading into the turn, but tired after three-eighths of a mile. PUBLIC SAFETY was slow to get going, and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
SIR SEAMUS took control and moved inside after an alert beginning, rated along through even fractions for six furlongs, and was driving to remain clear.
MYSTICAL MOON raced three wide advancing through the middle stages, had aim outside the winner turning for home, could not cut into the margin on the
wrong lead, and saved the place. DEVOTED KITTEN saved ground to the far turn in the second flight, moved out in the stretch and rallied belatedly.
SPEED GRACER raced three wide much of the way, and lacked a final bid. VOLUBILE moved up mildly four wide into the stretch, and finished evenly.
VERDICT IS IN was outrun for six furlongs, came five wide off the far turn, and was no threat. BOLD PAYNTER was reserved early, moved up between
horses after a half-mile, but had nothing further. GRAYDAR'S RESOLVE was never prominent. KING LEONARDO was under a firm hold early, and had no
response when roused. BLUESKY KITTEN pressed the pace outside for six furlongs, and tired. BUNYAN'S AXE chased toward the inside early, and was
done after six furlongs. COLIN A WINNER broke out a bit and steadied off MYSTICAL MOON, and was always well in arrears.

MALIBU MAX followed behind the leaders saving ground for a half-mile, was guided out three wide approaching the stretch, caught FRONT LOADED from
outside past the eighth-pole and drove clear. FRONT LOADED pressed the pace outside WHYRUAWESOME, wrested command and edged away late on
the turn, could not handle the winner through the last eighth of a mile but was much best of the others. MY FRIEND FLAVIN raced between horses in range
around the turn, and had no rally. SARGEANT DRIVE was outsprinted to the stretch, and passed tired horses on the rail. WHYRUAWESOME set a
pressured pace inside, was outdueled approaching the stretch by FRONT LOADED, and gave way. HY RIVERSIDE raced four wide around the turn, and
faded on the far outside. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MAI TY ONE ON was reserved in the two-path for three furlongs, tipped out drawing a bead on the leaders in upper stretch, and rolled by a sixteenth out to
win going away. KRSTO SKYE was never far back, advanced two wide near the quarter-pole, challenged for command outside PAY ANY PRICE turning for
home, could not kick on with the winner but was up for the place. PAY ANY PRICE broke a step slow, rushed up outside early, cleared to the lead and
moved inside early on the turn, got hooked by KRSTO SKYE into the stretch, and weakened on the rail. FRENCHMEN STREET was outsprinted two wide
to the stretch, and gained mildly without threatening. FULLY LOADED led early, lost the advantage to PAY ANY PRICE going to the turn, moved out two
then three wide nearing the lane, and faded. COOP TRIES HARDER chased three then four wide to the stretch, and faded. WILE E PEYOTE was outrun
inside. STURGEON was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
KEY BISCAYNE got bumped by LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN at the start, settled in the middle of the field early, moved to contention four wide on the far turn,
reached the front from outside in upper stretch and drove clear. DYNATOWN lagged well back for six furlongs toward the inside, angled out in upper stretch
and finished gamely between horses. JOST SAYIN bumped with GHOSTLY BEAUTY at the start, was outrun inside to the far turn, swung five wide past the
quarter-pole, and rallied on the far outside. SUN SUMMERS was never far back, had aim in the three-path turning for home, but was outfinished. SWEET
STORY was three wide early, waited in traffic late on the far turn and into upper stretch, altered course to the rail and finished evenly.
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN broke out at the start and took the worst of a bump with KEY BISCAYNE, raced three to four wide improving position gradually to the
stretch, and was outkicked between horses. GHOSTLY BEAUTY bumped with JUST SAYIN and steadied back at the start, raced far back early, rallied five
wide off the far turn, loomed outside through the furlong grounds, but could not sustain the rally. ADMIRAL'S WIN was reserved early, and lacked a solid
response in the stretch. YOLANDA'S PRIDE prompted the early pace, reached a short lead three wide on the far turn, and faded through the drive. BLUE
MISTRESS broke out at the start, prompted the pace three wide early, took a brief lead nearing the stretch while moving in a path, but faded steadily late.
MERSEYSIDE set a pressured pace to the far turn, and faltered after six furlongs. PROSPECTIVE DIVA stayed in range early, and retreated nearing the
stretch.
