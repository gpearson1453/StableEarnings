CARTER'S RUN settled off the pace while racing three wide, rallied three wide around the far turn, closed widest and was up in deep stretch. ORACLE OF
OMAHA broke outwardly and bumped TOP HAT TREASON, stalked the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the lane, drew clear in midstretch, drifted
out late and was caught in deep stretch. HAIKU saved ground off the pace, made some progress two wide around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch
and was along for the show. SUNBRIDLED stalked the pace two wide around the first turn, reached near even terms near the three-eighths pole, dueled
two wide to upper stretch and weakened. TOP HAT TREASON stumbled and was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide early, went two wide
around the far turn and finished evenly. BINN GOODE set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. CHARITABLE GOLD broke slowly, saved ground
well back and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
SWEETIN BREAD was strung out four wide nearing the first turn, angled in to stalk the pace two wide leaving the five-eighths pole, angled back out to bid
four wide down the backstretch, angled back into the two path near the quarter pole, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole, drew clear nearing the
lane and held clear under a drive. HARD BEING ME lacked early speed while saving ground, made progress under urging down the backstretch, briefly left
the rail to split rivals near the quarter pole, continued to gain inside around most of the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied willingly. CUBIC
SOUND raced well off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. BOLD VALOR dueled along the rail early, drew
clear nearing the far turn, was collared by the winner near the three-sixteenths pole and tired inside. CANDY MAN ONE saved ground off the pace, checked
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, raced mostly two wide around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. TWOBITSARIDE popped the
gate open but stood fairly quietly, raced off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and failed to menace. DEPUTY JAMES was outrun while
racing two and three wide. NAZCA MYSTERY stalked the pace three wide and was done after a half. COMMAND THE CAT unseated the rider and ran
loose pre-race, dueled two wide and stopped after a half. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SHEPLAYSTHEFIELD set the pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT prompted the winner two wide, could not seriously
gain and finished as clearly second best. LADY REBEL stalked the pace from the rail, lacked the needed rally but held third. GLORIOUS MYSTERY chased
the pace two wide and lacked a rally. UNKISS ME never threatened while racing three wide. DON'T SPIN ME was shut off and checked hard at the start,
raced four wide around most of the turn, came seven wide into the lane and had some rally. GOLDEN DESIRE failed to menace while racing two wide.
SILENT NOTION was outrun inside. FLOWERS VALE veered out at the start and checked sharply, raced far back four wide and lacked a rally. The
Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start but found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

BLIP SAYS BYE set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn and widened under a drive. MY LOVELY GIRL pressed the winner two wide, was no
match for that foe but continued on willingly for the place. TUNSTALL chased the pace from the inside, lacked a rally and lasted for the show. CROWNS
AND TIARAS was never a threat while racing two wide. R CHERRY was fractious in the starting gate, saved ground and lacked a rally. ECLIPTICALS VISKI
played no factor while racing three wide. RACING MY FATHER checked early, raced two wide and made little impact. U R THE LUCKY ONE was outrun
inside. NUVE NEGRA failed to menace while racing three wide. INFINITYPOWERSIWIN had some early speed, bolted midway around the turn and was
eased.

Footnotes
GIO DUDE was off a bit slow, made progress three wide around the first turn, tucked into a stalking position at the rail nearing the clubhouse turn, tipped out
to advance between rivals midway down the backstretch, seized command and angled back in nearing the far turn and drew off under moderate urging.
CANTAKEITANYMORE lacked speed while saving ground, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished well to gain the place. ROYAL BLUE was in
range inside, bid between foes early on the backstretch, could not match strides with the winner, chased three wide around the far turn and held well
enough for third. TARNISHED JUSTICE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, made a strong middle move to take the lead near the
seven-sixteenths pole, chased the winner two wide around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. STOLEN LOVE disputed the pace inside and tired
around the far turn. SET'EM UP JOE played no factor while racing three wide. CHARITABLE HERO was outrun inside. HOSWAY vied two wide for a half
but was through early. WHISKEY CREEK was rank at the start, dropped far back inside and made little impact. NINETYEIGHTTWO failed to menace while
racing two and three wide.
