Footnotes
GENERIC MARK brushed the left side of the gate and was pushed out by MUSIC CITY WOLF at the start, recovered to a stalking position outside, was
under a drive outside BELLA GIANNA but made little headway after six furlongs, stayed on task and was carried out past the sixteenth-pole, but forged past
determinedly. BELLA GIANNA sprinted clear early inside, rated along clear around the turn, remained comfortably in command past the eighth-pole,
swerved out suddenly in deep stretch and could not hold on. SMARTIZAR moved up three wide late on the turn, finished evenly and was best of the
remainder. NOBLE MARIA was outrun inside for six furlongs, and passed tired horses. MUSIC CITY WOLF broke out at the start bothering GENERIC
MARK, raced three wide and lacked a rally. WATER WIZARD swung five or six wide leaving the turn, and posed no threat. FURY SONG was no factor.
SPECIAL BEACH broke out at the start, chased three wide and tired before completing six furlongs. NANIE'S TREASURE pressed the early pace, and gave
way inside on the turn. LA GUATEMALTECA raced four wide, and dropped far back into the lane.

Footnotes
THREE DEEP veered out sharply into GABLE PASS setting off a chain reaction of trouble at the start, moved out four wide late on the turn, drifted way out
on the wrong lead and prevailed outside W W CANDY in the last strides. W W CANDY moved three wide to take over late on the turn, drew clear into the
stretch, drifted way out on the wrong lead and could not hold on. AYCAPOTE advanced four wide after six furlongs, and rallied mildly to best the remainder.
LIGHT FURY broke open the gate prior to the start, got bumped and pushed out by at the break, pressed the pace outside APACHE, bid two wide on the
turn, and weakened inside through the stretch. WOODHAVEN KID hit the left side of the gate and steadied behind APACHE at the break, advanced mildly
on the turn two wide, bumped with APACHE in upper stretch, and had nothing more. APACHE broke out at the start, set a pressured pace inside, gave way
late on the turn, and bumped with WOODHAVEN KID while continuing to drop back in upper stretch. ULTRACONFIDENT was bumped by LIGHT FURY
and took up at the start after getting shut off, and was always far back. GABLE PASS was bumped by THREE DEEP and crowded between horses at the
start, went wrong in the right front while trailing in the stretch, was pulled up before the wire and vanned off.

Footnotes
NAPA RULES advanced four wide around the turn, rallied steadily through the stretch and wore down TIPSY AGAIN from outside in the final strides. TIPSY
AGAIN vied outside BALLIE'S DREAM and CHARLIEANNA early, took over around the turn, settled into the stretch with a daylight lead, remained clear to
the sixteenth-pole and weakened. PASSING MOMENTS was devoid of speed inside early, angled to the far outside leaving the turn, and was going well
belatedly. MY SEBASTIANA raced five wide around the turn, and flattened out in the stretch on the wrong lead. SUE'S MONSTER BABY steadied slightly
between horses at the top of the stretch, and had no rally. PRINCESS CARRIGAN was finished early two wide. CHARLIEANNA vied early between horses,
and weakened midway on the turn. BALLIE'S DREAM contested the early pace inside, and gave way entering the turn. NILESTAR shifted in from the
four-path tightening things up a bit on SUE'S MONSTER BABY nearing the stretch, and tired.

MORE THAN USUAL tracked outside KHATTAF up the backstretch, took over readily after five furlongs, drew well clear roused mildly turning for home, got
flashed the whip past the eighth-pole and was in hand to the finish. CASTILLETE lagged far back to the turn, came four wide into the stretch and rallied
mildly to go clear of the others. KHATTAF set the early pace, yielded to the winner midway on the turn, drifted wide into the lane and ran on for the show.
MAKINALEGACY raced four wide around the turn, and lacked a solid bid. CONSILIUM advanced four then five wide approaching the end of the turn, and
continued on evenly. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER lagged well back four wide to the stretch, and passed tired horses. GRAN CHAMPAGNE raced forwardly
three wide into the turn, moved in a bit and gave way. CAB BEEF was far back throughout. MOUNTAIN TREE was finished after a half-mile. IMA
COALMAN raced three wide, and dropped far back after six furlongs. RESTLESS ROCKER saved ground to no avail. PERFECT ENOUGH was done early
inside. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST stopped after six furlongs, and jogged in.

Footnotes
LA TRES JOLIE was unhurried early, shifted well out in the track advancing into the stretch, caught FLAMMA MAMMA from outside leaving the furlong
marker under a drive, and widened with every stride. FIAMMA MAMMA vied for command three wide early, took over into the stretch, and proved no match
for the winner while clear of the rest. UNION LANE argued the pace inside LA FLAMENCA and FLAMMA MAMMA early, fought on inside the latter through
upper stretch, and drifted out weakening under left-hand pressure past the eighth-pole. KAUFY FUTURES moved out four wide late on the turn, and made
no headway through the lane on the far outside. LA FLAMENCA contested the pace between rivals, and weakened near the five-sixteenths pole. I'M THAT
BIRD raced three wide and tired after a half-mile. COUNTRY STRONG was outrun four wide into the turn, moved in through the lane and could not gain.
DISTINCTLY SASSY was coaxed along up the backstretch, stayed fairly close around the turn moving out five wide, but faded steadily after six furlongs.
TELL ME MAUX was finished early inside.

Footnotes
R U ROYALTY was never far back, swept past the leaders from outside with a quick move near the five-sixteenths, drew off and was kept to steady
pressure. RASPBERRY BALLET had no speed early, angled out steadily approaching the stretch, and was along for second in the middle of the track.
SWEDEN sat behind the leaders inside to the turn, moved out four wide rallying into second through upper stretch, but could not sustain the bid. PRETTY
DARLING was outrun for a half-mile, swung five wide into the lane and could not menace with an even finish. SMOOTH AS GLASS pressed the early pace
three wide, could not kick with R U ROYALTY while moving into second late on the turn, and weakened approaching the eighth-pole. CAROLYN'S SMILE
broke open the gate prior to the start, dueled inside JEANIE'S ANGEL for a half-mile, and faltered on the rail. JEANIE'S ANGEL dueled outside
CAROLYN'S SMILE for a half, gave way before reaching the stretch, and drifted out being eased up in the late stages. CAROLINA BEAST dropped far back
after a half-mile, and jogged in.

Footnotes
TREV was sent hard to vie for command outside ISLAND TAP and BERNIN' THRU GOLD, got the best of that dispute turning for home, edged clear with a
furlong remaining and was driving to the finish. LIFE IN SHAMBLES hesitated for an instant and lost his footing at the start, was far back to the stretch in the
two-path, and surged late inside rivals to get up for the place. SHARED LEGACY was well back three wide to the stretch, moved further out rallying mildly,
and was edged for second outside rivals. VINNIE VAN GO was well placed behind a trio of battling leaders around the turn, had a clear shot from outside
into the lane, lacked a solid response and was outkicked for larger shares between horses. BERNIN' THRU GOLD argued the pace between horses to the
stretch, and weakened a furlong out. JAKE ROCKS tossed his head briefly at the start, saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved out past the eighth-pole
and made no impact. ISLAND TAP contested the pace inside rivals to the stretch, and faded through the late stages on the rail. CHRISTOPHER was a step
slow from the gate, trailed widest into the lane, and could not improve while closing some ground.

FORTUNE COOKIE tracked widest of a trio chasing YODEL E. A. WHO for a half-mile, challenged for command late on the turn, moved further out battling
inside CHAMPAGNESONME past the eighth-pole, and gamely prevailed. CHAMPAGNEONME settled in the second flight early three wide, loomed on the
far outside through the furlong grounds, but could not get by the top one. GLORY OF FLORIDA gave chase between horses from the outset, and could not
gain inside the first two finishers through the late stages. YODEL E. A. WHO set the pace to the top of the stretch, and weakened on the rail. CREATE
AGAIN raced four wide on the turn, and had no late response. NOON TIME GEM was outrun throughout. HY RIVERSIDE stayed close early on the rail, and
tired after a half.

Footnotes
WHERE PARADISE LAY broke in bumping FUEL THE BERN at the start, advanced four wide off the turn, headed MAGIC TAPIT from outside with a
furlong to go, and drove clear. FROSTED GRACE was urged along at the back between foes on the turn with no real response, got steered to the far
outside at the top of the stretch, kicked in through the furlong grounds and was up for the place while never a threat to the winner. MAGIC TAPIT set the
pace slightly off the rail, moved further out coming under attack from WHERE PARADISE LAY in upper stretch, could not withstand that one giving way past
the eighth-pole and was overhauled late for second. RUNNING FOR RIZ pressed the pace outside MAGIC TAPIT to the stretch, and moved outside fading
through the last eighth of a mile. FUEL THE BERN brushed the right side of the gate and got bumped by WHERE PARADISE LAY at the start, raced three
wide for a half-mile, moved further out and could not reach contention. WHYRUAWESOME moved to the rail approaching the turn, and gave way steadily
after a half-mile.

Footnotes
ALL AROUND was slow into stride, took closer order around the turn four then five wide, rallied steadily and was up outside FRONT LOADED nearing the
wire. FRONT LOADED ranged up outside the leaders four wide after a half-mile, took over in upper stretch and drew clear, and was overhauled in the last
strides while much best of the others. QUIJOTE broke alertly and contested the pace three wide, yielded to FRONT LOADED turning for home and faded
while staying clear for the show. BENEFACTOR was forwardly placed early, lost ground to the leaders around the turn three wide, and ran on for the last
major share. SOUTH SEA contested the pace inside rivals, and weakened after a half-mile. KINGSVILLE steadied slightly behind BOLD ENVOY past the
five-eighths, and never reached contention. ATTHEPEARLYGATES contested the early pace between horses, gave way around the turn, and was eased up
in the stretch. LORD ADARE faded five wide nearing the stretch and was eased up. BOLD ENVOY was just off the leaders passing the five-eighths pole
when he clipped heels behind SOUTH SEA and/or ATTHEPEARLYGATES, stumbled and had the rider lose the right iron, dropped far back and was eased
up through the lane.
