Footnotes
LINFIELD was outsprinted to the backstretch then was pushed along to close the gap, rallied four wide on the second turn, edged away to mid stretch and
was clear under steady urging. MUSKET POWDER chased the pace early, moved up to engage for the lead at the half, was three wide to the stretch, got
outkicked by the winner to mid stretch then bested the others. OASIS was allowed to settle to the half, saved ground on the second turn but lacked a closing
response. HEAVENLY TIGER was also outsprinted early, pushed up to get closer to t he half, swung out four wide on the second turn but came up empty in
the drive. INTRINSIC VALUE set the pace, responded from the rail to the stretch then was outkicked and tired. NO MORE FIREBALL pressed the pace for a
half mile, stopped after six furlongs then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
DEEPINGREEN never far back to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, got on terms with PRAISE LOUDLY in mid stretch then edged away under
steady urging. AERO STREET settled mid pack to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch, could not impact the winner but outfinished PRAISE
LOUDLY for second. PRAISE LOUDLY dueled for the lead outside of SUPER TONY, was two wide to the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then was passed by
the winner and gave up second late. ONE EYED ROBIN had no speed, settled for a half mile, was fanned four wide on the far turn then lacked the needed
late response. CURRY NATION lagged for a half mile, was also three then four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. SUPER TONY hustled to
contest the pace to the second turn, stopped after six furlongs then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
GOVERNANCE was quickest to the first turn, set the pace from off the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch and held off SACRED RIDER stubbornly.
SACRED RIDER was allowed to settle to the half, bid two then three wide on the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and closed willingly but too late.
SMILEFORME pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. FLY THE SKY had no speed, settled to the
second turn, had to circle four wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. ECOLOGIST tracked the winner from the rail to the stretch but
weakened in the final furlong. ACTIVE PASS was always outrun.

NIL PHET was well placed to the half, bid three then four wide on the second turn, took over nearing mid stretch and held under steady urging. PEGASUS
SPRINT trailed to the half, bid three wide on the second turn then finished steadily and saved the place. BEAUSUN was outrun to the second turn, raced
three wide to the stretch then switched to a left lead in mid stretch, back to a right lead near the sixteenth marker and was closing ground. MUSKOKA
stumbled at the start, was outrun to the backstretch, pushed up to engage for the lead at the half, dueled three wide to the stretch but was tiring in the drive.
DARE TO BELIEVE was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn then was fanned four wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late
response. TEXAS BOB had good speed, dueled inside rivals to the second turn but gave way after six furlongs. SENSATIONAL ROCKET pressed TEXAS
BOB early, dueled between rivals to the second turn but also was tiring after six furlongs.

not shake the winner and was caught. REY COLIMAN was allowed to settle to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch, was a factor to mid stretch
but was outfinished in the late stages. CANDY'S MARTINI broke alertly, set the pace to the stretch, was overtaken in mid stretch and weakened. ARCH
ANTHEM trailed to the second turn, swung out four wide to the stretch and was closing the gap late.

Footnotes
TOMLIN had good speed and contested the pace inside RED LIVY (IRE), was off the rail to the stretch, responded when set down, kicked away to mid
stretch and held determinedly. FANTASY HEAT tracked the winner to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then responded late and was second best.
MUCHO AMOR had no speed, raced off the rail to the stretch, shifted out then was cut off and forced to steady at the furlong marker by PRINCESS VIVIAN,
recovered and outfinished that one for third. PRINCESS VIVIAN was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then shifted out but came out too
far, forced MUCHO AMOR to steady, straightened then was outfinished for the show. IMA HAPPY CAT stalked the leaders to the turn, got fanned out four
wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and could not make an impact. GOTHAM DESIRE was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the
stretch then lacked a closing response. LEFT ALONE (GB) had no speed, circled four wide on the turn but also was not a threat. STORMING LADY got
outrun to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, had to check when crowded by MUCHO AMOR in mid stretch and finished evenly. COCO BEE had no
speed and was not a factor. RED LIVY (IRE) contested the pace outside the winner and three wide to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
BOUNTY OF GOLD had good speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded, edged away to mid stretch and held driving.
RUNNINFROMTHELAW chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch then finished willingly to best the others. SOTHALIS pressed the winner three wide
to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. RED DAHLIA was chasing early, raced two wide to the stretch then was making up ground
belatedly. DAIRY KID had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but could only close a gap to the line. SAY IT WITH ROSES trailed to the stretch and
was never a threat. JUSTA POPPIN stalked the pace to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch then tired.
