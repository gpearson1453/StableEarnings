Footnotes
LIL' A. J. away in good order from the outside, set the pace while angling in some, under pressure from both sides then gained a clear advantage late on the
turn, led unchallenged in the two path at the top of the lane and held well under strong hand urging. YOUR ADORABLE stumbled and pinballed at the start,
wide up the backstretch, angled in entering the turn, saved ground into the stretch, rallied up the inside and earn the place. MAGICALCHIC bumped early
then stalked from the inside, swung out on the turn and came seven wide into the stretch, finished willingly but could needed more. SHE BE FIRE N ICE
shifted in and bumped twice leaving the gate, chased from the inside then moved out into the two path and weakened in the final furlong. DIOSA pressed
the pace from the outside outside, lugged out into the stretch and weakened. MY PROJECT GIRL tossed head leaving the gate then bumped and checked
off the heels of a rival early, angled six wide around the turn and lacked further response. CURRYFORTHREE BANG raced six wide into the turn, streered
to the inside around the bend and never responded in the drive. MADAME JEANETTE bumped twice at the start, lost path and checked soon after, raced
outside a rival and was floated out on the turn, approached the eighth pole five wide and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
TOOTHLESS WONDER allowed to settle in the early going, entered the turn three wide, streered out and came five wide into the stretch, lugged in and
bumped YES I'M WILD in upper stretch, gained command near the sixteenth pole and drew off. SEEKING PEACE tracked along the inside, came in tight
quarters and checked past the three-eighths pole, saved ground around the turn and edged YES I'M WILD for second. YES I'M WILD broke in and bumped,
set the pace then gained clear sailing near the three-eighths marker, held a comfortable lead through the bend and into the stretch, lugged out and bumped
with TOOTHLESS WONDER in upper stretch, lost command shortly after and got outkicked for the place. SHARON'S FURY raced along the inside then a
bit off the rail to the stretch and kept one paced to the wire. CHOCOLATE MESS chased outside a rival, two to three wide around the turn and weakened.
EL SENOR DE LATUNA crowded and checked leaving the gate, angled to the inside, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. EVENING
REWARD bumped start, tracked off the rail, five wide into the stretch and faded. Due to a timer malfunction the second race was hand-timed and no
fractions were recorded.
