Footnotes
SHANGHAI TRUFFLES tracked the pace early and shifted out for room on the backstretch, bid four wide on the second turn, rallied to the front in upper
stretch then drifted out under left handed urging and held determinedly. BUYBACK had no speed and settled to the half, came two then three wide on the
second turn, rallied to the stretch, was being outrun by the winner when that one drifted out, checked and angled in for room and got the nod for second.
MULHIMA (IRE) was unhurried to the second turn, circled four wide and rallied to loom a threat to mid stretch then got outkicked for the place. POSH
HOLLY (IRE) also had no speed, settled for a half mile, raced three wide when being roused on the second turn then swung out widest and closed steadily.
ZELAIA pressed the pace to the second turn, moved up three wide to contest for the lead to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
DREAMING ABOUT YOU also settled for a half, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. LADY OF PERCEPTION flashed speed while
three wide to the backstretch, set the pace to the second turn, stayed a factor for six furlongs then tired. The rider on BUYBACK lodged an objection against
the winner for alleged interference in the stretch but no change was made.

Footnotes
TAKES A VILLAGE chased the leaders early, bid two then three wide to the stretch, eased out for room, rallied when clear, took over late and held on
determinedly. STREUSEL had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and closed steadily but too late. SUPER PARTY
stalked the leaders three wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms in mid stretch, dug in willingly but was outfinished. SASSY AND HOT was on the pace
outside and rival, stayed on gamely to mid stretch but was giving way late. KENNA IS SPICY was a bit awkward to begin, got outsprinted to the turn, was
two wide to the stretch, moved closer to mid stretch but could not sustain the needed response. TANGERINE had no speed, was off the rail to the stretch
then did not threaten. PACIFIC SILENCE tracked the pace two then three wide to the stretch but flattened in the final furlong. CLASSIC KITTY pushed up to
duel inside rivals, saved ground to the stretch then was tiring and stopped. GO MUSKEE showed little. Photo finish camera malfunctioned and the finish
was confirmed by the stewards.

Footnotes
REAL KEEPER was quickest early then was collared by the runnerup, pressed that one two wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch and dug in late to
prevail. SARAH'S SMIRK was hustled along to the front, saved ground to the stretch, battled the winner to deep stretch but was bested late. SECRETLY
PARANOIDE had no speed, swung out four wide on the turn, shifted back in leaving mid stretch and finished in a mild rally. WAVERLY WAY was also
outrun to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch and finished willingly but missed the place. LYDIA O LYDIA was chasing to the turn, raced three
wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and also was making up ground belatedly. TOOLEY TUNES got outsprinted early, raced two wide to the
stretch and closed some late. SHEZ A GRINDER was outrun to the turn then saved ground to no avail. SINAWAVA chased the leaders three wide to the
stretch then got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. MORNING DOVE had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR contested the pace from the rail to the stretch, inched away under urging to mid stretch and held driving. STRUGAR attended the
pace outside the winner for six furlongs, was outkicked to mid stretch but was not threatened for second. EL BORRACHO chased the top two to the second
turn, was two wide to the stretch, came out and bumped CAPE POINT in upper stretch, straightened then came out again a sixteenth away, bumped that
rival again and held the show. CAPE POINT was also chasing to the second turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, got bumped by EL BORRACHO
at the three sixteenths and again a sixteenth out and missed third. LINFIELD had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two then three wide to the
stretch but lacked the needed late response. BEAUSUN stalked the top two for a half mile, was outkicked on the second turn and gave way in the drive.
CODE GRAY was rank leaving the chute, had no speed and was never a threat. GOLD N GRAND got outsprinted early, settled for a half mile but stopped
after six furlongs. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run and disqualified EL BORRACHO from third to fourth for interference to CAPE
POINT.

Footnotes
LORETTA took back nearing the first turn, settled to the far turn, bid three wide to the stretch then found her best stride nearing mid stretch and closed
steadily to be along in time. ODESSA attended the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to take over leaving the furlong grounds then could not stall the
winner. LIVE IT WELL eased inward to save ground, tracked to the second turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide to the stretch, remained a threat to mid
stretch then was outfinished. MOONSHINE ANNIE pressed the leader three wide for six furlongs, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. REV
REE had good speed, dueled from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but was tiring in the late stages. PRIVATE KITTY had no speed and
saved ground to no avail. AMERICAN ROYALTY trailed for six furlongs and did not threaten. SAY IT WITH ROSES was outsprinted to the backstretch,
settled to the far turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive.
