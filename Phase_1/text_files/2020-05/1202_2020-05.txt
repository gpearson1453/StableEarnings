Footnotes
TENGA'S JEWEL had good position three deep on the backstretch, bumped with SOMETHING CHATTER into the turn, went around ENERGY CAT while
four wide on the turn then three wide into the lane, came out in upper stretch, took aim at the leader and rallied outside to edge foe in the final sixteenth.
DERBY LADY bumped leaving the gate, stalked from the inside, took the lead on the turn and inched away to the stretch, led to the sixteenth pole but could
not fend off the winner. SOMETHING CHATTER chased between rivals, bumped with TENGA'S JEWEL entering the turn, lacked room and checked around
the bend, angled to the inside and lacked a rally. ENERGY CAT broke out and bumped rival at the start, set the pace from the two path then a bit off the rail
on the turn, lost the lead and drifted out a bit into the stretch and tired.

YOUR ADORABLE stalked from the inside then angled outside the pacesetter, traveled two wide on the turn then exited three to four wide, ranged up
alongside SIX EIGHTEEN mid-stretch and edged away. MERGIE TROID settled early, traveled along the inside through the turn, rallied late and got up for
second. MADAME JEANETTE stalked the pace off the rail then angled to the inside, saved ground into the stretch, finished willingly near the fence but got
outkicked for the place. ANNITASHEAVEN chased from off the rail then three wide to the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished with a late effort
from the outside. MAGICALCHIC stalked the leader from outside, entered the turn three wide then moved out a path, gained some ground through the final
furlong but needed to find more. SIX EIGHTEEN sped to the front, set the pace along the inside into and around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and
weakened in the late stages.

SANTALUZ DREAMIN stalked outside a rival, went three wide into the turn, angled out into the five path, rallied under right-handed urging and proved best
late. EVENING REWARD dueled for the lead inside of YODELERS WAY, drifted out into the three path on the turn, fought back from the inside in the drive,
outkicked by the winner in deep stretch but clearly second best. IRISH JACK tracked from the two path to the lane and edged rival for the show. MOUNTAIN
VIEW raced in range from the inside, challenged the top pair along the rail into the stretch but weakened in the late stages. DUTT BART saved ground into
the lane and never threatened. YODELERS WAY dueled for the lead from the outside, floated out by rival around the bend and ame four wide into the
stretch and weakened.
