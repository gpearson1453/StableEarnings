LOFTY dueled three deep then outside a rival on the turn, took a short lead, kicked clear in the stretch and held on well but was edged on the line. SHINES
HER LIGHT (IRE) bobbled at the break as the ground broke out behind, chased outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and rallied between the top
pair late. MO ME MO MY stalked outside a rival then three deep early on the turn, continued outside a rival leaving the turn and into the stretch and was
outfinished. NICE ICE saved ground stalking the pace, came a bit off the rail in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. HELLO BUBBLES wide early,
chased off the rail then outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and could not summon the necessary late response. A THOUSAND
DREAMS between horses early, stalked a bit off the rail then inside on the turn and into the stretch, came out and went around a rival in deep strettch and
lacked the needed rallly. QUEEN OF THE TRACK had speed between rivals then dueled inside, fought back on the turn and into the stretch and weakened
in the final furlong. STOPPED RAINING had good early speed and dueled between horses, steadied in tight into the turn, dropped back between foes on

Footnotes
REGAL BEAUTY pressed the pace outside a rival then took the lead on the backstretch, battled between foes a half mile out, inched away just off the rail
into the second turn, kicked clear under urging in the stretch and proved best. LAST FIRST KISS stalked just off the rail then between foes, bid three deep
on the backstretch, continued off the inside on the second turn and into the stretch and bested the others. CRYSTAL BALL was in a good position stalking
the pace just off the inside then between foes on the backstretch, continued three wide on the second turn and into the stretch and edged rivals for the
show. SAVING SOPHIE angled in and settled inside then a bit off the rail, continued inside on the second turn, came out into the stretch and was edged for
third between foes late. SWEET DEVIL stalked inside then a bit off the rail, went between horses on the second turn, found the fence again in the stretch
and lacked the necessary late response. CLASSY RULER went three deep on the first turn then stalked outside, continued four wide on the second turn and
into the stretch and weakened. MADISON PARC bobbled at the start, settled just off the rail then inside, came out some in upper stretch and also
weakened. FULL ECLIPSE was backed out and reloaded after being fractious in the gate, sped to the early lead and angled in, dueled inside, fell back on
the second turn and in the stretch and had little left for the drive. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE four wide on the first turn, chased outside then off the rail, dropped
back into and on the second turn and gave way.

Footnotes
BELLAFINA stalked off the rail, ranged up three deep into the stretch, took the lead outside rivals nearing midstretch under left handed urging and won
clear. HANG A STAR chased outside, angled in between horses leaving the turn and into the stretch and finished well. FIGHTING MAD drifted out after the
start, angled in and dueled inside, bumped with her pace rival in upper stretch, fought back in midstretch and just held third. MOTHER MOTHER clipped
heels soon after the start, stalked inside, came out in midstretch and was edged for the show. ARTISTIC DIVA sped to the early lead then dueled outside a
rival, fought back on the turn and into the stretch, bumped with that one in upper stretch, was between foes in midstretch and weakened late. TOMLIN
stalked outside a rival then off the rail, continued three deep on the turn and into the stretch and lacked a rally. FIRST STAR a step slow to begin, saved
ground chasing the pace, dropped back on the turn and had little left for the stretch. Following a stewards' inquiry, FIGHTING MAD was disqualified and
placed fourth for interference shortly after the start. The stewards conducted another inquiry into the bumping in upper stretch before ruling that incident did
not alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
HARPER'S GALLOP pulled to the front outside a rival then angled in and set the pace inside, continued along the rail in the stretch and held on gamely
under urging. ZUCCHERA bobbled at the start, settled a bit off the rail, came out on the second turn and five wide into the stretch and closed willingly to just
miss. SUTRO chased three deep, came four wide into the stretch and continued willingly late. SABINOS PRIDE angled in and stalked between horses then
outside a rival, continued off the rail leaving the second turn and into the stretch and was outfinished for the show. SMILING ROSE saved ground stalking
the pace, went between horses leaving the second turn and into the stretch and could not quite summon the necessary late response. INVINCIBELLA (GB)
chased outside a rival then inside on the backstretch and into the second turn, came out into the stretch and also lacked the needed late kick. KLEEN
KARMA broke in and bumped a rival, chased three deep then outside a foe, came out three wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary rally.
LUCKY MS JONES settled inside, saved ground off the pace, came out a bit in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. SOCIAL GRACES (GB) angled in
and saved ground stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and did not rally. ESTABLISH JUSTICE had speed a bit off the rail then stalked three
deep then off the inside, went three wide again on the second turn, steadied sharply off heels into the stretch and weakened. PASITO three wide early,
chased outside a rival, came out leaving the second turn, steadied off heels into the stretch and also weakened.

Footnotes
LAMBEAU sped to the early lead, set the pace inside, fought back when challenged leaving the second turn and in the stretch and held on gamely under
urging. SASH (GB) stalked the winner just off the rail, bid alongside that one leaving the second turn and in the stretch but could not quite match strides late.
SWAMP SOUFFLE angled in on the first turn and chased inside, came out into the stretch, split horses in midstretch and bested thee others. UNBROKEN
STAR chased a bit off the rail, came out three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SOLDIER BOY three deep into the first turn, stalked off the
rail then outside leaving the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. WINNING ELEMENT saved ground
stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. JUSTIN'S QUEST four wide on the first turn, stalked outside, came four
wide into the stretch and weakened. STRIKING A POSE a bit slow to begin, went four wide into the first turn, chased three deep then off the rail, came five
wide into the stretch and did not rally. TRUTH SEEKER five wide into the first turn, chased outside, came out five wide into the stretch and also lacked a
rallly. KISS TODAY GOODBYE a step slow to begin, settled off the rail, angled in some on the second turn, gave way and was eased in the stretch.
