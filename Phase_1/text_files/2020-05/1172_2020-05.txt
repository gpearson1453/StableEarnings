EVIL LYN stalked closest to the loose leader in the three path around the first turn, rated kindly in hand down the backstretch before inching forward around
the far turn to engage that leader turning for home, kicked clear from that foe approaching the furlong pole, and was driven to the wire. RESURRECTION
ROAD quickly sped to a clear lead through the frontstretch for the first time, widened her advantage while pulling keenly through the first turn, held a clear
margin down the backstretch, but was confronted by EVIL LYN turning for home, dug in but gave way approaching the furlong pole, flopped her leads while
weakening through deep stretch, but held place. COLDWATER shifted off of the rail to await racing room two wide between horses around the far turn,
swung to the five path at the three sixteenths pole, but finished evenly, hung and failed to catch the tiring early leader for place, and settled for show.
DRINKATTHECREEK broke inwards, was forwardly placed two wide, took the far turn in the three path and came into the lane in range of the leaders,
made a bid for place passing the furlong pole, but hung for that position before being outfinished by an outer rival. BE WITH US stalked along the inside,
shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to split foes at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened while hanging on her left lead. CIRRUSLY
raced far off of the pace two wide early on, shifted to the four to five path around the far turn, but lacked a rally. TUXEDO LEMON was pushed to the five to
six path around the far turn, but failed to factor. TWELVE MONARCHS trailed early on, and was never involved. STYLISH KITTEN was three to four wide
and weakened. SPINNING TOP advanced slightly inside of horses down the backstretch, but was shuffled back into the far turn, lacked a kick in upper
stretch, and weakened.

Footnotes
OCEAN BREEZE broke well and was forwardly placed five wide outside of horses, made a bid for the lead into the turn while cutting down to the three path,
vied outside of a pair of rivals around the turn, but responded readily when let loose in upper stretch, kicked away from the field passing the three sixteenths
pole, and drew off under a hand ride to the wire. RAISON D'ETRE vied four wide early on before shifting two wide into the turn, dueled for the lead while
between horses around the bend, but proved no match for her outer counterpart inside the three sixteenths pole, then held place. UNION MAIDEN was
restrained while among traffic early on, raced in midpack in the two path down the backstretch, but was shuffled back and steadied slightly at the seven
sixteenths pole as QUALITY TO SPARE weakened, shifted to the four, then five, path around the turn, and produced a late kick in the deep stretch, but
missed place at the wire. WILD LOVE vied two wide between horses early on, took back to stalk from the pocket into the turn, shifted to the three path in
upper stretch, but hung on her left lead, kept on then missed place at the wire. MARKET RUMOR raced midpack three wide between horses, cut the corner
turning for home, then stayed on willingly between rivals to the late stages. KINDA LUCKY set the pace three wide between horses early on before clearing
inner rivals and angling to the rail into the turn, held a narrow margin inside of a pair of foes around the turn, but came under a drive to hold her advantage
at the five sixteenths pole, was no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch, then kept on late, but got outfinished for minor rewards. STRIPPING took
the turn in the four path while midpack, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole while racing with high-knee climbing action. SHIP'S CREEK had a
slow start, saved ground far off of the pace and was no factor. QUALITY TOO SPARE chased along the inside, was in a bit tight of quarters into the turn
causing her to steady slightly at the seven sixteenths pole, then weakened thereafter. MAGIC MOTION was forwardly placed two wide between horses, but
weakened in upper stretch. CLAUDETTE NONSTOP was through after a half and showed little. MORATTA was slow to get going despite rider
encouragement, trailed the field down the backstretch, and showed little.

Footnotes
ECHO TOWN set the pace inside of a pair of rivals, turned back those foes turning for home, but simultaneously met bids from multiple rivals in upper
stretch, dug in as DIGITAL came along side at the furlong marker, and tenaciously held his advantage to the wire. DIGITAL angled from the two to the five
path at the five sixteenths pole to make a five wide bid for the lead turning for home, outkicked his inner bidding counterpart in upper stretch, came
alongside of the leader at the furlong pole while shifting ground inwards, but was repelled by that foe late and just held place at the wire. MERU broke
outwards, stalked the leading trio from the four path down the backstretch, came into the turn in the three path, shifted back to the four path approaching the
quarter pole to make a bid for the lead between horses as DIGITAL rallied alongside, got outkicked by that foe approaching the furlong pole, was put to tight
quarters at the furlong pole as that rival shifted inwards, switched out, then offered a solid late kick, but missed place at the wire. RELENTLESS DANCER
trailed, came into the lane in the four path, and passed tired rivals while chasing the leading trio home. JOHNNY RITT prompted the pace three wide while
staying in the four path around the turn, shifted down to the three path turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader, then brushed an outer
foe at the furlong pole, shifted inwards, and subsequently weakened. HOP KAT vied two wide between horses, but weakened approaching the quarter pole.
BY YOUR SIDE saved ground while off of the pace, but weakened.

Footnotes
RAMSEY SOLUTION broke readily and quickly cleared the field, made his way to the two path passing the wire for the first time, held an advantage inside
of a trio of foes around the first turn, stayed a bit off of the rail while maintaining his margin through the far turn, then kicked clear when asked for run in
upper stretch before widening his advantage under a hand ride through the late stages. KING CAUSE saved ground in midpack, waited for racing room
around the far turn, came into the lane in the three to four path, then produced a mild rally between horses to forge place approaching the wire.
HIERARCHY saved ground while trailing, shifted to the four path in upper stretch before darting back to the inside at the furlong pole, then produced a
belated rail rally. MOROCCO lunged at the start but was not cost much position, raced midpack two wide, advanced four wide and outside of rivals around
the far turn, but leveled out in upper stretch to a grinding rally, and was outfinished by inner foes late. MARKITOFF vied two wide between horses early on
before stalking into the backstretch, held position turning for home, but was outfinished late. LOST IN LIMBO stalked from the pocket around the far turn
before forging place from outer foes in upper stretch, but weakened late while on his left lead. LIMONITE saved ground, shifted to the four to five path
turning for home, but lacked a rally. MY BARILEY was restless in the gate before it opened, raced far off of the pace two wide, came into the lane in the six
path, and failed to make an impact. AWARD WINNER prompted the pace four wide around the first turn, backed off to a stalking position into the
backstretch, then weakened thereafter. EVIL EYE vied three wide between horses through the first turn, but weakened thereafter. FEDERAL LAW was no
factor.

Footnotes
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY stalked three wide while in the four path, moved up outside of rivals to make a four wide bid for the lead turning for home, then
prevailed under a long drive. MINE MY TIME was forwardly placed outside of the leader in the three path, made a three wide bid turning for home while
between horses as GIROLAMO'GLORY moved along side, but was outfinished late. OUR PHILLY SPECIAL set the pace while staying a bit off of the rail,
but was headed by outer foes at the furlong pole, and gave way while holding show. BUMP BAILEY prompted the pace setter from along the inside while
under a tight hold early on, was taken back and rated kindly from the pocket around the turn, committed to the inside turning for home, but lacked room
inside of the leader in upper stretch, finally got clear racing room along the rail at the furlong pole, but lacked a kick. AGGRESSIVITY saved ground while off
of the pace, came under a drive into the turn, and offered a mild response to chase the leading group home. SWITHER'S SHORTCUT took the turn in the
four path, but failed to threaten. IMPUNITY failed to get involved after racing in midpack in the two to three path. GIANT HONOR hopped at the start, trailed
in the five path around the turn, and lacked a rally.
