the inside, inched away briefly on the turn then met the bid from winner once more, drifted out into the lane, weakened in the final sixteenth and lasted for
the place. MILLIE JOEL tracked from off the rail and outside a rival, went two wide around the turn, came out in upper stretch and finished willingly but could
not get up for second. AIMING STRAIGHT chased from the outside, three wide wide into the stretch, drifted inward through the lane and weakened. CUTE
