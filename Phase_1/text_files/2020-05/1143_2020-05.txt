Footnotes
GLORIOUSLY broke out at the start bumping MIJET into SUNNYMEDE DREAM, went up to get the lead inside several rivals after a quarter-mile, moved
away around the turn well off the rail, and was driving to stay clear. UNFORESEEN was the only one to avoid contact at the start, swung four wide already
under a full drive around the turn, and rallied into second on the far outside. PLEASE was bumped by MEDAL CEREMONY at the start, pressed the pace
outside, lodged a mild bid around the turn but made no impression on the leader, and faded late surrendering second. MIJET was bumped into
SUNNYMEDE DREAM by the eventual winner at the start, saved ground and tired after six furlongs. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE bumped with SUNNYMEDE
DREAM after the start, pressed the early pace, and was finished after a half-mile. SUNNYMEDE DREAM was bumped between horses at the start, and was
outrun. MEDAL CEREMONY stumbled at the start and recovered bumping into PLEASE, showed brief speed, dropped far back before reaching the stretch,
and jogged in.

Footnotes
SWAGGY GEORGE came in at the start and was outsprinted early, swept past the field on the far outside around the turn, drew clear into the stretch and
was kept to pressure. CONGRATS AGAIN broke in bumping FAMOUS GENT, then was bumped back into that one by GIVE ME TWO STEPS, checked
getting shuffled back midway on the turn, shifted outside into the stretch and finished with good courage. ESPIA got pushed in at the start, strode greenly
entering the turn, came six or seven wide floating out OUR HOISTED MAST at the top of the stretch, and was doing his best running late. FAMOUS GENT
bumped with CONGRATS AGAIN twice at the start, hit the rail and steadied approaching the turn, and finished evenly inside. GIVE ME TWO STEPS hit the
left side of the gate and bumped with CONGRATS AGAIN at the start, bid for command past the three-eighths but was out-moved by the winner, and faded
steadily. FITZ'S MO took the lead inside with an alert break, weakened approaching the stretch and continued to fade. OUR HOISTED MAST hit the left
side of the gate at the start, raced four wide on the turn, was floated out a bit and bothered by ESPIA at the top of the lane, and tired. TESTIFIED broke out
at the start and brushed with FAMOUS GENT, pressed the pace outside FITZ'S MO and tired before reaching the stretch. CROSS OF GALILEE hit the right
side of the gate at the start, raced wide and dropped far back before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
MORNING STRIDE settled in easy striking range three wide early, took over outside DIZZY GILLESPIE late on the far turn, drove well clear in upper
stretch, and was taken in hand the last 70 yards. COWBOY CULTURE raced close up early inside, moved out three wide late on the far turn, drifted out
under left-hand pressure in mid stretch, straightened out once the rider switched right-handed and was up for the place. DIZZY GILLESPIE was difficult to
load, pressed the early pace outside GREAT KAHUNA, reached a brief lead after six furlongs, yielded to the winner approaching the stretch, and was
overhauled for second near the finish. GREAT KAHUNA set a manageable pace inside, relinquished command on the far turn, and faded steadily.
DRAGUNOV was reserved behind the early leaders, and was empty before reaching the stretch. COOL GIZMO never reached contention. LUCKY FAST
lacked speed from the outset, and dropped far behind.

Footnotes
HANDSOME PRINCE stayed in range early, slipped through on the rail to take over after a half-mile, drew clear and drifted out late. DR. SAMADI lagged
well back to the top of the stretch, and finished well outside. TAPI FROST bumped hard with UNION LINE at the start, raced well back for a half two then
three wide, and was up late for the show. TEN MILES HIGH advanced to loom a threat four wide late on the turn, flattened out through the furlong grounds
and weakened on the wrong lead. BOURBON STREET vied for command outside DISTURBIN BOURBON for a half-mile, and faded through the lane.
DISTURBIN BOURBON was sent up after the start to contest the pace inside BOURBON STREET, got overhauled from both sides after a half and folded
up. UNION LINE was difficult to load, bumped solidly with TAPI FROST at the break then steadied in tight between that one and SUNDOWN KID, and was
outrun throughout. TAAMER was a step slow at the start, and always outrun. SUNDOWN KID broke in at the start, stayed close for a half, and was empty
inside through upper stretch.

MR NAPPY broke out bumping EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE, stayed close inside to the stretch, got through a tight space between BAHAMIAN BEAT and EL
PILLO while taking an awkward step about 70 yards out, and was up gamely at the wire. BAHAMIAN BEAT vied outside JAXON'S GOLDIE early,
outsprinted that one and moved inside getting clear briefly on the turn, dug in when EL PILLO challenged coming to the quarter-pole, fended that one off
while drifting out in deep stretch, and was nipped in the last strides. COOL HAND COOP raced four wide in range to the stretch, finished determinedly on
the far outside and just missed. CONCORDE'S DREAM bumped with JAXON'S GOLDIE at the start and was in tight between that one and
EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE a stride later, hugged the rail and rallied mildly. EL PILLO bid outside BAHAMIAN BEAT approaching the stretch, could not get
past through the furlong grounds and drifted out while weakening. CITRUS BURST was outrun to the stretch, moved outside and went by severely troubled
foes late. EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE got bumped by MR NAPPY at the start, settled in midpack to the stretch, bumped with JAXON'S GOLDIE and took up
out of tight quarters late. LHOTSE broke slowly and was outrun. DREAM D'ORO was no factor three wide. JAXON'S GOLDIE hit the left side of the gate
and bumped with CONCORDE'S DREAM at the start, went up to contest the early pace inside BAHAMIAN BEAT, eased back being outsprinted by the
latter into the turn, attempted to go around but was forced to steady inside EL PILLO midway on the turn, ran on through mid stretch between horses, then
bumped with JAXON'S GOLDIE and took up to lose any remaining chance. BEE MAJOR was outrun four wide. THERE WAS A GENERAL STEWARDS
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
PICK UP THE FONE took the lead with a sharp start, disposed of KIMURA early on the turn, settled into the stretch well in command and well off the rail,
and was all out to hold sway late. DON'T GET KHOZY steadied after breaking awkwardly, advanced around the turn in the four-path, rallied determinedly
outside and was gradually getting to the winner near the finish. WORDS OF DEVINE put in a mild run toward the inside after a half-mile, but lacked a solid
closing bid on the rail. CHARGE ACCOUNT gave chase three wide early, and tired after a half. GOLDEN CHANCE was no factor inside. BEAST OF
WILDWOOD drifted four wide tiring off the turn, and dropped far back. KIMURA became edgy in the gate prior to the start, came away in good order and
pressed PICK UP THE FONE from outside, faltered past the three-eighths and dropped far back.

Footnotes
FOXY LADY was up close early, steadied along the inside entering the turn, moved out three wide closing in on the leaders near the quarter-pole, collared
SUGAR BOLT from outside through the furlong grounds and drove clear. SUGAR BOLT set a pressured pace inside, yielded to the winner entering the final
furlong. and just saved the place. PLAY THAT TONE was outsprinted three wide to the stretch, and finished well outside. PALACE TWO STEP bumped with
MS HEADLEY while outside that rival three wide midway on the turn, and lacked a rally. MS HEADLEY steadied between FOXY LADY and PALACE TWO
STEP and bumped with the latter midway on the turn, and dropped back. QUEEN FIELD was slow from the gate and outrun early, came four wide off the
turn and could not gain the far outside. ALPILLES pressed SUGAR BOLT from outside for three furlongs, and gave way. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
WILD MEDAGLIAD'ORO broke to the lead and backed the pace down in the two-path around the first turn, gradually picked up the tempo fending off FIRST
AND THREE and RODDICK through the middle stages, responded when set down turning for home, and remained clear under clever handling. ROMAN
EMPIRE went along under a firm hold early between horses, was roused three wide advancing after six furlongs, had aim outside the leader into the lane,
but could not cut into the margin. NO GETTING OVER ME saved ground to the far turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and finished evenly.
FIRST AND THREE prompted the pace between horses, and weakened after six furlongs. GRAY BEAU was slow into stride, and never got close. LAGOON
MACAROON faded steadily inside. RODDICK was four wide prompting the early pace, was empty between horses approaching the stretch, and was eased
up through the late stages.

Footnotes
DILLON ROCKS saved ground behind the early leaders, was guided out three wide for clear sailing midway up the backstretch, overhauled HERO UP from
outside at the top of the stretch and drew clear under a mild drive. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY settled in the middle of the pack early, began moving three
wide around the far turn, rallied through the stretch but could not reach the winner while clearly second best. HERO UP set the pace inside, was no match
for the winner into the lane, and ran on to salvage the show. SIR HOSKI raced well back for six furlongs near the two-path, moved out and improved
position. BACANO moved off the rail midway on the far turn, advanced mildly in upper stretch, but flattened out. UNCLE CURLY bumped with MAGICAL
MIKE after the start, steadied behind CRUPI'S PIZZA DOM midway on the first turn, and passed tired horses. STAR OF STARS failed to menace.
MAGICAL MIKE bumped with UNCLE CURLY after the start, and was always far back. TIZ LUNA raced four wide and never reached contention. CRUPI'S
PIZZA DOM moved out in front of UNCLE CURLY around the first turn, prompted the pace outside, and faltered after six furlongs. AT THE BEACH
prompted the pace two wide early, and was finished after six furlongs. GONE DIESEL was finished after a half-mile.
