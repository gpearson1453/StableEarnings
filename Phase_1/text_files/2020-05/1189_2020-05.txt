Footnotes
SWEET CHAYANE stalked the pace to the second turn, made a bid three wide to the stretch, rallied determinedly and wore down PAJAMA QUEEN late.
PAJAMA QUEEN set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded gamely to mid stretch then could not resist the winner while holding second.
PROUD TO SHOYU was allowed to settle to the half, came three then four wide on the far turn then closed willingly in the final furlong. BANK OF MANY
pressed PAJAMA QUEEN for five furlongs, was two wide on the second turn then got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. KELLY'S AMBER had no
speed, settled to the second turn then was fanned four wide to the stretch and came up empty in the drive. REBEL AT HEART was always outrun.

TIZ A RULE had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded when set down and held on gamely. SHE'S IN LUCK chased the
winner from the rail to the stretch, responded when set down, could not impact the winner but got the nod for second. SECRETLY PARANOIDE also was
chasing the pace, bid three wide to the stretch, loomed boldly in mid stretch but hung late. SADIE SUE pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and was outfinished to the line. RUN FOR A MILLION was outsprinted, had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
MR. DIPLOMAT hesitated slightly and broke half a step slow, trailed while under urging to stay within striking distance, circled rivals four wide to the stretch,
rallied when set down and closed willingly to be along in time. IF I HAD A NICKEL chased the pace three wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid
stretch, inched to a short lead a sixteenth out but could not stall the winner. REIGN ON (GB) stalked to the turn, was two wide to the stretch, shifted out for
room, responded when set down, failed to switch leads but finished well. SIERRA DANCE attended the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to mid
stretch but was tiring in the final sixteenth. LIL' CHIEFTAIN hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch, remained a threat to mid stretch then also
tired. CASH LIMIT had no speed and saved ground to no avail. INTIMIDATE chased the leaders three wide to the stretch then gave way in the final furlong.

ground to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch, dropped the whip in deep stretch but was second best. LYDIA O LYDIA had good speed, dueled inside
the winner to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. AMBA chased the leaders two wide to the stretch, also was outrun in upper stretch
and did not rally. REGAL LADY had no speed, tried to make a run three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
POPULAR APPEAL was outrun to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then closed ground with a rush and prevailed. SPICY PERFECTION was quickest,
set the pace while well off the rail, was three wide on the turn, got collared leaving mid stretch but saved the place. EMMA'S A BEAST chased the pace from
the rail to the stretch then closed the gap to mid stretch but finished evenly. TROUBLE N PARADISE was outrun to the turn, came two wide to the stretch
then could not offer the needed late response. MAMANUCA was outsprinted early, raced two wide to the stretch then closed the gap without threatening.
TEASPOON OF PEPPER was also outsprinted then saved ground to no avail. PERFECT SALE refused to break out of the gate then was walked off. The
stewards conducted an inquiry into the start but determined that PERFECT SALE was given a fair start and no change was warranted.
