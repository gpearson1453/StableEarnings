Footnotes
TORO DE TORO shifted outside of UPO into the first turn, pressed that one to the far turn, pushed up to engage for the lead into the stretch, edged away to
mid stretch then held despite not switching leads. UPO went right to the front, set the pace to the second turn, resisted the winner into the stretch but was
outkicked to mid stretch then was tiring but saved second. JIMMY G tracked the top two to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch and finished
willingly but too late for the place. MR. MAGICO briefly bobbled to begin, tracked the leaders to the second turn, made a bid two wide to the stretch but
flattened in the final furlong. ARCH ANTHEM was pinched between MR. MAGICO and TORO DE TORO at the start, steadied then had no speed, was two
wide to the stretch and closed a gap without seriously threatening. BLAME IT ON KITTY had no speed, raced off the rail on the second turn but also did not
threaten. MO BOB (IRE) was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn but gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
SUGAR CRUSH was outrun to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch then responded when set down and closed fast
to be along in time. ALITTLE BIT TECHIE was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then responded determinedly but was outfinished by the
winner. DARLING DEMON set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded when asked, stayed on late but was also outkicked. THRILL'S LEGACY
tracked to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. MY THREE KIDS chased the pace two wide, rallied to get on terms
in mid stretch but was weakening late. THUNDER WOMAN was rank shortly after the start, had no speed and was not a threat. SWEETENER pressed the
leader two wide to the stretch then was,outkicked to mid stretch and tired. TWISTY LUCK broke a bit slow and was not a factor. MAXIMA ONLY had no
speed and saved ground to no avail. SENORITA ESTRELLA chased the pace to the turn then bore out to the seven path at the five sixteenths and gave
way in the drive.

CHIRP had no speed, trailed from the rail to the stretch, shifted out and closed fast but was too late. YOU WANNA EAR RIP also had no speed, came two
wide to the stretch and was also gaining steadily. ADULTING had good speed, dueled from the rail to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and
raced erratically in the final furlong. ACADIA FLEET chased the leaders from the rail to mid turn then was outrun and came up empty.
RUNNINFROMTHELAW had speed while stalking early, dropped back suddenly four wide on the turn and gave way. MISS MONIQUE was outsprinted to
the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ARCH PRINCE never far back to the second turn, rallied while circling four then five wide to the stretch, pushed to the front leaving mid stretch and held
driving. MORE POWER TO HIM was allowed to settle for a half mile, was two wide on the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch and finished willingly for
second. RESPECT THE HUSTLE pressed the leader for six furlongs, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. MANY ROSES set the pace to the
second turn, saved ground to the stretch, resisted to mid stretch then was outfinished. MITHQAAL tracked the pace from the rail to the second turn,
remained inside to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. ROCKY TOUGH had no speed and was never a threat. ANGELO'S PRIDE was
outsprinted to the backstretch then was hustled outside rivals to go after the leaders, was three then four wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch.

POTENTE ALBA stalked the pace three wide to the stretch, eased out for room rallied to collar SMOKIN BLACKJACK leaving mid stretch and held driving.
COUNTRY ROAD broke inward and bumped SIZZLING JAMIE at the start, had no speed, was two wide to the stretch then shifted out for room and closed
willingly to the line. SMOKIN BLACKJACK set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then failed to switch leads, was collared by the
winner and lost the place late. SEAU was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. DON'TTEASETHETIGER tracked the
pace two wide to the stretch, remained a threat to mid stretch then finished evenly. WHOA BUDDY had no speed, was caught four wide on the turn and
lacked a closing response. SIZZLING JAMIE was bumped by COUNTRY ROAD to begin, eased inward then ran up heels nearing the half mile pole,
checked, shifted out and was four wide on the turn, swung out widest for the drive but did not rally. ROMAN RUSH pressed the pace two wide to the stretch
then weakened. CANNONBALL COMIN was always outrun.

back to the rail in mid stretch, responded willingly through a narrow opening and just missed. REDUCTA (GB) was also chasing the pace three wide to the

MYANGELCINDY pressed DEARBORN three wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch, took a short lead in deep stretch but was tagged by the
winner. DEARBORN was sent for speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch, responded when challenged in mid stretch but was outkicked in the late
stages. CHOCOLATE SPEIGHTS had no speed, came two wide to the stretch then shifted out and finished in a rally. INTO THE SOUTH was used early but
outsprinted, raced three wide to the stretch and also was closing late. MEET MISS KITTY had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch but lacked the
needed late response. OUR BOLD PRINCESS was void of speed, lagged to the stretch and did not rally. BEZZY was outsprinted early, raced three wide to
the stretch but weakened in the drive. SWEET RAFAELA was chasing early, got fanned four wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch.

SEEKING REFUGE bobbled briefly to begin the pushed up to pressed the pace to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, rallied two then three wide to
the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch and outfinished LOOKIN FOR REVENGE for the win. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE set all the pace from the rail to the
stretch, resisted the winner to mid stretch then stayed on and was an easy second. T BONES TRICK tracked the pace to the half, was two wide to the
stretch then could not threaten the top two. MY LUCKY BID had no speed, was fanned five wide on the second turn and picked off rivals in the drive.
GALLANT WARREN was settled to the half, bid four wide on the second turn and was gaining ground belatedly. WORLD AFFAIRS had no speed, settled
mid pack to the second turn then saved ground but came up empty. MY SUNSHINE was five wide to the backstretch, pushed up to press the pace to the
second turn, came two wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. I WILL YEAH (IRE) settled mid pack for a half mile, was asked for speed four wide on
the far turn but also lacked a rally. BIGFOOT CITY was very wide throughout and not a factor. BARHOPSKY stalked the pace to the second turn then tired
and gave way. SWIFT CHANNEL had no speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LA SHIRIMP never far back to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, took over in mid stretch and held driving. EGYPTIAN GODDESS had no
speed, settled to the second turn, shifted off the rail at the quarter pole then closed willingly for second. HEATSKY tracked the pace to the second turn, was
inside and checked off heels at the five sixteenths, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept on late. GOLDEN GODDESS attended the pace to the second turn,
dueled from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken by the winner and weakened. MAGICAL PATH had no speed, settled to the second turn, was three
then four wide to the stretch and finished in a mild rally. GO VAIDAGIRL had no speed and trailed tdo the second turn, came three wide to the stretch then
closed a gap to the wire. LA GATA ELEGANTE settled mid pack to the second turn then was fanned four wide to the stretch and did not threaten in the
drive. ALL MY HOPE contested the pace to the second turn, dueled between rivals to the stretch then tired.
