Footnotes
GRAN OLD PARR pressed the pace outside MAJOR SWARTZY and TOOK A CAB, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. KING OF ROCK settled in
midpack early, maneuvered out of traffic to the three-path approaching the stretch, altered course inside GRAN OLD PARR through the furlong grounds and
was best of the others. ANIMA D'OR was outsprinted two wide early, moved to the rail for the drive and finished well to get up for third. STORM THE
BRIDGE broke out brushing with THENEXTBESTTHING at the start, raced in the middle of the field two wide around the turn, and was one-paced late.
THENEXTBESTTHING was brushed between horses at the start, stayed in range three then four wide to the stretch, and weakened on the wrong lead.
SUDDEN CAPTURE brushed with THENEXTBESTTHING at the start, raced four wide to the lane, and lacked a bid. UNCAGE THE CAT broke in at the
start having to be pulled off BRIAN'S AVENUE, and was strung out five wide around the turn. TOOK A CAB set the pace pressed from both flanks for
three-eighths of a mile, and tired. BRIAN'S AVENUE steadied off UNCAGE THE CAT at the start, and was always far back. U. S. COAST GUARD was slow
from the gate, angled to the far outside off the turn, and made no headway. MAJOR SWARTZY broke in slightly, vied inside TOOK A CAB and GRAN OLD
PARR for three furlongs, and had nothing left.

Footnotes
CAMPANELLE (IRE) took the lead inside soon after the start, shrugged off her barn mate turning for home, wandered out while roused right-handed through
mid stretch, switched leads near the sixteenth-pole and came home comfortably in command. ROYAL APPROVAL pressed the pace from outside for three
furlongs, could not stay with the leader into the stretch but was much best of the others. C. P. A. GENIUS hit the left side of the gate at the start, eyed the
leaders isolated in third around the turn, weakened and salvaged the show. RIDE THE CURL broke in at the start, was outsprinted to the stretch, and made
no headway. HANDSOME EFFORT steadied off RIDE THE CURL at the start, saved ground to the lane, and finished evenly between horses. CROSS OF
GALILEE was outsprinted three wide into the turn, and remained outrun. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) raced greenly up the backstretch, and dropped far back
after three furlongs. THE ZIP FACTOR hit the left side of the gate at the start, got floated out by KODIAK MAMBA up the backstretch, and dropped far back
four wide.

EXAMINER took control soon after the start, set a solid pace slightly off the rail, and widened through the stretch under a drive. MAKABIM was taken off the
rail after a half-mile, raced four wide advancing around the turn, could not menace the winner and saved the place on the wrong lead. AEQUOR raced three
wide around the turn, was out-moved by MAKABIM after six furlongs, was taken out widest and finished evenly. FEDERAL CASE chased inside and could
not keep pace after six furlongs. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF AEQUOR AGAINST MAKABIM ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE
STRETCH WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.

Footnotes
KOZY DREAMS tracked the dueling leaders, challenged for command between horses three wide after a half-mile, out-fought UNCAPTURED RUBY
through mid stretch and pulled clear. UNCAPTURED RUBY joined the leaders four wide approaching the quarter-pole, could not match strides with KOZY
DREAMS through the furlong grounds, and ran on a pole clear of the rest. SUPER HERO WANDA saved ground outrun early, moved out in the stretch and
was along for the show on the wrong lead. LADY TEUFLESBERG became fractious and had the rider take refuge on the side of the gate prior to the start,
stumbled coming out, and was no menace. LITTLE MISS MACHO broke open the gate prior to the start, dueled inside CHILLIN LADY through most of the
opening half-mile, and faltered in the stretch. MISS CHEENY broke slowly, and was never in the hunt. CHILLIN LADY dueled outside LITTLE MISS MACHO
for a half, and folded up into the lane. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW was no factor three wide. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE TRAINER OF
UNCAPTURED RUBY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.

AWESOME ENOUGH went up to get the lead after the start, shook off SWINGIN ON A STAR and YOUREOUTOFCONTROL after three furlongs, and was
under a mild drive through mid stretch before being hand urged the last 70 yards. SWINGIN ON A STAR broke out at the start, pressed the pace between
horses to the top of the stretch, and ran on to hold the place. MAQUIAVELO bobbled and steadied early on the turn, moved out five wide advancing into the
stretch, and finished evenly. COLD WARRIOR got pushed out by SWINGIN ON A STAR at the start, then steadied behind YOUREOUTOFCONTROL,
checked outside MAQUIAVELO midway on the turn, lost position approaching the stretch four wide, and finished with good courage outside. JACK EL
BARBARO raced two then three wide on the turn, and had no rally. MAMMOTH bumped with MR IMPRESSIVE at the start and was outrun early, moved
inside in upper stretch, and finished evenly. MAKINALEGACY lagged well back to the stretch, and passed tired horses. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL veered
out at the start, was over-corrected and veered in hard to handle, pressed the pace three wide and gave way turning for home. TAPIZAR KING was
bothered by YOUREOUTOFCONTROL at the break, and was outrun. KING OF THE NORTH was outrun three wide. MR IMPRESSIVE bumped with
MAMMOTH at the start, gave way inside after three furlongs, and was vanned off. MR STARLIGHT dropped far back early, had the rider dismount on the
gallop-out, and was slowly escorted off.

Footnotes
THISSMYTIME broke to the lead, then was content to sit right outside STARSHIP VOYAGER and MIRACULOUSBLESSING, could not stay with
STARSHIP VOYAGER turning for home, kept to task through the lane and came back on to wear that rival down late. STARSHIP VOYAGER dueled inside
MIRACULOUSBLESSING and THISISMYTIME through a sharp half-mile, edged away into the stretch, but weakened entering the final furlong and could
not hold on. TARA eyed the trio fighting it out around the turn, came wide with aim into the stretch, and could only gain gradually late.
MIRACULOUSBLESSING dueled for command between horses early, and yielded approaching the quarter-pole. TIZ ENOUGH bumped with LITTLE
SHAMROCK at the start, saved ground and posed no threat. GOT IT MADE broke sluggishly, and showed little. BUXOM BEAST was finished early three
wide. LITTLE SHAMROCK bumped with TIZ ENOUGH at the start, drifted very wide off the turn and was eased up through the stretch.

Footnotes
INTEREST prompted the pace outside GONEASAGIRLCANGET, took over midway on the far turn, kicked away from MISS MY MACHO in upper stretch,
and held off a rail bid from LADY NOGUEZ with good courage. LADY NOGUEZ was under a firm hold early, went along in traffic through the far turn
alternating between the rail and the two-path, cut the corner into the lane and bid inside INTEREST, but did not have enough. MISS MY MACHO prompted
the pace three wide, challenged outside INTEREST after six furlongs, but was shaken off after straightening away for the drive. KAYSERI broke alertly
despite bobbling slightly, was keyed up under restraint behind the early leaders, shifted off the inside approaching the stretch, and could not gain under
pressure. TEACHER DRAMA settled in the middle of the field two then three wide to the end of the far turn, and lacked a final rally. BABYBEL was in a bit
tight inside LADY NOGUEZ on the first turn, took an awkward step and checked sharply just after completing a quarter-mile, circled four wide late on the far
turn, and was empty. WICKED SOLUTION took an awkward step and checked back shortly after the start, advanced mildly three wide around the far turn,
but could not sustain the bid. GONEASAGIRLCANGET set a pressured pace inside, and folded once displaced for command by the eventual winner.

ROYAL SQUEEZE raced forwardly early, dropped back three wide after a half-mile, continued evenly through the furlong grounds, stayed on task and was
up outside FROSTED GRACE in the last strides. FROSTED GRACE steadied on the rail past the half-mile pole, came out to the two-path past the furlong
marker, reached a short lead between rivals in deep stretch on his left lead, and was nipped near the wire. RUNNING FOR RIZ popped clear soon after the
start, extended the margin around the turn, stayed on his left lead and weakened through the late stages. WHERE PARADISE LAY chased outside
RUNNING FOR RIZ to the stretch, and weakened through the last furlong on the wrong lead. FIRST DEAL was slow away from the gate, saved ground and
could not reach contention.

Footnotes
OVERNIGHT SUCCESS advanced three wide into the turn, ranged up alongside CONGRATS THAT at the top of the stretch, wrested command coming to
the eighth-pole and drove clear. CONGRATS THAT crossed over to the lead after a sharp start, went around the turn being hounded from outside by
OVERNIGHT SUCCESS, could not stave him off by upper stretch but ran on well to hold the place. KING'S CASTLE hugged the rail improving around the
turn, stayed inside and finished evenly. SLICK STAR rushed up after breaking in a bit, lacked room behind CONGRATS THAT up the backstretch and
ultimately steadied into the turn, moved out three wide with a mild gain into the stretch, and flattened out. LAWYER DRILL raced widest throughout, and
lacked the needed late bid. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT was outsprinted to the top by CONGRATS THAT and got shuffled back behind that one up the
backstretch, and could not recover. VISIONS OF YOU could not reach contention four wide. FREDDY SOTO chased outside the pacesetter early, and
faded steadily after three furlongs. WAHOOWAH dropped back early three wide.

WHISKEY SUNRISE began narrowing the gap on HARRYHEE late on the turn, caught the leader in upper stretch and drove well clear. HE'S SMOKIN
NOW raced three wide to the stretch, briefly loomed a threat outside WHISKEY SUNRISE through the furlong grounds, and came up second best.
KRAMMY BOY shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, finished evenly and saved the show. ARRIVEDERLA was outsprinted four wide to the top of
the lane, and finished evenly outside. CHINOMADITO was outrun to the stretch, and passed tired horses. HARRYHEE sped off early, maintained the
advantage to the top of the stretch, and gave way readily inside. GAME BOY BENNY bumped with MR. CESCO after the start, and was finished after a
half-mile. MR. CESCO bumped with GAME BOY BENNY after the start, and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BAY was bumped between horses and checked at the start, advanced while swinging four wide approaching the stretch, rallied to the leaders
from outside through the furlong grounds, overhauled ROSA STAR and drew clear. ROSA STAR rated along setting the pace inside, was no match for the
winner past the eighth-pole, but held to stay clear of the rest. I'LL DO IT MY WAY bumped with TWIRLING CANDY at the break, then slammed into
PRIVATE MESSAGE after that, saved ground lacking room into and around the far turn, moved off the rail bumping GLORIOUS GAL in upper stretch, and
rallied mildly. TIDE STORM saved ground in range for six furlongs, and finished evenly in the two-path. LA CARA BONITA tracked outside ROSA STAR for
six furlongs, and faded through the late stages. GLORIOUS GAL broke out and was off slow, went along under a firm hold between horses up the
backstretch, bumped with I'LL DO IT MY WAY in upper stretch, and made no headway. PANAREA was bumped off stride by BRAMBLE BAY at the start,
advanced three wide to loom a threat after six furlongs, but gave way. PRIVATE MESSAGE got slammed by I'LL DO IT MY WAY and knocked into
BRAMBLE BAY at the start, and was always far back. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE was outrun three wide. TWIRLING WIND bumped solidly with I'LL DO IT
MY WAY at the start, was under a firm hold early, and was finished after six furlongs.
