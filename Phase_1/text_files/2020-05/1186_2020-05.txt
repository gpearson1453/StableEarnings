Footnotes
BRILLIANT BOLT settled off the pace while racing two wide, made progress between foes around the far turn, was behind a wall of horses in upper stretch,
angled out nearing the sixteenth pole, closed outside and was up and clear in deep stretch. VILLAGE PRINCE lacked early speed while racing three wide,
made some progress four deep around the far turn then rallied widest through the lane. PROSPECT TOY saved ground off the duel, bid three wide nearing
the lane, raced between rivals through the stretch and was outkicked. MAD MINER hesitated at the start, saved ground off the pace then rallied through
tight opening between foes in the lane. VENETIAN DRIVE dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened. MUSTA NEVER MET U dueled along the rail to
upper stretch, drifted out and tired. RIVER FLYINRED RVF saved ground in range, bid in upper stretch then weakened. UNBELIEVABLE STORY tracked
the pace three wide and was through after a half.

WHOISAPRETTYGIRL set the pace along the rail, drew clear nearing the lane, drifted out and held clear under steady right-handed urging. OUR BAD GIRL
was off a bit slow, advanced between foes down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn and rallied for the place. FLEETRESS lacked early speed,
raced three wide around the turn, angled wider in upper stretch and was along for the show in the final strides. SHANGHAI MISTRESS pressed the winner
three wide down the backstretch, two wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. KIM'S PET was outsprinted early, raced two wide around most of the
turn, came five wide into the lane and never threatened. DOCUMENTED saved ground to no avail. LIGHTLY DANCING was outrun inside. MRS POOCHIE
vied between foes early, angled to the rail entering the turn, chased inside around the bend and retreated through the lane.

SHE'S RIGHT settled well off the pace while saving ground, angled three wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole, closed outside and was up in the final
strides. CELIA'S PRIDE stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied outside of a foe from there to midstretch, fended off
challenges from both sides leaving the sixteenth pole but was nailed by the winner in the final strides. SING FROSTY saved ground in range early,
advanced two wide around the far turn, slowly gained three wide through the lane but could never get the runner-up. MARYLEE raced well off the pace two
wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly down the center of the track. KIM'S DIAMOND
pressed the pace two wide, had a brief lead midway down the backstretch, vied inside a foe from the five-sixteenths marker to midstretch then weakened.
QUINCYS WAY was outrun while racing two wide. BELLA FEMMINA set the pace along the rail around the first turn then retreated. CRYPTOCROSSING

FACEY'S SISTER broke slowly, lagged well back inside, angled three wide nearing the far turn, finished willingly and was up for the place in the final
strides. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW tracked the pace inside, chased two wide between foes around the far turn, never threatened the winner, battled on
between foes in the lane for the minor awards and lost second late. FONDA ROMANA failed to menace while racing three and four wide. COURTLY KITTY

GRUMPELSTILTSKIN set a rated pace along the rail, repulsed a bid nearing the lane and held clear under a drive. AWSOME FAITH settled off the pace in
the two path, advanced three wide around the far turn then finished willingly through the lane to narrow the gap. BACOLI stalked the pace two wide, bid near
the five-sixteenths pole, pressed the winner around most the far turn then weakened. SIENTE EL VIENTO raced two wide and never threatened. CAT
COME HOME stalked the early pace two wide, angled in nearing the far turn and faded. LITTLE BIG SIME had some early speed inside, was shuffled back
near the five-eighths pole, raced mostly two wide after that and lacked any further bids. WHO'S MY BOSS was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
WALL settled off the early pace two wide, was pushed out four wide entering the clubhouse turn, angled back in midway around that bend, advanced
between rivals down the backstretch, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, vied two wide around the far turn, drove clear in upper stretch
and held sway. NEGRONI UP broke on top, settled back into second early on the first turn, stalked the pace from the rail, dropped back a bit under strong
urging down the backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch and finished willingly. V FOR VIOLENCE tracked the
early pace two wide, bid between foes midway down the backstretch, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied inside of the winner around the far
turn and gave way in midstretch. CASTLEFINN lacked speed while saving ground early, advanced three wide around the far turn, came six wide into the
lane and rallied belatedly. WOODBURN HALL was reluctant to load, fractious in the gate, saved ground up close around the first turn, angled out
approaching the clubhouse turn, stalked the pace three wide from there and came up empty in the lane. OUR CHARITABLE checked at the start, saved
ground well back, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. STARRY SKY played no factor while racing four wide. FRATHOUSE MUSIC
steadied midway around the first turn, raced three and four wide, made a middle move outside of the winner down the backstretch then faded around the far
turn. CAPITAL ASSET was outrun while racing two wide. BRADY'S PALACE advanced two wide to the lead around the first turn, set the pace along the rail
and stopped after six furlongs.
