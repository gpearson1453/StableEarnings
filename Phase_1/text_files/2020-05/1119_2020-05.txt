Footnotes
LASHER prompted the pace two wide, bid near the quarter pole, reached near even terms between foes midway around the far turn, lost several lengths
drifting out into the lane, re-focused in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. BULL MEECHUM set the pace along the rail, re-cleared
cutting the corner as the winner drifted into the lane, continued on his left lead through the stretch, offered little resistance late, was pulled up early,
unsaddled on the turn and walked off. MAN OF THE NIGHT settled off the pace while racing two wide and finished willingly to gain the show. ANY WAY
NOW stalked the pace two wide, bid three wide into the far turn, was floated out a bit nearing the lane and came up empty. ROAD TO DUBAI lacked speed
while saving ground, went three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. LIL SILVER FOX saved ground to no avail. THORN OF ROSE HILL
failed to menace while racing two and three wide. RUM RUNNER RED was outrun inside.

Footnotes
POWER FORWARD was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace early, angled three wide late on the clubhouse turn, bid outside midway down the
backstretch, vied two wide to upper stretch then spurted clear under a drive. SECRET CASTLE raced in range just outside of the winner around the first
turn, did not go with that foe down the backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn and was along late for the place. TREASURED BOND set a
pressured pace along the rail, dueled inside of the winner from the three-eighths to upper stretch then weakened. C V'S CAMPFIRE lacked early speed
while saving ground, angled three wide nearing the far turn and lacked a rally. U S FUNDS was bumped at the start and made little further impact while
racing two and three wide. CLUBIN TILL DAWN pressed the pace two wide and was done after a half.

three wide around that bend, made progress four wide around the clubhouse turn, continued four deep around the far turn, continued on his left lead in the
lane and rallied for the place. SHALL WE DANCE settled off the pace along the inside, made a rail bid rounding the far turn and finished evenly to hold third.
GORGEOUS ROAD raced off the pace three wide, made a big middle move three deep around the clubhouse turn, pressed the pace two wide down the
backstretch, chased two wide between around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. DYNACASTLE stalked the pace two wide, was under urging three
wide between foes around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. ELLIE'S CORK was outrun inside. CANDY PANTS was through after a half and was eased.

CASTLE FIVE set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. OFFSHORE TRIP stalked the pace three wide, could not reel in the winner but
held second. SOUL MACHEN lacked early speed, made progress two wide between foes around the turn and rallied for a slice. KUCHEROV had early
speed inside of the winner, chased inside around the turn and lacked a closing bid. JACKS CITY chased the pace two wide between foes and came up
empty. SKY GAZER R V F was outrun while racing four wide. GLAD MOON (GER) trailed in the two path.

six wide as the pacesetters drifted into the lane, closed outside and was up inside the sixteenth pole. KELLI'S SMILE tracked the pace two wide, bid two
deep around the far turn, was floated out turning for home, took the lead between foes in midstretch but was quickly overpowered by the winner. SWISS
SUNRISE moved two wide around the first turn to take the lead, cleared early on the backstretch, set the pace along the rail from there, drifted out turning
for home, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. THUNDER GRUNDER bumped a foe at the start, saved ground and never threatened. FIBERTOWN was
bumped at the start, set the early pace along the rail and steadily faded after the opening quarter. STEP OUT DANCING was outrun inside. FRATHOUSE
MUSIC saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
UAINTSEENMECRAZYET dropped far back inside, circled five wide around the far turn, surged through the lane and won going away. ALLEGHENY DBL
LIME sprinted clear, set the pace along the rail, continued on his left lead in the lane and could offer little resistance to the winner while holding clear for the
place. HATTA DOUBLE settled off the runaway pacesetter while saving ground and finished evenly to maintain the show. LITTLE MAXIMOVA saved
ground early, went three wide between foes around the far turn, had her heels clipped midway around the far turn, angled back in in upper stretch and
lacked a rally. LADY'S LADY broke in a tangle, was completely devoid of speed, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. LIMEHOUSE LOUISE failed to
menace while racing two wide. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE had early speed three wide and steadily faded. GOIN GANGSTA had early speed two wide and
retreated after a half. MO CUISHLE raced three wide in midpack early, rallied inside of the winner into the far turn, clipped heels near the three-sixteenths
pole, lost the rider but did not fall herself and walked off. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident around the far turn but found no reason to alter
the original order of finish.

DUDES PICK settled in range two wide, moved into a clear second around the far turn, seized command near the sixteenth pole and powered clear under a
drive. UNCUT advanced two wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared and angled in midway down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail to the
sixteenth pole and was no match late. LANESBOROUGH saved ground in midpack early, went three wide around the far turn and was along for the show.
HICKORY MADE had early speed inside, dropped back down the backstretch, lacked a rally but passed some tiring foes to improve position. LIL WATTY
chased the pace four wide, angled in in the lane and weakened. EL BESTIA was outrun inside. LANGLEY GIRL saved ground and played no factor.
DOVES OUT was outrun while racing two and three wide. RACING MY FATHER stalked the pace two wide, had brief bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole
then retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
LIZZIE'S LAST broke outwardly, stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, dropped back two wide around the far turn, lugged in nearing the
sixteenth pole, came through a narrow hole at the rail late to get up in deep stretch. CITY PRINCESS stalked the pace two wide, seized the lead near the
sixteenth pole but was nailed late. SISTER ANNA set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit turning for home, continued on her left lead through the lane,
was collared near the sixteenth pole and held for the show. STERLING FURIOSA lacked early speed while racing two wide, moved up four wide around the
far turn and rallied belatedly widest. WORKPANSOMETHINGS saved ground off the pace, had her heels clipped entering the far turn, went two wide around
the bend and rallied mildly. CHARITABLE MISS settled off the early pace two wide, advanced along the rail around the far turn, steadied off heels nearing
the sixteenth pole and lacked room from there. BELLANDOLA failed to menace while racing two wide. MY COUSIN VICKY was shut off at the start, saved
ground and never factored. CORKY COWGIRL was in range four wide but was through after a half. FLIRTIN HEART clipped heels, fell and walked off. The
Stewards conducted an inquiry but found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
TWO IN THE BUSH tracked the pace four wide around the first turn, cruised up to the front near the three-eighths pole, quickly cleared, angled in and drew
off under a drive to deep stretch. TIPSY TIME lacked speed while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and finished willingly to be a clear
second. NATALIE was in range three wide, could not keep pace with the winner from the three-eighths pole but stayed on well enough to preserve the
show. COLD HEARTED GAL lacked speed, saved ground around both turns, angled out in upper stretch and passed some rivals. TIZAAWESOMEDAY set
the pace along the rail and tired inside around the far turn. COLLINSAVENUE played no factor while racing three wide. MIZZBANG had early speed two
wide and dropped back after a half. ZANGARVA was in range inside for a half and had no closing bid. INDEHERE was outrun while racing two and three
wide. BUTT DIAL was sluggish at the start and never involved.
