Footnotes
SETTING THE MOOD dropped well off the pace and was taken out widest into the backstretch, began picking it up into the far turn, got set down and
collared LA BABIA from outside into the stretch, and drove clear shifting inside. LA BABIA prompted the pace outside TWO CENT TOOTSIE, took over after
six furlongs, proved no match for the winner turning for home, but held the place. TWO CENT TOOTSIE took the lead after the start in the two-path, moved
inside establishing a moderate pace, and yielded after six furlongs. ACT LIKE ARTIE stayed close early, was put to drive on the rail through the far turn, and
was empty. POSITIVE POWER raced three to four wide early, and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
FLYING ALETHA was bumped lightly by LIME at the start, sped to the front soon after while slightly off the inside, was roused mildly through the furlong
grounds a bit tardy changing leads, and coasted in under confident handling. LIME broke in making light contact with FLYING ALETHA, prompted the pace
outside the latter under a long hold for three furlongs, made no impression when set down into the stretch, and ran on much best of the others. WHISTLER
DIXIE was a step slow at the start, hugged the rail and was along to be a distant third. BABY MO veered in at the start, chased after the leaders four wide
into the turn, and faded into the stretch under a drive. GREAT WARRIOR (IRE) was pushed in at the start by her barn mate, raced three to four wide around
the turn, and made no impact. DANESSA LADY broke slowly, and showed little three wide. RANITA was finished early, and dropped far back.

BRASSTOWN stumbled at the start, recovered to a stalking position three wide, took over outside MONMOUTH DR and BEAU TRACE after a half-mile,
drew well clear approaching the stretch, received a single right-handed reminder after straightening away, and was in hand to the finish. MONMOUTH DR
vied inside BEAU TRACE early, could not go with BRASSTOWN entering the far turn, and ran on second best. EARTHQUAKE broke in bumping BEAST
MODE, stayed close early, and made no headway three wide approaching the stretch. BYE BYE MAN saved ground early, and failed to menace. BEAST
MODE got bumped by EARTHQUAKE at the start and was off slow, entered the backstretch four wide, and remained well back. DOCTOR D J raced four
wide into the first turn, and was done early. BEAU TRACE contested the pace outside MONMOUTH DR early, and gave way on the far turn.

CAROLYN'S SMILE chased outside INTO FANCY from the start, made little headway through mid stretch, stayed on task changing leads a sixteenth out,
and forged past while getting floated well out in the track. INTO FANCY sped to the front immediately, showed the way well off the rail to the stretch,
remained clear while beginning to drift further out in deep stretch, and could not hold on. CASSEY'S GIRL was outsprinted in the three-path early, moved to
the far outside into the stretch and posed no threat while best of the others. TWILIGHT was off a beat slow, and never factored inside. DINNER AT FIVE
was a step slow at the start, and outrun four wide.

Footnotes
BIG SPENDER lunged into the left side of the gate and was quickly corrected, rated along setting the pace inside, responded when confronted by
TAYLORSINITIATION through mid stretch, and was edging away again late. TAYLORSINITIATION shied in from BIG SPENDER and had to be pulled off
ALASKAN at the start, loomed up three wide after a half-mile, reached near-even terms outside BIG SPENDER with a furlong to run, but was bested to the
finish. POPPY'S DESTINY lost position around the far turn despite urging, moved to the far outside for the drive and was going well belatedly. STARSHIP
TAXI raced four wide, and lacked a solid response through an even effort. MONEY COME brushed with ALASKAN at the start, brushed the rail early, hit the
rail and checked sharply going by the half-mile pole, and could not gain inside through the lane. BROADWAY PETE chased outside BIG SPENDER, and
faded after a half. I STAND CORRECTED raced three then four wide on the turn, and never reached contention. DECKOLOGY was outrun four wide.
RUSSIAN WINE dropped far back after a half. ALASKAN was crowded between horses at the start and off slowest, and showed little. AN OBJECTION
AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF TAYLORSINITIATION FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS NOT ALLOWED.

INDIRECTLY went along well situated off a battling trio into the turn, ranged up four wide to poke a head in front after six furlongs, and withstood a long
drive to turn back FARM STRONG in game fashion. FARM STRONG moved menacingly five wide coming to the quarter-pole, challenged outside
INDIRECTLY through a long drive, but could not get by while clearly second best. BIG TREASURE went up to contest the pace outside D'GUAPO and
FAYEZ midway up the backstretch, battled on between horses to the top of the stretch, and could not go with the top two while clear of the remainder.
EXPRESS BOY saved ground early, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and could not threaten with an even finish. SULTANNES CROWN took
the worst of a solid bump with MOUNTAIN BREEZE at the start, trailed inside around the turn, and passed tired horses late on the rail. MOUNTAIN
BREEZE bumped solidly with SULTANNES CROWN at the start, made a brief run five or six wide midway on the turn, but flattened out by upper stretch.
FAYEZ vied outside D'GUAPO early, continued on between horses up front through the middle stages, and gave way after six furlongs. D'GUAPO vied for
command inside to late on the turn, and gave way. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
RAY'SWARRIOR prompted the early pace outside PACHANGA PARTY, took over and moved clear past the five sixteenths, and drew away in hand. STAR
JUANCHO lost position around the turn between horses despite urging, shifted out in upper stretch and finished willingly to go clear of the remainder.
PACHANGA PARTY set the pace inside, had no answer when the winner ranged alongside late on the turn, and faded while able to salvage the show.
VALDOCCO saved ground to the turn, entered the lane in the three-path and was no threat. PASS THE GRAVY was finished early three wide. DR HARLAN
was outrun throughout. CHARGE CARD raced three to four wide around the turn, and tired. MAKING A MARC trailed outside.

Footnotes
LILO'S CALL tracked the leaders for a half-mile, took over outside CENTSLESS DRAMA approaching the quarter-pole, and drew off under a drive while
drifting out late. LADY FIORELLA was under a drive from midway on the turn four then three wide, and rallied mildly for the place. TRIESTE (BRZ)
advanced past tired horses after six furlongs, and was along for the show while never a threat. CENTSLESS DRAMA took over inside MISS CHLOE G after
a quarter-mile, could not withstand LILO'S CALL after six furlongs, and faded through the lane. JUST A BIT SASSY brushed the right side of the gate a bit
awkward at the start, and was no factor four wide. MY CANDY GIRL was finished early four wide. MISS CHLOE G led early, was content to prompt
CENTSLESS DRAMA from outside up the backstretch, and faltered after six furlongs. CHANNELED'S ANGEL was in range early, dropped back under
pressure entering the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
FAST PASS dropped back after an alert beginning, took closer order after a half-mile near the two-path, dove to the rail inside the leaders in upper stretch,
and edged MUCHO to the wire. MUCHO advanced three wide late on the turn, wrested a short lead outside ADMIRAL LYNCH with a furlong remaining, ran
on with good courage and missed narrowly. ADMIRAL LYNCH pressed the early pace outside WENTZ, outdueled that rival around the turn to get the lead
through a sharp half-mile, could not hold off MUCHO through the furlong grounds and just salvaged the show while weakening. COOL ARROW was
outsprinted three wide for a half, moved to the far outside and was closing in gradually too late. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) made a mild run four wide
under a drive late on the turn, but flattened out coming to the eighth-pole. WENTZ hustled up to get the lead after the start, was hard-pressed by ADMIRAL
LYNCH into the turn, and began to fade at the top of the stretch. JAGUAR POZ raced forwardly inside for a half, and tired.

the quarter-pole and into upper stretch, and edged clear while drifting out steadily. BAHAMIAN PARK contested the early pace inside INGREIDO, took back
and went around to rebid outside past the three-eighths, weakened approaching the eighth-pole and saved the place while drifting out. ALLGORILLA got
shut off behind BODIE CODY and checked at the start, advanced inside rivals in the two-path approaching the stretch, but could not sustain the rally with an
even finish. SNORING BARTH lagged well back saving ground on the turn, stayed inside and passed tired horses. BEINFUN broke out bumping BODIE
CODY at the start, and tired inside around the turn. BODIE CODY got bumped by BEINFUN at the start, showed brief speed, and tired five wide before
reaching the stretch. GOOD TIMING MAN retired after a half-mile, and was eased up in the stretch.
