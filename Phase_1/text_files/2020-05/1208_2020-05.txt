Footnotes
LIZZY'S INTHEGAME was content to trail to the second turn, shifted off the rail at the five sixteenths, came two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down
for the drive and closed steadily to wear down AMERICAN ROYALTY late. AMERICAN ROYALTY contested the pace from the rail to the stretch, resisted
the favorite in mid stretch then could not stall the winner. VONHRA was unhurried to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch then shifted in and was
gaining inside late. WAVERLY WAY was a pace factor from the outset, pressed the leader two wide to the stretch, dueled to mid stretch but could not get by
and weakened. TOOLEY TUNES checked off heels nearing the first tursn, settled to the half, saved ground to the the stretch then lacked the needed late
response. ROUGE BOUQUET was fanned four wide while chasing the pace, bid three wide on the second turn but came up empty in the drive.

MOTHER OF DRAGONS hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded in the drive and held. VRONILLA PARFAIT had no
speed, was three wide into the turn, eased to the two path into the stretch then closed steadily for second. MISIRLOU bumped with BEZZY at the start,
pressed the winner inside, shifted off the rail on the turn, loomed a threat to mid stretch but could not sustain the needed response. SPRING HEAT stalked
the pace two wide to the stretch but was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened. BEZZY bumped with MISIRLOU at the start, had no speed then saved
ground to no avail. MAGNA ROSE chased the pace early, was fanned four wide on the turn then bled in the stretch, was pulled up by the rider before
crossing the finish line and walked off.

some late. WHOA BUDDY was chasing early, got fanned to the four path on the turn then could not threaten in the drive. SIZZLING JAMIE stalked the

Footnotes
MOONSHINE ANNIE was just outside the favorite to the half, never gave that one a breather, responded when set down for the drive and inched clear
determinedly. ODESSA set the pace under steady pressure from the winner, saved ground to the stretch, dug in stubbornly late but could not hold.
SENORITA COMETA was allowed to settle to the half, advanced inside on the second turn, loomed boldly a furlong out but could not sustain the needed
bid. LIVE IT WELL tracked the top two three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. LUCKY MS JONES had no speed, was
outrun to the second turn then circled four wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. EDDIE'S PRINCESS chased the pace to the second
turn, was three wide to the stretch then gave way in the drive. IT'S BIG AINE settled mid pack to the second turn, was asked for speed two wide but tired in
the drive. GO MUSKEE showed little.
