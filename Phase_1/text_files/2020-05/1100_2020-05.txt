Footnotes
NOLA'S SUGARPLUM dueled from outside CHARMING DIVA from early on, moved clear in upper stretch and drifted out while drawing off under urging.
WITTS QUESTION stalked the leaders three wide and gained the place but could not close on the winner. CHARMING DIVA dueled about the two or three
path inside the winner and could not hold position in the lane. OBVI bumped with a rival at the start, moved five wide into the lane and had no rally. MY
LITTLE CHARLIE bumped with a rival at the start then failed to mount a bid two to three wide. ITYBITYQUIKASAKITY broke outward, chased the leaders
five and six wide through the turn into the lane and weakened. TIZASPELL saved ground and failed to threaten. WADABOUTDAREST trailed.

Footnotes
BANANA PEPPER moved up three wide to join the leaders in the second turn, continued from outside BEST TRICK YET to duel up the backstretch and
through the final turn then slowly edged clear under steady handling. BEST TRICK YET was on the pace outside MASCARPONE early, continued with the
winner as that one challenged in the second turn, dueled to upper stretch and gave ground grudgingly. CAPTAIN JOHN stalked the pace three wide and
gained position in the lane but could not threaten late. MASCARPONE contested the pace for a half mile along the inside and weakened. PRAISE BE TO
GOD was not a factor racing three or four wide.

Footnotes
RADICATOR was shuffled back at the break then caught five wide around the first turn, rallied four wide to collar the leaders and quickly move clear into the
lane then drew off under steady handling. WALKER'S BULLET stalked the pace three or four wide and rallied to gain the place while no threat to the winner.
WITTS SHORT STOP dueled on the early pace out from the rail and inside EXPLOSIVE SHOES then came up empty once headed in the lane.
WHATATRIP moved up four wide but could not threaten in the drive. EXPLOSIVE SHOES dueled on the early pace inside WITTS SHORT STOP and
weakened in the drive. LET IT RIP broke into the side of the gate then came in further and failed to threaten. MY EASY CASH saved ground and was not a
factor. HEZA FORTUNE stumbled and nearly unseated his rider at the start and never recovered. KIDO'S SLING SHOT saved ground and weakened.

JUDGE ON THE RUN tracked the early pace outside LOVESAFLYIN to reel that one in through the far turn and move clear then held the margin under
steady handling. CHAMBER DOORS followed the pace three or four wide, angled five wide into the lane gained clear for the place but could not get to the
winner. UBETCHA IMA BUMPER saved ground in reach of the pace lacked a final closing run. JAMACIAN ME MONEY made a mild four wide to rally to
best the others. MINE FOR A SONG moved up three wide while not a threat. P R GIRL CRUSH was not a factor three wide. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN failed
to mount a bid racing three wide. LOVESAFLYIN showed the most early speed to cross over and gain the inside, made the pace to the far turn and tired in
the lane. HOLD FAST KAT saved ground and tired.

SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE was on the pace inside rivals throughout, kept on in the drive and held safe by a shrinking margin. JESSICA GLITTERS settled
off the early pace four wide3, rallied into the lane and was slowly getting to the winner late. RANBIR contested the pace outside rivals to bid into the lane but
could not handle the top pair late. TOCCETTA saved ground to the far turn, angled four wide into the lane moved up while not a threat. LEGENDARY
SONG was not a factor. VAGARY bobbled at the start, saved ground and tired. MABEL BELLE contested the early pace between rivals and gave way going
to the far turn.

FEARLESS KITTY dueled on the early pace inside FRIEND OF DUBAI, was joined by WHERE'S RUFUS nearing the lane, dug in when headed and rallied
back to gain the advantage again late. WHERE'S RUFUS stalked the pace three or four wide to bid through the far turn and show in front turning for home
but could not hold the winner safe late. SMOKIN B settled four wide off the early pace, rallied through the far turn and slowly closed in the lane but came up
short. COUNTRY CURE settled off the pace three wide, angled out in the far turn to move five wide into the lane gained position but could not threaten late.
COUNTRY SUMMER tucked inside to save ground early, ran up into traffic in the far turn and awaited room nearing the lane then could not regain the rally
once clear. BROADWAY RIDGE was climbing into the first turn and dropped back three wide, swung seven wide into the lane and could not threaten.
HANDSOME DEPUTY stalked the early leaders three wide and weakened. FRIEND OF DUBAI dueled on the early pace outside the winner and tired.

AMERIPOINT settled back off the pace three wide, moved up going to the far turn, rallied five wide into the lane reeled in the leader to move off under
steady handling. SONGSTER bobbled at the break, recovered to chase the early leader three or four wide and move well clear into the far turn then could
not handle the winner in the lane while holding position. NATTYTYME stalked the pace from three wide and lacked a final closing bid. STREET RULER
broke inward and dropped back off the early pace while saving ground, angled four wide going to the far turn and moved up in the lane but could not
threaten late. TEXAS TROUBADOR saved ground and failed to mount a bid. MASTERPIECE DAY lunged at the break, settled three wide and lacked a
rally. LOGAN'S HEROE bobbled at the break and failed to mount a solid bid four wide. STARLING showed the most early speed to cross over and make the
early pace about the two path then had nothing left after a half mile. SPRING LOADED pulled up with an injury going to the far turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
KNIGHT DISRUPTOR tracked the pace outside DUN SOBER to bid and move clear through the far turn then held safe in the lane. TOP OF THE PAGE was
along the inside to move up through the far turn, angled outside the winner and closed but could not reach that one. MALLORY'S BANDIT dropped back
four and five wide, moved up and gained the show while no threat to the top pair. FOR THE HUSTLE saved ground and lacked a final closing run. SPOON
BOSS failed to mount a rally three or four wide. MASTERFUL STRIDE was just off the early pace racing four wide, bid into the far turn and could not sustain
the run. LONDON LEGACY stalked the pace four and five wide, bid into the far turn and could not sustain the move. LUCKYNSUCCESSFUL was not a
threat three wide. DUN SOBER showed the most early speed about the two path and tired in the far turn. LOVETHATCAUSE RAN THE RACE WITH THE
ASSISTANT STARTER'S LEAD ROPE STILL ATTACHED AND WAS HINDERED THE ENTIRE TRIP. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, LOVETHATCAUSE
WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER AND ALL WAGERS INVOLVING THAT HORSE IN STRAIGHT WAGERS WERE REFUNDED, MULTIPLE RACE
WAGERS REVERTED TO THE POST TIME FAVORITE AND A CONSOLATION DAILY DOUBLE PAID.
