Footnotes
RIGGSKI away quickly in the beginning then stalked the LOVE AND HOLD up the backstretch, bid outside the leader and collared rival midway around the
turn, quickly gained control midway through the turn, kicked clear into the lane and drew away under left then right-handed urging late. SOUND CHECKERS
stalked outside RIGGSKI, took aim three wide then four wide into the stretch, could not match the winner in the late stages and held safely for the place.
MALIBU MAGIC lacked early speed from off the rail, raced alongside HERE I GO INDY, bumped with that rival then checked between runners entering the
turn, angled to the inside, shifted out around LOVE AND HOLD who was weakening approaching the sixteenth marker, and earned the show.
IMPEACHMENT ACE raced three wide through the turn, came out in the upper stretch and lacked a serious bid. LOVE AND HOLD sent for the lead from
the inside, set the pace from in the two path, fought the rider while trying to lug out from the inside around the turn and came out approaching the eighth
pole, and weakened in the drive. HERE I GO INDY tracked the pace from the inside, bumped with MALIBU MAGIC and steadied entering the turn, saved
ground to the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
ATONARUN bumped from both sides at the start, shook off the troubled beginning and vied three deep, dueled with VERMEER into and around the turn,
cleared inside rival leaving the bend, stayed clear in the final furlong and held well. SHARON'S FURY stumbled and bumped by inside rival leaving the gate,
raced off the rail then angled in on the turn, steered out in the lane, rallied and gained the place. HOSS CARTWRIGHT broke out and bumped rival, showed
speed between rivals but was outpaced and chased the top pair up the backstretch, angled out leaving the turn and finished willingly. VERMEER vied for
the lead with outside foes, dueled with the winner into and around the turn, kept on well from the inside but was outfinished in the late stages.
BALLYCASTLE unhurried in the early stages, traveled along the inside to the stretch and failed to respond when asked. GO SAMMY GO settled early, went
outside a rival on the turn but was carried out into the five path and had little left for the drive. SIERRA ECHO bumped both sides leaving the gate, angled
inward early, asked right-handed near the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out on the turn and came up empty in the final furlong.
