Footnotes
SOCIALLY ASTRAY began to get in gear shifting two or three wide near the quarter-pole, kicked in past mid stretch, and ran by the leaders from outside
through the last 70 yards. TRINNI SUNSHINE eased back on the rail letting the leading trio fight it out early, moved out four wide to go after them
approaching the stretch, changed leads awkwardly reaching even terms for the lead outside NENITA in deep stretch, and edged that one for second.
NENITA vied for command outside AWESOME EVIL and TOO STYLISH early, fought on between rivals through the furlong grounds, moved inside late and
yielded grudgingly. LUCKY ANGELS DREAM raced three then four wide around the turn, and lacked a solid bid outside. AWESOME EVIL vied inside rivals
to upper stretch, and weakened on the rail. TOO STYLISH contested the pace between horses, dropped out of the skirmish near the five-sixteenths pole,
and faded steadily.

Footnotes
DESCENTE cleared from the three-path to the lead and moved inside around the first turn, rated along widening the advantage steadily after six furlongs,
and was kept busy to about 50 yards out. BAHAMA KITTEN stumbled and broke out at the start, recovered to track behind the pacesetter inside, moved to
the two-path under a drive on the far turn as the leader left everyone behind, and prevailed inside VITAEMI for the place. VITAEMI bumped with YAKO while
in a bit tight between that one and BAHAMA KITTEN at the start, moved up five wide leaving the first turn, chased outside BAHAMA KITTEN the rest of the
way and was edged for second. SPICY NELLY moved up three wide leaving the first turn, and stayed in range for nearly six furlongs before fading. YAKO
bumped with VITAEMI at the start, and was through early. QUICK POINT steadied slightly midway on the first turn, and dropped far back before reaching
the stretch. VALLEY DATE raced four wide, and tired after six furlongs. OUR CLOSURE retired early.

SOLITARY GEM bumped with FOREVER MARTA at the start, took closer order already under a drive late on the turn, had aim outside the leaders in upper
stretch, and rallied determinedly to overhaul them a sixteenth out. BARGAINAIRE chased outside SEMINOLE SUNSHINE from the start, turned up the
pressure with a quarter-mile remaining, loomed a threat between horses in mid stretch, and came up second best. SAMMIE SUNSHINE came out after the
start, sprinted clear early, held on to the furlong grounds and faded on the rail. FOREVER MARTA bumped with SOLITARY GEM at the start, raced three
wide and failed to threaten. SLINGIN SAMMY B broke in and was a step slow to begin, was outrun three to four wide for a half-mile, and was eased up in
the stretch. MOONSTONE was pushed out a bit at the start by SAMMIE SUNSHINE, showed brief speed inside before retreating, and was eased up in the
stretch.

Footnotes
PANAREA pressed the pace outside FAST CATALINA, challenged in earnest after a half-mile, wrested command in upper stretch, and was all out to eke
out the decision over CHEZ PAREE while drifting out steadily through the last sixteenth of a mile. CHEZ PAREE hustled up inside after breaking a step
slow, moved three wide driven late on the turn, rallied outside PANAREA past the eighth-pole under heavy pressure, drifted out steadily and just missed.
SEAMIALAUGH got pushed out at the start by RUNNING GIRL, raced four wide around the turn, lacked a response winding up inside the top two, and was
along for the show. FAST CATALINA set the pace inside to upper stretch, and gave way on the rail. CAPTURED LIGHT broke out bumping FEATHER'S
SECRET into NA NA DUDE at the start, and was outrun. FEATHER'S SECRET was bumped into NA NA DUDE by CAPTURED LIGHT at the start, and
was outrun. NA NA DUDE got bumped by FEATHER'S SECRET at the start, and dropped far back four wide on the turn. RUNNING GIRL broke out at the
start, and was finished early three wide.

GLASS CEILING took command soon after the start, rated along in the two-path, shook off ADDILYN going comfortably past the quarter-pole, got set down
through upper stretch and drifted out briefly while clear, and jumped back to her left lead a sixteenth out still well in control. ADDILYN led through the
opening strides before deferring, sat perched just outside GLASS CEILING into the turn, made no impression under a drive approaching the top of the
stretch, and ran on for the place while lugging in late. MONEY NEVER SLEEPS advanced mildly four wide after a half-mile, and continued on evenly. TALE
OF SUCCESS raced two wide around the turn, moved out in the stretch and had no rally. BATTLEOFWINTERFELL pressed the early pace inside, was put
to pressure into the turn and was empty after a half-mile. GINGER KITTY stumbled at the start, raced four wide and dropped far back in the stretch.

DOUBLE CROWN stayed close between horses early, eased out three wide to challenge still between foes after a half-mile, lugged in slightly in upper
stretch, and held on firmly outside GREEN LIGHT GO through the late stages. GREEN LIGHT GO pressed the pace outside CAJUN CASANOVA from the
start, was in tight briefly between that one and DOUBLE CROWN in upper stretch, and stayed on stubbornly inside the winner. WITH VERVE saved ground
outsprinted for a half, moved out late on the turn, gained gradually with a clear shot outside the top two past the eighth-pole, but did not have enough.
OURNATIONONPARADE broke out at the start, raced in striking range three then four wide to the top of the stretch, and lacked a final response. CAJUN
CASANOVA brushed the right side of the gate while away alertly, set a pressured pace inside, shifted out slightly while weakening approaching the
eighth-pole, and gave way. RICKI TICKI TAFFI stayed close early inside, but faded steadily through the lane. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY
THE RIDER OF GREEN LIGHT GO ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

KROY bumped with FOREVER MO at the start, took control rating along slightly off the rail, widened into the stretch with the rider taking a peek back, and
remained well clear hand urged to the finish. ALMASHRIQ hit the left side of the gate and was very slow into stride, began moving three wide after a
half-mile, and rallied to go clear of the others while never a threat to the winner. THUNDER RIDE was boxed in behind KROY and brushed with FOREVER
MO past the half-mile pole, dropped back inside and lacked a further response.. FOREVER MO bumped with KROY at the start, chased outside up the
backstretch, held his ground brushing with THUNDER RIDE and keeping that foe pinned approaching the turn, but had nothing left by the top of the lane
and dropped back.

Footnotes
CASINO GRANDE broke out at the start, tracked the pace three wide, ranged up to poke a head in front after six furlongs outside UNTITLED and CAJUN
BROTHER, drew clear in upper stretch and widened under pressure. EXTRAORDINARY stayed in range early inside, shifted out to the four-path under
strong urging before reaching the stretch, and finished willingly. EDGE OF FIRE hit the right side of the gate and brushed into GOLDEN CANDY at the start,
settled in the middle of the field between horses early, shifted out five wide past the quarter-pole, and rallied mildly. LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE broke out at the
start, raced well back saving ground for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch and passed tired horses. UNTITLED broke out at the start, pressed the pace
outside CAJUN BROTHER, bid for command between horses under heavy pressure late on the turn, and gave way coming to the eighth-pole. CAJUN
BROTHER set a pressured pace inside, yielded to CASINO GRANDE and UNTITLED nearing the quarter-pole, appeared to hit the rail at the top of the
stretch and dropped back. GOLDEN CANDY got brushed by EDGE OF FIRE at the start, and tired three wide before reaching the stretch. SMALL REASON
broke out at the start, went along in the second flight early, and dropped back four wide around the turn.

Footnotes
JAKARTA set a pressured early pace inside, was under a drive to fend off a challenge from VALEDICTORIAN approaching the stretch, dug in and kicked
away from that rival past the eighth-pole, and remained clear. BELLA CIAO was outrun inside for six furlongs, got steered out in upper stretch, and found
her best stride a sixteenth out rallying outside rivals. VALEDICTORIAN advanced into the turn three wide, loomed menacingly reaching near-even terms
outside JAKARTA after six furlongs, could not get by and weakened with a furlong remaining, and just saved the show. VALIANCE bobbled at the start,
shifted out four wide under a drive approaching the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. W W FITZY pressed the pace outside JAKARTA to the turn, gave way
before completing six furlongs, and drifted out fading through the lane. GOODBYE BROCKLEY raced three wide, and could not keep pace after six furlongs.
GREAT SISTER DIANE dropped back to trail early, and remained outrun. This race was hand timed.

LADY'S ISLAND broke in at the start, sped to the front well off the rail, rated along clear in the three-path around the turn, settled into the stretch well in
command, and faced no challenges under a drive. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY saved ground early in the middle of the field, advanced through the turn
gradually moving out four wide, made no further gains through the stretch but held the place while drifting out some. BELLERA broke open the stall door
prior to the start, was outrun early inside, came off the rail going around a tiring TWO SIXTY past the five-sixteenths, moved back to the rail and rallied
mildly to best the others. STARSHIP BONITA was crowded behind LADY'S ISLAND at the start, raced five wide around the turn, and posed no threat with
an even finish. LIZA STAR broke open the stall door prior to the start, moved off the inside giving futile chase to the pacesetter around the turn, and gave
way through the stretch. J P'S DELIGHT was no factor four wide. OCEANS OF LOVE brushed the right side of the gate at the start, raced forwardly outside
early, and was through after a half-mile. PICARA was always outrun. TWO SIXTY chased early, and had nothing left by late on the turn.

Footnotes
TRISOMIA closed in outside STORM THE BRIDGE after a half-mile, reached the front entering the final furlong and drove clear. CAPITAN FOFO advanced
mildly while moving out three wide late on the turn, and rallied outside to get up for a share of second. STORM THE BRIDGE sped off to a lengthy lead
early, saw most of it whittled away by upper stretch, weakened through the late stages and just saved a share of second. MIGHTY FAST broke out, bumped
AMAZING MOMENT and stumbled at the start, saved ground outrun to the stretch, and rallied mildly. BRIAN'S AVENUE raced three wide around the turn,
could not threaten and drifted out late. AMAZING MOMENT got bumped by MIGHTY FAST at the start and was last away, and raced far back inside.
CAPTAIN YENNER stayed in range early outside, gave way after a half-mile four wide, and dropped back through the lane on the far outside.
