WALK ON WATER vied between foes up the backstretch, dueled with GUTSY STREAK from the inside through the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and
drew off under right handed urging. GUTSY STREAK vied three deep, dueled outside and three wide into the stretch, could not match the winner late but
held the place. QUANTUM FORCE broke in, tracked the quartet through he early stages, went three wide around the turn and summoned a mild response
to earn the show. MELCHIOR vied from the inside, lost ground around the turn and continued to next to the fence into the drive, failed to find more in the
final furlong and edged for the show. KNIGHT SOLAIRE popped the front of the gate open but did not leave the stall, showed speed four deep, chased
three wide around the turn then drifted out a bit entering the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PIE O MY set the pace inside, padded the lead around the turn, asked right-handed in upper stretch and won easily under a hand ride in the final sixteenth.
VERYNSKY chased the pace three deep, went three wide around the turn and bested the rest. SPEEDY RIDE traveled four deep up the backstretch, four
wide through the turn and was along for the show. P TOWN TITAN bumped both sides leaving the gate, reserved in the early going, saved ground around
the turn, tipped out in the stretch and passed tired rivals. SHARED bumped from the outside leaving the gate, chased the leader from the inside into and
around the turn and weakened in the drive. LOST THE MINISTER broke in and bumped rival, between runners in the early going, crowded a bit near the
five-sixteenths pole, put in tight quarters again and lacked room from the quarter pole to the three-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch and had
little left for the final furlong.
