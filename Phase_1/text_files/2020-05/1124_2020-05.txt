Footnotes
COMMON COURTESY tracked from the pocket behind the dueling leaders through the turn, tipped three wide straightening for home for clear racing room,
responded when asked for run in upper stretch, took over at the furlong pole, and drew off under driving pressure. ORB'S SOUL advanced in the three path
around the turn to be behind horses turning for home, stayed inside for racing room while others shifted outwards, then rallied between horses for place. MY
SWEET KAT set the pace inside of TAP N SWAY, dug in in upper stretch as multiple rivals made bids, but was no match for the eventual winner at the
furlong pole, then kept on to hold show. TAP N SWAY prompted then dueled with the leader two wide into the turn, vied between horses turning for home,
but hung on his left lead through the lane and got outfinished for minor rewards. MONEY WELL SPENT was forwardly placed two wide, got floated three
wide at the quarter pole, but lacked a kick through the lane. LIAM'S LOOKOUT ran evenly in the three path. BOW DOWN TEWMEY saved ground, but to no
avail. NATIVE CHARM hesitated at the start, then weakened on his left lead through the lane. SEMINOLE SISTERS had a slow start and shied outwards,
then failed to factor from the three to four path. TEMRIK failed to threaten three to five wide and between horses. SIGNIFY was caught four to six wide
around the turn and faded. FOX FREY ducked in at the start after feeling right handed pressure multiple times, avoided the inner rail, then trailed the field by
a distance and galloped across the wire.

Footnotes
HETTY G. broke outwards, stalked the pace setter three wide, chased that loose leader in upper stretch, and determinedly wore that rival down in the final
sixteenth. RED JERSEY cleared off from the field at the half mile pole and angled to the rail into the turn, held a clear lead in upper stretch, dug in at the
sixteenth pole as HETTY G inched closer, but was worn down by that rival. HEART RIVER shifted from the four to seven path while far off of the pace
turning for home, and rallied outside of rivals for a minor reward. MI CHACHIS INTENTA was off multiple lengths show, which allowed her to avoid trouble
from both sides, trailed the field in the two path early on, advanced inside of foes through the turn, shifted to the five path ion upper stretch, but found traffic
and was shut off from clear racing room, tipped out at the furlong pole, and offered a good late kick. A WICKED WILDCAT took the turn in the three to four
path before shifting to the six path in upper stretch, then finished mildly. TRACI'S GREELEY had a slow start, recovered to race midpack two wide and
between horses, and chased evenly without making a bid. SO ARISTOCRATIC broke in and bumped a foe into multiple other rivals, raced in midpack three
to four wide and outside of horses through the turn, then finished evenly. ABOUNDING vied along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with the leader
at the half mile pole, then further weakened in upper stretch. RATHRBLUCKYTHNGOOD saved ground, but weakened around the turn. STELLAR
STILETTO was forced inwards and pinballed between horses at the start, then failed to make an impact in the two path. BOOMERANG BABY vied two wide
and between horses early on, was through early. TARNISH raced off of the pace in the three path,steadied slightly when A WICKED WILDCAT shifted
across her path at the five furlong pole, shuffled slightly behind that rival, then never got involved thereafter.

Footnotes
P R RADIO STAR stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, drew off passing the furlong pole under driving pressure, then was wrapped up
approaching the wire. DEEP SEA swung seven wide to the widest of all in upper stretch, and rallied past inner rivals to just reach place approaching the
wire. SATURDAY TRYST quickly cleared, held an advantage turning for home, but was confronted and headed by P R RADIO in upper stretch, was no
match for that rival at the furlong pole, but kept on, then got nipped for place. HOLD ME BLACK was caught four wide in midpack through the turn,
advanced outside of rivals to be in range of the leader in the five path turning for home, but got outfinished. SCARF IT DOWN saved ground, then rallied
mildly along the rail and inside of rivals through the lane. ROCKSHAW saved ground just behind the leaders, shifted off of the rail in midstretch for racing
room, but lacked a kick, and subsequently tired. POWERFUL ALLY shifted from the three to the five path turning for home, but failed to threaten.
FASCILITATOR broke outwards, saved ground while far off of the pace, angled to the six path in upper stretch, then failed to factor. STATE TREASURER
was squeezed at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, came into the lane in the three to four path between rivals, and faltered. BLINDED VISION
prompted the pace two wide, then attempted a bid between horses turning for home, but stopped in upper stretch and wilted. CODETOWIN was pinched
back at the start, trailed the field by a large distance early on, was eased into the far turn, then pulled up, dismounted, and untacked at the five sixteenths
pole, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CAT'S PAJAMAS stalked three wide through the first turn, tipped from the two to four path at the five sixteenths pole to make a bid for the lead turning for
home, drew off when asked in midstretch, and was kept to task with a clear advantage through the final furlong. FLABBERGASTED broke outwards, stalked
two wide, was floated from the three to the five path turning for home, but got outkicked by her inner rival in upper stretch, and chased that leader through
the lane before holding place at the wire. LUCK MONEY raced midpack in the three to four path around both turns, was floated to the six path straightening
into the lane, then chased the leader home and missed place. THREE FLAMINGOS was jostled between horses at the start, got caught four to five wide
while gaiing around the far turn, was floated to the seven path turning for home, then kept on without threatening. FAVORITE SIN trailed around the far turn,
shifted to the four to five path in upper stretch, but was quickly steered inwards at the furlong pole to rally inside of foes, but finished evenly. SISTA OF WAR
stalked the loose leader, inched forward in the three path around the far turn to make a bid, but weakened at the furlong pole. DUOPOLY was caught in the
five, then four, path around the first turn, angled to the three path into the far turn to be behind the leaders turning for home, but lacked a kick, and
weakened. LEFTATTHEALTAR bumped a foe at the start, four to three wide first turn, then never threatened after lugging inwards in upper stretch. TELLER
TO SING was no factor after coming under a drive into the far turn. WELL RESPECTED saved ground, but to no avail. INDAWIN saved ground, but
weakened into the far turn. MOONLIGHT DANCING cleared the field in hand into the first turn, but faltered turning for home and stopped.

Footnotes
DEAN MARTINI set an easy pace while in hand and a bit off of the rail, widened his margin in upper stretch under driving pressure, then was geared down
through the late stages. OBIWAN prompted the pace setter from the four then three path around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper
stretch, then held place to prove second best. MY PRIMO was forwardly placed two wide between horses, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper
stretch, then held show through the lane. BOURBON WISDOM tracked from midpack three to four wide, but finished evenly without threatening. SMIRK
saved ground from midpack, shifted to the five path to be outside of rivals in upper stretch, but was flat lacked a kick. STOCK DEAL bobbled a bit at the
start, saved ground far off of the pace, shifted to the three to four path in upper stretch, but failed to make a bid. ELITE CLASS shifted from the three to six
path turning for home, but lacked a rally outside of rivals. NILES CHANNEL stalked from the pocket, but failed to make a bid and weakened in upper stretch.
BEAR OAK hesitated at the start and broke multiple lengths slowly, trailed, then failed to make an impact. WHATA PERFECT DAY was no factor in the two
path. LIBERTY'S PURSUIT was caught four wide around the first turn, shifted to the inside into the far turn, but was never involved. HOFFA stalked four
wide, but weakened passing the half mile pole, and was eased through the lane.

PRINCE JERSEY TOWN vied for the lead early three wide, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive down the stretch and prevailed at the
wire. TOSHIO set the pace early from between horses, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch and just missed at the wire. THE
FEATURE raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied in the stretch and was gaining in the late stages. CHASING ANNA tracked the pace
early four wide, made a bid three wide into the lane but weakened late in the stretch run. HOOF PRINCE chased the pace early, was in the five path into the
lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. WHISKY MAN raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch run.

was never a factor. BOURBON NATIVE was never involved. ENTERTAINMENT was bothered at the start and done early. DANZAR was through early.
