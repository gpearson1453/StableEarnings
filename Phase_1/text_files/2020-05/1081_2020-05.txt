Footnotes
PRISON PADRE was rated along the inside tracking just off the leaders inside a rival racing to the backstretch, came through close quarters nearing upper
stretch to bid along the rail once entering the lane and edged forward to a narrow advantage late under brisk right handed pressure to prevail. BRANDY
CHASER was prompted to a forward placing racing to the first turn, conceded some position into the backstretch to track the leaders just outside the
eventual winner for a half, advanced racing into the far turn to press the issue three deep through the second bend, edged forward racing into upper stretch,
resisted between foes in a grudging effort and prevailed for the place honors while just failing to contain the winner. DONNIE BRASCO, knocked back at the
start, was collected to track off the second flight shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing through the far turn,
loomed four wide racing into upper stretch, lugged inwards a bit despite firm left handed pressure and was just outkicked by the top pair. DIG IN, reserved
while angling to the inside in early stages, swung out five wide into upper stretch gaining some position but lacked the needed final kick. TEMPLE MOUNT
broke inwards cutting off DONNIE BRASCO at the start, was urged to gain a forward placing racing just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, was prompted
to press the issue between foes on the far turn to upper stretch but gave way in late stages. FAST FAIRY was hustled to the lead racing a bit off the rail into
the backstretch, dueled inside foes racing into the far turn and gave way leaving the quarter mile marker. SOMETHING BIRD was settled outside a rival in
the last flight early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WOWZA MAN broke readily to dispute the pace inside a rival racing off the inside through the backstretch, shook clear entering the turn, then maintained
the advantage in an all out drive under brisk left handed pressure to prevail. MISTER MISTER tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along the
inside to the turn, was prompted to advance in tandem with HAPPY GUY while being bumped by that foe midway through the turn, continued with interest
inside the winner through the stretch to challenge for command and prevailed for the place honors while just failing to gain even terms. HAPPY GUY tracked
the leaders from out of striking distance racing in the three path through the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the turn while being urged to advance
between rivals in tandem with MISTER MISTER, bumped that rival midway through the bend, then shifted out three deep leaving midstretch while moving to
challenge but was outkicked by the top pair. NOBLE KING settled into stride racing a bit off the inside, angled out nearing midstretch and continued with an
effort to improve position. JUST SHOOT ALREADY, forwardly placed tracking just off the first flight in the opening quarter, shifted out three wide racing
through the turn continuing in pursuit of the leader but faded into upper stretch. SAND BAY BREEZE urged to terms with the eventual winner pressing the
pace outside that foe in the opening quarter, gave way racing into the turn. MY COMPUTER proved no factor. ALVARADO never threatened.

Footnotes
RIONERO was rated between foes just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted through close quarters nearing the far turn, angled
outside foes nearing the lane, shifted five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. IN HONOR
OF ARTIE, reserved three deep between foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the far turn while being
prompted to advance, moved to wrest command in that path nearing upper stretch to go briefly clear but just failed to contain the winner.
ANALYZEYOURVISION was rated off the second flight inside foes in the opening half, was held up in traffic racing into the far turn, switched outside a tiring
foe, then threaded his way between foes through the far turn to late stages to gain position to the end. DRILL BIT was settled last to the backstretch,
switched out five wide after a half while being prompted to advance with an early move, circled to the lead between calls nearing upper stretch but flattened
out entering the lane. MR. HAND FULL sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail, held sway on a clear margin to the backstretch, briefly resisted to regain
a clear advantage when challenged after a half, dueled for command into the lane and gave out late. GIMMEABREAK, forwardly placed three deep in
second flight tracking the pacesetter, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path between rivals racing into the far turn and faded into the lane.
WHEELBARRELBROTHRS, urged to a forward placing in second flight racing to the backstretch, lodged a brief bid between rivals entering the second
bend and emptied out in the drive. FULL MOON RISING, caught four wide racing through the first turn while dropping off the second flight, never gained
striking distance. SAISON, urged along pursuing the pacesetter leading the second flight on a narrow margin to the backstretch, gave way into the far turn.
FIFTH OF NOVEMBER angled to the inside while settling in the last flight early but failed to menace.

HOPEFUL GROWTH was rated near the inside stalking just off the first flight under light reserve racing to the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing the
midway point of the turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest command and kick clear under firm
left handed pressure. JUDY'S WAY broke through the gate before the start, gained a forward placing attending the pace outside foes, pressed the issue
three deep racing into the turn to gain a brief advantage nearing midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. GOGO SHOES, in touch
with the first flight between foes attending the pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue inside a rival racing into the turn, dueled inside foes to upper
stretch and gave way late. CHICK'S SHADOW tracked just off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages, lodged a brief bid racing just outside the
eventual winner racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. BRIDGE DANCER, reserved off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn,
failed to gain striking distance. LOVIELEE urged to dispute the pace inside foes in the opening quarter, emptied out abruptly nearing the turn, then was
vanned off the course following the race.

CLEAR AS DAY was prompted to a forward placing, angled to the rail nearing the first turn stalking the pacesetter inside foes to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance along the rail nearing upper stretch, came through inside the pacesetter when presented an opening to challenge for command and
edged forward to prevail in time under firm handling. FASHION'S STAR (IRE), pulling against restraint outside foes in second flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn, continued to dispute the issue three deep past midstretch but was outkicked.
PEACEFUL FEELING sped to the fore along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin inside foes to the far turn, shifted out racing into the stretch while
resisting the top pair to late stages but weakened nearing the wire. HANIEL, reserved last racing to the first turn, continued under reserve to the backstretch,
was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into the stretch and found her best stride late to close the gap. STORMY D worked her way to the
inside while being rated off the second flight to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn while coming under pressure to advance, then shifted out
to race four deep between foes to late stages while making a mild gain. FLIGHTY ALMIGHTY (GB), pulling early while gaining a position tracking just
outside the first flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid racing three deep between foes into the far turn but came up empty nearing
the lane. SWEETLY MAID, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, gave way between foes entering the far turn. ALYDARIUS was
settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. ITSHERLUCKYDAY tracked off the second flight between foes, was urged to
advance racing into the far turn but dropped out early.

CIRCLE AWAY raced off the second flight along the inside while under some prompting early, switched out entering the backstretch, continued under
pressure angling out five wide racing through the far turn, advanced in that path racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wear down
NICOLE MUNNINGS under firm left handed pressure to prevail in time. The latter angled inwards racing to the first turn while being urged to prompt the
pace outside a rival into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn to gain the advantage, maintained a narrow margin between foes racing past
midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. CPL. DIONICIO, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first turn, conceded some position to track just off
the first flight into the backstretch, shifted out three deep nearing the far turn while being urged to advance in tight quarters between rivals, angled to the rail
nearing upper stretch to bid inside the leader but was outkicked. OSVALDO tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted four wide
racing into the far turn advancing on the leaders but flattened out in upper stretch. AMERICA'S SIMMARD settled last along the inside, saved ground
through the far turn gaining position, then shifted outside foes to race four wide in the closing stages while making belated progress. FLEDERMAUS broke
readily to gain terms with the first flight racing to the first turn, was held up just off the first flight while shifting out racing into backstretch, was prompted to
advance three deep nearing the far turn, exchanged some light contact entering the second bend and gave way between foes into the lane. UPPER
CROWN, urged to dispute the pace along the inside racing to the first turn, shifted off the rail entering the backstretch pressing the issue inside a rival to the
second bend and gave way into the lane. BIG RIG was settled between foes in the last flight early and never gained contention. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN)
angled to the inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, gained some position inside foes after a half, was steadied slightly avoiding tight
quarters along the rail entering the second bend and quickly came up empty. SUNSHINES OUT, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the
backstretch dropping off the second flight, never gained contention. WHAT A HOOT was settled outside foes in the last flight early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
HIGH HEATER tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three, then four wide through the far
turn to upper stretch to challenge for command and prevailed in time under strong handling. DYNAFORM angled to the inside while being rated just out of
striking distance as part of the second flight in the opening half, advanced along the rail racing into the far turn, came through inside the pacesetter when
presented an opening in upper stretch to challenge for command and was just outkicked. VIOLATOR, off a step slowly, then forced in at the start, was
settled into stride, shifted out gathering momentum racing into the far turn, split foes while angling out five wide in upper stretch and was going well late to
close the gap. CALIFORNIA SUN broke inwards into the path of VIOLATER, was righted, then urged along the rail setting the pace on a clear margin into
the backstretch, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way between rivals late. RIVER HAWK, pulling against rating along the inside stalking the
pacesetter into the backstretch, was steadied in tight quarters leaving the half mile marker, was prompted in pursuit of the leaders just off the inside racing
into the stretch, ducked inwards crossing the path of MASTERIO nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed final response. MASTERIO was rated
off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, was prompted to advance along the rail entering the lane
but was shut off then steadied near midstretch and had no late response. BATS CHANCE tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, made brief
progress four wide racing through the far turn but proved empty in the drive. HIGH THRESHOLD broke slowly, was prompted to make an early move while
switching out four wide racing through the backstretch to briefly prompt the pace into the far turn but emptied out into upper stretch. MASPERO settled
outside foes in the last flight early, was fanned five wide nearing the lane and offered no rally.

Footnotes
TALAKO angled to the rail just after the break while under rating tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, switched out after half gathering
momentum, advanced on the leaders racing through the far turn while shifting out four wide, moved to wrest command in that path nearing midstretch and
went clear under firm left handed pressure. BIG DREAMING angled inwards racing to the first turn forcing the pace outside a rival, shifted to the rail entering
the backstretch once gaining a clear advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the second quarter, dueled for command inside foes into the
far turn, couldn't match the winner in the drive but edged a rival for the place honors. U S ARMY CORPS was rated off the second flight racing to the first
turn, split foes entering the backstretch steadily gaining position, advanced three deep on the far turn to bid for command between foes in that path in upper
stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. CURLIN'S THRILL settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide in upper
stretch and made an effort to gain some position in that path late. FOOD AND WINE, pulling against restraint while gaining a forward placing along the rail
prompting the pace into the first turn, switched outside the pacesetter entering the backstretch while continuing to prompt that rival to the second bend,
pressed the issue between foes on the far turn and came up empty racing into the stretch. FIT FOR A KING angled to the inside in early stages tracking off
the first flight, saved ground on the far turn but steadily faded racing into the lane. STORM TRACKER settled off the second flight along the inside and
retreated early. BELUSHI SAMURAI was a brief factor outside foes in second flight but was through after a half.
