Footnotes
STELLAR WAY stalked the pacesetter in the three path, a bit off the rail on the turn and two wide into the lane, bid inside the leader in the stretch, collared
foe nearing the sixteenth pole and took control, then edged clear under a drive. SOPRESCIOUS tracked off the inside, went three wide on the turn then
moved out a path entering the lane and produced a late rally to get up for second. BARB'S VALENTINE broke out and bumped rival, set the pace into and
around the turn, lugged out in upper stretch and weakened late. FAMILY TRIPS stalked off the rail, angled to the inside approaching the turn, chased a bit
off the rail to the lane and missed the show. KATHIA bumped by BARB'S VALENTINE at the start, saved ground around off the pace and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
MISS NAPPER TANDY attended the pace racing outside BELLIGERENT then between rivals entering the turn, challenged for command and around the
turn and took control. dueled with BELLIGERENT into and down the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. BELLIGERENT had good early foot from the
inside, in a bit tight entering the turn but kept close from along the rail, dueled with MISS NAPPER TANDY while drifting in through the lane went gamely to
the wire. LOUDER CALIFORNIA lacked early speed, traveled a bit off the rail around the turn, rallied up the inside but lacked room and checked in deep
stretch. MY PROJECT GIRL tossed head at the start but still came away fairly quickly, chased outside the pacesetter then five wide into the stretch, drifted
in late and finished evenly. RON'S ANSWER set the pace well off the inside, angled inward and went three deep into the turn, drifted out a bit around the
bend and gave way in the final furlong. The Stewards reviewed the incident in deep stretch and ruled that although BELLIGERENT drifted in and put
LOUDER CALIFORNIA in tight quarters late, LOUDER CALIFORNIA was never going to finish better than third and would be no change in the order of
finish.
