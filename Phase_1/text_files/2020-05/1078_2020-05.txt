Footnotes
KING OF ANYTHING was last away, saved ground to move up going to the far turn, angled outside WILLISTON DUDE turning for home and wore that one
down in the drive. WILLISTON DUDE forced the pace along the inside to bid and edge clear into the lane then could not withstand the winner's late run.
PICADILLY ROADSTER followed the pace three or four wide, fanned six wide into the lane and moved up but could only best the others. TRASK made the
early pace about the three path while pressed by the winner and weakened nearing the lane. HOT BLOODED SONG tracked the leaders four wide to make
a mild bid into the far turn and weakened. BUMPY GAME was just off the early pace three wide and tired.

SCIOTO'S SHOES dueled on the pace inside rivals early, briefly edged clear nearing the lane then continued on well but was caught on the wire as BRAVE
ONE rallied back to gain the dead heat. BRAVE ONE dueled three or four wide outside rivals and rallied back through the lane to finish on even terms with
SCIOTO'S SHOES at the wire. GO WEST INDY dueled between the top pair, settled back and angled four wide into the lane and rallied back late to close
the gap. WITTS SHORT STOP was just in behind the leaders, angled four wide into the lane but could not close the gap. JOJOGOTTAGO was bumped
early entering the main track when put in tight along the rail and went evenly the remainder. FLASH BROWN failed to mount a rally three wide. PRINCE
OLAF was three wide and lacked a closing run. MATT AND CHEESE was not a threat four wide. GO CHIVA GO was not a factor. SUNSHINE WHISKEY
was put in tight and bumped with a rival going on to the main track and dropped back.

Footnotes
BANKER NITA stalked the pace three wide to move up going to the far turn, waited behind the leaders through most of that bend, came through inside rivals
turning for home and surged clear under only moderate urging. WITT NINE lunged at the break and dropped back off the early pace, rallied three and four
wide through the far turn and continued to gain clear for the place. OBVI moved to a clear lead just off the inside early, continued to upper stretch and came
up empty. GABY VEE stalked the pace in good position three wide but lacked a closing run. NOLA'S SUGARPLUM tracked the pace three or four wide to
the far turn and weakened into the lane. B L BREEZY saved ground and tired. GLORY OF THE GAME was slow to begin after an awkward break and failed
to threaten. ENGLISH TOFFEE was not a factor. ATSA WOESY was four and five wide through the first turn and tired.

ASTONISHING TWEET showed the most early speed to gain a clear lead before the first turn, widened the remainder and continued to draw off under
steady hand urging in the lane. SHEPHERD'S PRIDE stalked the pace three wide, angled four wide in the far turn and rallied to gain clear for the place.
MAYHAWK saved ground to move up and get nearest the winner into the lane but could not sustain a rally. GREEN CARD settled off the pace three wide,
angled four wide into the lane and moved up. HOLIDAY JOKE saved ground, moved up in the far turn but could not threaten late. MADDY'S PRO was four
and five wide through the first turn, moved six wide into the lane and had no rally. PEACOCK COWBOY chased the pace four wide and weakened.
EMPIRICAL DATA chased the winner from three wide to the far turn and tired.
