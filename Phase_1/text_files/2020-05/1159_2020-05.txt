Footnotes
SILARDI bobbled a bit at the start, angled in and dueled outside a rival, took a short lead under urging in midstretch and inched clear late. MUCH MORE
HALO saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch and got up for the place three deep on the line. SOLO ANIMO broke slowly, moved up
outside a rival on the backstretch, continued inside on the turn, came out some in midstretch and split rivals late for the show. TOO LATE had good early
speed and dueled inside, fought back in the drive, could not match the winner late and was edged for a minor award in the final stages. INCH angled in and
saved ground chasing the pace, continued inside in the stretch and was in tight off heels nearing the wire. VERTICAL THREAT broke slowly, chased inside,
came out on the turn and five wide into the stretch and could not quite summon the necessary late kick. BIG CHEDDAR stalked between horses then a bit
off the rail on the turn, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. JOEYS ACE chased off the rail then outside a rival midway on the turn,
continued just off the inside into the stretch and had a mild late bid. HIGHLY DISTORTED pulled early, stalked outside then four wide to the stretch, drifted
in some and could not offer the necessary response. BRAVO stalked three deep between horses, angled in between foes then outside a rival on the turn
and also lacked a rally. RESTORING DREAMS stalked outside then three deep into and on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.
TRIPOLI dropped back outside a rival then angled in on the backstretch, came out into the stretch, drifted in then out in the drive and was not a threat.

MURALIST three deep into the first turn, stalked outside a rival then three wide on the second turn and into the stretch, bid outside the runner-up under
urging in the drive, gained the advantage nearing the sixteenth pole and proved best. STILL IN THE GAME sped to the early lead, set the pace inside, came
a bit off the rail on the second turn, fought back while drifting inward in the drive and held second. BELIEVE NOW four wide into the first turn, chased off the
rail then outside on the second turn, came three deep into the stretch and edged rivals for the show. DIVINE ARMOR saved ground stalking the pace
throughout and was edged for third. NEXT REVOLT angled in and stalked just off the inside, continued between foes on the second turn and in the stretch
and was edged for a minor share. FUTURE VISION four wide into the first turn, chased off the rail, dropped back and angled in some on the second turn

four wide into the stretch and gained the show.. SCARLET HEAT stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail, continued inside on the second turn and in the
stretch and was outfinished for third. PERFECT ICE STORM three deep into the first turn, chased outside then off the rail, angled in some on the second

Footnotes
WILDMAN JACK had speed between horses then dueled three deep, stalked between foes on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, rallied under a
vigorous hand ride and drifted in some a sixteenth out to get up in the final stride. SPARKY VILLE went up inside to duel for the lead, inched away into the
stretch, drifted out a sixteenth from home and held on well but was edged on the line. STUBBINS between horses early, stalked inside, came out slightly
into the stretch then angled back in, bid along the fence in deep stretch, steadied a sixteenth out and edged rivals for the show. TEXAS WEDGE had speed
five wide then stalked outside, continued three deep on the turn and four wide into the stretch and was edged for third. CISTRON broke in, bobbled some
and bumped a rival at the break, dueled between horses then outside the runner-up, continued between foes through the drive, drifted in some and steadied
a sixteenth out and was outfinished for a minor share. MURAD KHAN (FR) saved ground chasing the pace, came out a bit past midstretch and could not
quite summon the needed late kick. BLAMEITONTHELAW bumped at the start, angled in and chased inside, came out a bit into the stretch and lacked the
needed rally.The stewards conducted an inquiry into the trouble in deep stretch but made no change when they ruled both STUBBINS and CISTRON were
already in tight when the incident occurred.

Footnotes
DIAMOND OF VALUE prompted the pace four wide between horses then stalked three deep on the turn and into the stretch, re-bid outside the pacesetter
under urging past the eighth pole to gain the advantage nearing the sixteenth marker and won clear under a hold late. MIDNIGHT GARDEN stalked inside
then a bit off the rail, came out into the stretch and outfinished the pacesetter late for second. WAY TOO SWEET sped to the early lead, dueled inside,
inched away on the turn, kicked clear, fought back past midstretch and was outkicked late for the place. SYBIL'S KITTY stalked early then bid between
horses to duel for the lead, tracked the leader inside on the turn and in the stretch and lacked the needed response. REAL GOOD DEAL went up between
horses to duel for the lead, stalked between foes on the turn and weakened in the drive. AT THE MARGIN turned her head and hopped in a slow start,
settled just off the rail, angled to the inside on the turn and lacked a rally. DROP THE MIC pressed the pace five wide then stalked three deep on the turn
and into the stretch and weakened.

BIDDY DUKE had good early speed a bit off the rail then angled in and dueled inside, inched away under urging in midstretch and proved best under steady
handling late. LOVELY LILIA stalked early then bid alongside the winner to duel for the lead, could not quite match that one in the final furlong but was
clearly second dbest. SUGAR PICKEL chased inside then a bit off the rail on the turn, came out into the stretch and edged a rival late for the show.
RSTARS AND STRIPES saved ground stalking the pace, continued inside on the turn and in the stretch and was edged late for third. BLUEGRASS SKY
settled outside a rival then off the rail on the turn, came out into the stretch and lacked a rally. GALWALKSINTOABAR five wide early, stalked four wide,
entered the stretch three deep and weakened. TOO MUCH HEAVEN was in a good position stalking the pace between horses on the backstretch and turn,
drifted in late and also weakened. VEGAN close up stalking the pace between horses on the backstretch and turn, was in tight between foes past the
quarter pole, angled to the inside into the stretch and had little left for the drive.
