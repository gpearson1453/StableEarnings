Footnotes
ETANA was away slowly after being bumped by NENITA, trailed far back for the first half-mile, began picking it up around the turn shifting out five wide,
rallied steadily outside to reach the front a sixteenth out, and was geared down late. UPSY DAISY DO stalked inside to the turn, moved out three wide
following behind CRYSTALINA approaching the stretch, collared that one from outside to get a brief lead past the eighth-pole, but was no match for the top
one. CRYSTALINA got bumped by SIGNING BONUS and pushed into MALIBU TOO after the start, tracked the pace three wide, took over past the
three-eighths and moved clear, but weakened through the last furlong on the wrong lead. AMBER PRINCESS was slow to get going, saved ground outrun
for six furlongs, moved to the three-path and offered a mild response. ANGLICO bumped with UNCUT at the start, dropped far back after six furlongs, and
improved late on the far outside. SIGNING BONUS bumped CRYSTALINA at the start, raced four to five wide and failed to menace. AUNT IRENE bumped
with MALIBU TOO at the start, settled in the middle of the pack early, and posed no threat. NENITA became edgy in the gate, broke in bumping ETANA,
went up to set the pace inside, and folded up on the turn. UNCUT bumped with ANGLICO at the start, pressed the pace two wide, and gave way after six
furlongs. LOOKN FINE AS WINE was always outrun. MARIANNA QUEEN broke open the stall door prior to the start, raced three wide and was finished
after a half-mile. MALIBU TOO bumped with AUNT IRENE at the start, then got bumped by CRYSTALINA, saved ground and retired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
CANDY CRUSHEM broke out bumping with MILLIONAIRE RUNNER at the start, gained steadily around the turn three then four wide, took over outside
DESERT GENERAL in upper stretch, drove clear and was wrapped up the last 70 yards. DESERT GENERAL reeled in the leader approaching the
five-sixteenths, was no match for the winner after straightening away for the drive, and ran on much best of the others. ANIMAL TRICK bumped hard with
HE'S SMOKIN HOT and was pushed into SUMMER MISCHIEF at the start, sped off early inside, relinquished command soon after going five furlongs, and
remained clear for the show. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER got sandwiched at the start between CANDY CRUSHEM and SUMMER MISCHIEF and was shut off,
raced three wide well back to the stretch, and was up for the last major share. HE'S SMOKIN HOT bumped hard with ANIMAL TRICK and pushed that rival
inward at the break, and tired inside leaving the turn. SUMMER MISCHIEF got bumped between MILLIONAIRE RUNNER and ANIMAL TRICK at the start,
and was outrun throughout. SHIDOSHI was always far back. TAKEDOWN was finished early inside. SI ES GOYA raced four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
ARANSAS was reserved for six furlongs, advanced toward the inside late on the far turn, got steered to the far outside after straightening away, and kicked
in to overhaul the leaders in the final 50 yards. JOE BENJAMIN bumped with THE MORMON MAULER at the start, led early inside before yielding to that
same rival, rebid from outside after six furlongs, led through most of the stretch but could not deny the winner. SIR CHUBBY enjoyed good position isolated
off the leaders up the backstretch, ranged up three wide to challenge outside JOE BENJAMIN turning for home, could not get by and weakened late.
GUACO raced in the second flight two wide to the stretch, moved to the rail past the eighth-pole and finished evenly. FANTASTRY (BRZ) had aim in the
four-path turning for home, but flattened out in the last furlong. BUDGET BUSTER lagged far back to the far turn, and was driven along inside with no
response. THE MORMON MAULER bumped with JOE BENJAMIN at the start, was keyed up taking over from that rival well out in the course nearing the
backstretch, went along clear to the far turn, and succumbed readily when challenged. ISLE OF MAN lunged and brushed the left side of the gate to get
away awkwardly, and showed little.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE SAINT pressed the pace between horses, took over outside PAPA LUKE with five-sixteenths remaining, pulled clear into the stretch and
held sway under a drive. GETTHE MUNY BERNIE chased three wide, loomed outside through the lane, could not reach the winner but ran on with good
courage. ODDS IT'S REAL dropped back after an alert beginning, raced four to five wide around the turn, rallied in upper stretch and finished up evenly on
the far outside. THRILL RIDE bumped lightly with BATTLE RAGS at the start, shifted off the inside to the three-path advancing into the stretch, moved to the
rail and flattened out. FLYING FINISH hesitated at the start spotting the field three lengths or so, trailed to the top of stretch, went well out in the track and
was going well under the wire. BATTLE RAGS bumped lightly with THRILL RIDE at the start, improved mildly four wide on the turn, and faded late.
HARPER raced in the two-path around the turn, and tired. PAPA LUKE set a pressured early pace inside, and retreated once displaced for command
five-sixteenths out.

Footnotes
CONGRATS THAT sped to the front at once, set a pressured pace to the stretch, got headed by FELON a furlong out, but battled back to prevail on the rail
in a blanket finish. REAGAN'S HEART was well back inside early, advanced mildly on the rail through upper stretch, shifted to the two-path and narrowly
missed with a late surge between horses. FELON pressed the pace outside CONGRATS THAT from the outset, poked a head in front in mid stretch, but
weakened late and just saved the show. PUT IT ON DETTI was last away after steadying slightly off GATOR FIFTY TWO, saved ground to the stretch, slid
out with a furlong remaining and was gaining outside the top trio. HUDSON OVERPASS pressed the pace four then three wide to the stretch, held his
position keeping VENERATE from moving out, and ran on stubbornly while brushing with that rival repeatedly. VENERATE stayed in range early inside,
entered the stretch in the two-path, was prevented from moving out any further by HUDSON OVERPASS in upper stretch, and kept on willingly while
brushing with that one the rest of the way. WILD ONE FOREVER steadied behind horses in the three-path approaching the top of the stretch, and could not
seriously menace. GATOR FIFTY TWO chased three wide early, and gave way on the turn. SHANGHAI LEVI was outrun to the lane, and could not gain on
the far outside. PRICEY VICTORY came six wide off the turn, and could not gain. POPPY'S DESTINY raced forwardly five then four wide for three-eighths
of a mile, and tired.

Footnotes
TOURNESOL saved ground reserved to the far turn, angled to the four-path for clearance leaving the quarter-pole, rallied steadily while shifting in, and
prevailed outside TOFFEN after a late duel. TOFFEN tracked the pace inside for six furlongs, was held up in traffic behind horses from the quarter-pole to
upper stretch, got through on the rail and overtook LA CARA BONITA to get the lead with a sixteenth to go, but was bested to the finish. LA CARA BONITA
crossed over to the rail clearing for the lead after the start, lost the advantage briefly to LIFE ON THE EDGE after six furlongs, battled back to regain the
lead turning for home, then was overhauled from both sides with a sixteenth remaining. DAYS OF SPRING took an awkward first step, then bumped with
LIFE ON THE EDGE and bobbled after the start, became unsettled into and around the first turn having to be taken outside, came five wide into the lane
and did enough to land the last major share. JOYOUS TIMES tracked the pace three wide for six furlongs, and weakened approaching the stretch. JUST A
BIT SASSY raced three wide early, steadied behind TOURNESOL as that one angled out approaching the top of the stretch, and did not recover. LIFE ON
THE EDGE bumped with DAYS OF SPRING at the start, prompted the pace to the far turn, reached a short lead outside LA CARA BONITA after six
furlongs, but could not sustain the bid and gave way in mid stretch. GO GATOR GIRL GO trailed inside to the stretch, moved out and had no rally.

Footnotes
DANCE D'ORO brushed the left side of the gate at the start, closed in on ESTILO TALENTOSO under a drive before completing six furlongs, wrested
command outside that rival in upper stretch and drew away under pressure. GUAZZA advanced outside around the turn, rallied mildly on the wrong lead
and was along to overtake ESTILO TALENTOSO for second. ESTILO TALENTOSO sprinted clear early, showed the way inside to the stretch through a
solid pace, yielded to the winner, then shied out as the rider switched left-handed a sixteenth out. LASTING UNION saved ground to the turn, gradually
moved out to the far outside, and improved mildly while not a factor. TOKEN chased after the pacesetter to the turn, could not gain under a drive past the
three-eighths in the two-path, and faded steadily. SPORT'N FORTY saved ground to no avail. AWESOMENEWYEAR cut the corner into the stretch, and
could not gain. SO ELUSIVE was finished early, and eased up through the stretch.

Footnotes
CASSIDY'S SMILE was bumped lightly between FOR KICKS and HENNY'S TREASURE at the start, settled in the second flight for six furlongs, rallied three
or four wide into the stretch, wore down KARENINA from outside and prevailed after a long drive. KARENINA vied inside STAMINA PRINCESS under a
hold through even early fractions, gained the upper hand from that rival on the far turn, was clear into the stretch on the rail, and could not hold off the
winner while drifting out in the late stages. BABYBEL saved ground on the turns in striking range, and finished one-paced while clear of the others.
HENNY'S TREASURE bumped lightly with CASSIDY'S SMILE at the start, came five wide off the far turn, and improved mildly outside. GOLDEN TAP
tracked the pace three wide, lodged a mild bid near the quarter-pole, but gave way in the stretch. MI KARLITA brushed the left side of the gate at the start,
saved ground early near the back, came five wide into the lane and was no menace. FOR KICKS bumped lightly with the eventual winner at the start, went
along in range between horses early, and tired after six furlongs. MAGIC RIVER raced three to four wide on the turns, and posed no threat. MOON EYES
was outrun throughout. STAMINA PRINCESS set a measured early pace outside KARENINA, and stopped after six furlongs.

Footnotes
BOERNE sprinted to the front at the start, widened the advantage gradually around the turn, moved off the inside nearing the stretch and stayed well in
command under heavy pressure. VAST broke slowly, steadied inside behind SPANISH POINT passing the five-eighths pole, moved out five wide under a
drive after a half-mile, and was up on the far outside to get second. SWEET MIA chased inside for a half-mile, moved out for the drive a clear second
through most of the stretch, but yielded that position late. SPANISH POINT advanced mildly four then three wide on the turn, and flattened out in the lane.
NAKED AVENGER chased two wide early, and tired through the stretch on the rail. VELVET CRUSH chased three wide for almost a half-mile, and tired.

Footnotes
OUTSHINE bumped with CENTERFOLDPROSPECT at the start, pressed the pace outside that rival to the far turn, reached a short lead between horses
after six furlongs, and held off MACHIAVELLI through a long drive. MACHIAVELLI saved ground early, rallied five wide leaving the far turn, finished gamely
but could not get past the top one. GINS AND TINS tucked in behind the early leaders on the first turn, was hemmed in behind horses inside passing the
quarter-pole, continued in traffic through upper stretch, and did not have enough when clear. SOUPER COURAGE rocked back as the gates opened and
was slowest away, was outrun to the stretch, and rallied mildly outside for a share. STOCK TRADE stayed close for six furlongs, came four wide into the
lane and was outkicked from both flanks. DEVOTED KITTEN had a ground-saving run through the turns, and had no final rally between horses in the
two-path. RULE YOURSELF tugged his way forward outside rivals entering the backstretch, bid three wide at the top of the lane, but began to weaken
through the furlong grounds. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT set the pace inside to the far turn, and fought on to mid stretch before weakening. BOLD
PAYNTER was three to four wide on the turns, and dropped back to trail after six furlongs.

CORY GAL broke alertly and pressed the pace outside R PREROGATIVE, wrested command after a half-mile, shifted to the rail and drove clear on the
wrong lead. MIDTOWN ROSE saved ground not far back, came off the rail to the two-path approaching the stretch, and finished gamely inside rivals for the
place. FLASHING DIAMOND advanced three wide to loom a threat outside CORY GAL at the top of the lane, could not reach that one and was outfinished
for second. CRUMB BUN raced four wide improving position around the turn, and gained mildly without becoming a late threat. TALE OF SUCCESS was
not a factor three wide. MOONSTONE lacked early speed, and passed tired horses on the far outside. FUJAIRAH raced two wide and was finished early.
SHORT SUMMER DRESS dropped back inside before reaching the stretch. R PREROGATIVE set a pressured pace inside for a half, and faltered through
the stretch.

Footnotes
DONJI prompted the pace outside ROBINTAKINCHARGE from the start, got shaken off in upper stretch, stayed on task determinedly and got up in the
closing yards. ROBINTAKINCHARGE cleared to the lead soon after the start, rated along through an easy pace inside, moved away through the furlong
grounds still going well, but yielded in the final stages. BOURBON IN MAY advanced four wide after six furlongs, rallied willingly but did not have enough
outside the top two. KEEP QUIET (FR) stayed in range three wide to the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. TIL THE END went along in the two-path to the far
turn, moved further out to the lane and could not threaten. AMERICAN NINJA was no factor inside. TOTONO was reserved early inside, stayed on the rail
and had no response when roused. KING ORB trailed for six furlongs, and made no headway on the far outside. SOLAR WARMING raced two wide and
was through after six furlongs.
