Footnotes
ELUSIVE RULER bumped with CONSTITUTIONAL PAL at the start, stayed in range early near the two-path, took over outside LASCARI turning for home,
and withstood a long drive to prevail. TURN OF EVENTS had a ground-saving trip fairly close to the pace, and finished gamely on the rail. WIN D'ORO
broke out and had to be pulled off EAST LEX at the start, checked sharply between horses entering the backstretch, came five wide off the far turn and
finished gamely outside. EAST LEX was outrun early, loomed menacingly four wide approaching the stretch, but flattened out late. HERO D'ORO was in the
second flight early, lost some position after six furlongs, and was going well belatedly on the far outside. CONSTITUTIONAL PAL was bumped between
horses at the start, checked and/or steadied along from midway on the first turn into the backstretch, and had no final rally. MIGHTY TOUGH got clipped
behind by COACH TEMPLE early up the backstretch, and was outrun. LASCARI (GB) set the pace inside to the far turn, and gave way after being
overhauled by the eventual winner. MAINE broke out at the start, pressed the pace outside, and checked in the process of giving way approaching the
stretch. COACH TEMPLE bumped with CONSTITUTIONAL PAT at the start, clipped heels behind MIGHTY TOUGH and stumbled with the rider losing the
right iron soon after entering the backstretch, and jogged in well behind the field. IRKED got carried out at the start, pulled up in distress outside the
quarter-pole, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
NACHO PAPA sped clear early, dueled inside LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA around the turn and into the stretch, and gamely prevailed after a long, hard drive.
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA stumbled while breaking alertly, went up to challenge outside NACHO PAPA into the turn, poked a head in front at the top of the
stretch, battled fiercely and was nipped on the wire. LONDON WEREWOLF raced in the two-path within range early, had aim outside the leaders into the
stretch, but could not gain appreciably while attempting to lug in. BABA TOBI was outrun inside for a half-mile, moved off the rail for the drive and passed
tired horses for the last major share. GRAN CAUSEWAY broke a step slow, moved up through the run up the backstretch, stayed close between horses
around the turn, and gave way. SIGHTED came away with the leaders but was reserved just off the pace inside, stayed on the rail and came up empty
when roused. FIVES WILD was driven four wide on the turn with no response. AMERICAN ROCK SALT faded four wide before completing a half-mile.
KING'S CASTLE was two wide into the turn and failed to respond to urging.

SUPERFECTO sprinted to a clear lead while headstrong through the first quarter-mile, settled down through the middle stages lengthening the advantage,
and was kept driving to remain well in command. HARD LIGHTING was three wide on the first turn, got closest to the pacesetter on the far turn, whittled
away some of the margin in the stretch but was not a serious threat while best of the rest. AJHAR hit the left side of the gate at the start, moved up three
wide on the far turn, and finished evenly outside. CORNBREAD KINGDOM entered the first turn four wide, stayed well out in the course drifting wide
approaching the stretch, and made no headway. RAG TAG bobbled at the start, got outsprinted for position heading to the first turn, and was finished before
reaching the stretch. OR'EFFICE prompted the pace outside SUPERFECTO, and gave way midway on the far turn. NEWSWORTHY veered out sharply at
the start spotting the field several lengths, lost contact with the field on the far turn, was eased up by the top of the lane and eventually jogged under the
wire.

PRIVATE MESSAGE advanced with a three-wide run after a half-mile, took over outside OUR LITTLE DEVIL in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
TEENAGE KICKS was outsprinted early, came four wide rallying off the turn, and went clear of the rest past the eighth-pole while greenly swapping leads a
few times. INVALUABLE was shut off after the start between LITTLE MISS MACHO and KAY'S DREAM, moved out finding her best stride at the top of the
stretch and finished with some interest to go clear of the others. LITTLE MISS MACHO was bumped by KAY'S DREAM after the start, showed early speed
inside, and faded. CHEZ PAREE chased early between horses, and tired. OUR LITTLE DEVIL sprinted clear early and moved inside, got collared by the
winner turning for home, and faltered through the last eighth of a mile. SHE SO NAUGHTY hit the left side of the gate at the start, and was outrun.
ESPIRITU DE LUNA chased outside OUR LITTLE DEVIL early, and was finished after a half. KAY'S DREAM stumbled badly at the start and recovered
bumping into LITTLE MISS MACHO, and never reached contention.

Footnotes
JAMAICAN broke to the lead, showed the way inside lengthening the margin around the turn, settled into the stretch well in command, was clear to a
sixteenth out and had just enough to last. VALDOCCO was a step slow to begin and outrun early, swung five wide off the turn and closed steadily outside to
just miss. DR HARLAN lost some ground to the front flight saving ground into the turn, moved to the two-path near the quarter-pole, gained while moving
back to the rail in upper stretch, came back out to the two-path and brushed with SILENT TIGER finishing willingly between horses. SILENT TIGER chased
outside the pacesetter to the stretch, and ran on with good courage outside SILENT TIGER and brushing with that one late. PHISH FAN raced forwardly
three wide to the stretch, and lacked a solid response. PACHANGA PARTY turned in an even effort four wide much of the way. BLACK PEPPER was
outrun five wide. FINNEGAN (IRE) was outrun inside. CHARGE CARD was four wide into the turn before moving inward, and failed to menace. ZALZA
faded steadily approaching the stretch, and was eased up to the finish.

LORILOUPIES was roused to get a move on approaching the turn, responded readily to run past the leaders three wide near the five-sixteenths, and
widened through the stretch under pressure. SWEETHEART DEAL took over inside ONE HOT DRAMA before going a quarter-mile, was no match for
LORILOUPIES after a half-mile, and ran on best of the others. GLORY DIA saved ground to the stretch, and lacked the needed bid. SMITTEN FOR
SMITTY was devoid of speed out in the track for a half, and passed tired horses on the far outside late. FREEZER BURN raced forwardly three wide and
tired before going a half. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE was outrun toward the inside. FAST FIONNUALA was done early three wide. ONE HOT DRAMA
grabbed the lead with an alert break, relinquished command to SWEETHEART DEAL up the backstretch, and gave way between horses before going a
half.

Footnotes
POSITIVE PHIL went along covered up to the far turn in the two-path, tipped out for clearance in upper stretch, and responded well to wear down
CONQUISTADOR from outside. CONQUISTADOR grabbed the early lead, rated along inside through an even clip, repelled a bid from SMELL OF ROSES
turning for home in the two-path, and could not contain the winner while drifting out late. LOOKIN AT ROSES bumped with OLE MOLE at the start, raced
well back for a half-mile, advanced in the two-path coming off the far turn, and finished gamely inside the top pair. SMELL OF ROSES prompted the pace
outside CONQUISTADOR from the outset, challenged in earnest a quarter-mile out, was rebuffed through upper stretch, and steadied late behind
CONQUISTADOR as that one came over. POPPY'S BOYS fought rating inside early, stayed on the rail for the drive and gained mildly. MY G P S stayed
close to the early leaders while reserved inside, and was empty when roused. NOTSOSUBTLE raced four wide, and faded after a half-mile. BEBEAU
stayed in range three wide early, and tired before reaching the stretch. JANUARY WON was always outrun. VITA DOLCE was three wide early, moved
further out to the far turn, and could not reach contention. OLE MOLE bumped with LOOKIN AT ROSES at the start, and was finished early.

Footnotes
OVERDELIVER crept closer to the leaders two wide into the turn, was guided out for full clearance after six furlongs, rallied to overhaul BEAU LUMINAIRE
from outside in deep stretch and pulled clear. BEAU LUMINARIE bumped with COOL BOBBY after the start, stalked the pace three wide, took over from
outside approaching the quarter-pole, stayed clear through the furlong grounds but could not hold off the top one. GUMP broke out bumping SANDINO
RULER, led out of the chute before deferring to JUST FOR ONE DAY, rebid poking a head in front past the midway point on the turn, was no match for
BEAU LUMINAIRE soon after, and weakened inside. KID BOURBON saved ground outrun for nearly six furlongs, moved out improving position into upper
stretch, and finished evenly. BE GONE DADDY was outrun in the two-path to the stretch, and passed only tired horses. COOL BOBBY bumped with
SANDINO RULER at the break, then bumped with COOL BOBBY a couple strides later, had aim four wide around the turn, but gave way after six furlongs.
ALLURSTRA broke out at the start but made no contact with rivals, raced four wide and was done before reaching the stretch. SANDINO RULER (ARG)
was bumped and shut off between horses at the start, raced widest early, and dropped back to trail on the turn. JUST FOR ONE DAY took over inside
GUMP after a quarter-mile, gave way to a wave of challengers past the three-eighths, and was eased up through the late stages.

Footnotes
MICHELINE was allowed to settle early inside, advanced around the far turn gradually moving out to be four wide by the top of the lane, shifted in moving to
the leaders near the furlong marker and kicked away decisively. HIGHLAND GLORY was off a beat slow, checked in tight on the rail around the first turn,
improved position continuing inside after six furlongs, weaved through traffic in the two-path through upper stretch, rallied into second late, and just held that
position. STUNNING SKY raced well off the early pace two wide, moved out wider around the far turn still out of it, found her best stride through mid stretch
and finished well outside to narrowly miss the place. ENVOUTANTE grabbed the early lead inside, rated along through a leisurely opening half-mile, picked
up the tempo under a drive before reaching the stretch, held on to the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly. MIMINA'S TEAM stayed close in or near the
two-path to the far turn, shifted three wide looming a threat into the lane, and was being outkicked when steadied between MICHELINE and ASTORIA
KITTEN a furlong out. ASTORIA KITTEN prompted the pace outside ENVOUTANTE for six furlongs, challenged at the top of the stretch, and drifted out
slightly beginning to weaken into the last eighth of a mile. DIAMONDS ARE A stayed in range early toward the inside, lost position steadily through the far
turn gradually moving out, and made no late headway out past the middle of the course. ONYX took an awkward initial step at the start, trailed inside for six
furlongs and passed tired horses. LA RUSIA brushed the right side of the gate at the start, and was finished early. SEDUCER was slow to begin, raced four
wide early, and tired. BAJAN GIRL was four wide early, came under a ride three wide into the far turn, and gave way after six furlongs. IVYETSU hesitated
at the break and was off several lengths behind the next-to-last horse, tugged her way forward widest of all around the first turn and into the backstretch,
and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
NETWORK EFFECT broke out bumping GARTER AND TIE, vied up the backstretch inside HE HATE ME and ROYAL SQUEEZE, deferred into the turn and
lost position approaching the quarter-pole, got through on the rail in upper stretch and responded well to overtake NOBLE DRAMA and pull clear. NOBLE
DRAMA settled off the pace, swept up four wide with a quick move to take over late on the turn, could not match strides with the winner entering the last
furlong and remained clear of the rest. LAST JUDGMENT was under a full drive after a half-mile and made little headway toward the inside, moved out four
wide to the stretch and ran on willingly rallying to be clear for the show. ROYAL SQUEEZE vied three wide outside NETWORK EFFECT and HE HATE ME
early, took over into the turn shifting in a path, felt pressure from both flanks at the top of the lane, and folded up. RED CRESCENT bumped with GARTER
AND TIE at the start, tracked the early pace three wide, and lacked the needed response turning for home. HE HATE ME battled up front between rivals
early, and gave way at the top of the stretch. GARTER AND TIE was bumped between NEWWORK EFFECT and RED CRESCENT and checked back at
the start, and moved out widest unable to keep up approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
GUFO was devoid of early speed inside, edged a bit closer still well back after six furlongs, came three wide into the stretch confidently handled, kicked in
strongly when set down a furlong out, and blew past PROVEN STRATEGIES in the last 50 yards to win going away. PROVEN STRATEGIES vied outside
JUSTINTHENICKOTIME up the backstretch, took over and moved inside fending off several challengers a quarter-mile from home, edged away from
ISLAND COMMISH on the fence going by the eighth-pole, but was powerless to contain the top one late. SUMMER TO REMEMBER was never far back
while near the two-path, moved out a bit wider for the drive and rallied mildly. ISLAND COMMISH prompted the pace three wide to the far turn, challenged
outside PROVEN STRATEGIES at the top of the lane, was rebuffed through the furlong grounds and weakened. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME vied inside
PROVEN STRATEGIES through the first half-mile, yielded around the far turn, and ran on with good courage to deep stretch. FAME TO FAMOUS was slow
from the gate, raced well back two wide to the stretch, moved out and was going well too late. SOUTH BEND bumped with EXPRESS PHAROAH while
widest near the back at the top of the stretch, and could not gain. EVER DANGEROUS was slow from the gate, raced four wide on the turns, and gave way
after lodging a brief bid nearing the stretch. EXPRESS PHAROAH saved ground early, was out four or five wide near the back coming off the far turn when
he bumped with SOUTH BEND and steadied behind EVER DANGEROUS, and tired. DON JUAN KITTEN bounced hard off the left side of the gate at the
start, went along in range under a firm hold early, challenged between horses three wide near the quarter-pole, and gave way through the closing stages.
DOC BOY steadied behind rivals well back at the top of the stretch, and tired.

Footnotes
PAINT THE CORNERS broke alertly, went up to set the pace through even early fractions, and dug in gamely on the rail to turn back several late
challengers. DRINKS ON ME pressed the pace from the start, challenged outside PAINT THE CORNERS into the stretch, and just missed between horses.
BEACH DREAMING raced in the second flight to the stretch, and was closing in on the far outside nearing the wire. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD sat off the
first flight to the far turn, bid three wide into the stretch, and was outkicked between rivals. HOTTY TODDY saved ground on the turns well back, and gained
mildly while not a threat. DANGEROUS WOMAN stayed close inside to the stretch, moved out and lacked a rally. DANCE TILL DAWN was keyed up into
the first turn pressing the pace between horses, and faded before completing six furlongs. LITTLE CODE saved ground outrun early, and made no headway
in the stretch on the far outside. MUCH ABOUT IT hit the right side of the gate at the start, trailed inside early, and could not gain four wide coming off the
final bend.
