in mid stretch but was outfinished for the win. ROWDYROOSTER had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then could not
threaten the top two. NORTH FORK also had no speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned three then four wide to the stretch but failed to offer a late
response. BLUES RAPPER tracked the pace to the second turn, shifted off the rail nearing the quarter pole but came up empty in the stretch run.

FABRIANA pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up to engage for the lead into the stretch, battled determinedly through a long drive, may have
been headed leaving the sixteenth marker but gamely got the nod late. COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) set the pace under pressure from the winner for five
furlongs, was collared and headed in mid stretch, fought back to again have a slim margin in deep stretch but was outnodded late. KATZUMOTO had no
speed, settled to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, was a factor to mid stretch then could not impact the top two. KITTEN'S ROYAL stalked the
leaders to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. AZTEC WARRIOR trailed to the stretch while
three wide and also lacked a closing response. SOONER BETTER chased the top two for five furlongs while saving ground then did not rally in the drive.

RESPECT MY CANDOR chased the pace early, bid three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch then held under steady urging. LASTING
LIGHT broke a bit slow, trailed to the turn, was three wide to mid turn, swung out five deep and was widest in the drive and closed steadily for second.
JUPITER S. had good speed, dueled two wide to the stretch then was collared in mid stretch and finished evenly. POINT HOPE (IRE) tracked the leaders to
the turn, saved ground to the stretch then was gaining a bit late. SING IN THE WIND was outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail. COZZE KID
had no speed, swung out four wide while inside the runnerup to the stretch but went evenly in the final furlong. PAPAYA attended the pace from the rail to
the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and weakened.

UNCHAINING MELODY (GB) was outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, battled CARRIE'S SUCCESS through the
final furlong and got the nod. CARRIE'S SUCCESS was also outsprinted early, came two wide to the stretch, rallied between rivals in the drive, got to terms
with the winner then dug in but was nipped late. DANCIN IN PARADISE pressed the pace two wide, pushed up to engage for the lead to mid stretch then
was outkicked to the line. SUGARSEEKER had no speed, was two wide into the turn, swung out four wide to the stretch and was making up ground
belatedly. THE PET hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was also outfinished. LEONILLA stalked the
pace from the rail to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response.

Footnotes
KONA COAST had the best speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, responded to edge clear to mid stretch and was under steady urging to the wire.
MERCY RULE was allowed to settle for a half mile, bid four then five wide while circling on the second turn then finished willingly in the drive. MAD LUTHER
stalked the winner to the half, bid three wide on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. TURNAROUND trailed to the second turn,
was three wide to the stretch then shifted out for room and closed with interest late. THE REF also had no speed, settled to the second turn, tried to rally
three then four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. FOR HIM got outsprinted to the backstretch, tracked the winner to the second turn, was
off the rail to the stretch and lacked a closing response. BABY FRANKIE was hustled early but outsprinted, stalked to the second turn then saved ground
but weakened through the drive.

Footnotes
LOUD LOUD MUSIC stalked the leaders three then four wide to the stretch, rallied to take over in mid stretch and held under steady urging. APPLES ARCH
chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. HEY WILMAAA pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to
mid stretch then finished evenly. DIAMETRIC tracked the leaders to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then was making up ground belatedly.
GOLD ARROW had no speed, raced three wide on the turn and was also closing some ground late. POULAPHOUCA broke out and tightened things up for
TIBBY GEE and ST. ANNIE'S INDY, hustled to the front, dueled from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken and tired. SWEET AND SOFTLY broke in
and caused some trouble inside of her, was outsprinted and chased the pace two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. TIBBY GEE was
pinched back soon after the start, had no speed and was always outrun. ST. ANNIE'S INDY also was pinched back between rivals shortly after the start,
raced three wide but was not a factor. GO MUSKEE showed little.
