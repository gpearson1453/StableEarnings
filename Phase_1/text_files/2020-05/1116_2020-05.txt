Footnotes
ARCH ABILITY stalked the leading duelers three wide, inched closer to bid as BAUDETTE BLIZZARD moved along side turning for home, then drew off
under driving pressure through the final furlong. BAUDETTE BLIZZARD broke sharply but took back to stalk four wide, came under a drive around the turn
to attempt a four wide bid, but got outkicked in upper stretch by ARCH ABILITY before staying on to just get up for place4. J'S WARRIOR dueled inside of
CAN IMAGE through the turn, but was headed by ARCH ABILITY at the furlong marker, kept on through the late stages, but was nipped for place. ONE IF
BY LAND got pinched back at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace, then offered a belated rail rally through the late stages despite the rider
dropping his whip at the sixteenth pole. CAN IMAGINE dueled two wide, vied turning for home as multiple foes made outside bids, then weakened between
horses passing the furlong pole. UGO saved ground from midpack, but failed to make a bid and ran evenly. FARS GLITTER took the turn in the two to three
path while outside of a rival, then lugged in in upper stretch and weakened. SKYBURST had a slow start, took the turn in the three path and was no factor.
DR. ALBERT saved ground while off of the pace, and failed to get involved. CREAL WONDER was off a step slow, trailed four wide around the turn, and
was no threat. THE MAIN FACTOR was outrun three wide. TAKECHARGECOMANCHE raced in midpack in the three path, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
DIAMONDCOAT prompted and pressed outside of the leader, took over handily from that foe turning for home, and drew off through the lane. DUTCH
TREAT saved ground from midpack, shifted off of the fence in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly between tiring horses to achieve place. STROLLIN THE
BAYOU shifted from the two to the four path down the backstretch, advanced position around the far turn outside of rivals to make a place bid in upper
stretch, but tired late and got outfinished for that position. LADY CLEOPATRA set a lightly pressured pace along the inside of DIAMONDCOAT, but was no
match for that foe turning for home and tired. YIELD was caught four wide into the first turn, took back, then dropped to the two pah into the far turn, but
failed to threaten after shifting out in midstretch. TEMPESTUOUS AMY trailed after a slow start, shifted to the three path into the far turn,k then to the five
path in upper stretch, but was no factor. RAHWAY stalked three wide, but tired around the far turn. MY WYNTER ROSE raced three wide around the first
turn, shifted to the four path while fading into the far turn, and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
LOUIE'S KINGDOM quickly established a loose lead, widened his advantage around the turn, then was driven to the wire. UNCLE GREGORY was
forwardly placed along the inside,shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, then split foes with a determined left lead grind, and switched leads approaching the
sixteenth pole to secure place. JIMMY AT LAST gained ground four wide around the turn to make a place bid turning for home, but got outfinished by an
inner rival in the late stages. KOLTEN'S COURT trailed along the inside, advanced through the turn in the two to three path before shifting the the five path
at the furlong pole, and stayed on with a mild rally for a minor reward. WALLET stalked the loose leader, cut the corner turning for home, but weakened
inside of rivals through the late stages. TOM'S LAST GENERAL was forwardly placed three wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. TRY TRY
AGAIN broke out, was caught in the five path around the turn, shifted to the seven path turning for home, but was no factor. BIG ISLAND was well off the
pace two wide, and never got involved. HE'S THE SOUPERWON stayed in the five path around the turn and didnt play a factor. BAQUERO FLIES was
caught six wide around the turn and never made an impact. SKIP CHASER took the turn in the two to three path, but stopped turning for home.
UNBRIDLED RULER raced two wide in midpack early on, but steadily faded into and around the turn.

Footnotes
MONOMOY GIRL stalked two wide between horses while a bit keen from the kick-back, tipped to the three path around the far turn to be outside of the
dueling leaders, inched forward under confident handling to bid for the lead turning for home, quickly asserted command and took over, then drew off
handily while being shown the rider's crop multiple times to keep to task. RED DANE (ITY) settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted four wide turning
for home and rallied past inner tiring rivals to prove second best. MISS BIGLY stumbled slightly at the start, was forwardly placed along the inside of the
leader, was put to tight quarters into the turn as that foe came in a bit, raced under a tight hold right off of the pace through the turn before shifting three
wide turning for home, stayed on, but was outfinished for place. ESTILO FEMENINO trailed along the inside, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and
passed tired rivals for a minor reward. TALK VEUVE TO ME dueled two wide, but proved no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch, and weakened
through the final furlong. FASHION FAUX PAS dueled inside of TALK VEUVE TO ME for the lead while in the two path, cut down to the rail into the turn, but
weakened in upper stretch. LADY KATE broke outwards, stalked three wide, got floated to the four path as her inner rival shifted out, then drifted to the five,
then six, path turning for home, and subsequently weakened.

Footnotes
OXIDE prompted the pace setter while being kept in the three path, took over from that foe turning for home, then drew off under driving pressure.
CONTRACTOR BILL set the pace inside of OXIDE while staying a bit off of the rail, but proved no match for that foe turning for home and held place
through the lane. FORTUITY settled off the pace in the two path around the first turn, shifted to the five path and rallied outside of horses through the far
turn, then stayed on mildly to secure show. AMANI'S EAGLE stalked three wide while in the four path and a bit keen around the first turn, came under a
drive to inch closer to the dueling leaders passing the five sixteenths pole, but lacked a response, and weakened in the late stages. BAKER'S MAN was
bumped between horses at the start, shifted from the two to the five path turning for home, and stayed on mildly. HANDY stalked three wide between
horses, but lost position before angling to the inside into the far turn, and finished evenly. ENCHANTED EMPIRE was jostled between horses at the start,
took the far turn in the three path while far off of the pace, and lacked a rally. FAN FAVORITE was forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but
weakened along the inside through the far turn. IMPLICATION was caught in the five to six path around the far turn and failed to menace. A. K. SAFARI was
caught five wide around the first turn, but weakend in the four path around the far turn. PIP'S BRASSY BOY was forwardly placed along the inside, but
weakened into the far turn and rapidly faded. INDIAN SPRINGS was slow into stride, and showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
STRONG YEN sped to establish a clear advantage in the two path, then drew off under driving pressure through the lane. HERE'S CARLOS saved ground
while far off of the pace through the turn, advanced inside of wide foes turning for home, then sustained a rail rally through the lane to reach place
approaching the wire. IRRITATOR hopped at the start, chased the pace from the three, then two path, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper
stretch, and got outfinished for place late. STARSHIP MERCURY was shuffled back along the inside into the turn, shifted to the four path turning for home,
then stayed on late for a minor reward. TOMMYTOM forced the pace from along the inside of the leader, but failed to keep pace with that foe turning for
home and subsequently weakened. FLOROPLUS bobbled a bit at the start then was very awkward to get going, advanced five wide outside of horses
through the turn, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch and lugged in while rallying mildly. WHERE Y'AT JOE JOE took the turn in the three to four path,
but failed to get involved. KNIGHTS KEY took the turn four, then three wide, but lacked a kick between horses in upper stretch, and weakened. HOW'S MY
BUD raced two wide between horses in midpack early on, tossed his head into the far turn while among tight quarters, tipped out to the four path
approaching the quarter pole, but hung on his left lead, and weakened. MARK MY WAY shifted from the four path to the seven path approaching the furlong
pole, but failed to make a bid. TEE TEE took the turn in the two path inside of rivals, but was never involved. TWINKLING KNIGHT took the turn in the four
path, shifted to the eight path turning for home, but was no menace.

Footnotes
REAGAN'S EDGE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, made a late bid and wore down the leader while just up
at the wire. CALL ON MISCHIEF stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, inched clear in the stretch but was caught in the late stages.
KARAK set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. ILCHESTER CHEETAH came in at the start, raced back early on,
was off the rail into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. RISING SEAS chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and weakened late in
the stretch. OWNER'S SUITE tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. FLY SO PRETTY was bumped at
the start and no factor. UNUNDERSTANDABLE was done early. MONEDAS DE ORO was through early. TULANIAN was through after a half.
