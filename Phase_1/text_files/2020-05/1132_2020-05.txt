Footnotes
YAYASGOTMOREGAME moved up inside the leaders to bid going to the far turn, dug in as challenged by CREEDS REVENGE turning for home and held
that one off to the wire. CREEDS REVENGE stalked the leaders four wide to bid with the winner in the far turn, continued outside that one and could not get
by in the lane. LEON'S DIAMOND steadied between rivals going up the backstretch and angled out, bid four wide through the far turn and continued on to
just miss the place. PETE AND REPETE settled off the pace racing three wide, moved up into the lane but could not reach the top ones. GOGETMBUGS
forced the pace outside MR. BIG SHOT to late backstretch and weakened into the lane. MR. BIG SHOT moved to the front racing about the two path and
tired through the far turn.

Footnotes
XAVIER DAVEY stalked the pace from along the inside while never far back, angled out nearing the lane to bid outside GIANT GAMBLE turning for home
and wore that one down to move clear late. GIANT GAMBLE made the pace on a short lead racing about the two or three path and could not contain the
winner's late run. BORN FORCE settled back off the pace racing three wide, rallied through the far turn to come five wide into the lane and closed but was
too late. DIESEL'S PRIZE followed the pace two and three wide and lacked a solid closing bid. I'M A ROCK prompted the pace outside GIANT GAMBLE to
the far turn and weakened. DORCHEAT ZARB failed to mount a bid three wide. FRANKALEE FUN saved ground and was always back.

CLYTEE settled back off the pace three or four wide, moved closer through the far turn to angle five wide into the lane and closed late run down GABY VEE
in the closing yards. GABY VEE contested the pace among four horses while four wide between rivals, gained the lead into the lane but could not hold the
winner safe. COIL AND STRIKE was inside rivals about the two or three path on the contested pace and lacked a final closing run in the drive. B L BREEZY
racing without a whip, was steadied in the opening sixteenth between rivals, settled inside to stalk the leaders in good position but lacked a final closing run.
SUPER MISS B HAVEN followed the pace three to four wide and failed to rally. PEYTONS SKY DANCER was not a threat racing three wide. WITTS
MAMBO JACK attended the pace five wide outside rivals to the far turn and weakened. HRISHI'SLILHOTROD saved ground and was not a factor. ATSA

SPOTITUDE settled off the early pace three wide, rallied to contention going up the backstretch to bid into the far turn, continued inside AMERIPOINT and
was up after a long drive. AMERIPOINT settled four wide, moved with the winner going to the far turn to bid outside that one and missed late. GOLDEN
BULLET saved ground and lacked a final closing run. ALL FOR TRUTH made the pace about the two or three path while pressed throughout and weakened
into the lane. OHTANI stalked the early leaders two or three wide and weakened. THE ROCK ROLLS was always back. CLIFF'S PLACE forced the pace
outside ALL FOR TRUTH to late backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
MACANDALES dueled on the pace three wide outside GONE PREACHIN while between rivals to the far turn, continued with that one and edged that on the
wire. GONE PREACHIN was on the pace inside rivals while out from the rail, continued to duel the winner into the lane and came up short late. KING OF
ANYTHING was part of the five horse pack contesting or forcing the early lead, continued on to close through the lane but came up short. SHEPHERD'S
PRIDE was between rivals three and four wide as part of the pace battle and could not produce the needed late run. BIG HEARTED FACTOR was widest of
all in the contested pace battle at five or six wide and could not produce the needed late run. AIR ASSAULT hesitated at the break and failed to threaten
three or four wide. STRONG IMAGE hesitated at the break, saved ground and failed to mount a bid.

Footnotes
RYRYSWEETIE settled back off the pace four wide, moved five wide in the far turn then closed strongly through the lane to run down the leaders and go
clear. IRISH CONTESSA stalked the pace four wide outside FRIENDLY AND KIND, continued on through the lane and held the place late. DIVA'S DIVA
settled three wide off the pace, rallied between foes in the lane and gained third late. FRIENDLY AND KIND moved to a clear lead racing in the two to three
path, carried a clear lead into the lane and came up empty. ATTITUDE AJUSTMENT stalked the leaders while saving ground to bid into the far turn but
lacked a final closing response. A KISS GOODNIGHT was along the inside, made a mild move in the lane but checked along the rail nearing the wire.
KELSEY prompted the early pace three wide and gave way badly through the far turn. WIREWIREWIRE stumbled at the break and unseated her rider then
went riderless around the course for a half mile before being caught by an outrider.

AWESOME EMMIT dueled on the pace from inside EXECUTIVE DECREE to the far turn, edged clear of that rival nearing the lane then held safe as
SCOOTER'S BOY rallied late. SCOOTER'S BOY was unhurried to drop well off the early pace three wide, reeled in the field through the far turn, angled out
in the lane and closed well but was too late. OURBESTFRIEND D L tracked the dueling leaders three and four wide, bid into the far turn then could not
sustain the move into the lane. ITSALLABOUTYOU saved ground and could not produce the needed late response in the drive to finish on even terms with
HOLDING FAST for fourth. HOLDING FAST was four wide stalking the pace, failed to offer a solid closing bid while finishing on even terms for fourth with
ITSALLABOUTYOU. EXECUTIVE DECREE dueled on the pace outside the winner to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane.

HOLIDAY JOKE saved ground off the early pace, rallied through the far turn and continued on in the lane to edge clear late behind the riderless horse. IMA
SOONERS FAN was in reach four or five wide early, dropped back some going up the backstretch then rallied through the far turn to bid four wide into the
lane and was just up for the place. PEACOCK COWBOY dueled on the pace outside VISCOSITY through the opening half, was forced in early in the far
turn as the riderless horse came in, brought a clear lead into the lane but could not last. FAMILY CODE stalked the pace four wide then steadied as a rival
shied inward from the riderless horse and could not close ground late. CHARED was fanned wide out of the first turn and lacked a rally. VISCOSITY dueled
on the pace inside PEACOCK COWBOY then checked along the rail as that rival was forced in by the riderless horse and dropped back. RISKY BOY
showed brief speed between horses and tired. RULETHENIGHT reared at the break and unseated his rider with a hard landing then went riderless around
the track to finish in the front of the field.
