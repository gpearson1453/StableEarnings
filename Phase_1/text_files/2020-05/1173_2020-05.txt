Footnotes
CONTRABAND showed the most early speed to make a short clear lead about the two path and held the margin under steady handling. BETA CAPO
SONG prompted the winner's pace three wide and could not produce the needed final late run. HEIR HORSE ONE tucked inside the top pair and could not
close the gap in the drive. DAVE saved ground and improved his position while not a threat late. RESILIENCE OF LOVE failed to mount a bid. DION was
five wide through the far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
COIL AND STRIKE stalked the frontrunning SUPER MISS B HAVEN three or four wide to reel that one in going to the far turn, went clear through the bend
and held a safe margin under urging. SUPER MISS B HAVEN moved off to a clear early lead about the two path, continued to the far turn then could only
chase the winner home while clearly best of the others. STREAKNSILVERSTONE got nearest the top pair going to the far turn but could not threaten while
three wide. DEEPLY was crowded between rivals at the start and shuffled back, saved ground to the far turn, angled four wide and could not threaten. GET
THE GLUE was along the inside and took up going to the far turn as a stricken rival fell then gave way in the far turn. WILDFIRE SIS chased the early
leaders four wide and tired. STELLAR BESS fell going to the far trun due to injury and was vanned off.

AMERIPOINT settled back off the pace early, moved four and five wide through the far turn into the lane and continued the bid to collar MERLO'S LAD in
the closing jump. MERLO'S LAD was with the pace four wide to bid into the lane, led past the sixteenth marker and just failed to last. ALL FOR TRUTH was
on the pace between rivals, dueled through the far turn and came up empty late. NATTYTYME saved ground behind the early leaders and could not
produce the needed late run. REVERSALOFFORTUNE stalked the leaders four wide and lacked a final closing run. LUCKYNSUCCESSFUL lacked a solid
bid racing three and four wide. TAYLOR'S PRINCE steadied in the opening furlong between rivals, followed the pace three wide and failed to mount a bid.
COLLEGE PARTY contested the pace inside rivals while about the two or three path and weakened into the lane.

BANKER NITA dropped back off the early pace while four and five wide in the first turn, rallied to contention four wide through the far turn to show in front
turning for home and moved clear under steady handling. RANBIR moved to the front about the two or three pace, continued with the winner through the far
turn but could not go with that one in the lane while clearly best of the others. ALEXANDRIAS THRONE tracked the early leader three or four wide to bid in
late backstretch but could not sustain the run through the far turn. VAGARY stalked the pace four wide, angled in going to the far turn and weakened.
REESEY PEESEY was not a threat racing four wide. JESSICA GLITTERS saved ground in reach of the pace and tired. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN saved
