MADAME BARBARIAN stalked a bit off the rail, came out leaving the turn and three wide into the stretch, rallied under urging to the front in deep stretch
and proved best. EASY GRADER stalked just off the inside, bid outside a rival on the turn, took a short lead between foes a quarter mile out, inched away in
midstretch, could not hold off the winner late but was clearly second best. WINSINFASHION stalked three deep, bid three wide leaving the turn and into the
stretch and held third. RUBY BRADLEY close up stalking the pace between horses, steadied in a bit tight into the turn, continued between foes leaving the
turn, drifted to the inside in the final furlong and lacked a rally. ZILLINDA chased outside then off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and could not offer
the necessary late response. INCREDIBLY LUCKY settled outside then off the rail, came out into the stretch and lacked a rally. MONGOLIAN WINDOW
dropped back off the inside on the backstretch, angled in some approaching the turn, came out into the stretch and did not rally. A FILLY CAN DREAM

BRICKYARD RIDE quickly sprinted clear, set the pace a bit off the rail, opened up on the turn, widened under left handed urging while drifting in some in the
final furlong and was under steady handling late. PROMISE NOTHING chased between horses on the backstretch and turn, continued outside a rival in the
stretch and bested that one for the place. CALL ME DADDY also chased the winner between horses then inside on the turn and in the stretch and was best
of the others. HYDROGEN saved ground chasing the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a further response. FOREIGN PROTOCOL chased
four wide between horses then three deep on the turn and into the stretch and weakened. ARC NATION five wide chasing the pace on the backstretch,
dropped back and angled in some on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
RED KING chased inside then outside a rival, went between horses on the second turn, came out four wide into the stretch and rallied under a couple
cracks of the whip and good handling to get up four wide on the line. OF GOOD REPORT saved ground stalking the pace, split horses in midstretch, bid
along the rail in deep stretch, put a head in front late and was edged on the wire. TURN THE SWITCH pulled between horses then stalked outside a rival,
bid between rivals on the backstretch then dueled outside the pacesetter, gained a slim advantage leaving the second turn, inched away in midstretch,
fought back between horses in deep stretch while bumping with AVALANCHE a sixteenth out and shared the show with that one. AVALANCHE settled
inside then outside a rival, went three deep on the second turn and five wide into the stretch, drifted in and bumped a foe a sixteenth out then tied for third
with that runner. GO DADDY GO broke out a bit, chased outside a rival then moved up boldly three deep with a bid on the backstretch then tracked again
between foes into and on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and was outfinished. FIVESTAR LYNCH (IRE) saved ground stalking the pace,
came out into the stretch, was between horses through much of the drive and also was outkicked late. CRYSTAL TRIBE (IRE) a bit slow to begin, angled in
and settled outside a rival then three deep into and on the second turn, was in tight four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. POSTERIZE had
speed outside foes then angled in and set the pace inside, dueled along the rail on the backstretch and second turn and weakened in the final furlong. The
stewards conducted an inquiry into the bumping of the show horses but made no change when they ruled the incident minor.

BORDER TOWN a bit slow to begin, settled just off the rail, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch, angled inward in midstretch and
rallied under a left handed crack of the whip and a strong hand ride to gain the lead in deep stretch and proved best. MOUNTAIN SPIRIT pulled three deep
then stalked outside a rival, bid alongside the pacesetter on the backstretch and second turn to gain the lead nearing the quarter pole, inched away into the
stretch, drifted out in midstretch and could not hold off the winner. SOUTHERN KING chased inside then between foes into and on the second turn, came
out into the stretch and bested the others. MADMAN pulled along the inside then saved ground chasing the pace, came out a bit in the stretch and was
outfinished. IRISH HEATWAVE stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. MOVE OVER (GB) angled in and
settled inside, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch and improved position. THE STREET FIGHTER chased three deep then
outside a rival, went three wide into and on the second turn and into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. CAJUN TREASURE saved
ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch and weakened. DARK HEDGES had speed three deep then inched away and angled in, set a pressured
