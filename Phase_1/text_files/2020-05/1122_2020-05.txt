Footnotes
LIL SYDNEY stalked off the rail, split horses into the turn, continued just off the inside, swung three wide into the stretch, took the lead outside the runner-up
in midstretch and inched clear late under urging. STREET IMAGE had speed between rivals then dueled outside a foe, took the advantage leaving the turn,
fought back off the rail in the stretch, could not match the winner late but was clearly second best. BRICKBAT chased inside, went around a rival into the
stretch, angled back to the fence in midstretch and gained the show. GIT ON YOUR PULPIT chased off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and was
outfinished for third. POISE TO STRIKE had speed between foes then stalked between rivals, came three wide into the stretch and also was outfinished for
a minor share. ULTIMATE MYSTERY settled off the rail, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and lacked the needed rally between foes late. MOANA
LUNA chased inside, came out on the turn and five wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. ROYALLY BIG broke a bit slowly,
settled off the rail, went outside a rival on the turn and could not offer the needed late kick. SENSUOUS had speed five wide then stalked four wide to the
stretch and weakened. ROYAL ASPIRATIONS hopped slightly at the start, went up inside to duel for the lead, fought back leaving the turn and weakened in
the drive. JOHN'S INTUITION saved ground stalking the pace, dropped back on the turn and had little left for the stretch. CALDER VALE settled off the
inside then angled in and saved ground off the pace and failed to menace.

HEYWOODS BEACH hopped at the start but quickly recovered. stalked inside then bid along the rail to duel for the lead, gained a slim advantage on the
second turn, inched away a bit off the rail in the stretch, battled outside the runner-up in deep stretch and held gamely under urging. EASTERN OCEAN in a
bit tight between foes early, stalked inside, steadied in close into the second turn, bid along the rail in a bit tight past midstretch and continued willingly to the
wire. CAPITAL CALL angled in and settled outside a rival, went three deep on the second turn and five wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the drive but
gained the show. DOMINANT SOUL dueled four wide then stalked three deep to the stretch and lacked the needed late response.a. NO SLO MO saved
ground off the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and improved position in the drive. PORT SAINT JOE dueled between horses then three deep to the
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. PERSEVERANCE pulled and chased a bit off the rail then outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed rally. LEPRINO dueled a bit off the rail then between horses, fought back on the second turn and weakened in the final furlong.
LEMONADE STAND stalked outside a rival then between horses on the second turn and could not offer the necessary response. FIRE POLISH angled in
and settled outside a rival then between foes leaving the second turn and did not rally. ISTANBUL chased outside a rival then off the rail, came out leaving
the second turn and four wide into the stretch and weakened. SUMMER INVASION dropped back and angled in outside a rival then a bit off the rail to the
stretch and was not a threat. A claim of foul by the rider of the runner-up against the winner for alleged interference in midstretch was not allowed by the
stewards, who ruled the incident did not alter the original order of finish.
