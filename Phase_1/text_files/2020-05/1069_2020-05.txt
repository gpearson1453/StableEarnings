Footnotes
TIMELY TRADITION away in good order, asked a bit early to make the advantage, showed the way through the turn along the inside, shook clear when
straightened for home and maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. LADY C in the second flight, moved closer in the two path
late in the turn, split rivals past the furlong marker, finished willingly to earn the place, not a threat to the winner. SHE'S A DIME void of early foot, dropped
inside midway on the turn, in some traffic a furlong out, finished willingly when clear late. MISS IMPERIAL in the second flight inside, came up empty the
final furlong. JACCAT forwardly placed outside, continued three wide turn, also was found lacking when the real running began. FIRST ALTERNATE off the
pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, set down for the drive, lacked a serious late kick. LEXINGTON GRACE (IRE) last to leave, raced back,
passed a couple of tiring rivals without posing a serious threat. HAWT MESS prompted the winner off the inside, moved closer to that one with a brief bid
late in the turn, remained closest to that rival past the furlong marker then faltered late. FULL OF GRACE settled off the early pace, steered out to be three
wide late in the turn, faded in the drive. WAR BALLAD trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SCOLDING dueled up front while racing off the inside, shook off the other speed turning for home, clear, won geared down to be ridden out. TAKE
CHARGE GLENDA lacked early foot, four wide through the turn, advanced to be closest to the winner a furlong out, proved no match for that one, fully
extended to hold sway for the place. BRITTLE AND YOO broke back, raced back early, four wide into the lane while in some traffic, finished willingly to be
getting to the runner up late. SPURWINK LANE within striking distance while four wide into the far turn, three wide when chasing the winner into the lane,
lacked a punch to the wire and finished up evenly after dropping to the inside. EXTRA EFFORT behind the pace in the second flight along the rail, checked
up in tight quarters along the rail into the turn, fell well back, saved ground into the stretch, moved out a bit and improved position. PORTOFINA last to
leave, trailed early, in the two path out of the turn, improved upper stretch then flattened out late. HURRICANE TIZWAY broke sharp, allowed the two early
leaders to go early, moved inside for the drive, steadied behind a stopping rival late in the turn, faded. BONUS BABY in mid pack early outside, three wide
through the turn, had little left for the drive. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY remained back while racing outside. SHE'S THE BOSS broke forwardly, dueled inside
the winner for a half and stopped. CLAY'S QUARTZ staged a steady retreat three wide.

Footnotes
ENDORSED off step slow, outrun early, began to advance late backstretch, advanced four out to five wide in the second turn, challenged then put a head in
front just inside the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe. BANKIT outrun in the early going while saving ground, continued inside into the
far turn, advanced then angled to the outside entering the stretch, finished with good energy to be getting to the winner late. PIRATE'S PUNCH forwardly
placed while four wide into the first turn, stalked in the run up the backstretch, moved to challenge four wide in the second turn, vied, lacked a late punch to
be outfinished at the wire. LONG RANGE TODDY prompted the pace off the inside, challenged and put a head in front midway on the far turn, continued to
vie into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the top three. RATED R SUPERSTAR lacked early foot toward the inside early, steered out to be five wide
turning for home, mild gain. OPERATION STEVIE void of early foot, saved ground, steered out in upper stretch, improved position. LOMBO prompted the
pace off the inside, lodged a brief bid in some traffic midway on the second turn, gave way in the drive. TREASURE TROVE broke alertly, set the pace
along the inside, faltered when headed in the second turn. TWO THIRTY FIVE crowded while in tight quarters past the wire the first time, mid pack the next
half, tired in the drive. CHRIS AND DAVE behind the leaders while along the inside, tired. LONE ROCK was finished early.

HUNT THE FRONT off a step slow, raced back just off the inside, began to move into the far turn, angled out four wide for the drive, challenged outside the
leader with less than a furlong remaining, gained the advantage then had enough left late to withstand the runner up. FRIAR'S ROAD settled in mid pack,
moved closer in some traffic midway on the second turn, also was four wide into the lane, set down, finished willingly to be steadily getting to the winner late.
WILD UNION prompted the pace off the inside, moved to challenge far turn, took over, could not match strides with the winner nor contain the runner up,
clear of the others. BEAVER HAT went one paced while racing off the inside. TONALTALITARIAN off slowly, trailed early, rallied five wide out of the final
turn, displayed some late interest while widest down the lane. WHAT A COUNTRY lacked speed into the first turn, steadied in some traffic midway on that
bend, saved ground second turn, failed to menace to finish up evenly. ABSOLUTE UNIT forwardly placed while outside, continued to race forwardly in the
three path in the run up the backstretch, moved closer far turn, faltered in the drive. F F ROCKET settled in mid pack, lacked a response while four wide
through the final turn. WILD TONIGHT remained always back in lacking a closing response. SECOND LINE DAVID rank when forwardly placed in the early
going, began a steady retreat before a half. RING OF FIRE set the pace inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch, began to weaken when
headed far turn. APPLE EMPIRE finished early, far back, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
GAMINE broke alertly, set the pace while in hand through some lively fractions, shook clear in the second turn, responded when confronted late and dug in
to refuse to allow that rival to pass. SPEECH settled off the pace while angling in, advanced to be closest to the winner along the inside turning for home,
shifted out, challenged on the outside with less than a furlong remaining, denied, clearly second best. QUEEN BRIDGET void of speed, advanced in the far
turn along the inside then steered out three wide, finished willingly to be well clear of the others, no match for the top two. KISS THE GIRL went one paced
while racing toward the inside. AIN'T NO ELMERS forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the drive while continuing on the outside.
BOOTYTAMA away in good order, raced closest to the winner off the inside for five furlongs through those glib fractions and began to give way. FOREIGN
EXCHANGE last away, five wide into the first turn when with the main body, continued to race outside and failed to rally. SEAHAWK LISA in tight quarters
then jostled into the first turn, raced outside, worked way to the rail second turn and failed to menace. BLACK KAT TAPS in some traffic into the first
turn,came out to tighten up outer rivals, made little other impact while remaining back. ROADRUNNER'S HONOR broke back and was never involved.
ORQUIDIAS BIZ jostled into the first turn, finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MORETTI forwardly placed while four wide into the first turn, settled in the second flight in the run up the backstretch, four wide again in the second turn,
asked, challenged from between horses past the furlong marker, drew clear under firm handling. DUKES UP void of early foot, continued well back while off
the inside, swung six wide into the lane, finished with good energy to earn the place, no late gain on the winner. FRA MAURO also devoid of any early foot,
saved ground, rallied for the show, no threat to the top two. CARIBBEAN (AUS) away in good order, prompted the pace, three wide when stalking the
leaders, challenged in the second turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, faltered. FORTHELUVOFBOURBON back off the pace, second
flight in the second turn when saving ground, poised to strike into the stretch, lacked punch. TIMES SQUARE off slowly, trailed far back, swung widest into
the lane, improved. BENINTENDI broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, faltered in the drive. WILD POPIT pressed the leader off the inside, advanced
to challenge midway on the final turn, vied into the lane, gave way the final furlong. DEFENDER five wide into the first turn, hard rated, continued wide, four
wide through the second bend then gave way in the drive. DON VITO CORLEONE shuffled back in some traffic into the first turn, raced in the second flight
the middle half off the inside, gave way suddenly in the far turn, eased stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
DUNPH in the second flight while racing outside, advanced into the far turn, took over, clear, kept to task, to remain clear the final furlong. FEARLESS void
of speed, moved out in the first turn,dropped back to the inside for the run into the final turn, steered out wide exiting that bend, finished full of run while too
late. SONNY SMACK lacked speed of the inside, rallied three out to four wide into the stretch, annexed the show while no match for the top two. HOME
RUN TRICK closest to the leader, challenged that one from the outside second turn, offered little resistance to the winner when that one went by into the
stretch, chased that rival past the furlong then faltered. MO GOTCHA within striking distance off the inside, continued in the two path second turn, lacked a
closing response. ALWAYS void of speed, trailed well back, improved position with some modest late interest, not a serious threat. ROTATION settled off
the pace and the inside, had little for the drive. PROVERB in mid pack early, saved ground to no avail in lacking a rally. LORD GUINNESS off slowly, settled
in mid pack, tired in the drive. POPULAR KID never menaced. EXTIRPATOR broke well, set the pace, stopped when headed. ESKENFORIT was finished
after a half.

Footnotes
RUSHIE broke well, prompted the leader from the two path, challenged between foes turning for home, put a head in front upper stretch, lugged in past the
furlong marker and drove clear. CANDY TYCOON settled off the pace along the inside, continued to track the leaders far turn, moved out for the drive,
roused, finished with good energy to be getting to the winer late. BACKGROUND forwardly placed while in the three path, challenged three wide in the
second turn, could not keep up with the winner in the drive nor could he contain the runner up, comfortably save the show. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke alertly,
set the pace, vied along the inside into the lane, was beginning to weaken when bothered by the lugging winner a furlong outside, continued to falter.
KATZARELLI raced in mid pack off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a serious late kick;. VILLAINOUS void
of speed, raced in the two path through the final turn, improved position while never a serious threat. GINOBILI settled off the pace and the inside, moved
closer to loom a threat four wide midway on the final turn, lacked a further advance through the stretch. SPANISH KINGDOM made little impact while racing
off the inside. AMEN CORNER lacked speed, moved out to be five wide in the second turn, failed to muster a rally when called on. SPECIAL DAY was
finished after a half. SLEW TANG CLAN was off a step slow and always outrun. LIFE ON THE ROAD in mid pack in the early going, began a steady fade
after a half.

Footnotes
CHARLATAN broke running, got clear past the wire the first time, rated while maintaining daylight in the run up the backstretch, let out a notch turning for
home to increase his advantage, was kept to task with a left handed stick past the furlong marker and was not threatened to the wire. BASIN broke out,
quickly straightened to be closest to the winner in the two path, pursued that rival up the backstretch and into the far turn, asked for run midway through that
bend, proved no match in the drive, fully extended to preserve the place. GOUVERNEUR MORRIS settled off the pace in the two path and between horses
through the first turn, in hand up the backstretch, moved toward the inside late in the final turn, switched to the outside when straightened for home, finished
willingly to be steadily getting to the runner up late. WINNING IMPRESSION settled off the pace and the inside, roused in the two path for the drive,
displayed some mild interest to improve slightly, no threat to the top three. ANNEAU D'OR last to leave, moved out and toward the front, within striking
position in the three path, had little left for the drive. CRYPTO CASH void of early foot, continued back and off the inside, passed a couple of tiring rivals
while never a threat. MO MOSA in the second flight while along the inside, saved ground to no avail in lacking a response in the drive. JUNGLE RUNNER
void of speed while racing toward the inside, remained back while also unable to muster a closing response. MY FRIENDS BEER raced in the main body for
a half and then began a steady retreat.

edged away late under brisk handling. WARRIOR'S CHARGE hustled clear soon after the start, dropped inside, rated in the run up the backstretch,
continued to show the way while saving ground through the final turn, responded when the winner came alongside turning for home, dueled past the furlong,
proved stubborn until late, lasted for the place. MR FREEZE away in good order, steered out into the first turn to carry several rivals out, ranged up closer
while four wide in the second turn, lost ground to the top two turning for home, getting back to the runner up late. TACITUS in some traffic then carried out
and bothered into the first bend to be five wide, continued outside, four wide through the second turn, mild interest late to pick up a minor award. TAX
forwardly placed while racing three wide, continued in the three path the middle half, crept closer in the second turn then flattened out in the drive.
CAPTIVATING MOON last away, void of speed, circled five wide late in the final turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. SKY PROMISE
dropped inside soon after the start, fell far back, continued to trail past the furlong marker then improved position through some traffic the final furlong.
CHESS CHIEF forwardly placed early along the inside, fell back along the inside before a half, went evenly in the drive in lacking a late bit. NIGHT OPS
carried out six wide into the first turn when with the main body, continued to race well wide, five wide through the second turn, nothing left for the drive.
COMBATANT in mid pack when carried out four wide into the first turn, remained back in showing little. BRAVAZO pulled early when well behind the pace,

Footnotes
NADAL allowed the pace to go early, settled in the three path while applying pressure to the leader, collared that rival turning for home, shook clear, geared
down, ridden out. KING GUILLERMO raced in the second flight just off the inside, angled out slightly and loomed a threat three wide late in the final turn,
proved no match in the drive, remained clear for the place. FINNICK THE FIERCE settled in the two path early, moved out slightly to be three wide turning
for home, had little for the top pair the final furlong, finished best of the rest while not a threat to the top two. FARMINGTON ROAD fell back after the start,
moved out, lodged a middle move four wide, failed to sustain that advance in the drive to finish up evenly. WELLS BAYOU broke sharp, got clear toward the
inside, two path through the first turn, continued to set the pace, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted second turn, folded when headed by
that rival by late in the final turn. STORM THE COURT within striking distance off the inside early, continued three out to four wide in the second turn, faded
in the drive. SILVER PROSPECTOR three wide off the pace, dropped inside to save ground through the second bend, failed to fire through the stretch.
CODE RUNNER broke in mid pack, raced back, was finished before a half. TAISHAN settled toward the inside, early, also was through early to be a non
factor.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE D'ORO pressed the issue from the start, bid between foes turning for home the second time, long drive, found more late to prevail in game
fashion. RIVER ECHO (GB) also forwardly placed from the start, continued to pressure the pace from the three path through the third turn, hooked up with
the winner turning for home, dueled, outfinished in the late going. DANGERFIELD in hand off pace inside, pulled into the lane the first time, second flight
second turn, closer, tapped brakes six furlongs out, continued up firm restraint up the backstretch the second turn, steered out, no match top two. CURLIN
GREY void of speed for over a mile off the inside, advanced four wide through the final turn, continued to improve position in the drive, no real threat. THE
ROUGE DIESEL raced in mid pack for a mile, moved closer four wide after a mile, lacked a further response to finish evenly. GHOSTLY WHO broke on top,
set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch the second time, began to weaken when headed by the top two turning for
home. CARLOS SIXES rated off the pace toward the inside early, remained in mid pack, came up empty for the drive. MAGIC VOW in the main body while
three wide, faded after a half. WHOLE LOTTA LUCK lacked speed in hand, failed to muster a rally. WILD ABOUT YOU steadied early, remained always
back. SHE MIGHT TELL off slow, was never involved. WICKETS WAY failed to menace. STUART HALL void of speed, remained always back in showing
little.
