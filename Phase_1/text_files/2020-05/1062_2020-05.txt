Footnotes
STARSHIP BUBBA broke in bumping REINOANIMAUX solidly at the start, ambled along unhurried early, was put to a drive approaching the quarter-pole
four wide, caught NIMBLE BEAST while attempting to lug in through the furlong grounds, and was geared down the last 70 yards. NIMBLE BEAST bumped
with OFFICER COUNTRY after the start, went up to take the lead inside, shook off PUNCHLINE around the turn, could not hold off the winner entering the
last furlong but held well to clearly best the others. OFFICER COUNTRY got bumped between NIMBLE BEAST and PUNCHLINE and steadied after the
start, swung widest leaving the turn and was up outside rivals for the show. WINTER AT BASTOGNE was reserved early in striking range, and lacked the
needed response toward the inside. EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE was forwardly placed three wide to the stretch, and faded. PUNCHLINE bumped with
OFFICER COUNTRY after the start, prompted the pace outside NIMBLE BEAST for a half-mile, and retreated on the turn. REINOANIMAUX received a
solid bump from STARSHIP BUBBA at the break, and dropped far back after a half.

Footnotes
EXCHANGE DAY was never far back, closed in three wide around the turn, collared LUCKY AS A SEVEN from outside at the top of the stretch, and proved
best despite neglecting to change leads. LUCKY AS A SEVEN brushed the left side of the gate while coming away alertly, sped clear inside, responded
when hooked by EXCHANGE DAY turning for home, and fought gamely to the finish. CONGRATS AGAIN lost his action greenly and dropped back to trail
after the start, came four wide beginning to advance off the turn, and found his best stride belatedly. CHUCKY broke with the leaders and was close up
inside early, dropped back uncomfortable with kickback into the turn, got steered out four wide to avoid it, and lacked a solid response. MIDNIGHT
TRAVELER pressed the pace outside LUCKY AS A SEVEN, and began to give way nearing the quarter-pole. TESTIFIED raced in the two-path outsprinted
early, and made no headway widest in the stretch. HIGHLY NOTED unseated the rider skittish pre-race, broke alertly, could not keep pace into the turn and
was ridden along with no response. CATCHING FISH broke a step slowly, saved ground outsprinted to the turn, and showed little.

Footnotes
SCAR eyed the leading trio up the backstretch, swept up four wide taking over readily near the five-sixteenths, drew off into the lane and was kept busy to
the finish. BAHAMIAN PARK was reserved early inside, moved out following behind the winner four or five wide late on the turn, could not threaten that one
but was clearly second best and wrapped up late with his position secured. INTEREST raced well back early, swung five wide leaving the turn and was
along for the show while never a factor. HERO UP raced four then five wide around the turn, and weakened in the stretch. ITSMYLUCKYKNIGHT broke out
at the start, vied outside rivals up the backstretch, and faded three wide approaching the stretch. BEINFUN contested the early pace inside CHAOS KID and
ITSMYLUCKYKNIGHT, weakened through the turn, and dropped far back. CHAOS KID contested the pace between horses for a half-mile, faltered around
the turn, and was eased up by the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
SEE THE PYRAMIDS went up to vie inside VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ after a half-mile, moved clear around the turn, faced a challenge from MACHO
D'ORO into the stretch, dug in along the rail and was going away late. MACHO D'ORO settled in the middle of the field early toward the inside, swung four
wide gathering momentum late on the turn, ranged up alongside SEE THE PYRAMIDS through upper stretch, could not get by and stayed clear of the
others. VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ established the early pace off the rail, was joined from the inside by the eventual winner approaching the turn, and
weakened between horses before completing six furlongs. HAIL MICHIGAN had good striking position three wide just off the leaders to the turn, and lacked
the needed bid. PUMP ROOM was prominent early three wide, and faded around the turn. SUPER EDGAR lost his footing briefly at the start, and dropped
well out of it four wide before reaching the stretch. BIP BIP FULL POWER bobbled at the start, and was outrun. KING OF THE NORTH was finished early
inside. TEXAS GIANT raced widest early, and dropped far back.

AWESOME ACTION dueled for the lead outside DECIDER early, disposed of that one by midway on the turn, shook off the next wave of pursuers by upper
stretch, and had enough left late to preserve the decision. DECKOLOGY broke open the stall door prior to the start, swung out four wide approaching the
stretch, and was closing in late outside the winner. FENTYNOLA bumped with FREE FLAYME at the start, lagged well back to the stretch in the two-path,
angled to the rail past the eighth-pole and finished willingly. STARSHIP TAXI bumped with ELVIS COLE at the start, advanced five wide around the turn,
loomed a threat into the stretch but was outkicked. MOON PISTOL got squeezed back between BOLT and STARSHIP TAXI at the start, advanced mildly
three wide after a half-mile, and gained outside late without menacing. EL ZEUS pressed the pace three wide for a half-mile, and faded through the drive.
BOLT broke out slightly at the start, stayed in range four then three wide for a half, and tired. REGGAE PIRATE faded steadily after a half. ELVIS COLE
bumped with STARSHIP TAXI at the start, and was outrun. FREE FLAYME bumped with FENTYNOLA at the start, and never reached contention.
DECIDER hustled through to duel for command inside AWESOME ACTION early, and faltered around the turn.

KEY BISCAYNE chased after AMADORA already being put to pressure by late on the backstretch, lost ground around the far turn appearing beaten, then
found a second wind and kicked in outside to overhaul the pacesetter in time. AMADORA assumed command after the start, rated along slightly off the
inside through an even clip, remained well clear into the stretch but could not withstand the top one in the closing yards. STARSHIP NUGGET was never far
back, advanced along the rail on the far turn, shifted to the two-path with aim outside AMADORA, and was one-paced to the finish. MO OF THE WEST
saved ground for six furlongs, and angled wide tiring into the stretch. LOVE RANGER raced three wide and was finished soon after going a half-mile.

Footnotes
AWESOME PARTY stumbled at the start and recovered bumping UYEDA, settled well off the pace for a half-mile, began to edge closer shifting four wide
after six furlongs, rallied steadily and overtook the leaders outside in deep stretch. SHANGHAI MOON raced three wide into the turn, moved inside
approaching the stretch, bid along the rail through the furlong grounds and finished gamely. NEVERSTOPDREAMING was nursed along on a short early
lead inside, dueled inside STILL SCHEMIN around the turn and into the stretch, and yielded late in the two-path. STILL SCHEMIN prompted the pace
outside NEVERSTOPDREAMING, went head and head with that rival around the turn and into the lane, and weakened in the final stages. UYEDA bumped
with AWESOME PARTY at the start, had the dueling leaders in his sights while shifting out three wide on the turn, but gave way by upper stretch. EXATLON
dropped back before reaching the turn, and continued to fade away. CHASING THE CANDY was forwardly placed early inside, dropped back steadily on
the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
HIGH NOON RIDER saved ground at the back for six furlongs, moved out in upper stretch, rallied steadily being brushed lightly late by DALARNA, and
proved best. BELGRANO took over around the first turn in the two-path, moved inside setting a sharp pace, drifted out under left-hand pressure bumping
DALARNA solidly in deep stretch, and could not hold off the winner. DALARNA was pocketed inside to the stretch, eased outside to challenge BELGRANO
and reached near-even terms past the furlong marker, was bumped by the latter and pushed out toward HIGH NOON RIDER in deep stretch and
weakened, then pulled up in distress favoring the left front and was vanned off. FLOWMOTION brushed the right side of the gate at the start, saved ground
on the turns, moved out going a bit one-paced through mid stretch, and lacked a clear path late behind the leaders. ZIPPY raced three wide early at the
rear, came under a ride into the far turn and lacked a response. FIFTH TITLE was a step slow from the gate and four wide to the first turn, and faded three
wide after six furlongs. FARLEY prompted the pace outside BELGRANO, and retired after six furlongs. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, BELGRANO
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND POSITION AND PLACED THIRD FOR IMPEDING DALARNA IN THE STRETCH.

CONGRATS THIS advanced steadily inside up the backstretch, got shuffled back slightly early on the turn, regrouped and found clear sailing shifting to the
two-path approaching the stretch, wrested command outside STRATEGIC OUTLOOK past the eighth-pole and drew away under a drive much best.
STRATEGIC OUTLOOK fended off pursuers setting the pace inside for six furlongs, was no match for the winner entering the final furlong, but held to stay
clear of the others. DOCTOR D J was outrun early, moved up menacingly four wide late on the turn, but flattened out. COWBOY BOB moved up four then
three wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. SNAP HOOK raced three wide on the turn, and failed to menace. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) was
no factor three wide. RATTLE'M bumped with HOLLYWOOD OVERDOGS at the start, chased after the leaders three wide to the turn, and was through
after six furlongs. BEAST MODE raced four or five wide, and never reached contention. QUALITY SPECIAL was through early inside. HOLLYWOOD
OVERDOGS bumped with RATTLE'M at the start, prompted the pace outside STRATEGIC OUTLOOK to the turn, and had nothing left approaching the
stretch.

Footnotes
OVER GATORS broke alertly and set the early pace inside, shook off FOXY LADY around the turn, drifted out under pressure while clear in the stretch and
was never in jeopardy. PROSPECTIVE DIVA was outsprinted early, came three wide off the turn, battled outside QUEEN ABARRIO through the lane and
won that battle for second. QUEEN ABARRIO raced in range two then three wide on the turn, lacked a solid rally and was outfinished for the place. FOXY
LADY pressed the pace outside OVER GATORS to the quarter-pole, and faded steadily. SONG RIVER broke in the air, raced four wide around the turn,
and made no late headway on the far outside. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE became edgy in the gate and had her head turned left at the break, and was outrun
inside. ALL ABOUT STELLA stumbled at the start, chased the leaders three then four wide into the turn, and tired before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS MY MACHO settled in easy striking range early, lodged a bid three wide turning for home, kicked away through mid stretch and remained clear under
a drive. LADY NOGUEZ advanced toward the inside while awaiting room early on the far turn, tipped out for clearance at the top of the lane, shifted in
gradually while moving after MISS MY MACHO through the furlong grounds, and did not have enough. GEA raced in the second flight for six furlongs, came
three wide turning for home, steadied outside BEASAICHI and behind LADY NOGUEZ in mid stretch, and was gaining late outside the latter. BEASAICHI
saved ground for nearly six furlongs before shifting out three wide, and was one-paced through the late stages. SILLY NOTION was well back to the stretch,
and improved on the far outside without threatening. KAYSERI pressed the pace outside REITERATE, reached a short lead a quarter-mile out, could not
match strides with MISS MY MACHO nearing the eighth-pole and gave way. QUEEN FIELD raced four wide through the turns, and could not gain.
REITERATE set the pace inside for nearly six furlongs, and faltered. R SEA SMOKE tired three wide before reaching the stretch. K P CATS WILD was slow
into stride, and trailed throughout. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF GEA AGAINST LADY NOGUEZ FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.
