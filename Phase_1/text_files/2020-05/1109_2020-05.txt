Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO was tracking the leaders to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and edged away driving.
HULA KING had no speed, was in the two path on the turn then closed steadily through the lane. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF was also outrun to the turn, saved
ground to the stretch then shifted out for room but finished evenly. LORD VADER chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch then was
gaining ground belatedly. NO MORE FIREBALL contested the pace inside a rival to the stretch, was collared by the winner in mid stretch and weakened.
SMILING RED broke slow and was green in the opening furlong, eased in to save ground to the stretch and showed some interest late. MARINO HEAT
attended the pace outside a rival to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and tired. PAPA SUGAR chased the pace from the rail to the stretch but came
up empty when asked. FIGHTINGALLTHETIME was outsprinted early, raced three wide to the stretch but also lacked a closing bid. PRAIRIE CREEK
chased the leaders two wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON never far back to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, shifted off the rail nearing mid stretch, rallied between rivals and pushed
clear despite not switching leads. BAD BEAT set the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then could not stall the winner but saved
second. EUSTACE was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide while rallying into the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch but could not sustain the
needed response. TRUMP UM pressed the pace two wide, pushed up to try to engage for the lead into the stretch, dueled to mid stretch then weakened.
MISTER MCLEAN tracked the pace to the turn, was two then three wide to the stretch but lacked a late response. WINK AND A DREAM had no speed, was
three wide to the stretch but did not threaten in the drive. OPERA GHOST was bumped by GOLD CRUSHER at the start, had no speed and was outrun.
GOLD CRUSHER broke in, bumped OPERA GHOST at the start then was not a factor.

FAIR CHALLENGE stalked the leaders early, bid three then four wide on the turn, collared the leader in mid stretch and edged clear driving. DAVE'S GIFT
tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch, rallied to mid stretch then could not menace the winner but saved second. CHIEF EAGLE EYE was chasing the
pace two wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch and was closing belatedly. NEAH BAY hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path to the
stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch and weakened. HOLD ME CLOSE was outsprinted early, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked the
needed late response. CUPID'S VICTORY was used to press NEAH BAY two then three wide to the stretch but tired in the drive. TEXAS BOB had no
speed and was never a threat. RUN TO THE ATM almost dwelt at the start, lost about six lengths to begin and did not recover. LUCKY TWICE had no
speed and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BADGER pressed the pace early then pushed up inside rivals to engage for the lead, dueled to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch and held under
steady urging. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE broke in a tangle and was outrun to the turn, had to circle four then five wide to the stretch but finished willingly and
was along for second. NORTH CROSS tracked the leaders two wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch but finished in a mild rally. BABY YOU
GOT IT got outsprinted early, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. RUN HEAT hustled to the front, dueled between
rivals on the turn, was passed in upper stretch and weakened. BUEN AMIGO tracked the leaders to the turn but got fanned four wide to the stretch and
lacked a late bid. TANNER'S MY NAME had no speed, trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. RAINDANCE RULES hustled along early, attended the
pace three wide to the stretch but got outkicked in upper stretch and stopped suddenly.

RUSTIC CANYON pressed the leader to the half, bid two wide and dueled to the stretch then pushed clear and held driving. NOLONGERAHOBBY tracked
the pace to the second turn, was asked for more three wide to the stretch, got oukicked by the winner to mid stretch but saved second. EAST RAND had no
speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned to the four path to the stretch and was gaining ground belatedly. IMPERATOR also was allowed to settle mid
pack, bid three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. MAD AT MONEY tracked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but
came up empty in the drive. ELECTORAL chased the pace to the half mile pole, raced two wide to the stretch but flattened in the final furlong. BOYSON had
no speed and was not a factor. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE hustled to the front, contested the pace for six furlongs then tired.

Footnotes
FAR WEST had no speed, was off the rail on the turn, eased out in upper stretch, rallied then shifted back inward and closed fast to prevail. MR. DIPLOMAT
tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch, rallied to get to terms in mid stretch, took a short lead in deep stretch but could not stall the winner. ROB'S GOT
GAME also was tracking the leaders, bid three wide and rallied to mid stretch to loom a threat but finished evenly late. MERCY RULE broke a bit slow,
chased the pace, saved ground to the stretch but was outkicked in the late stages. POWER TIMES TWO was also chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide
to the stretch but could not muster the needed late response. SIMPLY CHARMING hustled to set the pace under pressure to the turn, dueled from the rail to
the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then was tiring. STONE GROOVE broke a step slow, had no speed, was three wide to the stretch but failed to threaten in
the drive. CASH MONEY was pinched back at the start, was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then was trying to rally but was caught in tight
inside, steadied leaving the eighth pole and lost any chance. GALLANT HEAT had no speed and saved ground but did not rally. KLAY NATION hustled
along to attend the pace three wide to the stretch then tired. HARDY CHISEL chased the pace early, was forced out to the five path on the turn and gave
way in the drive.

Footnotes
THE FILTER hustled to the front, set a presssured pace from the rail to the stretch, was overtaken by JAZZ STREET to mid stretch but battled bravely to
retake the lead and held off KNOWN late. KNOWN broke slow and had no speed, was two wide to the stretch then finished fast in the final furlong. JAZZ
STREET pressed the winner two wide to the turn, moved alongside and dueled that one then edged away under urging to mid stretch but failed to switch
leads in the drive and hung. NORTHERN QUEST was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then was rallying behind the runnerup but had
to check off that on in deep stretch. MR. NASTY had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then was closing fast in the late stages. OASIS had no speed,
raced three wide to the stretch then also finished willingly. JAMASON chased the pace three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. INTRINSIC
VALUE stalked the leaders from the rail to the stretch then tired. CALIFORNIA CANDY was also chasing the pace but was fanned four deep on the turn and
gave way in the drive. FANTASY SUITE flashed some speed early, was two wide to the stretch then also gave way.
