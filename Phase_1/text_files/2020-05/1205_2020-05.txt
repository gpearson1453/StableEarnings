wide into the stretch, rallied to the front outside foes under an energetic hand ride nearing midstretch and drove clear. NOCHERYLIKEMYCHERY stalked
outside a rival then between rivals on the second turn, waited off heels then split horses in midstretch and gained the place. WARRIOR'S MOON saved
ground stalking the pace, slipped through along the fence with a bid in the drive and just held third. HOT ON THE TRAIL angled in and stalked inside, cut
the corner into the stretch, lacked room in tight off heels in midstretch, came out and just missed the show. BRAHMS COMMAND had speed three deep
then outside a rival, inched away and angled in, set the pace inside, came a bit off the rail into the stretch, was not a match for the winner in the final furlong
and was outfinished late for third. MARJORIE E stalked outside a rival, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. OH PRETTY WOMAN
between horses early, had speed inside then stalked a bit off the rail, went outside a rival leaving the backstretch and three deep on the second turn, came

Footnotes
SHANGHAI CURLY sent along inside to stalk the pace, bid along the rail on the turn to take a short lead, inched away nearing midstretch, drifted out a bit
and proved best under urging then steady handling late. ROSSMAN a step slow into stride, saved ground stalking the pace, came off the rail on the turn and
three wide into the stretch and bested the others. CALDER VALE stalked three deep then outside a rival into the turn, continued off the rail and three wide
into the stretch, angled to the inside in midstretch and edged a foe for third late. SENSUOUS had speed outside the winner then edged away a half mile out,
dueled outside that one on the turn and into the stretch and was edged late for the show. FOUR O'FIVE close up stalking the pace between horses, fell
back some just off the rail into the turn, angled to the inside on the bend and weakened in the drive. ITALIAN FIGHTER hopped slightly in a slow start,
dropped back off the rail, angled in some on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
PAIGE RUNNER came off the rail on the first turn and bid between horses then dueled outside the runner-up, took a short lead in upper stretch, came in
under right handed urging to bump with that one in midstretch and edged away late. DESTINY'S JOURNEY sped to the early lead, dueled inside, fought
back in the stretch, was bumped by the winner in midstretch and could not quite match that one late. MISS BENNET stalked three deep then off the rail on
the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted out some and bested the others. TICK TOCK broke out a bit, settled off the inside, came three
wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SAMANDAH stalked a bit off the rail then inside leaving the first turn and on the backstretch and second turn, cut the
corner into the stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN SUNRISE had speed three deep then stalked off the rail, continued between foes leaving the
backstretch, dropped back on the second turn and had little left for the drive. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the bumping between the top pair in
midstretch but made no change when they ruled the incident minor and that it did not alter the original order of finish.

ANTITHETICAL had good early speed and dueled a bit off the rail then inside on the turn, came out a bit into the stretch, inched away under urging in
midstretch and proved best. POISE TO STRIKE sped to the early lead off the rail then dueled outside the winner, fought back into the stretch, could not
match that one in the final furlong but was clearly second best. BEAUMONT BEAUX saved ground stalking the pace throughout and bested the others. U.
S. DANGER bobbled some at the start, was five wide early then pulled hard three deep and was in tight off heels a half mile out, stalked three wide to the
stretch and weakened in the drive. PRINCE RICKY cased outside a rival then a bit off the rail on the turn, came out in the stretch and also weakened.
GEOCAS STREET close up stalking the pace between horses, continued a bit off the rail leaving the turn and into the stretch and also weakened. ST.
GEEZY between horses early, chased a bit off the rail then inside on the turn and into the stretch and lacked a further response.

LAURA'S LIGHT angled in and tugged inside chasing the pace, came out into the stretch, took the lead outside the pacesetter in upper stretch, inched clear
in midstretch, drifted in some from the whip in deep stretch and held gamely under urging. STELA STAR (IRE) broke out a bit, chased outside a rival then
inside leaving the second turn, split horses in midstretch and finished gamely between foes to just miss. CROUGHAVOUKE (IRE) settled outside a rival,
went up three deep on the second turn and four wide into the stretch, drifted in some past midstretch and again in deep stretch and also finished willingly
three deep on the line. RED LARK (IRE) chased outside a rival then inside on the second turn, came out into the stretch, angled out past the eighth pole
then was in tight in deep stretch and lacked the needed late kick. GUITTY (FR) settled inside then moved up three deep on the backstretch, continued three
wide on the second turn and into the stretch, steadied in tight past the eighth pole and could not summon the necessary late response. K P DREAMIN
allowed to settle inside, went outside a rival on the second turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. PARKOUR pulled her way to the lead wide,
angled in and opened up a bit off the rail, widened on the backstretch, continued inside on the second turn and into the stretch and weakened. FASHION
ROYALTY (GB) saved ground chasing the pace, dropped back on the second turn and in the stretch and had little left for the drive. The stewards conducted
a pair of inquiries into the stretch run before ruling the trouble to GUITTY and RED LARK did not alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
RAIN DIVA had speed between horses then inched away on the backstretch and turn and drew off in the stretch under some urging and good handling.
QUEENSBECCAANDJANE broke a bit slowly, stalked inside, was in a bit tight into the turn, continued along he rail and gained the place. CAPITAL HEAT
also broke a bit slowly, settled off the rail, angled in and split horses on the turn and bested the others. AWESOME ALESSANDRA stalked inside, came out
some leaving the turn and into the stretch and weakened. CASILLALATER close up stalking the pace between foes then outside a rival on the turn,
continued between horses into the stretch and also weakened. KEEP IT CLASSY dropped back outside then off the rail, angled in some on the turn and
lacked a rally. TIZ A UNICORN tugged between horses to stalk the pace and was in a bit tight into the turn, angled in on the turn, came out into the stretch
and weakened. SWEET HONOR had speed between foes then stalked between rivals, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. LA SABALERA
stalked five wide then four wide on the turn and into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes

drifting in some to gain the lead in deep stretch and proved best. FRASARD (GB) stalked inside then between horses leaving the backstretch, went up three
deep into and on the second turn and four wide into the stretch, took the advantage and drifted in nearing midstretch, fought back inside the winner in deep
stretch and held second. CAPITAL CALL settled inside, came out on the second turn and four wide into the stretch, also drifted in some and edged rivals
late for the show. TALLIEN (IRE) chased between horses then outside a rival, came out four wide into the stretch, drifted in and waited off heels in
midstretch and was edged for third between foes late. RIO OCHO (IRE) pulled three deep early then angled in and chased inside, steadied in tight between
and behind rivals in midstretch, came out and put in a late bid at a minor award. UNUSUALLY HANDSOME angled in and chased a bit off the rail, was in
tight between foes into the second turn, continued between rivals, was in tight again in close quarters in midstretch and was outfinished for a minor share.
CANADIAN LUCK also angled in and pressed the pace outside a rival then stalked a bit off the rail, steadied off heels when boxed in passing midstretch and
was outfinished. WHIRL CANDY had speed inside then inched away leaving the first turn, set the pace along the rail, fought back into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. COSMO angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, awaited room briefly in midstretch, came out and lacked the needed
rally. INFATUATE chased three deep then outside a rival leaving the backstretch and on the second turn and weakened. PREMIER LEAGUE angled in and
stalked a bit off the rail then outside a rival leaving the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. HAND TIMED.
