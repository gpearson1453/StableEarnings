Footnotes
CHARMING WEEKEND received a light bump from the outside at the start, set the pace clear in the early going, stayed clear three wide to the stretch and
held foes at bay under hand urging. LOVELY STORM chased outside a rival, went three wide into the turn, took aim four wide into the stretch, bid outside
the leader but could not get by. YOLANDA'S STONE broke in and bumped UNCHANGED, unhurried in the early stages, angled to the inside, saved ground
around the turn, tipped out in the stretch and finished well, gaining to the wire. BLAZING MISS up close from the inside, put to urging around the turn, kept
on willingly from the rail but got outkicked in the final sixteenth. UNCHANGED knocked into rival leaving the gate, traveled two wide into the turn, angled out
into the five path, finished willingly but needed more. MAIKA went three wide into the turn, angled out and left the turn six wide and failed to threaten. AVO
stalked to the outside of the leader, crowded and steadied entering the turn, angled four wide and gave way.

Footnotes
SATRAPA pressed the leader from the inside, cleared rival around the turn and powered away to win easy. HOSS CARTWRIGHT veered out and bumped
riva at the start then bumped with another rival soon after, set the pace under pressure from inside rival, lost command and chased off the rail on the turn,
lugged out leaving the bend, lugged out further in the lane and held the place. STARTLING bumped leaving the gate, attended the pace three deep then
dropped back to stalk the top pair, swung six wide around the turn, carried out further in the stretch and held the show. ZINZAN veered out and bumped at
the start, traveled four wide into the lane and missed the show. NAHOY bumped at the start, bumped again with rival soon after, raced outside a rival and
could not rally. LAKE SHOW sandwiched between rivals at the start, saved ground around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and made no impact. HEAT
THINGS UP sandwiched leaving the gate, settled off the rail, swung six wide and had little left for the drive. GO SAMMY GO tracked from the inside and
never threatened.
