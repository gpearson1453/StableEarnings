KERTARA stalked the pace, raced four wide through the stretch and held gamely under strong pressure. MO GAYLE was allowed to settle early, lacked
racing room nearing the eighth pole, angled from the inside to the four path and closed in gamely late. FIGURE showed good early speed, raced three deep
and finished willingly to the wire. NOCTURNAL MISSION stalked the pace and weakened along the inside. MUSICAL MILLIE was allowed to settle early,
raced five deep at the eighth pole and never was a factor. HOYAM showed good speed from the inside and weakened. MISS LEIN was slow early and
never threatened. MI BELLA failed to sustain a bid.
