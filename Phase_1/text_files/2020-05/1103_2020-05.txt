Footnotes
HAPPY WANDERER hopped while being carried inwards by NAUTI BOY at the start, was urged through close quarters along the rail to gain terms with the
leaders racing into the first turn, prompted the pacesetter along the inside through the backstretch, switched outside that rival racing into the far turn,
continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage racing into the lane, then maintained a narrow margin under firm urging and some right handed
pressure. TIZ SAMURAI was urged to the lead between foes racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage just off the rail through the
backstretch to the second bend, resisted the winner's challenge to late stages but proved only second best. COMPLETELY BONKERS, pulling against
restraint between foes in the first flight racing into the first turn, was held up just off those rivals nearing the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the
far turn while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed final bid. GAME DAY DRAMA, urged to terms with the leaders four wide, then three deep
prompting the pace into the backstretch, couldn't match terms with the top pair racing into the far turn and gave way. MALEKITH tracked the leaders outside
rivals in second flight to the far turn but offered no rally. HONDO GUSTO was settled in the last flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane to gain
some position but made no real impression. THE WAYNE FACTOR settled between foes in early stages but never gained contention. NAUTI BUOY broke
inwards bumping the eventual winner, was steadied out of tight quarters racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight through the
backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch but had no late response. ENTERTAINER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to
the backstretch and faded after a half. WANNA SALSA reared at the start while breaking very slowly and soon trailed. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SWINDLE was prompted through close quarters to gain a forward placing, angled inside the leaders racing through the backstretch, was prompted to bid for
command along the rail entering the turn, forged clear racing into upper stretch while shifting out and held sway to the end under firm right handed
encouragement. RISEN CHANGE tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground through the turn steadily gaining momentum and continued
willingly inside the pacesetter late but proved only second best. TALE OF V K prompted to a position in second flight, swerved out five wide in early stages,
angled to the inside racing into the stretch and continued with an effort to gain position to the end. MEMORABLE ANGEL tracked the leaders between foes
in second flight, was prompted to advance while angling out four wide nearing the lane and continued evenly in late stages. FEISTY CHI CHI, restless in the
gate, was settled along the inside, saved ground to the lane and passed inside some tiring rivals. GOLDEN NOLE, urged to dispute the pace from the
outset, shifted off the rail nearing the turn pressing the issue between foes into the bend and gave way into the lane. TINK was off slowly, settled outside
foes in the last flight early, raced four wide between rivals to the stretch and proved no threat. TORNERO made brief pursuit of the leaders three deep to the
turn and gave way early. LEARN STORY (DOM) broke slowly, switched out racing into the turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and proved no threat.
R KISS EM GOODBYE, urged to terms outside rivals prompting the pace three wide into the turn, gave way racing into upper stretch then shied inwards in
the lane.

Footnotes
FRERET was guided to the inside leaving the chute while being rated off the second flight, continued under patient handling awaiting an opening leaving the
midway point of the far turn, came through along the rail in upper stretch steadily gathering momentum, angled outside the pacesetter leaving midstretch
and wrested the advantage in time under firm handling. PASSIONFORTREASURE angled to the rail racing to the first turn while gaining a forward placing,
prompted the pace inside a rival for a half, edged clear racing into the far turn to dictate terms past midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the
winner. NAGINI, caught a bit wide into the first turn, tracked off the second flight into the backstretch, steadily gained on the leader three wide racing into the
far turn, continued in that path between foes into the lane but finished evenly late. SPITFIRE SUZIE broke inwards brushing, was held up racing to the first
turn, switched outside foes, then advanced four wide racing into the far turn and continued in that path to late stages in an even effort. STACK SHACK, a bit
reluctant to load, was caught in close quarters while pulling between foes in second flight racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders through the
backstretch, was shuffled back avoiding a tiring foe entering the second bend and couldn't regain contention. TIZNOISE angled to the inside tracking the
leaders as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance while shifting out a bit nearing upper stretch but soon gave way. BLUEJEANLADY settled
along the inside early, switched out entering the backstretch, was caught five wide racing into the far turn and lacked a rally. IMAGINARY FRIEND (IRE)
tracked the leaders three deep in second flight to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes racing into the far turn but came up empty
entering the lane. INHONOROFOWENJR proved no factor. LITTLE MS BROADWAY sped to the lead while shifting off the rail racing to the first turn,
pressed the issue outside a rival for a half, was steadied racing into the far turn and quickly gave out.

Footnotes
ONWARD, forwardly placed between rivals in the opening stages, shifted three wide nearing the turn, pressed the issue in that path to upper stretch and
went clear late under brisk handling. REAL GRACE, bumped at the start, joined the pace outside foes in the opening stages, angled inwards to press the
issue between foes racing through the turn to upper stretch but couldn't match the winner late. BRANCO MARIA was prompted to a forward placing along
the inside, then was rated tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing the lane, shifted out four wide nearing
midstretch and continued with an effort to prevail for a share. MUKULWITZ, urged between foes disputing the pace, angled to the rail racing through the
backstretch pressing the issue into the turn and gave way in late stages. FALKIRK, a bit slow into stride, was settled near the inside, shifted out entering the
lane and improved position between rivals in the closing stages. FIVE STAR COLONEL ducked outwards bumping LUCA DREW THE ACE, switched out
four wide tracking off the second flight racing to the turn and offered no rally. LUCA DREW THE ACE, bumped while being forced into REAL GRACE at the
start, was guided to the inside racing through the backstretch and lacked a rally. DETECTIVE tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages and
soon faded.

Footnotes
PREMIER JUSTICE was urged to the lead prompting the pace along the rail racing into the first turn, continued inside a rival racing through the backstretch,
edged forward racing through the far turn and went clear through the stretch under firm encouragement. MISS LOTUS FLOWER tracked the leaders outside
a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted three deep nearing the lane while moving to challenge, lost some momentum while being
fanned five wide by WILDCAT MERRY racing into the stretch but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. OURHANDSOMEGAL tracked off
the second flight while angling to the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a mild bid to edge rivals for a share on the wire. BROKEN
ENGLISH, held up out of close quarters at the start, was settled off the second flight outside a rival and split foes just off the inside in the closing stages to
make mild progress to the end. LANGUE LIEE was prompted to gain a position just off the leaders while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, tracked
those foes as part of the second flight to the far turn, shifted off the inside racing into the lane while being roused to advance between foes but had no final
bid. REINA LA KELSY, bumped at the start, was settled along the inside and never gained striking distance. BEACHTREASUREGIRL broke outwards
bumping a rival, shifted out four wide racing past the half mile marker but offered no rally. WILDCAT MERRY, reluctant to load, was urged forcing the pace
outside the eventual winner on a narrow advantage racing into the backstretch, continued to dispute the issue losing the advantage racing into the far turn,
then drifted out four wide racing into the lane while quickly dropping out. LINDA BUG was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and
soon trailed.

EXCLUSIVE DONALD broke readily to gain the advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail racing into the turn, then turned back a rival
to go clear through the stretch under some left handed pressure. TOMMY TUESDAY tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages,
angled to the inside racing into the turn and made steady progress inside rivals to prevail for the place honors on the wire. IRON DRILL, off a step slowly,
was settled well off the field to the turn, saved ground on the bend and produced a solid late response racing nearest the rail to just miss for second.
STARSHIP FONZY broke slowly, was settled last outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out gathering momentum racing into upper stretch and split rivals
three deep gaining position to the end. BOLTER exchanged light contact with KING SHAWN at the start, tracked off the second flight racing four wide into
the turn, was fanned five wide in the closing stages but continued with a mild bid. WYATTS WARRIOR settled off the second flight along the inside racing
into the turn and offered no rally. COMPOUND INTEREST was hustled outside foes to gain terms with the pacesetter after the opening quarter, prompted
that rival racing through the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. ESOR tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight, shifted out three
deep racing into the lane but came up empty midstretch. KING SHAWN exchanged bumps at the start, tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight
and steadily faded into the stretch. GALLEON LIGHT raced five wide through the backstretch into the turn and soon retreated. DRILL DOWN WAS
ORDERED TO BE SCRATCHED AT THE GATE.

Footnotes
LADY BREXIT gained a position just off the leaders along the inside stalking those rivals under light rating into the backstretch, came under some prompting
to advance racing into the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out to split foes in the closing stages to prevail in time under firm handling.
SWEET MOOCHIE was settled last in hand to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum switching outside foes racing into the far turn, swung to the six
path entering upper stretch and was going well late while just outkicked by the winner. CLASSY OF COURSE sped to the fore while angling to the rail
leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, maintained the advantage under pressure past midstretch but failed to sustain that
momentum. SUNDRENCHED tracked just off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted out three wide leaving the midway point of the far turn
while being urged to advance, continued in that path into upper stretch but was outkicked. LET'S GO BABY, in touch prompting the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, dueled into the far turn and gave way between foes late. PURO BLANCO tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, shifted
inwards a bit while being urged to advance nearing the lane, steadied entering upper stretch, then shifted five wide in the closing stages but had no final
response. NO SNIVELING was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight and never gained contention. CONGRELLA tracked off the second flight
along the inside to the backstretch but retreated early. WHITEHEELGIRL, held up avoiding close quarters leaving the chute, raced between foes to the
backstretch, angled to the inside after a half but steadily faded. BETTYB, held up avoiding tight quarters leaving the chute, angled to the inside racing to the
first turn and soon trailed.

Footnotes
BUENO BUENO BUENO was rated off the first flight while angling inwards in early stages, was prompted to gain position three deep between foes nearing
the turn, was shuffled a bit when squeezed entering the bend, split foes three deep, and continued with a steady effort in that path to wrest the advantage
and hold rivals on safe margin to the end under pressure. WILL RUNAWAY was urged to press the pace inside rivals in the opening stages, lost some
ground to the pacesetter entering the turn, switched off the inside racing into the lane, then angled to the four path on the closing stages to prevail for the
place honors late. STRIKING HEIR, urged between rivals disputing the pace into the bend, angled nearer to the rail once gaining a clear advantage but
weakened once headed in late stages. WATER PATROL was settled last in the opening stages, split rivals racing into the turn gaining position, angled to
the rail in upper stretch, was steadied in tight quarters late but continued willingly. DEBDURITE, in touch three wide between foes, altered course twice
racing into the turn while making some contact with the eventual winner, then gained some position inside foes in late stages. BIG YES, urged to a forward
placing five wide racing through the backstretch, faded into lane. CREDIT CYCLE tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages, shifted out five
wide on the turn but lacked a late response. ATTACK ZONE settled between foes in early stages, angled out six wide racing through the turn but proved no
threat. WELD retreated early. ZECHARIAH tracked the leader five wide in second flight racing to the turn and gave way after half. FORECASTER proved no

Footnotes
CARAMELITO tracked just off the leaders outside UNCORK THE BOTTLE racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing the lane while being
prompted to advance, was bumped in late stages by UNCORK THE BOTTLE while challenging for command and just edged that rival under brisk right
handed pressure. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out nearing the lane while being urged to
advance between foes making light contact with the eventual winner in late stages but continued grudgingly to the end while just outkicked. VALIANT
VIRTUE, in touch attending a rival's pace racing to the first turn, gained the advantage dictating terms on a narrow margin to the second bend, angled to the
inside while gaining a clear margin, held sway past midstretch but couldn't fend off the top pair late late. MATTY'S EXPRESS was rated off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed final bid.
DANCERONTHEBEACH tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, made some brief progress between foes on the far turn but proved
empty in the drive. KID DRAMA was settled last to the backstretch and proved no threat. FIRST DEGREE tracked off the second flight along the inside, was
prompted to advance along the inside entering the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. STUCK UP, urged along the rail disputing the pace into the
backstretch, gave way abruptly after a half.
