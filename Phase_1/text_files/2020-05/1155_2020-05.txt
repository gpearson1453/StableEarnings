Footnotes
FREEDOM PASSAGE was hard held in the three path on the first turn, leveled out midway down the backstretch then came under urging, advanced near
the seven-sixteenths, stalked three wide on the far turn, took the lead into the stretch, kicked clear under the whip outside the furlong marker and drew away
under steady urging. SWEET LINDA was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace on the inside, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the lead under a
drive into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong then brushed the rail and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. QUICKPAY
was caught in the six path on the first turn then settled on the outside, moved up with a half-mile to run, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two
path on the far turn, dropped back under urging inside the quarter-pole and weakened while clear for the show. INGLENOOK went around the first turn in
the two path, raced just off the pace, chased inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path, floated five wide into the stretch under a left-handed
whip and tired. DARING DAMSEL went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the back, was roused inside the half-mile pole, went five wide on the far
turn and failed to threaten. MY MONEY HONEY went four wide on the first turn, raced just off the pace for a half-mile then retreated. QUEEN OF
CARNIVAL broke out at the start, angled in entering the first turn, saved ground on both bends and was no factor. SHEZA ROCKSTAR went five wide on
the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back while four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final
furlong but walked off.

clear into the final furlong, extended the advantage under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride while much the best. RIBBON

outfinished then caught for the place while clear for the show. GRADYZ KAT dropped back quickly at the start, showed no speed, went three wide on the
turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and improved position. PAULA'S BUDDY was ridden along on the outside,

on the turn then moved to the two path, came out while dropping back in upper stretch and capitulated. ROCK THE DEVIL showed good speed, set the
pace, was challenged by the winner at the seven-sixteenths, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the three-sixteenths and gave way. CROSSTIME
