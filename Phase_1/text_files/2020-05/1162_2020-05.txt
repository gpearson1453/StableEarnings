Footnotes
MOLLY'S GAME was forwardly placed along the inside, waited for racing room just off of the leaders into the turn, was shuffled back behind the tiring FUN
SUCKER at the five sixteenths pole, lost about a length of position before shifting outside of that foe, came into the lane in the two path, rallied to split the
leaders at the three sixteenths pole, then drew off under driving pressure. CATTY KRYS took the turn in the five path and outside of rivals, advanced turning
for home to make a five wide bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an innner rival at the furlong pole while hanging on her left lead, then kept on to
secure place3. BONITA SPRINGS chased three wide before making a three wide bid outside of the dueling leaders at the seven sixteenths pole due to C
ISLANDSURPRISE also making an early bid, dueled around the turn while between rivals, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, then gave
way. C ISLANDSURPRISE made a four wide bid into the turn, vied to upper stretch as CATTY KRYS moved up along side, then weakened between horses
at the three sixteenths pole. SPERLING trailed two wide around the turn, then improved mildly between rivals through the lane. CHECK SIX dueled inside of
multiple rivals through the turn, dug in in upper stretch, but yielded approaching the furlong pole and faded. MARIA ROSE raced far off of the pace in the
four path around the turn, shifted to the seven path through midstretch, then failed to menace. MALEFICENT QUEEN saved ground, but was no factor.
TICKET TO RICHES saved ground while racing in midpack, but to no avail. MORTY had a rank start, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn,
but weakened. FUN SUCKER dueled for the lead outside of CHECK SIX early on, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole, rapidly faded
turning for home, and stopped.

Footnotes
PROUDLY FOUGHT quickly established a clear advantage, took the turn along the inside, then widened in upper stretch when asked for run, and was
driven to the wire. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR was forwardly placed along the inside, rated into the turn allowing another rival to clear off in the place position,
shifted three wide turning for home to be outside of the leaders, and produced a grinding rally through the lane. BIZBY cleared inner and outer rivals to forge
place into the turn, chased the loose leader around that bend, then weakened in deep stretch but held show. MESANGE chased the loose leader in the
three to four path around the turn, then finished evenly. IT'S ALL CASH broke in and bumped a foe at the start, raced far off of the pace in the four to five
path around the turn, came into the lane in the six path and widest of all, then produced a mild rally while shifting inwards through the lane. ANNOULA took
a bump from her outer rival at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace, improved position in upper stretch, but failed to sustain a rally and flattened
out. COCO CABALLO was pushed from the four to the five path around the turn and failed to menace. SUPREME IRENE was off slowly after lunging
inwards at the start, raced far off of the pace in the two to three path and never got involved. REAL LATE trailed in the three path and was no factor. APRIL
ENTRY three to four path, weakened into the turn. CALIKA ROSE saved ground, but weakened. FLAME OF ALBERTA was forwardly placed three wide,
but rapidly faded passing the five sixteenths pole, and stopped.

Footnotes
MISS IS ZIPPY rated off of the pace, shifted two wide around the turn, commenced a rally between horses in midstretch, sustained her bid to catch the tiring
leader at the sixteenth pole, and won going away. SPANISH PEAKS established a clear advantage at the five furlong pole, held a margin in the two path
around the turn, widened away from her chasing foe while in the three path in upper stretch, but tired in deep stretch, was caught at the sixteenth pole, then
held place. MARIPOSA D'ORO stalked two wide, then along the rail around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader passing the five sixtenths pole,
but kept on in deep stretch to secure show. FACTOR AROUND advanced to stalk the pace two wide while staying in the three path and outside of the
leaders, shifted to the five path turning for home, then kept on for a minor reward. COMPLETE SURPRISE raced off of the pace three wide, improved
position and shifted to the six path between horses in upper stretch, then finished evenly. STRONG ODOR had a slow start and trailed the field down the
backstretch, took the turn in the three to four path, then was no factor. LADY O'PRADO advanced in the four path outside of horses through the turn, swung
to the seven path turning for home, but finished evenly. MORE MOET PLEEZ was forwardly placed along the inside early on, but weakened into the turn
and was eased through deep stretch. RAIN DANCE broke outwards to open space, was forwardly placed and chased in the three path around the turn, but
failed to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, stopped in deep stretch, and was eased. LILY CHASER midpack two wide between horses, but weakened
into the turn and was eased through the lane. GOTTA B THE SALSA raced off of the pace four wide, but weakened around the turn, and was eased through
the lane.

Footnotes
CARINA bobbled a bit and had a slow start, saved ground off of the pace before shifting two wide turning for home, sustained a grinding rally through the
final furlong to catch the leader approaching the wire. LOVE MY HONEY rushed after a lack luster beginning to duel for the lead two wide, cleared off from
her inner rival at the five sixteenths pole, widened her advantage in upper stretch, but was worn down and caught in the late stages while well clear of show.
ISABELLE'S JOY swung from the three path to the five path while between horses turning for home and offered a mild kick for show. BOLD ESTHER
showed speed, dueled inside of LOVE MY HONEY early on, but was outpaced by that rival into the turn, shifted to the three path turning for home, but
weakened and was nipped at the wire for show. LEMON DROP TWIST chased two wide while in the three path around the turn, shifted to the four path
turning for home, but had little kick and finished evenly. BOOTS N' BATTLE was no factor from the two path. ALL FACT broke outwards to open space,
raced off of the pace in the three path between horses around the turn, but failed to make an impact. PROMISED FAME broke outwards and squeezed her
out rival, was forward early, but weakened to midpack in the four path into the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and weakened thereafter. TWISTED
EMOTIONS bobbled a bit at the start, advanced along the rail to stalk the pace from the inside at the nine-sixteenths pole, stalked inside of a foe while in the
two path around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch, and stopped. GIANNA'S GIFT saved ground, but to no avail. TIMELY MISS was pinched back at
the start, trailed in the four path around the turn, and never got involved. SHE'S A QUEEN was forwardly placed five wide early on, but weakened at the half
mile pole, and was eased up through the late stages.
