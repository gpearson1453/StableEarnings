Footnotes
DIXIE CAT made the front shortly after the break while pressed by SUPER MISS B HAVEN, remained well clear through the far turn and was under a
steady hand ride in the lane. BEHOLD DE DANCER angled three wide into the far turn to move nearest the winner then could only chase that one home
while clearly best of the others. JAKEALINA moved up three and four wide going to the far turn then gained third past a tiring rival in the lane. SUPER MISS
B HAVEN tracked the winner's early pace three wide and weakened. BELLA'S BLUFF was angled in on the far turn, moved along the rail in the lane and
checked inside the sixteenth marker as a rival drifted in and lost momentum. ROXANNA LYNN was always outrun. MZ JACKIE saved ground and tired.

WITTS DATA LINK lunged at the break, made a quick four wide move to go well clear heading up the backstretch, continued about the four path into the
lane and shook off a rival midstretch to move off again under urging. EYES ON BEHOLD was on the early pace inside TICKER, moved out to take aim at
the winner in upper stretch but could not match strides. TICKER bobbled at the break but quickly recovered to contest the earl pace outside the runnerup
then weakened in the far turn while holding position. GOODNESS CAT steadied behind rivals in the opening furlong to drop back, moved up inside going to
the far turn but had no further rally. HOLIDAY CHIMES saved ground while trailing to the far turn, angled out into the lane and passed beaten ones. SWEET
AS CARO showed brief speed two or three wide and tired. MY AWARD followed the pace four wide and tired.

bid racing two and three wide. P R GOLD MONEY stalked the pace four wide and tired. SWEET COWGIRL prompted the early pace outside G G HOLIDAY
and gave way after a half.

WILD DRIVE tracked the leaders four wide bid into the far turn, continued outside AMERICAN LEAGUE through that bend then moved off in the lane under
confident handling. AMERICAN LEAGUE challenged inside the leaders going up the backstretch to show in front hitting the far turn, dueled the winner into
the lane but could not match strides while saving the place late. GONE PREACHIN moved up while angling four wide into the far turn then went evenly in
the lane and just missed the place late. BUSTER BROWN BOY dueled on the pace inside rivals to late backstretch and weakened. TRASK tracked the
pace from four wide and weakened. MAGNANIMUS MAN dueled from between rivals to the far turn, gave way and dropped back into the lane then returned
bleeding from the nostrils.

Footnotes
MINEFIELD stalked the early pace while five wide out of the first turn, moved four wide to bid through the far turn into the lane and went clear under steady
handling. REVERSALOFFORTUNE was off the early pace outside, rallied four and five wide through the far turn into the lane and closed to gain the place
late. OHTANI tracked the early pace four wide to bid into the far turn and came up empty in the drive. TAYLOR'S PRINCE bumped with a rival at the start,
contested the early pace along the inside and came up empty in the drive. DREAMER'S POINT moved inside through the first turn, made a mild bid in the
far turn to move up but lacked the needed late effort. LIGHT BOUND BID improved position three wide while not a serious threat. MERLO'S LAD showed
early speed three wide and weakened. R DUB bumped with a rival at the start, steadied along the rail late in the first turn and remained back.
THEBOYFROMJERSEY stalked the pace four or five wide and weakened.

Footnotes
THREE FOOTER was with the early pace outside OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY to bid and move clear nearing the lane then held safe late as FLANAGAN made a
late run. FLANAGAN saved ground to move up going to the far turn, bid into the lane and continued to close the gap through the lane. COLOR ME BEHOLD
saved ground to the far turn, angled three wide to move up into the lane just gained the show late. THUNDER BOX stalked the pace four wide and made a
mild late run to just miss the show. OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY was on the early pace racing about the three path and came up empty in the drive. JOMO
followed the pace three or four wide and weakened. WISE RON was away last and failed to threaten three wide. ULTIMATE OLIVER was four and five wide
just off the early pace and weakened from six wide into the lane.

Footnotes
DOBY tracked the early pace three wide to bid into the far turn, was joined by UNSHACKLED CROSS nearing the lane, dueled that one in tight quarters
and went well to hold safe. UNSHACKLED CROSS stalked the leaders four wide to bid outside the winner through the far turn, dueled that one through tight
quarters in the lane and missed. The stewards posted an inquiry and the rider of UNSHACKLED CROSS lodged a claim of foul alleging interference through
the lane which was not allowed. RETALIATED was back off the early pace, moved up four and five wide going to the far turn but lacked a final closing rally
while clear for third. DJINN OF DJIBOUTI was along the inside, moved between rivals with a mild bid going up the backstretch and weakened. KAT DUDE
steadied at the break as the rider avoided a rival throwing his head while coming in, saed ground and and could not threaten late. YE BE JUDGED
contested the early pace two or three wide inside a rival early and weakened in the far turn. LUCK CHECK was not a threat along the inside. MOMENT OF
MAGIC was with the early pace three or four wide and tired. POVERTY FLATS threw his head at the break while coming inward and was always back.

Footnotes
SUPERSTYLE was four and five wide in the first turn, settled outside to stalk the leaders, moved closer three wide to bid through the far turn and rallied
clear under steady handling in the lane. WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT was on the early pace out from the rail and inside a rival, edged clear through the second
turn to make the pace to late in the final turn then could not go with the winner while holding clear for his position. SHAWNEE KID settled off the pace racing
three wide, rallied through the final turn and gained the show late. RENVYLE saved ground while at the back for three quarters, swung out to move six wide
into the lane and gained position. MEDIEVAL MEDICINE saved ground in reach of the pace and weakened in the far turn. VANQUISH stalked the pace four
wide to bid in late backstretch and could not sustain the move. DAZZLE MAN saved ground and failed to mount a bid. RAIN RAY forced the early pace
outside and tired. SERGIOS LIMONCELLO followed the pace three or four wide and tired.
