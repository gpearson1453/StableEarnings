Footnotes
ZYXYZ stalked the pace four and five wide while never far back, challenged through the far turn to bid into the lane and edged clear under moderate urging.
DISTINCT APPROVAL followed the pace from the two or three path inside the leaders, bid through the far turn then could not go with the winner while just
up second late. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY moved to the front early well off the inside about the three and four path, contended to upper stretch and could not hold
position late. CALIFORNIASUMMER stalked the pace in good position three wide but lacked a closing run. JAFMIL'S INFERNO was along the inside
throughout and failed to rally. DIXIE DELTA pressed the pace outside TAYLOR'S BEAUTY to late backstretch and weakened. MONGOL CALL was not a
factor three wide. FOXY TWIST saved ground and tired.

BANDWIDTH stalked the early pace four wide, moved to the leaders through the far turn to bid into the lane and moved clear under steady handling.
WARRIOR'S LULLABY tracked the early leader four wide to bid into the far turn, continued three wide then could not handle the winner in the lane.
BIGSHOT LACEWELL was along the inside and moved up but could not close ground on the top pair. TRASK was four and five wide while lacking a solid
closing bid. ASTONISHING TWEET showed the most early speed out from the rail to make the pace about the two to three path and weakened into the
lane. SPOON BOSS was not a factor.

narrowly as an injured rival crossed the wire. BE MY SHADOW showed the most early speed to make the pace out from the rail, was headed into the lane
then suffered injury inside the sixteenth marker and crossed the wire while pulling up and was vanned off. PICKELJUICE saved ground and weakened.

Footnotes
ROCK CITY ROADHOG tucked in through the first turn to save ground, rallied inside on the far turn then angled outside leaders into the lane and bumped
with DANCE DOCTOR, continued to exchange brushes as that foe came in and slowly edged clear. DANCE DOCTOR stalked the pace four wide to bid into
the lane, bumped as the winner came out into the lane then came in and leaned on that one through the drive. The rider of DANCE DOCTOR lodged a
claim of foul and the stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run. Following a review, no action was deemed necessary in hard ridden stretch run.
LOVETHATCAUSE stalked the early lead inside, bid into the lane but was outfinished by the top pair late. I'M RIVER moved to the front about the three
path, continued to upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. MY BOY LOLLIPOP moved up three and four wide while not a threat. FOR THE HUSTLE
stalked the pace three and four wide, steadied in traffic behind the incident entering the lane and weakened. MALLORY'S BANDIT followed the pace three
wide and weakened.
