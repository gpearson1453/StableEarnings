SHARED set the pace with pressure from RIGGSKI, shook free of that rival while four wide, angled in entering the turn and inched away under hand urging.
RUNAWAY INDY was along the inside to into the turn, saved ground around the bend and edged RIGGSKI for the place honors. RIGGSKI prompted the
pace from the inside, chased the leader outside a rival then three wide into the stretch and was nailed for second. SOUND CHECKERS mid-pack in the
early going, went four wide around the turn and finished willingly three deep at the wire and missed the place. MALIBU MAGIC trailed the field early, then
went between rivals, two wide around the turn, shifted to the inside in upper stretch and improved position. BOB AGAIN in rang between foes, chased from
the inside then two wide into the stretch and flattened in the late stages. SECOND BOLD unhurried up the backstretch, traveled along the inside and proved
no menace. IMPEACHMENT ACE four to five wide around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
CAT'S DESSERT set the pace clear of the field, angled in entering the turn, challenged from BARB'S VALENTINE on the turn, drifted out into the lane, then
responded well in the final furlong to hold the runner-up at bay. BARB'S VALENTINE stalked the pacesetter from the far outside, angled in and ranged up
alongside the leader on the turn, drifted out into the stretch, kept pressure in the drive but lacked the needed late punch. HAPPIER TOGETHER five deep
up the backstretch, moved into the two path on the turn then cut the corner entering the stretch and produced a late rally. IN IT FOR LIFE settled off the rail,
went three wide around the turn and summoned a late rally, finishing best of all in the final sixteenth. SOPRESCIOUS traveled three deep on the
backstretch, pinballed between rivals near the three-eighths pole, went two to three wide around the turn and showed a mild response in the drive. FOR MY
BROTHER tracked the pace from off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and never rallied. CHITTER CHATTER bumped early from the inside, raced
between rivals and got bumped repeatedly near the three-eighths pole, a bit off the rail around the turn and weakened. STELLAR WAY bumped repeatedly
near the three-eighths pole, came four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. FAMILY TRIPS lugged out and bumped rival early, bumped twice
with same rival near the three-eighths pole, checked entering the turn and came up empty in the late stages.
