Footnotes
LEBASI came under some prompting early racing between foes in second flight, was eased back from that position while shifting out after the opening
quarter, was prompted to advance four wide racing through the turn to upper stretch, then angled inside the leaders racing through the stretch to wrest the
advantage in time under steady right handed pressure. BOLTER tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, advanced three, then four wide racing into
the lane while steadily gaining on the pacesetter but was outkicked while prevailing for second. W W ARCHIE gained terms prompting a rival's pace racing
to the turn, edged clear into upper stretch but faltered late. WENDIGO, off a step slowly, was urged to terms inside rivals in the second flight racing through
the backstretch into the turn and continued evenly between foes in late stages. IRON DRILL, a bit outpaced in early stages, angled to the inside, saved
ground to upper stretch to gain some position but made no impact. WYATTS WARRIOR tracked the leaders three deep between foes in second flight racing
to the turn but offered no rally. STARSHIP FONZY broke slowly, settled into stride, angled five wide entering the lane but proved no threat. FRIED
PLANTAINE broke sharply, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace racing into the turn but was spent after a half.

Footnotes
BURNING BRIGHT broke readily to gain a forward placing stalking just outside the pacesetter under firm rating racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
wrest the advantage racing through the far turn, went clear while shifting to the inside racing into upper stretch, then made the balance of the pace under
firm hand urging and some left handed pressure to maintain a safe advantage. VICARAGE, reserved last racing a bit off the inside to the backstretch,
shifted outside foes entering the far turn and made a steady three wide advance to close the gap on the winner late. DRAMA CHORUS broke sharply,
angled to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, lost the advantage midway through the bend, shifted out while being roused to
maintain terms with the winner but gave way midstretch. OUR MAN LUKE tracked the leaders four wide, then three deep as part of the second flight racing
to the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. FIT FOR A KING tracked the leaders three deep between foes in second flight into the backstretch, then
gave way racing into the far turn. BIG PERM tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight but steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
DONNIE BRASCO, off a beat slow, tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted out five wide after a half advancing on the
leaders, pressed the issue four wide through the far turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch and edged clear through late stages under brisk left handed
pressure. IRISH MAIL tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, shifted to the four path entering the backstretch, was urged to bid for command
three deep between foes racing through the far turn, lost some ground to the leaders racing into the lane but continued with interest to edge a rival for the
place honors late. SILENT MISCHIEF, in touch attending a rival's pace under firm rating racing to the backstretch, was prompted to press the issue between
foes racing into the far turn, contested the lead inside the winner into upper stretch but weakened late. SOMETHING BIRD came through tight quarters at
the start, then was a bit rank racing into the first turn while held up just off the second flight, shifted three deep nearing the lane and split foes to gain some
position while no real threat. HALEL tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted to the three path on the backstretch to lodge a brief bid
between foes nearing the far turn but soon gave way. BRANDY CHASER broke outwards bumping YADI, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a
narrow advantage into the backstretch, dueled inside foes racing into the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. YADI, bumped at the start, was
righted to track off the first flight inside foes to the backstretch but steadily faded racing into the far turn. ENDURING ARCH, squeezed back out of tight
quarters just after the start, switched outside foes racing to the backstretch but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
TOTALLY PERFECT, reserved in last in the opening stages while switching outside the field, commenced a steady, four wide advance racing through the
turn, then continued in that path to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. VIVAMENTE, four wide in second flight in the opening
stages, angled inwards nearing the turn to prompt a rival's pace, pressed the issue nearing the lane to go briefly clear in upper stretch but was collared
nearing the wire. HYPERLOOP, unhurried three deep between in second flight tracking the leaders into the turn, moved to challenge for command in that
path racing into the lane but had no late kick. DRIVE IN tracked off the second flight inside foes through the backstretch, swung out four wide entering the
lane and continued to improve position. RIDGELYSREDHOT tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, was urged to advance racing into the turn
but came up empty nearing the lane. SIDNEY SUE, off a bit slowly, settled along the inside and never gained contention. WORKINONBEINSINGLE, urged
forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset, shifted to the inside once gaining a clear advantage, dueled inside a rival on the turn and gave way into the
lane. WEE MS. BURNZIE vied briefly for command inside foes in the opening quarter but gave way early.

Footnotes
CALYPSO KEY was prompted to gain a forward placing while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter inside a rival under light
rating, came through inside that foe advancing to challenge, tipped outside MARCHENWALD racing through the stretch and just edged that foe in time
under firm handling. The latter gained a position stalking just off the leader under rating racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced between foes to wrest
the advantage nearing upper stretch, angled inwards once gaining the advantage and just failed to contain the winner. BIG LIZ, reserved between foes in
the last flight, briefly awaited an opening racing through the far turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and made a belated rally. DONNAMEUP,
steadied in close quarters in early stages, settled along the inside, steadied again racing past the five furlong marker, came through some close quarters on
the far turn, swung six wide entering the lane and made some mild progress. V K LEGACY, caught in close at the start, tracked off the second flight
between foes, angled four wide nearing the lane but had no rally. ENOUGH KISSES settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, made brief progress
three wide entering the far turn to lodge a bid nearing the lane but soon flattened out. DRAMATONE settled between foes racing to the backstretch, was
fanned wide into the lane while never gaining contention and was gathered up late. MIGHTY ELECTRICA tracked off the first flight inside rivals to the far
turn and gave way nearing the lane. GET BACK HOME, caught in close quarters at the break, was held up along the inside and failed to menace.
BETTERTHENYOURX, pulling against restraint while shifting off the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing just off the
rail to the second bend and gave way into the stretch.

RATTLESNAKEROSE angled inwards in early stages stalking the pacesetter under light reserve, was prompted to wrest the advantage racing through the
turn, shifted out while opening a comfortable advantage racing into upper stretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under firm handling. NIKKI
BELLA, bumped at the start, quickly recovered to track the leaders outside foes in second flight, was prompted to advance three deep between foes on the
turn, shifted four wide entering the lane and continued willingly to close the gap. FIELD LETTERS, reserved last in the opening stages, shifted outside foes
nearing the bend, was prompted to advance four wide between foes on the turn, angled inside entering the lane and continued willingly between rivals while
being just outkicked by the top pair. I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE tracked the leaders three deep between in second flight, shifted inwards on the turn, was urged to
bid three deep between foes entering the lane but was outkicked. CULTURAL MANDATE sped to the lead while angling to the rail, set the pace on a narrow
margin to the bend, dueled for command on the turn and gave way. CHECOTAH tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight but faded early. SUPER

Footnotes
TALK TO THE MEDIA moved readily to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, repelled a rival's challenge to go
clear racing into the lane and widened late under firm encouragement. IRISH MAJOR angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight under light rating,
shifted out three wide nearing the lane but proved only second best. GO HIPPO GO gained terms prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the
issue on the far turn and gave way into the lane. REAL ESTATE MOGUL was rated off the second flight in the opening half, then split foes racing into the
lane while continuing evenly. PROMETHEAN settled inside rivals in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the stretch and
gained some position while making no real impression. WHISTLE ME HOME tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted three wide while
making a brief bid midway through the far turn but soon emptied out. DELTA LEVY, held up while taking an awkward step between foes in early stages,
angled to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground throughout but had no closing bid. DONE ACTING was settled outside foes in the last flight
early and never gained contention. CIRCLE AWAY tracked off the second flight outside foes and dropped out early. HARV WON'T TAP was settled
between foes in the last flight and dropped out last.

Footnotes
BETWEENHEREANDCOOL was rated outside foes tracking just off the first flight, advanced three wide entering the turn to wrest the advantage racing into
upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. SUM OVERTURE angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes just off the inside, shifted
out four wide on the turn, was fanned five wide between foes in late stages but narrowly prevailed for second. GAME DAY DRAMA was urged to the lead
from the break, dictated the pace on a narrow margin off the rail through the backstretch, couldn't contain the winner's bid leaving the turn, then shifted out
racing through the lane contesting second but just missed. JAIDEN'S BEST settled between foes dropping off the second flight, split rivals just off the inside
in late stages and was just outkicked for share. UNSPOILED MOMENTS, reserved last, gained some position between foes just off the inside racing
through the turn, then angled to the rail entering the stretch to improve position late. THE GREAT LOUDINI tracked off the second flight outside foes, was
fanned six wide into the lane and gained some position in an even effort. TIZ SAMURAI, in touch from the outset, attended a rival's pace under rating racing
to the turn, was urged to make a brief bid between foes but proved empty in the drive. THE WAYNE FACTOR was settled between foes in the last flight
early and failed to menace. SEVENTYSEVENWILOW tracked the leaders four wide off the second flight and gave way into the turn. CRAZY FRANK C
proved no factor. RED ROSE CAT angled in to track just off the flight between rivals racing to the turn and gave way abruptly after a half. ALLEGIANCE, off
step slowly, angled to the inside early but soon retreated.

Footnotes
THE CONNECTOR bobbled at the start, was quickly righted to track the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch,
continued under patient handling through the far turn, came through inside the pacesetter to wrest command racing into upper stretch and held EMPTY
HOLSTER safe to the end under firm right handed pressure. The latter was reserved outside foes dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, was
prompted split foes three deep making contact with ANDREZ CONQUEST racing into the far turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued willingly to close the gap. BURL tracked off the second flight along the inside under rating, angled out five wide racing through the lane and
improved position. K'S FUNHOUSE was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and made some mild progress late. HEY
SACH sped to the fore, dictated the pace along the rail through the far turn, drifted out entering upper stretch and gave way. CARL G tracked the pacesetter
three deep as part of the second flight and faded between foes into the lane. APPRAISED tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, was urged
to lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn but soon gave way. DISCO'S BRIDGE, reserved off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch,
offered no rally. TINKER'S PAL ducked in at the start, was settled well off the field and proved no threat. ANDREZ CONQUIST tracked the leaders outside
foes off the second flight for a half, was bumped while being forced wide racing into the far turn and quickly gave way.
