WHENDUCKSFLY broke slow but hustled up inside rivals to take the lead, edged away to the turn, was two then three wide to the stretch, responded
determinedly through the late stages and held on desperately. CONTINENTAL UNION pressed the winner to the turn, was fanned out four deep to the
stretch then responded in the drive, closed fast but was too late. LUCK IS MY NAME had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch and closed the
gap without threatening. JAMASON was outsprinted, saved ground to the stretch but also did not threaten. JAZZ STREET was outsprinted early, drifted four
wide on the turn and lacked a closing response. MULZOFF chased the top two from the rail to the stretch then weakened.

LIFE IS A TRIP broke alertly, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, responded when set down for the drive and dug in gamely to hold off BOLD ROMAN by
a whisker. BOLD ROMAN pressed the winner from the rail to the stretch, was in a bit tight in mid stretch, checked and angled out for room then closed
steadily and just missed. THREE RED SEVENS had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch, eased out in upper stretch and offered a late bid without
threatening the top two. A NEW TREND stalked the pace to the turn, made a bid three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
OOPPER WALLAH had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. JASON X L was chasing to the turn, got fanned
four wide to the stretch then also weakened. RED CLEM was outsprinted, came four wide into the turn then eased down to the two path into the stretch but
came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SHOT OF A LIFETIME pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to get to terms into the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then dug in
determinedly to hold. WICKED OLD FASHION trailed to the second turn, came three then four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, finished willingly
and got the nod for second. UBER STAR was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, rallied in the
drive and just missed second. I DECLARE WAR set the pace from the rail to the second turn, was overtaken by the winner in mid stretch and outfinished.
NOWHERE MAN prompted the action to the half, saved ground to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. UNLAWFUL ACT was rank off heels to the
first turn, steadied and angled out then never seemed comfortable and was not a factor.

SURELY A SMILE was well placed off the leader to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, rallied when set down, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held
under steady urging. GET'EM TIGER was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. CONNIE'S PROMISE
had no speed, was in the two path on the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch, could not impact the top two but bested the others. LOUS TIZNOW
chased the pace three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. THUNDERBOLT S. had no speed, swung out five wide into the
stretch but did not threaten in the drive. SHE'S GOT HEART pressed NIP NAP two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and tired. NIP NAP
pulled to the lead, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then gave way.

HOPSCOTCHY chased the leaders to the turn, was two wide then eased out for room into the stretch, rallied when set down, pushed to the front in mid
stretch and held under steady urging. COASTAL STARLITE had no speed, raced off the rail on the turn then finished well between rivals for the place.
SITTIN AND THINKIN stalked the pace to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied when asked, was outfinished for the win and bested late for
the place. THANKS hustled and dueled outside of TOP HAT HIGH JINKS to the stretch, was collared nearing mid stretch and weakened. RAMONCITA
LIGHT was also stalking to the turn, came two then three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS hustled to contest the
pace inside of THANKS, was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. SHEZ A GRINDER had no speed and was not a factor.

REV REE never far back to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, dueled AROUSE N GO to mid stretch then disposed of that one and held on
late. CHARLIE'S BELLE was allowed to settle to the half, raced two wide to the stretch, eased out for room and finished willingly for the place. AROUSE N
GO stalked the pace to the second turn, bid inside and dueled the winner to mid stretch then was outkicked and lost second late. SNOW PACK was settled
to the half, bid three wide on the far turn and was gaining steadily in the drive. AUTISM'S QUEST had no speed, trailed to the second turn, got fanned four
wide to the stretch and was also making up ground belatedly. SHAKE IT CALI was also allowed to settle for a half mile, raced two wide on the second turn
but lacked the needed late response. MUSKETIER WALTZ had no speed and was never a threat. SEIZE THE CHANCE was rank and pulled the rider to the
lead, edged away to the half but tired after six furlongs and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
RESTRAINEDVENGENCE was outside of the runnerup while a pace factor from the outset, bid three wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch, could
not shake loose but dug in gamely to get the nod. KIWI'S DREAM (AUS) set the pace under pressure from the winner for five furlongs, responded when
hooked in mid stretch, was brave to the line and just missed. CAMINO DEL PARAISO stalked the top two to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch,
got outkicked to mid stretch, finished evenly but saved the show. BUILDER was allowed to settle to the second turn, came two then three wide to the stretch
then could not make an impact on the top two but was gaining steadily on CAMINO DEL PARAISO for third. PREMIUM FOREST was settled to the second
turn then saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. BOLD ENDEAVOR had no speed and was never a factor. ENGRAM
also had no speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
ARGOSY FLEET was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide while rallying to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held driving. MY
FRIEND TONY was outsprinted also, raced off the rail to the stretch, had traffic issues in upper stretch, waited for clearance then rallied steadily for the
place. CARTOONIST set the pace from the rail to the stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch and was tagged late for second. MIDNIGHT DESTINY
had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. MY LUCKY MARK was chasing to the turn, came three wide to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. LOVENSEEK was chasing the leader to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong.
QUICK AND SILVER pressed the pace two wide to the stretch then tired. AWESOME SILVER gave a dull effort.

Footnotes
GOLDEN DELIGHT broke clean and was close up to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held under steady
urging. KHALEESIS DRAGON had no speed, was two then three wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch and finished steadily for second. TRULY
FABULOUS was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two. SHELBY R. had good speed, dueled from the rail
to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. RUNNIN DIVA got outrun to the turn then saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response.
ALITTLE BIT TECHIE hustled to be a pace factor two wide to the stretch but tired through the drive. SHEZJUSTINTHYME gave a dull try.
