Footnotes
POPPY'S OATS was allowed to settle early, moved up three wide at the quarter pole, angled five wide through the lane and just got up in his final stride
under strong handling. REBEL RUMBLE was unhurried early, raced four wide into the lane and just missed in a game effort. VIVACE pressed the pace and
weakened while racing two deep. MIDNIGHT DRAMA showed good speed from the inside and weakened. GET COUNTRY stalked the pace, saved ground
through the stretch, lacked racing room nearing the eighth pole and had not enough late. SAZERAC REMEDY stalked the pace and weakened. SMILIN
CAT was off slowly, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. GOSPEL MOTOVATION was slow early and never threatened. TIGER
TREATS raced seven deep in the lane and never was a factor.

Footnotes
TIN CAN ALLIE showed good speed from the outside, raced two deep and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. A FAST BROAD was allowed to
settle early, raced towards the inside, angled to the four path through the stretch and finished second best. JUST WHAT I NEEDED was off slowly, saved
ground and showed good late interest. D' CINNAMON GIRL stalked the pace, raced four wide in the drive and had no final bid. WINNING BELLS stalked
the pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no rally. LUCKY ROAD was allowed to settle early and failed to respond. INDELLIBLY dropped back
early and never threatened. TWILIGHT GLOW raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MY PASSWORD showed good speed and
gave way. ONE RING was slow early and never threatened.

Footnotes
EREBUNI showed good early speed, raced two deep and prevailed late under all out pressure. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY pressed the pace, raced three deep
and missed in a game effort. TAPINDEED stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide through the lane and kept on to the wire. COLLEGE QUEEN
was allowed to settle early, raced three wide and showed good late interest. CASTANUELA (MEX) stalked the pace, raced five wide into the lane and had
not enough. SHIP SHAPE MISS settled off the early going, saved ground and had no response. HEY ROXY was unhurried early, raced three wide through
the stretch and had not enough late. ASSEMBLED LADY stalked the pace, raced five wide through the drive and had no response. BATTLE CHIC failed to
have a response. CANELA CALIENTE was off slowly and never was a factor. MY HOLIDAY showed little. SASSY BOX raced five deep into the upper
stretch and never was a factor. PER RULING #20-WRD-047 FROM THE OKLAHOMA RACING COMMISSION, EREBUNI WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st
