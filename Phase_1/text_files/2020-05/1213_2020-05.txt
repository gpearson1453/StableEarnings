Footnotes
NUMEROLOGIST pursued the leader from outside early then between runners four wide into the turn, shifted in gradually through that bend reaching just
off the rail by the three-sixteenths, bid inside the weakening leader in upper stretch, edged clear late. DAKOTA was unhurried and switched outside rivals
heading up the backstretch, was five abreast into the turn moving in about a path on that bend, bid in upper stretch putting a short head in front, drifted in
just a bit nearing the sixteenth pole but and was outkicked by the winner. SEXY DEXY set the pace in the clear racing removed from the fence, went in the
two to three path through the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch while just starting to weaken, was in just a hair tight as DAKOTA drifted in but continued
to weaken. HANDSOME LAD chased in behind and briefly between rivals early, dropped back entering the turn and appeared to have a little trouble
cornering early on that bend going in the three to four path, came out six wide into the stretch and came again late. QUINCY EXPRESS was in behind the
leaders racing on or just off the rail up the backstretch and through the turn, came out three to four wide in upper stretch and ran on mildly. TOM T WHO
was forwardly-positioned three wide and between runners up the backstretch, began to drop back on the turn and had no rally. LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM
raced on or just off the rail and was never a threat. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
PEACEOUTYOURHONOR was a bit fractious entering the gate, tucked in behind rivals in the four path leaving the backstretch, maintained that ground
early on the turn before angling out seven deep coming past the three-sixteenths, bid in upper stretch, struck the lead a sixteenth out and edged away.
PRINCESS JADA was bumped at the break, settled into stride before advancing outside foes six wide into and on the turn, took a narrow lead at the
three-sixteenths, was overtaken at the sixteenth pole but second best. PREMED was bumped into a rival at the start, pressed the pace going five wide
through the turn, lacked the needed late kick. VERY CHERRY was lacking in early speed, urged along two wide on the turn, continued to improve from that
path in the lane but needed more. ARTISTIC MINISTRY was forwardly-placed contending from inside foes on or just off the rail, weakened in the stretch.
MEGAN'S REVENGE broke outwardly bumping a rival, went in behind foes two to three wide on the turn, shifted six wide into the stretch and ran on.
ROLLWITHTHEMUSIC contested the pace inside rivals but well off the fence in about the four path into the turn, continued wide on that bend, gave way
once in the stretch. PERFECTUS was bumped into a rival at the start, raced well back outside rivals early, went in the three to four path on the turn and was
never a threat. FEISTY HALO showed brief foot from between runners then chased briefly near the inside and was not a threat. LITTLE RED RUBY chased
briefly from outside, started dropping back in the five path on the turn and faded.

KNUCKLE BALL chased in behind the leaders up the backstretch moving inside then back out a bit, went in the three to four path through the turn still in
behind the leaders, came out a bit turning for home, ran on strongly late inside BACK SEAT HERO to get up in time. BACK SEAT HERO pressed the pace
from between foes then outside going four then three wide on the turn and in striking distance, angled out past the furlong marker as a rival came past
outside, and kept on late. KRIS WHO was forwardly-positioned inside foes up the backstretch, edged clear on the turn from the two path, ran on evenly in
the stretch. CHERRY WAY settled off the leaders, advanced inside a foe then outside rivals four deep through the turn, struck the lead by the head of the
stretch, moved clear in mid-stretch then went awry near the wire, was pulled up just past the finish and vanned off. R H EXPRESS was between rivals at the
rear early, went three wide on the turn, improved position. CUIDANDO got away a length slowly, raced outside foes at the back, went four wide on the turn,
struck a foe past the wire and lost the rider, was later caught and vanned off. HUNTER ROCKS saved ground to no avail. ONE KEY chased from outside
five wide through the turn, dropped back and faded. PACK 'N GOLD showed brief speed from between rivals to contest the early pace two wide heading up
the backstretch, steadily dropped back and faded. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
SHUG'S BEST set the early tempo while far wide, continued to vie outside when joined by two inside foes, went four wide on the turn, regained command in
upper stretch, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging nearing the sixteenth pole and just lasted. LET IT ROLL raced in behind the leading trio off the fence,
went in the three path on the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, attempted to find room and was carried out a bit near the sixteenth pole, continued
gamely but missed. FLIGHT SONG vied between runners going two to three wide on the turn, kept on well in the lane but was simply outfinished. TO
SATISFY YOU was taken up after the start when in tight between runners, settled last but one, entered the turn three wide and was asked for more,
gradually shifted to the five path on that bend, reached striking distance in mid-stretch, was carried out a bit near the sixteenth pole and lacked the needed
late kick and was vanned off. SCARLET STREAK was squeezed back at the start, trailed unhurriedly racing well off the inside, went in the four path into the
turn emerging six deep and passed tired rivals. BALLINOUTTACONTROL tracked inside a rival a few lengths back of the leaders, continued on or just off
the rail through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and had no rally. SHEZA DANDY R F vied inside to the top of the stretch then gave way. Following a
stewards' inquiry into the stretch no action was taken.

Footnotes
BELLAMY BLING was close into the first turn then took back and shifted in, dropped back heading up the backstretch, was still unhurried two to three wide
on the far turn, swung eight deep out of that bend now under urging, drove past late. JEDI WARRIOR raced three to four wide off the early leader on the first
turn, took closer order early up the backstretch contending between runners, was carried out a bit after going three to four wide and between runners on the
far turn, emerged with a narrow lead in upper stretch, lugged in a brushed a rival near the sixteenth pole. BUBBA NIGHTLINGER set the pace in the clear
but getting out a bit on the first turn going in the two to three path on that bend, was joined by outside foes early up the backstretch, contended inside foes
but again removed from the rail into the far turn drifting out a bit late on that bend, was brushed lightly near the sixteenth. KING LEBRON attended the pace
from outside going four to five wide through both turns and lacked the needed late kick. ALMOST A STORM was caught outside foes five to six wide into the
first turn then eased back and shifted in a couple paths, moved nearer still the inside up the backstretch going two deep through the far turn and nearly in
striking distance but had no late bid. PLEASE DO TELL was slow to gather and lacking speed, raced mostly in the three to four path, edged a bit closer on
the far turn but made no bids. NAVARONE SANTASONG was hard to load, raced three to four wide well back and was not a threat. SEND THE STORM
was caught outside the pacesetter two to three wide on the first turn, shifted in late on that bend, tracked from inside then came up empty. Following an
objection by the rider of BUBBA NIGHTLINGER against JEDI WARRIOR alleging interference the latter was disqualified from second and placed third
behind the former.
