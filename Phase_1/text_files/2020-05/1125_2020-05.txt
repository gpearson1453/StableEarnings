Footnotes
TASTE'S LEGEND rated off the fast fractions, bid two then three wide on the second turn, blew to the lead in mid stretch and was clear under a hand ride.
PAPA DO RUN pressed the pace to the backstretch, pushed up to engage for the lead, dueled two wide to the stretch then was no match for the winner but
had enough of a cushion to save the place. TEQUILA BLANCO was settled for five furlongs, saved ground to the stretch then could not impact the winner
and was too late for second. CLASSIC CHAMP had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then also was not a threat late. HERDSMAN had no speed and
was always outrun. FORT YORK hustled to the front, was collared nearing the half, dueled from the rail for six furlongs then was outkicked and tired. DYF
had no speed, settled to the second turn, stopped after six furlongs then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
CASH FOR CASS rated off the quick leader, responded when asked for more into the second turn, pushed away to mid stretch and held while in hand late.
BEYOND PLEASURE was settled to the half, shifted off the rail on the second turn then could not impact the winner but was an easy second. SKEETER
DAVIS had no speed, settled for a half mile, came two wide to the stretch then could not threaten in the drive. MOSCATO GIRL also was allowed to settle
off the fast pace, bid three then four wide on the second turn but finished evenly in the drive. TIKI BAR LOGIC sped to a clear lead for a half mile, was
overtaken by the winner into the stretch and gave way. STORMY MIST had no speed and was never a factor. FANTASTIC SECRET chased the pace to the
second turn, made a brief try three wide but tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
ZIARAH (IRE) was outsprinted to the backstretch then was pushed up closer leaving the five eighths, briefly was stuck behind a rival into the second turn
but eased off the rail into the stretch, rallied to the front and held driving. MORNING CYNN set a pressured pace for six furlongs, met the winner's bid in mid
stretch, stayed gamely to deep stretch before giving way. GETTIN SIDEWAYS trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but could not threaten
the top two. IMPERIAL CREED tracked the leaders to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response.
BLAZINBEAUTY also was tracking the pace while in the two path throughout then weakened in the drive. CREATIVE ROMANCE pressed the pace three
wide to the half, was two wide on the second turn then tired through the lane.

I AM ALLTHATYOUARE chased the leader three wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid stretch then pushed away in the final furlong. KIND OF
GALLANT was quick and raced clear to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then was tiring, got overtaken by the winner in mid stretch and just saved the
place by a whisker. INQUISITION had no speed, came two wide to the stretch then was closing on KIND OF GALLANT for second. DYNAMIC DUO also
had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch then was also finishing well but missed a placing. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER got outsprinted early, came three
then four wide to the stretch and lacked a closing response. I'LL DASH FOR GOLD was chasing the leader early, got fanned out to the four path on the turn
and weakened in the stretch. BONA FORTUNA stalked the pace to the turn, was outkicked to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
REGINELLA never far away to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch then inched away under steady urging. MOMMY ROSE
had no speed, shifted out four wide on the turn then was widest in the drive and made a late run for the place. BAKO SWEETS attended the pace inside of I
LOVE ROMANCE, saved ground to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was outkicked. I LOVE ROMANCE hustled to duel for the lead outside of
BAKO SWEETS, responded to pressure to mid stretch then had the rider lost his whip and was also outfinished. BRILLIANT BIRD stalked the leaders two
wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was finishing evenly. LUCKY ANTARES was chasing to the turn then saved ground to no avail. SARI'S
TIGER broke a bit slow and was slow to find a comfortable stride and was never a threat.
