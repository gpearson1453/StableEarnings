Footnotes
WHOVILLE stalked in the five path before inching forward to vie four wide into the turn, forged an advantage turning for home, but came inwards while
clearing inner rivals in upper stretch, then held position to the wire under driving pressure. MY BETS was off slowly, trailed along the inside, shifted to the
four path turning for home, then to the six path in midstretch to produce a late kick, but was belated. CAVATICA had a rank start and was rank behind
horses early on, commenced a rally in the five path outside of rivals at the five sixteenths pole, made a bid at the furlong pole while drifting inwards, but did
not have enough and got outfinished for place. SLAINTE made a five wide bid turning for home, but was outfinished between horses late. EVERY SINGLE
DAY was in range of the leaders two wide between horse into the turn, split AMERICAN VALUES and WHOVILLE turning for home to make a three wide

Footnotes
CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR) lunged inward at the start, but was urged along inside of rivals to achieve forward positioning early on, and again into the first turn,
was forwardly placed two wide between horses behind the early leader down the backstretch, shifted to the three path at the five sixteenths pole to make a
bid for the lead outside of the dueling leaders turning for home, kicked clear from those inner rivals at the furlong pole, and held safely to the wire. WITEZ
stalked along the inside, rated in the pocket around the far turn, waited for racing room behind the leaders in upper stretch, switched out at the furlong pole
after CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR) kicked clear, then offered a late kick to forge place late while gaining slightly on the leader in deep stretch. ELLA BRILLA
prompted the pace setter from the two path, made a two wide bid for the lead the five sixteenths pole, forged a sight advantage from her inner foe in upper
stretch while being hounded by CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR), but was outkicked and no match for that foe at the furlong marker. FIRST COURSE saved ground
while far off of the pace and produced a mild late rally. QUEEN BRIDGET was caught three wide in midpack around the first turn, came into the lane in the
four path, but lacked any kick. PRANKED set the pace along the inside, dug in turning for home as multiple foes made bids, but yielded at the furlong pole.
SECURE CONNECTION saved ground before shifting to the two, then three, path around the far turn, but lacked a kick through the lane. PANTERITA failed
to get involved while in the two path. I WAS LOOKING UP advanced slightly outside of horses in the three to four path around the far turn, came into the
lane in the six path, but flattened out and weakened. ELUSIVE RIDE showed little. SHELLEY'S GEM was off slowly after breaking in the air, pulled her way
forward to prompt the pace from the three to four path around the first turn, but came under a drive into the far turn, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
ROYAL FLAG tracked from midpack in the two path, inched forward around the far turn to make a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, built a clear
lead in upper stretch, drifted out when the rider switched to left handed pressure inside the furlong pole, causing SARACOSA to shy outwards despite being
clear and no contact being made, flopped back to her left lead when corrected at the sixteenth pole, then drfited out again approaching the wire, and kept
her counterpart at bay in the late stages. SARACOSA advanced in the two path to striking position behind the leaders turning for home, tipped out in upper
stretch, rallied, but shied outwards when ROYAL FLAG drifted out approaching the sixteenth pole, flopped back to her left lead while recovering, kicked on,
but subtly shied again from her drifting for approaching the wire. SARA SEA prompted the pace setter two wide, vied into the far turn, but was no match for
the eventual winner in upper stretch, then held show late. CASH OUT stalked along the inside, but was shuffled back at the five sixteenths pole as MORE
ROSES weakened, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, then kept on for a minor reward. INDY UNION was bumped between horses at the start, trailed
the field to the far turn, advanced slightly in the five path around that bend, but flattened out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MORE ROSES built a
clear lead while staying in the two path early on, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole and weakened. SUBIACO was caught five wide around the first
turn, four wide around the far turn, and failed to factor. FINAL CUT was three wide between horses while off of the pace through the first turn, then failed to
get involved. CALF MOON BAY stalked three wide while inthe four path around the first turn, but weakened at the half mile pole and steadily faded around
the far turn. RAZEENA was off a bit slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, but weakened, and stopped late.

Footnotes
CAVALRY CHARGE set the pace inside a duo of rivals, drew clear from those foes turning for home, then widened his advantage through the lane under
driving pressure. REIGNING SPIRIT bumped with BARBARONI at the start, raced far off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, took a while to find
stride after being put to a drive into the far turn, but responded turning for home while four wide between horses, switched out to the five path in upper
stretch, quickened to forge place between rivals approaching the sixteenth pole, then gamely fended off FREEDOM'S FLIGHT to the wire for that position.
FREEDOM'S FLIGHT trailed early on in the two path, swung to the six path turning for home, rallied outside of rivals, but was denied place in the late
stages. CLEVELAND SIMPSON was forwardly placed while caught four wide around both turns, made a bid for place turning for home after the leader
cleared away, but drifted inwards in upper stretch, then weakened at the furlong pole. WIN D'ORO stalked along the inside, waited for racing room through
the far turn, shifted off of the rail approaching the furlong pole, but lacked a bid and weakened. GHOSTLORE raced three wide between horses, cut down to
the rail turning for home, but lacked a rally. AHNAF saved ground around the far turn, but to no avail. HILLBILLY DELUXE was caught in the four to five path
around the first turn, then advanced subtly in the five path around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. OPUS NORTH was never involved.
VASARIANO vied two wide between horses to the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. INDIAN SPRINGS bumped foes on both sides at the start, saved
ground far off of the pace, and failed to make an impact. BARBARONI bumped with REIGNING SPIRIT at the start, vied three wide to the far turn, but
weakened between horses turning for home.
