Footnotes
BATTALION tracked the pace three wide, challenged outside NATHAN'S SECRET and HUSHED HIJINKS turning for home, wrested command and moved
clear past the furlong marker, drifted out and had just enough to hang on. SCANNO saved ground in easy striking range for six furlongs, tipped to the
four-path at the top of the lane, rallied steadily outside BATTALION and just missed. KARAMOJO raced well back early, began to advance four then five
wide leaving the far turn, and rallied mildly. MY BOY BLUE bumped with NATHAN'S SECRET at the start, went along in the second flight toward the inside
to the stretch, and finished one-paced. HUSHED HIJINKS prompted the pace two wide early, bid between horses on the far turn, and stayed on to the
furlong grounds before giving way. NATHAN'S SECRET bumped with MY BOY BLUE at the start, went up to get the lead, rated along through a
manageable pace for six furlongs, and weakened on the rail. TIME FOR TROUBLE tired in the two-path before reaching the stretch. RESERVIST steadied
along keyed up through the stretch the first time, moved outside on the first turn, and was empty when roused.

Footnotes
BIG DADDY DAVE sped to the front at once, shook off OMAHA CITY and TRICK SHOT in the two-path approaching the stretch, and was kept busy to stay
comfortably in command on his left lead. BOOMER brushed with TRICK SHOT at the start, raced three then four wide around the turn, and finished well to
best the others. FULMINI was outsprinted two wide early, cut the corner into the stretch and rallied mildly on the rail. MY LIBERTY broke a step slow and
was well back toward the inside for three furlongs, and improved position while a bit green through the lane. OMAHA CITY was late coming on the track due
to a shoe repair, pursued BIG DADDY DAVE from outside, and tired in the stretch. TRICK SHOT chased outside the early leaders, and tired after three
furlongs. SHOOTING broke slowly and was always far back. GRUNTLED could not keep up around the turn, and drifted out extremely wide at the top of the
stretch. SALT LIFE FOR ME veered out sharply at the start, was outsprinted to the turn and dropped far back.

Footnotes
NOWITNA RIVER closed in around the turn three wide, caught NOTHINS FREE from outside 70 yards out and edged away. GRACE'S DRAMA was outrun
toward the inside to the stretch, came off the rail late and got past a spent NOTHINS FREE to get second. NOTHINS FREE took over inside DURLYN
midway up the backstretch, widened to a lengthy advantage through sharp middle fractions, and gave way late on the rail. TROPICALITY advanced inside
around the turn, but flattened out through the stretch. KINDHEARTED KOTA was no factor three wide. MYFRANCESCA was finished early inside. DURLYN
was on a clear lead leaving the chute, got overtaken by NOTHINS FREE soon after completing a quarter-mile, and stopped before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
NORTH BROADWAY was a bit keen while on hold off the early leaders, ranged up willingly three wide after six furlongs, took over through mid stretch
under a drive and drew off. AMERICAN GODDESS prompted the pace, came off the rail near the quarter-pole to challenge between horses, could not kick
with the top one through upper stretch while lugging in slightly, and saved the place inside rivals. STARSHIP MALLOMAR swung three wide at the top of the
stretch with aim at the front flight, shifted in and finished evenly between horses. LOVELY LUCKY raced in the second flight around the turns two wide,
moved out and rallied mildly. WINNIPEG WONDER set the pace inside, and gave way in upper stretch. UNDER THE OAKS bumped with MY LIPS ARE
SEALED at the start, was outrun for six furlongs, and improved on the rail without threatening. MOONLIT FANTASY stumbled a stride from the gate,
advanced inside on the far turn, but flattened out. YOU'RE THE BEST steadied at the start, trailed for six furlongs, and passed tired horses. MY LIPS ARE
SEALED bumped with UNDER THE OAKS at the start, settled in midpack early three wide, and tired. FALL MOON raced in the second flight early, and
dropped back three then four wide around the far turn. TIZ AFFAIR prompted the pace outside WINNIPEG WONDER to the far turn, and was finished after
six furlongs.

GILDA F. closed in on the battling leaders after a half-mile, took over outside SUZ in upper stretch and drew clear under a drive. BABY ICE raced three then
four wide around the turn, and rallied past the remainder entering the final furlong. TUESDAY'S ROSE got shut off behind SUZ and bumped with PASSING
MOMENTS at the start, lagged well back four wide to the stretch, and offered a mild response outside for the show. SALSA RITA chased after the dueling
leaders inside, and lacked a late rally. SUZ broke out in front of TUESDAY'S ROSE, dueled inside ROYALLY COOL, won that battle approaching the
quarter-pole, but faded through the drive. PASSING MOMENTS bumped with TUESDAY'S ROSE at the start, and was outrun. ROYALLY COOL dueled
outside SUZ early, and yielded after a half.

UNION LANE was away alertly but cautiously handled behind the loose horse exiting the chute, took over inside SAMOA midway up the backstretch, drew
well clear around the turn, and was all out on the rail to hold on. ROMANTIC GIZMO was edgy in the gate prior to the start, advanced inside midway on the
turn, had aim outside the winner through the lane, and was gradually closing in late. MIA'S BOBTAIL raced two wide around the turn, could not reach the
leaders and was well clear of the rest. I'M THAT BIRD was bumped by FIAMMA MAMMA and pushed in at the start, and was never close. KAUFY
FUTURES became edgy in the gate prior to the start, hit the left side of the gate coming out, and was outrun. SAMOA bumped with FOR KICKS at the start,
was displaced up front by UNION LANE up the backstretch, and faltered after six furlongs. FOR KICKS bumped with SAMOA at the start, and dropped far
back four wide late on the turn. FIAMMA MAMMA broke open the gate twice prior to the start, bobbled and veered in bumping I'M THAT BIRD and
unseating the rider just after the start, galloped along in front of the field, and was apprehended and escorted off. This race was hand timed. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
BLESSED BEAST was never far back, swung four wide at the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly and surged outside SAY ADIOS to get up near the
wire. SAY ADIOS pressed the pace outside POSEIDONS PRINCESS, wrested command after a half-mile, drew clear through mid stretch, and was nailed at
the finish. GIOIELLI saved ground in range early, was guided out three wide with a clear shot turning for home, and finished one-paced. TRANS
MISSISSIPPI was in tight between BLESSED BEAST and POSEIDONS PRINCESS soon after the start and clipped heels behind the latter, raced four wide
around the turn, and improved past tired horses. POSEIDONS PRINCESS got clipped behind by TRANS MISSISSIPPI early, sped to the front slightly off
the inside, got overhauled by SAY ADIOS after a half, and gave way. MISS MARIS tired inside after a half. TOONIE LOONIE was driven three wide on the
turn, and had no response.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN HUG was held up early inside, began to advance while shifting out four wide after six furlongs, set sail after GIVEMETWENTY through the
last eighth of a mile, and ran that rival down from outside. GIVEMETWENTY turned up the pressure on BAD BEAT BRIAN on the far turn, took over outside
the pacesetter in upper stretch, drew clear past the furlong marker but could not deny the winner. DOMINATE THEMOMENT settled in the middle of the
field early, waited behind the leaders a quarter-mile out, tipped out to the four-path at the top of the stretch, and rallied mildly. BAD BEAT BRIAN cleared
inside with the early lead, rated along through even fractions for six furlongs, could not hold off GIVEMETWENTY after straightening away for the drive, and
weakened on the rail. LETS PLAY HARDBALL bumped with STRONG ENDING at the start, raced three wide around the far turn, and lacked a solid closing
response. SAINT BENEVOLENCE raced forwardly three wide to the far turn, and faded after six furlongs. VIKING PLUNDER angled widest leaving the first
turn, and made no gains four wide around the far turn. CITY PARK was strung out four wide around the first turn, and failed to menace. BLOOD MOON
saved ground on the turns, and faded approaching the stretch. STRONG ENDING bumped with LETS PLAY HARDBALL at the start, saved ground in
striking range to the top of the lane, and came up empty.

YODEL E. A. WHO vied inside his three opponents early, shook them off approaching the stretch, and drew clear under a steady drive. WIN WITH PRIDE
pressed the pace in the two-path between horses, could not stay with the winner turning for home, and ran on clear for the place. CAJUN FIRECRACKER
contested the early pace between horses three wide, and could not stay with the top two after a half-mile. SMALL FORTUNE was widest of a closely-knit
foursome early, and faded steadily after a half.

Footnotes
SUNSATION went up to get the early lead in the three-path, moved inside establishing an even pace, responded when challenged approaching the stretch,
and dug in for the decision. MYSTIC LANCELOT broke out bumping UNCONQUERED LEA, came three wide off the far turn, and rallied to get up for the
place. UNCONQUERED LEA stumbled and was bumped by MYSTIC LANCEALOT at the start, dropped back a bit three wide up the backstretch, loomed
up outside the leaders around the far turn, appeared poised to go by SUNSATION in upper stretch, but could not get by and yielded the place late.
COWTOWN broke out bumping BLESS THE KITTEN, lagged well back for six furlongs, and was going well belatedly on the far outside. TALKING bumped
with BLESS THE KITTEN at the start, was steadied and shuffled back through the stretch the first time, came three wide off the far turn and failed to
menace. OUR COUNTRY stayed close early between horses, moved inside approaching the stretch, and could not gain on the fence. EXPRESS
PHAROAH prompted the pace outside the winner to the stretch, and gave way. BLESS THE KITTEN bumped with TALKING at the start, then bumped with
COWTOWN a stride later, saved ground in range for six furlongs, and tired.

Footnotes
ATAKAN went up to get the lead early and moved inside, backed down the pace up the backstretch, kicked away turning for home and had just enough to
hang on. DREAMMASTER steadied along the rail first time through the stretch, continued inside and steadied entering the far turn, waited for an opening
into the stretch still on the fence, came clear moving to the two-path 70 yards out and was rapidly getting to the winner in the last strides. TRAFFIC
TROUBLE raced in the second flight early between horses, came four wide off the far turn and finished willingly outside the top two. GUN OF GLORY
prompted the pace outside ATAKAN from the outset, got shaken off into the stretch and weakened through the late stages. QUEEN'SPLATE NOLAN raced
three wide early, moved further out on the far turn, and lacked a solid late bid outside. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER trailed for six furlongs, moved off the inside
and finished with belated interest between horses. LOVEDISC saved ground in range, and faded in the two-path through the last eighth of a mile. POWER
(BRZ) steadied in tight on the rail approaching the first turn, went along in traffic from midway on the backstretch to the furlong grounds, and could never be
set down in earnest. BELLAS FELLA was four wide on the first turn, lodged a mild bid between horses in the three-path after six furlongs, but gave way in
the lane. CONSILIUM raced three wide for most of the initial six furlongs, and had nothing left in the stretch.
