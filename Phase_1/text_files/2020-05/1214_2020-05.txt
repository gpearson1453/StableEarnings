Footnotes
MONGOLIAN LEGEND sped to the early lead, shook off a pair of foes to inch away on the backstretch, responded when rivals loomed leaving the second
turn, drew off under left handed urging in the drive and proved best. MASTER RECOVERY stumbled at the start, saved ground stalking the pace, came out
into the stretch and again in upper stretch, was three deep through much of the final furlong and gained the place. INVICTATATUS pressed the pace three
deep then stalked a bit off the rail, angled to the inside leaving the backstretch, inched forward on the second turn, came under urging along the rail in the
stretch then had the rider lose the whip a sixteenth out and edged a foe for third. FAY DAN pulled his way between horses to prompt the pace on the first
turn then stalked off the rail, continued outside a rival leaving the backstretch and on the second turn and into the stretch, was between foes through much
of the final furlong and was edged for the show. TWIRLING DERBY chased off the rail then outside on the second turn, came three deep into the stretch,
continued three wide through most of the stretch and was outfinished for a minor share.

SEVEN SCENTS saved ground stalking the pace, came out in upper stretch and again nearing midstretch and rallied under some urging with the whip
turned down and a strong hand ride to gain the lead in deep stretch and won clear. VIA EGNATIA stalked inside, came out into the stretch, bid three wide in
midstretch then between foes in deep stretch and edged the pacesetter late for second. MORGAN S. had speed off the rail then dueled inside, inched away
past the eighth pole, fought back in deep stretch and was edged for the place. MORE HONOR stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail on the turn,
continued alongside a foe into the stretch, came out some in the drive and lacked the needed late kick. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE hopped in a slow, awkward
start, angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, continued inside on the turn and in the stretch and could not offer the necessary late response. LITTLE
NO WAY four wide early, stalked three deep then outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. FACTORIAL had speed
outside then dueled alongside a rival, fought back on the turn, was between horses in midstretch and weakened late. EMERALD MAGIC a bit slow into

FIGHTING MAD had speed three deep then angled in and set the pace inside, inched away on the second turn, drifted in a bit in the stretch, kicked clear
under urging and steady handling late. HARD NOT TO LOVE bobbled slightly at the start, settled inside then a bit off the rail, went outside a rival on the
second turn and into the stretch and was second best. CE CE stalked inside then a bit off the rail, went three deep leaving the backstretch and into the
second turn, continued outside a rival on that turn and just off the fence nearing and into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. KAYDETRE stalked
three deep then outside a rival, was between horses leaving the backstretch and into the second turn, dropped back on that turn and into the stretch and
gave way. HOROLOGIST stalked between horses then a bit off the rail, angled in on the second turn, took an awkward step and was pulled up into and
through the stretch, eventually walked across the line and was walked off.

Footnotes
TONAHUTU (IRE) chased outside a rival then a bit off the rail, came out on the second turn and three deep leaving that turn and into the stretch, took the
lead outside the pacesetter under energetic handling and pulled clear under some left handed urging. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) angled in and saved ground
stalking the pace, came out a bit in upper stretch and went around the pacesetter in deep stretch for second. SEASIDE DANCER tugged a bit and took the
early lead, inched away into the backstretch, set the pace inside, fought back in midstretch then could not match the winner and was outfinished for the
place but held third. MESO pressed the pace outside a rival then stalked a bit off the rail, was between horses leaving the backstretch and again leaving the
second turn, came out some in midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. AVALON RIDE saved ground stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch
and did not rally. TAMMY'S WINDOW broke a bit slowly, chased outside a rival, was between horses leaving the second turn and into the stretch and
lacked a further response. SUGARY stalked the pace three deep, fell back three wide leaving the second turn and into the stretch and weakened.
