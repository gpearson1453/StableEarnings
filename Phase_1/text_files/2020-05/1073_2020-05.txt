Footnotes
MAZ KANATA set a pressured pace outside of NIGHT OF IDIOTS, kicked clear around the turn, led comfortably through the lane, weakened a bit late but
found the wire just in time. LOUDER CALIFORNIA stalked a bit off the rail, angled outside the leader in the lane, closed fast and missed. NIGHT OF IDIOTS
lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and was along for the show. SLIGHTLY raced in the two path through the turn and lacked a rally. TWO
TIMING LUCY pressed from the inside, failed to match strides with the winner on the turn, lugged out into the lane and gave way.
