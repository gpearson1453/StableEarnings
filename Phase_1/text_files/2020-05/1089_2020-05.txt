Footnotes
BARBIE'S KING was never far back, swung four wide at the top of the stretch, wrested command outside TOOK A CAB and SWEET GIANT approaching
the eighth-pole and drew clear. SWEET GIANT tugged his way forward four wide leaving the first turn, bid for the lead after six furlongs, flattened out
through the furlong grounds, and just saved the place. TRAFFIC TROUBLE was outrun toward the inside to the far turn, shifted out four wide for the drive
and finished well. DRAMATIC KITTEN veered out sharply at the start and was far back early, angled to the far outside coming off the far turn and improved
to get the last major share. POWER (BRZ) broke out at the start and was off slow, steadied outside TRAFFIC TROUBLE past the quarter-pole, and
improved without threatening. LOVEDISC underwent a four-wide journey and lacked a bid. SKYLINE VIEW got clipped behind by RECLINER midway on
the first turn, saved ground and had no rally. MAYITO moved off the inside to the three-path after six furlongs, and tired in the stretch. TOOK A CAB set a
pressured pace for six furlongs, and gave way inside. RECLINER bumped and brushed with BOOGADI STEEL and steadied at the start, clipped heels
behind SKYLINE VIEW and stumbled midway on the first turn, and stayed far back. JACK BEANSTALK pressed the pace for six furlongs, and retreated
steadily. BOOGADI STEEL bumped and brushed with RECLINER at the start, steadied in tight between horses on the first turn, and dropped far behind
after a half-mile.

Footnotes
HYPERFOCUS was a step slow from the gate, advanced under pressure three wide late on the turn, and wore down PEPPI from outside under a heavy
drive on the wrong lead. PEPPI vied outside BREAKTHROUGH from the start, got the best of that dispute by mid stretch, and yielded grudgingly late.
BREAKTHROUGH broke sharply and dueled for the lead inside PEPPI, and weakened through the drive. COBB hesitated at the start spotting the field a
couple lengths, and was outrun four wide. FULL SEND showed brief speed and tired. ZIGGY was outrun three wide. GIVE ME TWO STEPS was outrun in
the two-path to the stretch, moved to the rail and could not gain. SCREEN STAR showed little inside.

Footnotes
TEMPERANCE prompted the early pace three wide, bid for command midway on the far turn, edged clear in mid stretch, and had just enough to hold on.
BY HIS GRACE saved ground in easy striking range for six furlongs, tipped out to the three-path turning for home, rallied willingly and just missed outside
rivals. KAHIKO bumped with DREAM ADRIANNA at the start, settled in the middle of the field along the rail for six furlongs, bid late between the top two
finishers and was gaining at the wire. CHOUCHOU DE BOO set a slow pace inside, responded when hooked on the far turn, and stayed on to deep stretch
before giving way. CAT LADY was outrun early, came five wide off the far turn and was gaining late on the far outside. TOKYO saved ground to the stretch,
and improved without threatening. DUR A CUIRE stayed in range near the two-path to the stretch, and lacked a bid. MARIPOSA BELLE broke slowly, raced
two to three wide, and never menaced. MARIES MELODY raced in the second flight, and was never a factor. MIDNIGHT MARVEL prompted the pace two
wide, and was finished before reaching the stretch. DREAM ADRIANNA took the worst of a solid bump with KAHIKO at the start and was knocked off stride,
fought rating four wide going to the first turn, and was through after a half-mile.

Footnotes
SAND DRIFT bumped with SAMIS CAR at the start, advanced through the middle stages, swung three wide for the drive, took over outside DANA GRACE
a furlong out, and kept GET REWARDED at bay to the finish. GET REWARDED improved position saving ground into the far turn, was guided out four wide
at the top of the stretch, finished gamely and could not reach the winner while best of the others. DANA GRACE was never far back, reached the front three
wide approaching the stretch, was no match for SAND DRIFT entering the final furlong, and weakened. FANTASTIC KINGDOM was well back for six
furlongs, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly. TOO MUCH WAR pressed the pace two wide, and weakened through the stretch on the rail.
ALGODONAL raced close up inside, steadied late on the far turn, and faded. ITS ABOUT ME saved ground early, took up sharply behind SAMIS CAR
midway on the far turn, and lacked a rally. DUBAIAN was always outrun. BLAME THE GODS raced four wide in range to the top of the stretch, and tired.
MONEY FACTOR was four wide early, and tired in the stretch out past the middle of the course. STARSHIP GUSSIE raced two wide, and was through
before reaching the stretch. SAMIS CAR set the pace inside, took up sharply behind ALGODONAL in the process of giving way on the far turn, and was
eased up after that.

POSEIDONS PRINCESS bumped with PERSONALLY at the start, sped clear early inside, maintained a daylight advantage in the two-path through the
furlong grounds, and was all out to hang on. NENITA became fractious unseating the rider behind the gate, came away in good order to get a forward
position, rallied outside the winner through the lane and came up just short. SOCIALLY ASTRAY hugged the rail throughout, gained ground late and was
best of the others. MI TIA REGIS lagged far back to the stretch, and improved position on the far outside while not a threat. LOLA WANTS lacked a rally
three wide. PAZYARMONIA raced two wide outsprinted into the turn, and could not gain inside through the stretch. IMPRESSION GIVEN chased outside
the pacesetter early, got shaken off after a half-mile and retreated. PERSONALLY bumped with the eventual winner at the start and was off slow, and
remained far back. CAPELINE was outrun three wide. ARCHING hit the left side of the gate at the start, and dropped far back before completing a half-mile.

Footnotes
RIGGINS settled inside unhurried to the far turn, slid out to the four-path through a tight space at the top of the stretch, set sail after the leaders, and
outdueled CALL CURT while brushing with that one near the wire. CALL CURT saved ground in easy striking range for six furlongs, got through on the rail
and took over inside EAGLES PALACE in upper stretch, battled inside RIGGINS in close quarters and was edged at the finish. STRONG HEADED bumped
lightly with EL SAMURO at the start, was in tight between RIGGINS and RECONVENE and bumped with the latter at the top of the stretch, and finished
willingly outside. EAGLES PALACE bumped with RECONVENE after the start, took over from outside around the first turn, moved in showing the way for six
furlongs, got collared from inside by CALL CURT in upper stretch and weakened. VIKING PLUNDER dropped back to trail after the start, stayed on the rail
throughout and improved late without threatening. EL SAMURO exchanged light bumps between STRONG HEADED and BEE MAJOR at the start, lagged
well back to the stretch, and improved on the far outside. NASSAU STREET was no factor three wide. BEE MAJOR exchanged a series of bumps between
EL SAMURO and RECONVENE and steadied after the start, moved up three wide coming off the first turn, but faded gradually after six furlongs.
RECONVENE was bumped, jostled around and steadied between EAGLES PALACE and BEE MAJOR after the start, advanced four then five wide around
the far turn, bumped with STRONG HEADED and got pushed further out at the top of the stretch, and could not recover. STONECASTLE saved ground
early, moved out prompting EAGLES PALACE up the backstretch, and faded steadily after six furlongs. MAKE A MOVE raced forwardly two wide early, and
stopped approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
FOOLISH HUMOR sped to the front after the start, kicked away from ENVIED through upper stretch, and lasted over FAST SCENE by the bob of a head.
FAST SCENE broke in crowding rivals, was outsprinted in the two-path early, rallied steadily outside the winner and just missed. AMERICAN TAP was
crowded and pushed in at the start, raced well back to the stretch, advanced between horses through the furlong grounds, and was up for the show with a
mild rally. ENVIED chased three wide early, loomed a threat outside FOOLISH HUMOR turning for home, but weakened through mid stretch.
COMPENSATE pressed the pace two wide to the top of the lane, and faded through the final furlong. AFFICIONADO (FR) was pushed in by FAST SCENE
and crowded at the start, advanced mildly three wide on the turn, but flattened out. HAPPY LOUDON went looking for the lead out of the gate but was
beaten to the top by FOOLISH HUMOR, lost position inside around the turn, and was never fully set down through the stretch in the two-path. GLORY DIA
was outrun four wide. SILVER TUNES was forwardly placed on the rail approaching the stretch, and came up empty.

ASSERTIKO bumped lightly with CHINOMADO at the start, pressed the pace three wide, collared LOUIE'S KINGDOM from outside in mid stretch, and
edged clear all out. LOUIE'S KINGDOM vied outside CAT GONE QUICK early, won that battle turning for home, could not stave off ASSERTIKO through
the furlong grounds, and held well to best the others. HARPER GO LUCKY lagged well back to the stretch two wide, moved out and was up outside ROAD
TO PEACE for the show. ROAD TO PEACE raced in range four wide to the stretch, lacked a solid bid and was overhauled for third money. WAR ACT raced
between horses two then three wide for a half-mile, and had no rally. CAT GONE QUICK dueled for the lead inside LOUIE'S KINGDOM, and weakened
after a half. SARASOTA BOY was put to a drive inside around the turn, and had no response. CHINOMADO acted up briefly in the gate prior to the start,
bumped lightly with ASSERTIKO coming out, and dropped back early inside.

Footnotes
HALLADAY bobbled and broke out at the start, recovered quickly and took the lead without any undue exertion, rated along inside gradually increasing the
tempo to maintain a clear advantage, and remained in control through the stretch under good handling. AQUAPHOBIA was never far back, eased out three
wide to take a run at HALLADAY turning for home, and could not reach that one while clearly second best. SOCIAL PARANOIA broke in at the start, raced
in the second flight unhurried early, idled through the far turn being scrubbed on in the two-path, began to advance into the stretch getting in gear between
horses, and finished willingly. ADMISSION OFFICE raced fairly close to the pace three wide to the far turn, lost some ground to the leaders into the stretch,
and stayed on for a share without a late punch. CULLUM ROAD lagged well back for six furlongs, and passed only tired horses. EL TORMENTA prompted
the pace outside HALLADAY under a firm hold early, and came up empty when roused after six furlongs. SAND DANCER saved ground in midpack for six
furlongs, steadied inside SOCIAL PARANOIA approaching the top of the stretch, and tired. HIGHLAND SKY raced two to three wide on the turns, and never
got involved. HAWKISH got shut off between HALLADAY and SOCIAL PARANOIA at the start, put in a brief run three wide approaching the stretch, and
gave way.

Footnotes
BATTLE OF BLENHEIM prompted the pace three wide, challenged outside GRAY'S FABLE into the stretch, and prevailed after a late duel. GRAY'S FABLE
grabbed the lead after the start, picked up the pace after a half-mile, responded when hooked in upper stretch, and held to be clearly second best.
HARBOUR MASTER (GB) raced in the two-path around the turns, and rallied mildly. HONEY WON'T prompted the pace outside GRAY'S FABLE, and
weakened after six furlongs. SUBLIME APPEAL saved ground in range for six furlongs, and finished evenly in the two-path between horses. COUNTER
OFFER lacked a solid response through an inside trip. SURF SHACK was pushed out at the start, raced at least four wide throughout, and passed tired
horses. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE got pushed out at the start, raced widest up the backstretch and into the far turn, and could not gain. STRONG ONE broke
out sharply carrying out several rivals, and had no rally four wide off the final bend. BASHA was slow from the gate, steadied behind STEALTH going into
the first turn, and remained far back. URBAN LIGHT (IRE) was pushed out at the start, stayed fairly close early while four wide, and tired after six furlongs.
STEALTH was reserved early toward the inside, and was empty when asked.

TAP IT TO WIN tracked behind the leading trio around the turn, moved out four wide getting his cue approaching the stretch, caught WHISKEY SUNRISE
from outside past the eighth-pole and drove clear. WHISKEY SUNRISE chased three wide early, reached the front after a half-mile and pulled clear into the
lane, could not cope with the winner a sixteenth out but clearly bested the remainder. R MERCEDES BOY bumped with HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC at the
start, pressed the early pace outside I'LL FIGHT DEMPSEY, bid between that one and WHISKEY SUNRISE late on the turn, but faded through the drive.
SEPTEMBERTEN saved ground early, entered the stretch in the two-path, and lacked a solid bid. CRYOGENIC was no factor three then four wide on the
turn. HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC bumped with R MERCEDES BOY at the start, and had nothing left after three-eighths of a mile. I'LL FIGHT DEMPSEY set a
pressured pace inside, and folded up after a half. MORE THAN STRIKING was outrun four wide. CHINOMADITO missed the break and trailed.

Footnotes
AREYOUTALKINGTOME was outrun for six furlongs, circled five wide into the stretch, rallied steadily and was along after a long drive. THE ROBERT was
devoid of early speed, moved out steadily through the turn to be six wide past the quarter-pole, and closed in gradually out in the middle of the track.
TRAPPEZOID shifted off the inside to the four-path leaving the turn, raced in some traffic under heavy pressure through upper stretch, and ran on gamely
late. SHE TAKES HEART bumped with STARSHIP APOLLO at the start, tracked the pace three wide, bid at the top of the lane, and weakened through the
closing stages. DISCREET HEAT was under a drive three wide around the turn, and continued evenly to the finish. STARSHIP APOLLO bumped with SHE
TAKES HEART at the start, vied for command outside DEXTER ROAD, clung to a short lead with a furlong remaining, and weakened. THE QUEENS
JULES stayed in range two wide to the stretch, and lacked a bid. IL FARAONE saved ground far back to the stretch, and was going well much too late.
PEPPI THE HUNTER bobbled at the start, brushed with MR CHAPLIN up the backstretch, and tired after six furlongs. DEXTER ROAD vied inside
STARSHIP APOLLO for six furlongs, and tired. MR CHAPLIN brushed with PEPPI THE HUNTER up the backstretch, and gave way on the turn. This race
was hand timed.
