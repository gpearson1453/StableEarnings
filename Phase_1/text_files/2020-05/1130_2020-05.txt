Footnotes
MISS JUSTICE tracked the early leaders outside to move four wide going up the backstretch, continued well into the lane and edged clear under steady
handling. AMY'S SHADOW stalked the pace from along the inside, continued on in the drive and was just up for the place late. MISS BLUE ROOSTER
prompted the early pace to bid three wide and gain a short lead up the backstretch then could not contain the top pair in the drive. ZIBBY TOO stalked the
leaders three wide, angled inside on the far turn but lacked a solid closing run. STREAKNSILVERSTONE was not a factor three and four wide. FANCY ME
MARIE failed to mount a bid four wide. PRINCESS B was always back. WILDFIRE SIS showed the most early speed to cross over and establish position
about the two path, made the pace to midway up the backstretch and gave way.

the first turn and improved position but could not threaten late. CLASSY MAGIC hesitated at the break, moved up four wide but could not threaten late. GO
CHIVA GO saved ground in reach of the pace and weakened. BEHOLD DE EROS followed the pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
NATTYTYME saved ground in reach of the pace to the far turn, angled out nearing the lane to rally four wide, responded through the lane and rallied clear in
the closing sixteenth. PANIC BUTTON tucked inside to save ground through the first turn, moved closer while angling out leaving the second turn, bid three
wide through the far turn then could not handle the winner's late run. SPUNKY KITTEN tracked the leaders three or four wide to bid and move clear into the
far turn then came up empty in the drive. BIG EGYPT settled back of the field while four wide, rallied five wide to bid into the final turn and weakened in the
drive. COUNTRY CURE followed the pace four to five wide and lacked a solid closing bid. BETA LOVER made the pace on a short lead about the two or
three path and tired. CHILLY WILLIS prompted the pace outside BETA LOVER and gave way.

BANKER NITA moved inside through the first turn to save ground, tracked the leaders to bid going up the backstretch, drew clear in the final turn and drew
off under mild urging. BRILLANT MIND settled off the pace three wide near the back, fanned six wide into the lane and rallied to gain the place.

pace racing out from the rail and weakened in the far turn. SHELL LOCKET saved ground to move closer through the far turn but lacked a late rally.
VIOLENT FIT stalked the pace four wide and weakened. GYPSY WIND JEANNE was not a factor four wide. DIXIE CAT prompted hte early pace outside
GOVENESS SHEILA and tired.

Footnotes
DISTINCT APPROVAL showed the most early speed to gain position about the two or three path, made all the pace, was challenged as DOROTHE MARIE
bid into the lane but kept that one safe under a steady drive. DOROTHE MARIE stalked the pace three or four wide to move nearest the winner through the
far turn, bid outside that one into the lane but could not get by. ATOKA GIRL settled off the pace four wide and rallied to gain the show while no threat to the
top pair. RACEY REECEY followed the pace while saving ground and lacked a final closing run. FEELS RIGHT tracked the pace inside the winner and
weakened. KONAWA KWEEN moved up three wide while not a threat. IMA DANGER was not a factor. SIBLYLINE followed the pace three wide and
weakened.

Footnotes
I'M LUCKY prompted the early pace outside BANJO BILL to bid clear and widen through the far turn then just held late as I CALL SHOTGUN rallied. I CALL
SHOTGUN lunged at the break to get away slowly, settled three or four wide, rallied through the far turn to fan six wide into the lane and closed well but just
missed. BRETT'S BOY stalked the leaders from four wide, closed through the lane but came up short at the wire. COUNTRY CLUB DINER saved ground
back off the early pace, moved three wide in the far turn and gained position but could not threaten the top ones. WILLOWY DANSEUR was three wide and
lacked a solid closing rally. BANJO BILL forced the early pace outside the winner and weakened in the far turn. HARMONY GROVE saved ground in reach
of the pace and weakened. GREEN CARD followed the pace four to five wide and tired. TOBIN was always back. RAZORBACK RED was not a factor four
wide.
