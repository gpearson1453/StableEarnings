Footnotes
CREDIT CYCLE broke inwards bumping ONEWAYTICKET, was quickly righted to race just off the leaders three deep between foes racing to the turn,
continued with a steady bid to press the issue between foes nearing upper stretch, went clear under firm encouragement entering the lane and was taken in
hand nearing the wire. EARLY DELIGH dwelt at the start, was settled into stride, gathered momentum entering the turn, swung out five wide racing into the
stretch and continued with interest to gain the place honors in the closing stages. ROCK THE PARK, raced five wide tracking off the second flight in the
opening quarter, was prompted to advance four wide nearing upper stretch and continued evenly in that path through late stages. STRIKING HEIR tracked
just off the first flight four wide in the opening stages, advanced on the leaders entering the turn to press the issue three deep between foes but flattened out
in upper stretch. AUTOGRAPH angled inwards from the break while being urged to force the pace outside a rival, dispatched that foe midway through the
backstretch, then dueled for command inside foes racing into the turn but gave way abruptly entering the lane. ONEWAYTICKET hopped, then was bumped
at the start, was urged inside a rival to briefly contest the pace but gave way early. KILL SWITCH was rated off the second flight between foes in the
opening stages but retreated early.

I'M A G SIX was settled in hand while dropping out last just off the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside foes racing into the far turn commencing a
steady advance, continued four wide into upper stretch and reeled in OPTIC WAY to prevail in time under firm handling. The latter broke readily, attended a
rival's pace under light racing to the backstretch, was urged to go clear nearing upper stretch but was collared approaching the wire. STORM ADVISORY
tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, was urged to advance between foes on the far turn, then shifted four wide entering the lane but
couldn't match the top pair. GENERAL PADDY settled off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, continued three deep between rivals on
the far turn, was fanned five wide in the lane and continued evenly. HIDE THE DEMON, urged inside a rival dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the
backstretch, gave way racing through the far turn. FOG WARNING came through close quarters at the start, raced a bit erratically under rating along the
inside tracking just off the leaders but dropped out after a half.

Footnotes
MOMENTS TO SAVER was rated between foes just behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn, then came through
close quarters nearing upper stretch to bid for command inside foes and was driven clear. STRICT VOW, reserved off the field to the backstretch, switched
out four wide after a half while being prompted to advance, made steady progress in that path to challenge for command racing into the lane but proved only
second best. TEGLA, in touch with the pacesetter between foes attending that rival's pace, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn and weakened
entering the stretch. LEMON WATER tracked off the second flight three deep in the opening half, gained contention between foes in that path racing into the
far turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane but lacked the needed late kick. SMARTY CAT was rated off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half,
was urged to lodge a bid between foes on the far turn but emptied out racing into the stretch. AND I KNOW, forwardly placed three deep racing in touch with
the first flight to the backstretch, gave way nearing the lane. WICKED WITCH tracked off the second flight along the inside, lost some position when caught
behind a tiring foe nearing the far turn, shifted outside that foe but had no rally. LADY JORDAN, urged inside rivals disputing the pace to the backstretch,
dueled into the far turn, quickly came up empty, was steadied racing past the quarter mile marker and abruptly gave way. BELLA LINDA dropped well off the
field racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. OURHANDSOMEGAL angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch but
gave way early.

Footnotes
UNCLE KEVIN was urged to gain a position between foes stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, made steady progress racing into the turn to
prompt the leader, took over racing into upper stretch, went clear under pressure and held sway late under hand urging. GOLD DUCAT tracked off the first
flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and prevailed for the place honors in late stages. OLLYSILVEREXPRESS broke inwards
bumping ROMANCING THE CAT, was settled well off the leaders, angled five wide in upper stretch and displayed some late interest to gain a share under
his own courage. CLIFFY shifted off the inside tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight, gained position between foes racing into the lane
but had no final kick. LAMECH sped to the lead from the break while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command
entering the turn and gave way into the stretch. RIVER HAWK, forwardly placed four wide stalking the pacesetter through the backstretch, gave way leaving
the turn. NAMBITI tracked off the first flight while angling inside but dropped out early. ROMANCING THE CAT, bumped at the start, trailed throughout. THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
I'M CARDINAL broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the rail racing into the bend, shook clear nearing upper stretch, shifted off the
inside but held sway under steady pressure. SAUCY DON, brushed at the break, tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, swung
out five wide racing into upper stretch and produced solid late response to gain the place honors. COROT angled to the inside tracking off the first flight
racing into the turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. NO WAY NEVER (IRE)
tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position but was outkicked for a share. SOLARTE, in touch
prompting the pacesetter in the opening stages, couldn't match that foe racing through the turn and gave way into the stretch. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE
ducked out at the start brushing a rival, was reserved out of close quarters in early stages, switched out nearing the stretch, was fanned six wide in late
stages and offered a belated response. MORGAN'S Z VA tracked off the first flight outside foes, was prompted to advance while caught four wide racing
into the turn and soon dropped out. TRULY STELLAR, forwardly placed three wide pursuing the leaders into the turn, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
NOTACATBUTACARD was rated off the first flight while shifting out on the backstretch, angled to the four path nearing upper stretch and produced a steady
late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. KALU tracked the leaders just off the inside racing through the backstretch,
bid for command along the rail leaving the midway point of the turn, edged forward entering upper stretch but proved only second best. DRILL'S LI'L MAN,
forwardly placed attending a rival's pace, pressed the issue three deep racing through the turn to upper stretch and weakened late. BIG MONEY MACHINE
tracked off the first flight outside foes, was fanned five wide entering the lane and gained some position in an even effort. PERFETTO reserved out of close
quarters in early stages, angled inwards racing into the turn while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. RED HOT LOOKS sprinted to the lead
shifting off the rail in early stages, dueled for command between foes through the turn and gave way entering the lane. PAPACHO settled into stride racing
off the inside but failed to menace. MOUNTED COP trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE QUEEN, reserved last along the inside dropping well off the field to the backstretch, gathered momentum racing into the far turn, split foes
midway through the bend advancing on the leaders, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch to bid for command inside foes and went clear under firm right
handed encouragement. OLENDON (FR) firmly rated between foes stalking the pacesetter into the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with the pacesetter
racing into the far turn, bid for command nearing upper stretch, was floated three wide into the lane, couldn't match the winner's late kick but edged a rival
for the place honors. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER sped to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch,
shifted out racing into the lane while being roused to resist a rival's challenge but weakened between foes late. FLOR DE LA MAR tracked the leader three
wide in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. CLASSY WOMAN tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight racing to the
far turn and came up empty nearing the lane.

Footnotes
STELLAR GRACE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight in the opening stages, switched outside a tiring foe to gain position between rivals
racing into the turn, bid inside the leader racing into upper stretch, went clear under pressure and was taken in hand late. SIXTY CENT vied inside the
pacesetter three deep between foes in early stages, angled inwards while moving to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch but couldn't match the
winner. BEAUTY GENIUS settled between foes in early stages, gathered momentum while altering course to the five path entering the lane and continued
with interest to prevail for the place honors. OVERDRESSED tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out four wide entering the lane and
finished evenly between foes. ALEX'S FIRST, slow to gather stride, was prompted to advance four wide on the leaders racing into the turn but proved empty
in the drive. MAY BEAU, reserved last racing through the backstretch, shifted out and improved position three deep in late stages. LA LUISA was hustled to
the lead outside foes in the opening stages, angled inwards racing into the turn but gave way entering the lane. C'EST PARTI vied inside foes into the turn
and gave way after a half. ABUELA CORI tracked the leaders along the inside and retreated early. LADY TAPATIA ducked in at the start, made brief
progress between foes to gain a position off the first flight, was carried wide into the stretch and emptied out.

Footnotes
IGOTTAWHITEFACE broke readily, angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight into the backstretch, shifted out three wide entering the lane and
continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and maintain a safe margin to the end under firm encouragement. EYERISH INSPIRED
tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, advanced three, then four wide racing into the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors while closing
the gap on the winner. VALERIE FIRST, reserved last, swung out five wide entering the lane and finished willingly to gain terms with the top pair late.
ALLURING APPROVAL, forwardly placed along the inside, switched out nearing the backstretch, pressed the pace between foes into the far turn while
gaining a narrow advantage but yielded in late stages. KWAINA, forwardly placed three deep racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival to
upper stretch and gave way late. LIL HOOH'S HOOH tracked the leaders between foes in second flight but lacked the needed late response. COCKTAIL
SKIRT settled along the inside early and failed to menace. LITTLE CODE proved no factor. CLEM GEM urged to the lead while angling to the rail racing to
the first turn, set the pace to the far turn and gave way. LADY LOVE was pulled up racing to the backstretch and was vanned off the course.
