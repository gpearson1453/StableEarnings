quickly on the winner late but missed while clear for the place. REINA DEL MAR was urged along well off the pace, went three wide on the turn and lacked
the needed response while able to get the show. G'S ALILCRAZY showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the

while no match for the winner. DULCE RIDE broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, moved in near the furlong marker
and finished with good energy to just miss the place while clear for the show. STRONG PATRIOT broke out and bumped with a foe, was ridden along in
third position, moved out late on the backstretch, went six then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. FLASH N GO was urged along off the
pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to rally. HEADLINING was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced well back on the outside, angled in
near the seven-sixteenths, traveled around the turn in the two path and was no factor. WITT SEVEN was bumped at the start then dropped back, raced well
back while ridden along, went three to four wide on the turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. CITYONTHENILE was hard ridden

Footnotes
TEXAS MUSIC BOX was well placed just behind the leading group, drafted in the two path on the turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch,
rallied to the lead inside the furlong marker then drew clear under steady urging. STORMY DEPENCIER lugged in nearing the three-quarter pole, contested
the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place.
MISS SPICY was very slow into stride and spotted the front several lengths, moved out at the rear, went three then four wide on the far turn, gained five
wide into the stretch but flattened out and settled for the show. TRUE RUNNER broke out at the start, pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied three
wide on the turn, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. CIAO CIAO disputed the pace on the outside of a
foe while loosely between horses, vied in the two path on the turn and weakened. MS MEER stalked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn
and came up empty. HIGH DEF RIDGE dropped well back while showing no speed, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch
and was no factor. AKUNA MATATA tossed her head badly at the start then was taken up and off very slow, went three wide early on the turn then moved
to five wide, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DESCENT was last to commence while about three-quarter lengths behind the rest of the field who broke as one, established position into the first turn,
saved ground on that bend, settled comfortably off the pace, rallied while angling from two to four wide on the far turn, closed strongly to get the lead outside
the three-sixteenths, was asked in upper stretch, drew away under a strong hand ride until outside the sixteenth-pole, had the rider take a peak behind him
at that point then was eased up while much the best. RANCHO BARGO went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, contested the pace on the
inside of a rival, was asked in the two path on the far turn then put to stronger encouragement around the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner
outside the three-sixteenths and proved no match while able to hold the place. AGITATOR went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace,
was urged along while moving closer in the five path on the far turn and missed the place while well clear for the show. LINUS rounded the first turn in the
two path, lagged well behind, picked up his stride in the two path on the far turn, checked sharply while coming to the race from the quarter-pole to outside
the three-sixteenths and improved position. REDBIRD'S GRADUATE went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while five wide
on the far turn and failed to rally. HAMAZING SONG went four wide under tight restraint on the first turn, moved up while tugging hard at the bit onto the
backstretch, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. WILKY G went three wide on
the first turn, raced well back in the field, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed
to threaten. DADDY JACK was caught six wide for most of the far turn then dropped to the four path very late on that bend, settled towards the rear while
moving towards the inside, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor. OZMO went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along
passing the half-mile pole, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. SPICY LEGACY saved ground on
the both turns and also failed to respond. DELIRIUM went five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back midway down the
backstretch, came up empty into the far turn and stopped.

ground on the turn, gained while cutting the corner into the stretch, chased along the rail into the final furlong, made a bid approaching the sixteenth-pole but
missed while able to get the place. IMPACT PLAYER disputed the pace while loosely between horses, vied in the four path on the turn, fought between
horses into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. IMPRESSED showed good speed and set the pace, vied in the two path
on the turn, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just missed the show. ALWAYS was squeezed back between horses just
after the start, moved in towards the rear around the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail in the stretch and finished well to just
miss the superfecta. ARCADIA CALLS disputed the pace between horses, dropped back in the three path on the turn, moved out inside the furlong marker
and kept on willingly but also missed the superfecta. NINTH STREET was urged along towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came seven
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ABOUT OUR TIME was urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn and came up empty.

stretch and capitulated. RUMPOLE was ridden along well back in the field, went six wide on the turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
LEROY settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into upper stretch and closed strongly to get up in the final
sixteenth. SENOR JOBIM was urged along towards the front, chased in the two path on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch, took the lead inside the
furlong marker but was caught while clear for the place. NEW COLOSSUS bumped with a rival at the start, raced well back in the field, went three to four
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK lunged at the start and was last to
commence, moved up on the outside, chased four to five wide on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took the lead outside the three-sixteenths,
led into the final furlong then was headed by the runner-up and weakened. VIOLENT RIDGE dropped back while hard ridden, moved from the inside to the
three path on the turn and finished willingly. MORNING SNOW was hustled from the start, showed speed then chased the pace, dropped back significantly
in the two path on the turn, was hesitantly ridden into upper stretch and gained in the final furlong but failed to menace. SOAP BUBBLE veered out at the
start, was urged along on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn and came up empty. FINAL EXAM bumped with a foe at the start, raced well back in
the field, went four to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NO DEBATE settled under some urging, went three wide
on the turn, steadied at the furlong marker and failed to respond. FIRE BLASTER broke out then was corrected by the rider, disputed the pace on the
outside, moved clear near the seven-sixteenths, rounded the turn in the three to four path, was headed outside the three-sixteenths and stopped. THIRSTY
JUNIOR broke out then was corrected by the rider, angled in while showing speed, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and
retreated.
