Footnotes
PICADILLY ROADSTER tracked the pace while angled outside COMO SE LLAMA heading up the backstretch, bid into the far turn then went clear in the
lane under steady handling. COMO SE LLAMA gained the lead about the two or three path inside rivals in the first turn, continued with the winner through
the far turn then could not match strides while holding position late. EMPIRICAL DATA bumped with rivals at the start, attended the pace three or four wide
then went evenly in the lane to be well clear for his position. WILLISTON DUDE bumped with rivals at the start, saved ground and moved up in the lane
while not a threat. FAT TIRE angled in heading up the backstretch and failed to mount a threatening bid. RULETHENIGHT was with the lead group early
two or three wide and weakened. TRISTAN'S DREAM was five and six wide on both turns and failed to threaten. JOHN ARNOLD was bumped between
rivals at the start then went four and five wide on the first turn and weakened.

Footnotes
FLASHIN THE CASH showed the most speed as a host of rivals gunned for the lead going up the backstretch and edged clear into the turn, steadied briefly
going through geese on the track past the quarter marker, held clear to upper stretch and just held late. FASHION FACT was widest of rivals six deep
showing speed from the gate, slowly closed through the lane and just missed. DREAMINGNDIAMONDS was four and five wide between rivals in the lead
group up the backstretch then went evenly in the lane and held position. DANBURITE stalked the early leaders three wide and lacked a solid closing run.
GONEWITHTHEBREEZE was four and five wide between rivals going up the backstretch and was outfinished for position in the lane. SCIOTO'S SHOES
was three and four wide between rivals with early speed and lacked a final closing run. SABEBRA was three wide with the early lead group and weakened.
BEHOLD DE SKY was angled out through the turn and never threatened.

in time. P R STREAKIN was also back off the pace racing three wide, rallied four wide in the far turn to bid with the winner and could not handle that one.

pace about the two or three path to move clear into the far turn, was getting out approaching the lane to pack the show horse wide and weakened.
TERRIFIC JO was along the inside and weakened. PICKLES N ME followed the pace three wide and failed to offer a bid. MR MON showed early speed
three wide and tired. TIZ A MAGIC MAN was angled out heading up the backstretch and tired. TRIP CODE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ORNAMENTAL IRON moved inside leaving the first turn and rallied to the leaders going up the backstretch and through the far turn, angled out to bid four
wide into the lane and moved clear under mild urging. CHEVERIE stalked the early leaders three or four wide to bid into the far turn, continued outside
SHADY LANE into the lane then could not handle the winner in the drive. SHADY LANE was on a contested pace out from the rail and inside rivals,
continued to upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. BEHOLD THAT WORD saved ground and made a mild late run to just miss third. LET'S GO
PLACES was back off the pace racing three or four wide, moved up in the far turn but could not hold position in the lane. WIREWIREWIRE failed to offer a
bid three wide. GLOBAL EXCHANGE contested the early lead outside SHADY LANE and weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
RYRYSWEETIE dropped off the early pace while four and five wide in the first turn, rallied outside on the far turn to move six wide into the lane and
responded with a good late run to collar the leaders and move clear. INNOCENT STORM stalked the leaders four wide to bid clear turning for home but
could not handle the winner's late run. OUR ANABELLE stalked the pace four wide, rallied five wide into the lane gained the show but could not threaten the
top pair. CALIFORNIASUMMER saved ground to late far turn, bid between rivals into the lane and could not sustain the run. CHANCE OF FROST improved
position two or three wide while not a threat. LA INDIA alternated on the pace outside A J HART to the far turn and weakened. HOLY MARIE was four wide
early, settled three wide and failed to mount a bid. A J HART alternated on the pace inside LA INDIA to the far turn, remained in reach entering the lane but
had nothing left.

Footnotes
DIVA'S DIVA moved three and four wide through the far turn to bid between rivals into the lane, continued on well and ran down the leaders through the
final sixteenth. PUT SARAH ON forced the pace outside TAYLOR'S BEAUTY throughout to come five wide into the lane and could not produce the needed
late run while between rivals. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY was on the pace about the two or three path inside a rival and saved third late. DIXIE DELTA was four to
six wide through the first turn, moved up outside to fan six wide into the lane and was outfinished in the blanket finish. JAFMIL'S INFERNO followed the
pace three wide, came in on a rival early in the far turn, bid inside the leaders turning for home and was outfinished for position. ZYXYZ saved ground and
lacked a final closing bid. KINKY KIM tracked the pace four wide to the far turn and weakened. LIVELY SPELL was five wide through the first turn just off
the lead group and weakened. HEAVEN'S CREATION saved ground just off the early pace, checked when put in tight along the rail early in the far turn and
dropped out.

Footnotes
DIRTY DIXIE ROAD made the lead racing out from the rail and inside rivals, shook off a bid into the far tun then edged away in the lane under steady
handling. MEMORIES GALORE stalked the leaders four wide to bid outside the winner into the far turn then could not go with that one in the lane. YOU'RE
THE REASON saved ground just off the early pace, waited briefly along the rail midway of the far turn and made a mild gain through the stretch. STALKER
was four and five wide in the first turn, moved up outside but remained wide in the far turn and could not threaten in the drive. PANENA TORNAI failed to
offer a bid three wide. HUSKER RIDGE tracked the pace three or four wide and weakened. CASH TIZ WONDERFUL lunged at the break then bumped with
a rival and stumbled, saved ground and was always back. ELUSIVE DREAM followed the early pace three to four wide and tired. TRIPLE TROUBLE
bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground and tired. CLASSY AFFAIR was always back and finished appearing off to pull up soon after the wire but
walked off under her own power.

from the rail while pressed by a rival, remained on the lead to late in the final turn then narrowly saved the place late. MONGOL CALL settled three wide off
the pace, rallied through the far turn to bid inside rivals and just missed the place. CHARMIN DIXIE was last away and settled three or four wide, moved up
six wide into the lane but could not threaten late. FIANNA HILLS prompted the pace outside MOONFIELD to the far turn and weakened into the lane. MISS
ELLIE'S GIRL moved up three and four wide with a mild bid going to the far turn but could not sustain the effort. RIVER DEPUTY followed the pace three or
four wide and tired. DEEYA'S BLING was always back. EMILY'S PEGASUS saved ground in reach of the pace for a half and tired.
