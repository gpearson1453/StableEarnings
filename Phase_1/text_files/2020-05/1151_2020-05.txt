Footnotes
GOLDEN NOTION broke outwards, was forwardly placed four wide, vied four wide at the half mile pole, then dueled two wide into the turn as inner foes
weakened, but stayed in the three path, was game in upper stretch as his inner rival dug in, then prevailed in the late stages under a long drive. LOOKING
AT LIBERTY shifted from the two to the five path in upper stretch, offered a belated rally, but did not have enough to catch the leader while just getting up
for place at the wire. BABY WHITE SOX set the pace, dueled inside of a trio of rivals at the half mile pole, then inside a single foe into the turn, dug in
persistently in upper stretch, but yielded passing the sixteenth pole and was nipped at the wire by an outer oncharging rival for place. MY NAME IS PHRED
advanced three wide while in the four path into the turn to achieve striking distance turning for home, but hung on his left lead and subsequently weakened.
YASHIMA took the turn in the two to three path and rallied mildly. JUDGE JOHNNY saved ground, but to no avail. NO BAD DAYS vied three wide and
between horses down the backstretch, but weakened into the turn. VICTORYATVICKSBURG failed to menace after shifting from the four to the six path
turning for home. WHITE WOLF was crowded at the start, took the turn in the three to four path, swung to the seven path at the quarter pole to be widest of
all, and failed to factor. POW WOW PRINCE was shut off at the start, trailed by a distance in the four path around the turn, then passed tired foes. STEP
TEN saved ground, came into the lane in the three path, and was no factor. HUG THE MUNNY pulled to vie two wide between horses at the half mile pole,
but weakened into the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL vied two wide between horses before cutting down to the rail into the backstretch, which put I WILL STAND into tight quarters,
dueled inside of SLICK SILVER down the backstretch, built a clear lead into the far turn, then widened approaching the furlong pole and was driven to the
wire. STRUT THE RING advanced three to four wide outside of the leaders around the far turn to make a place bid in upper stretch, and prevailed for that
position late while no threat to the leader. I WILL STAND vied along the inside of a pair of rivals into the first turn, checked slightly as his outer foe cut down
to the rail into the backstretch, stalked from the pocket, made a place bid in the two path turning for home, but was outfinished by his outer foe through the
lane. ALTITO swung to the five path turning for home and made a belated mild rally for a minor reward. LADDIE BOY stalked four wide around the first turn,
stayed in range three wide around the far turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. DANGERFIELD took the first turn in the three path, but
weakened along the inside through the far turn, then passed tired horses in the lane. COUNTY COURT saved ground, but to no avail. KEARNY COUNTY
was a bit crowded at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace, and never got involved. SLICK SILVER pulled keenly to vie for the lead three wide
around the first turn, settled while prompt two wide into the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with his inner foe into the far turn, and weakened between
horses at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
VERB was forwardly placed three wide, inched forward to vie for the lead outside of a pair of rivals at the seven sixteenths pole, forged a slight advantage in
upper stretch, then held his position under a long drive while shifting inwards through the lane. BELFAST BOY took a bump at the start, pulled keenly along
the rail to achieve second flight position inside of multiple rivals, cut the corner turning for home before altering outside of the inwards lugging trio of leaders
at the furlong pole, then produced a late rally, but missed. FUGITIVE dueled two wide and between horses around the turn, dug in as his outer rival, VERB,
grabbed a narrow lead in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead through the lane, lugged inwards while being herded inwards by his outer foe, brushed his
inner counter part at the furlong pole, then show. FULL AUTHORITY pulled to set the pace along the rail, dueled inside of a pair of foes before losing the
lead in upper stretch, then was brushed by his outer dueling rival at the furlong pole as that rival lugged in, then gave way. WARTIME HERO raced three
wide between horses, then finished evenly. SHADOW BOAT had a slow start without incident, trailed to the turn, took the bend in the three to four path
before swinging to the seven path turning for home, and produced a mild rally without threatening. BUBBA CABALLO broke outwards, was forwardly placed
in the second flight two wide between horses, but failed to produce a bid before weakening late. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS broke outwards, took the turn in
the five path, six path upper, but weakened in the late stages. PEDDLERS PRIDE was pinched back at the start, saved ground before swinging to the six
path in upper stretch, but was no menace. BLAME THE CAKE four to five wide between horses in second flight, but weakened. CAROLINA AIRNESS
saved ground, but was no factor. RUNYON two wide while in the three path, and never got involved.

Footnotes
ALTAF took a bump behind from between rivals at the start, settled far off of the pace, rallied stoutly in the five path outside of foes through the turn, swung
to the seven path turning for home, blew past the inner leader approaching the furlong pole, and drew off handily. MAJORETTE was bumped between
horses at the start, trailed the field early on, improved position in the four path around the turn, shifted to the seven path in midstretch, and produced a mild
belated rally to get up for place at the wire. BOBBY'S GOLDENGIRL was forwardly placed three wide, crept closer to duel outside of the leader into the turn,
stayed in the three path around the bend, forged a clear advantage away from his inner weakening foe in upper stretch, but was worn down and offered little
resistance to ALTAF at the furlong pole, then got outfinished for place. VALLETTA chased from the pocket, shifted to the three, then four, path at the five
sixteenths pole, but lacked a bid and finished evenly. TAKE CHARGE PATTI was squeezed back at the start, raced far off of the pace in the four to five path
between horses, then finished evenly. ANGEL DE CORA saved ground off of the pace, advanced in the three path in upper stretch, but flattened out late.
TAKE CHARGE GLENDA bobbled a bit and was forced outwards into rivals at the start, was jostled between foes early on, then raced in midpack three
wide in the four path, but weakened. ITHACA FALLS broke outwards to open space, took the turn in midpack in the three path between horses, but
weakened. READY N WAITING set the pace early on, dueled inside of a rival into the turn, but weakened in upper stretch and stopped. BLONDE BY
NATURE saved ground, but to no avail. DEEP SPACE lunged outwards at the start, prompted the pace two wide, but weakened at the half mile pole. MAID
OF HONOR was jostled between horses in the chute, trailed into the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
SPOOKY CHANNEL rated off of the pace in the two path early, advanced to striking range four wide between horses around the far turn, waited for racing
room behind traffic turning for home, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, kept on with a grinding rally in the late stages, and got up approaching the wire.
PARLOR had a slow start after tossing his head right before the gates opened, shifted three to five wide around the first turn while far off of the pace, rallied
five to six wide and outside of rivals around the far turn, swept past his inner foes with a stout blitz turning for home, built a clear advantage in upper stretch,
but tired in the late stages and was caught approaching the wire. HEMBREE was caught four wide around the first turn, shifted three to five wide around the
far turn before swinging to the seven path in upper stretch, then rallied outside of rivals for a minor reward. JUST HOWARD trailed two wide turning for
home, swung to the eight path, and made a belated rally. ENGLISH BEE made a four wide bid for the lead into the far turn, vied outside of rivals around that
bend, met outside bids turning for home, shifted inwards in upper stretch causing FIRST PREMIO to check, then weakened at the furlong pole. DOCTOR
MOUNTY saved ground and advanced inside of rivals while waiting for racing room turning for home, shifted to the six path for clear racing room at the
furlong pole, but failed to menace. MR. MISUNDERSTOOD rallied four to five wide between horses along with PARLOR through the far turn to make a bid
turning for home, but was outkicked by his outer rival, then weakened. MADE YOU LOOK prompted the pace two wide before taking back to stalk along the
inside, waited for racing room turning for home, steadied amongst traffic at the three sixteenths pole, then came up empty thereafter. FIRST PREMIO
tracked two wide from the second flight, made a three wide bid between horses into the far turn, vied to upper stretch, but was squeezed between rivals at
the three sixteenths pole when ENGLISH BEE shifted inwards, and weakened. MICK'S STAR set the pace along the inside, met many bids around the far
turn, but weakened in upper stretch. REAL STORY stalked four to three wide around the first turn, vied two wide between horses around the far turn, but
was swallowed up at the quarter pole. CARIBOU CLUB saved ground before shifting three to four wide to be in range of the leaders around the far turn
among traffic, was shuffled back turning for home, but weakened once clear, then was awkwardly pulled up approaching the wire, refused to return to the
winner's circle to be unsaddled, then walked off.

SMART TIME tracked midpack in the two path around the turn, shifted to the three path to make a bid between horses in upper stretch, and prevailed under
a long drive. GET THE PRIZE swung from the four to the seven path turning for home, lugged a bit inwards while rallying mildly outside of horses with a
grinding advance through the lane, but missed at the wire. BREAKING NEWS shifted from the three to the five path turning for home to make a bid for the
lead outside of rivals in upper stretch, but got outfinished. HIDDEN RULER broke outwards, set the pace while well off of the rail in about the eight path
early on, cleared away from his inner foe at the half mile pole, held a clear advantage while staying in the three path around the turn, but cut down to the
inside in upper stretch, was headed at the furlong pole, kept on, but yielded late. HE'S A BABE stalked in the three path before making a four wide bid
turning for home, but got outfinished by rivals on both side, then took up slightly after getting mildly shut off approaching the wire, but was not cost a placing.
ZOE'S DELIGHT was far off of the pace in the three to four path before shifting to the six path at the furlong pole, then finished evenly. BIGMANCAN saved
ground from midpack, but to no avail. PICASSO stalked along the inside, was shuffled back to midpack around the turn, altered outwards in upper stretch to
the four path, but lacked a rally thereafter. HIGH CRIME vied along the inside early on, was outsprinted and stalked through the turn, shifted to the two path
in upper stretch, and weakened. CREME DE CERISE was crowded at the start, trailed in the two path, found traffic from the furlong to the sixteenths pole,
and failed to rally thereafter. FLATSTER raced midpack in the four to six path, but weakened through the lane.
