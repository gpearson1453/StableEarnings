Footnotes
EL SCORCHO hit the right side of the gate and was off slowest, rapidly picked off rivals with a wide move around the far turn, ran by JOSEFA to take over
in upper stretch and drew off under pressure. MATCHA steadied on the rail behind DONA CAMILE midway on the far turn, shifted out three wide for
clearance at the top of the lane, and rallied well to best the others. SILVER PALMS saved ground to the far turn, angled four wide to the lane and improved
position. LOOKN FINE AS WINE was in range early, got shuffled back between horses on the far turn, moved to the rail with a mild run into upper stretch,
and finished evenly. FUNNY FEATHER bumped with JOSEFA at the start, went along in traffic behind and between horses early, and lacked a solid bid.
JOSEFA bumped with FUNNY FEATHER at the start, vied outside MIRIANA'S QUEEN early before clearing off entering the backstretch, was no match for
the winner turning for home and folded up. DONA CAMILE was forwardly placed when she appeared to strike the rail and got taken up midway on the far
turn, and could not recover. SIGNING BONUS raced four wide early, appeared to bump with MIRIANA'S QUEEN on the far turn and checked with the rider
losing the right iron, and dropped back steadily. TINY TURBO was a step slow to begin and four wide early, and dropped back before reaching the stretch.
MIRIANA'S QUEEN prompted the pace early, was in tight between DONA CAMILE and SIGNING BONUS midway on the far turn, and faltered after six
furlongs. BIT COIN QUEEN lacked room and steadied on the rail into the first turn, moved out four wide and could not gain.

Footnotes
DAYOUTOFTHEOFFICE vied inside ACTING LUCKY and ROCK WITH ROBIN into the turn while in the two-path, shook away approaching the stretch and
drew off under a drive. ACTING LUCKY stumbled at the start, hustled up to contest the early pace between horses, could not stay with the winner turning for
home, lugged in greenly and ran on second best. DANNYHILL was outrun early inside, moved out in the stretch and went clear of the rest with a mild
response. DANCING IN FIRE was outsprinted early, and never reached contention. ROCK WITH ROBIN pressed the pace in the four-path into the turn,
weakened past the quarter-pole, drifted out tiring in upper stretch and got clipped behind. CLOUD BREAK hesitated at the start, and was always outrun. GO
JO JO GO broke out sharply at the start and was slow into stride, advanced four wide late on the turn, clipped heels behind ROCK WITH ROBIN in upper
stretch and stumbled unseating the rider, and was eventually apprehended and escorted off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, ROCK WITH ROBIN
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH POSITION AND PLACED SIXTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
SEA LOVER cleared to the lead and moved inside heading to the turn, met a challenge from BAHAMIAN PRINCE approaching the quarter-pole, and dug in
along the rail through a long drive to prevail. BAHAMIAN PRINCE moved up to challenge outside SEA LOVER after a quarter-mile, had aim the length of the
stretch but could not get by while much best of the others. DEO FORTE raced in range three wide to the stretch, lacked a bid on the wrong lead and saved
the show inside rivals. KHOZY MY BOY brushed with BYCHANCE after the start, was outrun early inside, and posed no threat between horses to the finish.
GRAN HOMBRE was four wide around the turn, and could not gain late outside. FLASH PASS bumped with BYCHANCE just after the start, and was never
close. FREDDY SOTO was fairly close early between horses, but dropped back after three-eighths of a mile. BYCHANCE bumped with FLASH PASS a
stride from the gate, then brushed with KHOZY MY BOY, was held up behind horses into the turn, and came up empty. OUR TIME was close up early

Footnotes
CAPTAIN DUKE bumped with SUDDEN CAPTURE at the start, went up to challenge U S S COLTON from outside after a quarter-mile, wrested command
after dueling around the turn, and was driving to stay clear. U S S COLTON sprinted to the front early inside, got outdueled around the turn by CAPTAIN
DUKE, and ran on second best. JACK EL BARBARO saved ground early, shifted out with aim behind the battling leaders late on the turn, but lacked the
needed rally. EAST CODE raced two then three wide around the turn, and had no bids. SUDDEN CAPTURE was bumped and squeezed back between
CAPTAIN DUKE and TIGER'S BACK at the start, and faded steadily before reaching the stretch. TIGER'S BACK bumped with SUDDEN CAPTURE at the
start, and dropped far back after a half-mile.

FIFTH TITLE began moving into the turn, slipped through on the rail to take over from DIZZY GILLESPIE near the five-sixteenths pole, and drew well clear
while shifting out through upper stretch. CREA'S BKLYN LAW was slow early, came through along the rail turning for home, and rallied past the remainder.
DIZZY GILLESPIE vied early inside STONE HANDS and CHARLIE THE GREEK, left the rail open and was overhauled from inside by FIFTH TITLE late on
the turn, and gave way. STONE HANDS bumped with SOLAR WARNING at the start, pressed the early pace between horses, and tired after six furlongs.
SOLAR WARMING came under a ride before reaching the turn, and did not respond. CHARLIE THE GREEK contested the pace outside rivals to the turn,
and retreated before reaching the stretch. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
PECHANGA (IRE) saved ground in striking range for six furlongs, lacked room behind the leaders in upper stretch, got through with a late rail bid inside
TIZLEGAL and was just up. TIZLEGAL stalked the pace three wide, bid for command approaching the lane, led through the late stages but could not hold
on. SO DARN HOT was outrun to the far turn, moved off the inside beginning to advance past the quarter-pole, and finished gamely between horses.
FRESCO raced four wide most of the way, had aim outside the leaders through upper stretch but was outkicked. LONGPANTS REQUIRED moved out for
the run up the backstretch, came five wide rallying off the far turn, and was one-paced late on the far outside. STARSHIP MALLOMAR saved ground early,
raced three wide on the far turn, and failed to menace. NOUDHA vied outside MAGIC FLUTE early, got the best of that dispute after six furlongs, lost the
advantage to TIZLEGAL in upper stretch and weakened on the rail. MY SWEET WIFE dropped back under pressure around the far turn, moved inside with
a mild run into the stretch, but could not gain appreciably late. THANKFUL brushed the left side of the gate coming out slow, raced three to four wide and
never factored. PSEUDONYM fought rating five wide around the first turn, and was empty when asked. THEARTOFCOMPROMISE raced in the two-path
on the turns, and tired after six furlongs. MAGIC FLUTE vied inside NOUDHA to the far turn, and faltered after six furlongs.

Footnotes
MASERATI MAN bumped with AIN'T WASTING TIME at the start, saved ground outrun early, got steered out four wide around the turn, bid outside the
battling leaders through upper stretch, and got the best of MONEY RIDE a sixteenth out to win going away. MONEY RIDE sprinted clear briefly up the
backstretch, got hooked by VALID QUEST early on the turn, won that battle through upper stretch, but was no match for the top one late. VALID QUEST
went up challenge outside MONEY RIDE after a quarter-mile, battled around the turn and into upper stretch, and gave way. AIN'T WASTING TIME brushed
the right side of the gate and bumped with MASERATI MAN at the start, then steadied behind FLAMING HOT, trailed for a half-mile, and improved on the
far outside while not a threat. BEYOND GONE pressed the early pace between horses, was driven through the turn but lost ground to the duelers, and
faded after a half-mile. FLAMING HOT was forwardly placed early inside, and gave way before reaching the stretch. UNPRECEDENTED raced three wide
and was finished early.

Footnotes
DON'T GET KHOZY began to edge closer to FAST VENEZUELA while leaving the others behind late on the turn, collared the leader from outside entering
the last furlong and drew off under a drive. BLESSED BEAST saved ground around the turn, moved out for the drive and overhauled FAST VENEZUELA for
the place. FAST VENEZUELA bumped with MIDNIGHT GEM at the start, sprinted clear early, maintained control to upper stretch, and faded through the
last eighth of a mile. CHIT CHAT GIRL lagged well back in the two-path for a half-mile, and improved through the lane without threatening. MAGICGIRL was
far back for a half inside, moved out in the drive and passed only tired horses. MIDNIGHT GEM bumped with FAST VENEZUELA at the start, showed
speed four wide to the turn, and retreated. JOPLIN gave chase early three wide, and was finished after a half. GRAN BRANDY retired early three wide.

HEIRESSALL stayed close between horses three wide for a half-mile, bid outside VIOLENT TIMES turning for home, and forged past approaching the
sixteenth-pole. DAY BY DAY advanced along the rail after a half-mile, got steered out past the furlong marker and finished with good courage. VIOLENT
TIMES broke out bumping PACIFIC GALE at the start, set the pace inside to the stretch, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. BRONX BEAUTY
was outsprinted to the stretch, and lacked a solid response on the rail. PACIFIC GALE absorbed a solid bump from VIOLENT TIMES at the start, moved up
outside nearing the turn, and faded four wide approaching the stretch. GRAY OWL broke alertly despite veering out, pressed the pace for a half and tired.

Footnotes
COOKIE COVE vied inside MAMA LONGLEGS early, moved away going comfortably around the turn, and was kept to pressure past the eighth-pole to
remain well in command. CAFFEINE RUSH got bumped by CAFFEINE RUSH at the start, raced three wide around the turn, and rallied with good energy to
go clear of the others. PLATINUMCENTS broke out bumping CAFFEINE RUSH at the start, raced well back to the lane three wide, and offered a mild
response. NEW YORK COMMANDER saved ground outsprinted for three furlongs, moved out in the stretch and improved for the last major share.
ESPIRITU DE LUNA was bumped into SIX STRING KISS by PASATIME at the start, chased three wide to the stretch, and weakened. DOTDOTDASH was
outrun early four wide, and passed tired horses on the far outside. PASATIME broke out bumping ESPIRITU DE LUNA into SIX STRING KISS at the start,
and was outrun inside. SIX STRING KISS was bumped by ESPIRITU DE LUNA at the start, and was outrun three wide. MAMA LONGLEGS vied outside
COOKIE COVE early, could not keep pace around the turn, and faded steadily. HECHIZADA was outrun five wide. MOHANNA QUEEN was hustled along
to stay close, became choppy-gaited in deep stretch retreating suddenly, pulled up in distress after the finish and was vanned off. THE VELVET BEAST
raced two wide and faltered after three-eighths of a mile.
