Footnotes
ELAINE sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, held clear well past the sixteenth pole, shortened stride late and just lasted for a
share of the win. SHARP'S MISSION chased the runaway pacesetter from between rivals in the three path, continued on her left lead in the lane, closed
outside and was up for a share on the wire. HAPPY FREEDOM chased the pace inside of foes in the two path, tipped out leaving the sixteenth pole, rallied
between the top two and was outfinished. WILD CORK lacked speed while racing two wide and had a mild rally. TINA'S SONG chased the pace five deep
and had only a mild gain. MY SWEET MAGGIE saved ground and never threatened. BREAK DANCIN raced in range between foes about four wide and
lacked a bid under little stretch encouragement. PRINCESS KENO was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
EMPRESS HEART had speed inside of the pacesetter in fairly tight down the backstretch, dropped back around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, slowly
gained through the lane and was up in deep stretch. SWISS THUNDER set the pace two wide, drew clear around the turn and led until deep stretch.
RUNNING PRAYERS lacked early speed, raced five wide around the turn and rallied widest. IRMA GIRL prompted the pace three wide between foes and
was outkicked in the lane. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE was devoid of speed, saved ground and improved position in the lane. BERRY STRONG chased the pace
four wide and came up empty in the lane. CLERESTORY failed to menace while racing five wide.

not keep pace around the turn then continued on to gain the place in the final strides. RICHIE'S B L dueled inside of the winner to upper stretch, continued
on his left lead through the lane and weakened. BALLYHOO PRINCE was in range inside early, dropped back down the backstretch, went three to four wide
around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied. ECLIPTICALS DEWEY tracked the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. YESUS STAR
failed to menace while racing two and three wide. GRANDPA LOUIE broke a bit awkwardly, lacked speed three wide, advanced four wide into contention
down the backstretch then retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
LETTS GO TO DIXIES advanced two wide to the lead leaving the five-sixteenths pole, quickly drew off around the turn and held well clear under a drive.
IT'SMYINTENSION lacked early speed, advanced between foes into the turn, steadied off heels near the three-sixteenths pole, split rivals in upper stretch
and finished willingly to be clearly second best. AUNT MAGGIE checked at the start, lagged inside, swung six wide nearing the lane and was along for the
show. WE LOVE NANNI never threatened while racing three wide. BEST TO BE ME leapt at the start and nearly unseated the rider, raced three wide and
made little further impact. VIRGINIA PEACH was outrun inside. STERLINGS MORENA played no factor while racing two wide. BECOMING MACHEN failed
to menace while racing two wide. JORDAN SPRINGS had a clear lead early then retreated inside around the turn. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into
the start but found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

pole and powered clear under a drive. LIL LINDER dueled two wide, took the lead in midstretch but was no match for the winner late. HOUSE OF LOVE
chased the pace two wide, angled four wide nearing the stretch and was along late for third. STYLISH PAINT dueled at the rail to midstretch and weakened
late. ONE FAT KAT stumbled at the start, advanced three wide down the backstretch to reach a stalking position by the turn, stayed there three wide around
the bend but came up empty in the lane and returned bleeding from the nose. POLICY MISTAKE failed to menace while racing three wide. BETTY BOM
BOTZ was outrun while racing two wide. SILKEN BELLE was outrun inside.
