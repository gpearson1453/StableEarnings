into the stretch, bid three deep to gain the lead in midstretch and pulled clear under urging. CITY RAGE saved ground stalking the pace, came out in
midstretch and gained the place. TOROSAY had good early speed and dueled between horses then inside leaving the turn, fought back in midstretch and
just held third. GALLOPING MISCHIEF chased inside, came a bit off the rail in the stretch and was edged for the show three deep on the line. LINCOLN

the turn, battled between horses in midstretch and weakened late. ITALIANO bobbled at the start, settled outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch
and could not offer the necessary response. MYSTIC FLIGHT (IRE) between horses early, stalked outside a rival then inside, was in tight off heels leaving

stretch and did not rally. ALL AMERICAN HERO settled off the pace outside then off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and was not a threat. SMILING

HENDAVID sped to the early lead, set the pace a bit off the rail, inched away on the turn, widened leaving the turn, drifted in under left handed urging in the
stretch and proved best. DYN O MITE stalked four wide on the backstretch and outside a rival on the turn, came three deep into the stretch and was clearly
second best. CLAW stalked between horses then a bit off the rail on the turn, split rivals nearing midstretch and just held third. FOXBOROUGH fractious in
the gate, had speed between horses then stalked just off the rail, angled in on the turn, came out into the stretch and just missed the show. REIGN OF FIRE
between rivals early, angled in and bid along the rail into the turn, saved ground on the bend and into the stretch and weakened along the inside. W.
WHITEHOUSE broke with the field then dropped back inside and saved ground throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
KAYDETRE stalked outside a rival, bid three deep on the backstretch and most of the second turn, took a short lead outside the runner-up a quarter mile
out, drifted inward in the final furlong but won clear under a couple left handed cracks of the ship and steady handling. MESSAGE sped between foes to the
early lead, angled in and set the pace inside then a bit off the rail, dueled between horses on the backstretch and oito the second turn, fought back inside
leaving that turn and into the stretch and clearly bested the others. STREAK OF LUCK stalked outside a rival then off the rail, went three deep leaving the
second turn and into the stretch and picked up the show. MEAL TICKET steadied off heels midway on the first turn, saved ground stalking the pace, split
horses leaving the second turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed response in the drive. COLONIAL CREED brushed the side of the gate in a bit of
a slow start, chased just off the rail then inside, came out leaving the second turn and into the stretch and weakened. ANGEL ALESSANDRA pulled her way
along inside and steadied early on the first turn, bid along the rail on the backstretch and into the second turn, steadied again from inside foes midway
through that turn and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
KELANI KIM sped to the early lead outside foes, angled in and set the pace a bit off the rail, widened under urging in the stretch and proved best. LITTLE
RACHEL broke in and a bit slowly, went up inside on the backstretch, split rivals into the turn, went four wide midway on the turn and three deep into the
stretch and gained the place. TROUVILLE stalked between horses then outside a rival leaving the turn, angled to the inside in midstretch and bested the
rest. SAPPHIRE SILK close up stalking the winner between horses then a bit off the rail on the turn, came out into the stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. ROSIE'S PAL saved ground chasing the pace, came out leaving the turn and into the stretch and lacked a r ally. KATSAROS chased three deep on
the backstretch, dropped back leaving the turn, came three wide into the stretch and wealkened. ENRICHED BY DEB pulled her way along early then
angled in and stalked inside, continued along the rail on the turn and into the stretch, came out some in the drive and also weakened. BELLE OF SUMMER
dropped back off the rail then outside a rival midway on the backstretch, angled in on the turn, came out some in deep stretch and was not a threat. INDI
GALLE broke a bit slowly, settled three deep then dropped back off the rail on the turn and gave way.

upper stretch and finished with a rush. STEALTHEDIAMONDS sped to the early lead, set the pace a bit off the rail, drifted in some in midstretch and held on
well but was caught late. INTO MYSTIC stalked a bit off the rail then inside, came a bit off the fence in deep stretch and continued willingly. JUST GRAZED
ME chased outside then three deep into and on the turn and into the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late response. MISS HOT LEGS
stalked a bit off the rail then between rivals into and on the turn and into the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. SURRENDER NOW angled in and
saved ground stalking the pace, continued inside in the stretch and had no late bid.
