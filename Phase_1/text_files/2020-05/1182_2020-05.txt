Footnotes
DIVA'S DIVA stalked the early leader two and three wide, moved inside that one to bid through the far turn and kick clear into the lane then held the margin
under steady handling. A KISS GOODNIGHT settled off the early pace three wide, rallied into the lane and was just up for the place. RYRYSWEETIE
dropped off the pace four wide, rallied in the lane and just missed the place. RIVER DEPUTY stalked the pace three to four wide and lacked a final closing
bid. IRISH CONTESSA broke into the side of the gate, saved ground and failed to mount a bid. MOONFIELD moved to a clear lead racing out from the rail,
made the running to midway of the far turn and had nothing left. DAME DANGEROUS saved ground and tired.

Footnotes
RAGTOP RED bumped with a rival at the start, rallied four wide in the far turn then wore down TIZ A MAGIC MAN through the lane to move clear. TIZ A
MAGIC MAN showed the most early foot to edge clear and gain position about the two path through the first turn, continued the lead to upper stretch and
could not handle the winner late. BULLS EYE BETTY saved ground just off the early pace, angled out to bid three wide with the winner into the lane but
could not produce the needed late run. P R STREAKIN saved ground and made a mild late run in the lane. IN SIDE THE LINE was angled out through the
first turn to follow the pace four wide, swung widest into the lane and moved up. MR MON bumped with the winner at the start, tracked the pace four wide
and weakened. TERRIFIC JO followed the pace three wide and weakened. AMY'S SHADOW was always back.

Footnotes
DOROTHE MARIE stalked the early pace three wide, moved up through the far turn to angle four wide into the lane and slowly edged clear. DIRTY DIXIE
ROAD forced the pace inside PERSONAL CAT throughout then could not handle the winner late while clear for her position. PERSONAL CAT was on the
pace outside DIRTY DIXIE ROAD throughout and came up empty in the drive. YOU'RE THE REASON settled three or four wide just off the pace, fanned
six wide into the lane while moving up but could not threaten late. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL stalked the leaders four wide and lacked a final closing bid.
STALKER fanned six wide into the lane and could not threaten. INTOXICATING KISS tracked the leaders three and four wide to bid into the far turn and
weakened. RACEY REECEY was not a factor two and three wide.

Footnotes
ALEX OF ICE settled off the pace four wide in good position, rallied nearing the far turn to bid clear and drew off in the lane under steady handling. FRONT
OFFICE dueled on the pace inside DRASTIC through the opening half mile then continued on to chase the winner home while clearly best of the others.
CREEDS REVENGE stalked the pace three or four wide and held position through the lane. DRASTIC dueled on the early pace outside FRONT OFFICE
and weakened in the far turn. PETE AND REPETE dropped back off the pace three wide, moved up five wide into the lane but could not threaten.
BACKCHATTER failed to mount a bid three wide. BEST TRICK YET was not a factor racing four to five wide. GERDY'S BOY saved ground and was not a
threat. JERF chased the early pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
JUDGE ON THE RUN tracked the early pace outside QUESTION MARKIE to bid and move clear in the far turn, carried a daylight lead into the lane then
just lasted as CHAMBER DOORS closed late. CHAMBER DOORS stalked the pace four wide, rallied outside UBETCHA IMA BUMPER into the lane and
brushed with that one straightening for home, continued with a good late run and just missed. UBETCHA IMA BUMPER stalked the pace three and four
wide, brushed with CHAMBER DOORS straightening for home then could not close ground late. The rider of UBETCHA IMA BUMPER lodged a claim of
foul alleging interference in upper stretch which was not allowed. QUESTION MARKIE showed the most early speed to cross over and gain inside position
then weakened nearing the lane. JAMACIAN ME MONEY saved ground and failed to threaten. HOLD FAST KAT was always back. P R GIRL CRUSH was
not a factor. FINAL AFFAIR saved ground and was always back.

Footnotes
SHIMMERING DREAM settled off the early pace duel four wide, rallied five wide into the lane to bid outside OUR ANABELLE, came in leaving the sixteenth
marker to bump with that rival and continued on to gain the edge. OUR ANABELLE dueled on the four way battle between rivals on the lead, continued with
OUR ANABELLE through the lane, was bumped and steadied leaving the sixteenth marker and could not regain the lead. THE RIDER OF OUR ANABELLE
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST SHIMMERING DREAM ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WHICH WAS ALLOWED WITH
SHIMMERING DREAM DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND. REMARKABLE CHARM moved up four wide in the far turn, fanned six wide into the lane
and closed but could not reach the top pair. FIANNA HILLS dueled from inside rivals on the pace while about the two path and came up empty in the drive.
SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE broke in the air to get away last, saved ground to rally to contention through the far turn and continued with a mild run but came
up short. SPELL WINDER stalked the pace two and three wide, held up in traffic nearing the lane and lacked a late rally. A J HART dueled on the early pace
between rivals and weakened. LA INDIA was caught five wide outside rivals on the early duel for the lead and weakened in the far turn.
