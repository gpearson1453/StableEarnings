Footnotes
OX TROT, held up just off the second flight while angling inwards in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance splitting rivals just off the inside racing
into the turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge ELUSIVE RO on the wire under firm handling. The
latter, caught six wide in early stages tracking just off the first flight, shifted inwards nearing the turn while moving to press the pace three deep, edged
forward to a clear advantage racing into the stretch and just missed. DAD'S YANKEES, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch on a
narrow advantage, pressed the issue into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. MALIO'S angled to the inside in early stages tracking off the first flight,
saved ground on the bend, swung out four wide entering the stretch and gained some position in an even effort. MULLED WINE, reserved last while angling
to the inside in the opening quarter, improved position inside foes while no real threat. LEM ME TEL YA tracked the leaders three deep between foes in
second flight racing into the turn and gave way entering the stretch. EXPEDITER, urged prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn,
dueled between foes on the bend and gave way after a half. DOC KANE tracked the leaders four wide between foes in second flight to the turn and gave
way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CULTURAL MANDATE sprinted clear of the field from the break, angled in to set the pace just off the rail racing into the turn, then met the challenge of
I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE racing into upper stretch holding that rival on a narrow advantage to the end under firm right handed pressure. The latter tracked the
pacesetter in the four path as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the turn while steadily advancing on the
leader, moved to terms pressing the issue through the stretch but was outkicked. CHECOTAH tracked off and outside the second flight in the opening
quarter, advanced on the leaders three deep through the turn to upper stretch but finished evenly in late stages. LOLANITA tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight, shifted inwards entering the turn and had no late response. DREAMING DIAMONDS, held up out of close quarters just after the start,
angled to the rail tracking off the second flight in the opening quarter, switched out avoiding traffic racing into the turn to race four wide to upper stretch but
offered no rally. NIKKI BELLA, held up avoiding close quarters in early stages while shifting inwards, angled to the rail approaching the turn, steadied off
rivals entering the bend and soon dropped out. PUBLICIST was a brief factor inside foes in second flight but gave way leaving the midway point of the turn.
THORCERESS, reserved last near the inside, failed to menace.

WORLDS APART, reserved out of striking distance while being guided to the inside racing to the first turn, gradually drew into range nearing the second
bend, shifted out on the far turn readily advancing on the pacesetter, moved to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm left
handed encouragement. TIZNOISE sped clear of the field while angling inwards racing to the first turn, shifted off the rail on the backstretch dictating terms
under light rating, disputed the issue inside the eventual winner nearing upper stretch but proved no match. PADDY KAYE'S WILD tracked the pacesetter
outside foes foes to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. ENOUGH KISSES prompted to a forward placing stalking the pacesetter in the opening
half, gave way racing into the far turn.

SILENT MISCHIEF, caught four wide racing into the first turn while rated off the second flight, continued in that position through the backstretch, split foes in
that path leaving the midway point of the far turn, lugged inwards under pressure while moving to challenge in late stages making contact with
OVERPRAISE, but was collected off that foe while continuing with a late response to wrest the advantage in time. IMPERIAL GREATNESS was hustled to
the lead racing to the first turn while angling nearer to the inside, dueled for command through the backstretch racing a bit off the rail, staved off several
challengers through the far turn past midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. OVERPRAISE was settled in hand
while shifting just off the inside racing to the first turn, steadily gained position between foes racing into the far turn, shifted out three deep to challenge for
command in upper stretch but lost some momentum when bumped by the winner in the final sixteenth. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS, forced out by ONE MORE
DRINK at the start, was settled outside foes to the backstretch dropping out last, was prompted to split rivals leaving the midway point of the far turn, angled
inside the leaders while being roused to challenge midstretch but lacked the needed final kick. DRAMA AN VICTORY tracked the leader between foes in
second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half, continued in that path into the far turn, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch,
then drifted inwards under pressure in late stages while giving way. DIAMOND DREAMER was urged between foes to gain terms prompting the pacesetter
entering the backstretch, dueled for command to the far turn and gave way. SHIFT THE BLAME tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening
half but faded early. SWIFT KID, held up off the second flight while working his way to the inside nearing the backstretch, made brief progress nearing the
far turn but quickly came up empty. ONE MORE DRINK swerved out at the start bothering a rival, was collected to track off the pacesetter inside foes,
shifted out three wide racing through the backstretch while coming under pressure to contend early and gave way abruptly nearing the second bend. RICKY
RUN WAS SCRATCHED AT THE GATE.

FIELD LETTERS hopped at the start losing position to the leaders, angled to the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground through the turn to
upper stretch, shifted out leaving the furlong marker while gaining late momentum four wide in the final sixteenth and prevailed in time under firm left handed
encouragement. GOLDEN NOLE, urged forcing the pace outside foes in the opening stages, edged clear racing into the turn, held sway past midstretch and
just missed. TORNERO caught five wide in early stages tracking just off the first flight, shifted inwards nearing the turn advancing three deep on the leaders,
continued in that path through the lane and finished evenly while prevailing for a share. FLAN, cut off, then steadied at the start, was prompted to regain
contention while angling to the inside racing into the turn, was urged to challenge along the rail nearing midstretch but lacked the needed final kick. MARDI
GRAS GIRL ducked inwards cutting off FLAN at the start, was righted to track off the second flight on the backstretch, shifted out racing into the turn to
advance four wide between foes to the lane but lacked the needed late response. CONGRATS GOLDA tracked off the first flight three wide between foes
racing into the turn and faded into the stretch. CONCERTOS APPEAL bobbled at the start losing position, was settled into stride, swung out five wide racing
into upper stretch to gain position but made no real impression. RETURN THE FAVOR switched out five wide in the opening quarter tracking off the second
flight and gave way racing into the turn. SHANGHAI MISTRESS, urged inside rivals pressing the pace into the turn, gave way after a half. THE OTHER CAT
flashed brief pace between foes and emptied out early.

Footnotes
RUDIGER, reserved inside foes in the last flight in the opening half, swung out leaving the midway point of the far turn, raced four wide into upper stretch
and produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. BIG MONEY MACHINE tracked outside foes in second flight in
the opening half, steadily gained on the leaders three deep racing into the far turn, struck the front nearing midstretch but just failed to contain the winner's
late bid. HEY BIG GUY, rank between foes in early stages, switched out racing into the backstretch settling into stride, angled out five wide nearing upper
stretch and found his best stride late to close the gap while prevailing for a share. FOX ROX moved readily to the fore along the rail, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin under light rating to the backstretch, resisted when challenged racing into upper stretch but weakened late. D'CRAZINESS tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight, gained some position between foes into the stretch but was outkicked. PURE LUCK tracked off the second flight in
early stages, was urged to advance three deep nearing the lane but lacked the needed final kick. ENGLISH LAUGHTER tracked the pace inside foes in
second flight, came under pressure after a half, saved ground to upper stretch gradually gaining position and was taken up in late stages while racing in
some traffic. ENDURING HONOR, urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, gave way into the lane. LITTLE LEO, caught
four wide racing to the first turn, proved no factor. KING TIDE settled between foes early and never gained contention.

Footnotes
ROCK THE PARK, reserved out of striking distance racing well off the inside in the opening quarter, advanced on the leaders while shifting out six wide
leaving the midway point of the turn, moved to challenge in that path nearing midstretch and prevailed in time under firm handling. THE EXCEPTION
tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled inside the leaders entering the stretch to bid for command and edged rivals for the place honors
late. SACCO AND VANZETTI tracked off the first flight four wide under light rating in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance in that path on the turn
to gain a brief lead racing into upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. ED'S DOG tracked the leaders along the rail through the backstretch, was
prompted to bid for command inside foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. INDIAN BUZZ was settled between foes dropping off the second flight
early, shifted out advancing five wide between foes racing into upper stretch but had no late kick. K C TWOSTEP shifted well wide in the early stages
dropping well off the leaders, then made some belated progress racing five wide through the stretch while making no impression. IRISH MAIL, shuffled back
out of tight quarters at the start, was fanned six wide into the lane while proving no real threat. LUCKY RUNS NORTH, urged inside rivals disputing the
pace, shifted out losing position on the turn while continuing in pursuit of the leaders and emptied out late. ETERNAL CROSS broke awkwardly, was hustled
forcing the pace four wide to gain a narrow advantage racing into the turn but emptied out into the lane. MR. MORNINGSTAR, steadied out of tight quarters
at the break, proved no factor. LITTLE GUY, bumped at the start, was urged three deep between foes pressing the pace to the turn but gave way early. THE
SPIDER ducked out at the start bumping LITTLE GUY, was righted while being urged to contest the pace briefly between foes but emptied out nearing the
turn.

Footnotes
SUGAR FIX broke readily, was rated along the inside stalking the pacesetter into the backstretch, switched outside that foe steadily moving to terms racing
into the far turn, took over racing through the stretch and went clear under firm right handed encouragement. PERT tracked off the second flight racing to
the backstretch, angled inside gaining position after a half, switched out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail for
the place honors in time. STRONG GEM tracked the pacesetter outside the eventual winner into the backstretch, shifted out three deep nearing the lane
while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed final bid. MATINEE GIRL, restless in the gate before the start, was urged to the lead while angling
in, dictated the pace on a clear margin along the rail to the second bend, briefly resisted the winner's bid but gave way leaving midstretch. PEACE TAKER
tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground through the far turn and faded into the stretch. MELISSANI settled between foes in the last flight
early, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn but had no closing bid. SAYYIDA AL HURRA tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening
half but lacked a rally. MISS DAWN made brief pursuit of the leaders four, then three wide into the backstretch and emptied out after a half. BELLA LINDA,
settled along the inside racing to the backstretch and trailed throughout. MR. MORNINGSTAR SCRATCHED AFTER BREAKING THROUGH THE GATE
BEFORE THE START.
