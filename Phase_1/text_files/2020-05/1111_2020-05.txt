Footnotes
MALIBU SUNSET prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, seized command entering the turn, drew clear near three-sixteenths pole and widened
under a drive. NO MISTAKE N ME set the pace between foes early, angled to the rail near the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with the winner
around the turn, continued on his left lead in the lane and held for the place. ON THIS DAY disputed the early pace from the rail, could not match strides
with the top two nearing the turn, angled out entering the turn, chased two wide and held for the show. TRANSFIGURED lacked early speed, saved ground
and passed tiring rivals. POPLAR AVENUE was reluctant to load, steadied early, chased the pace between rivals, went three wide around the turn and
faded. POET WARRIOR failed to menace while racing two wide. HEARTLAND HIT had brief speed between foes and dropped back three wide around the
turn. ROLLING BROOK chased the pace outside, was bumped entering the turn, raced wide and faded. NOPALITO played no factor while racing five wide.
JEWEL HEIST broke slowly and trailed inside.

Footnotes
GUNTER set the pace three wide, repeatedly came in on foes with the rider looking over his left shoulder down the backstretch, shut off a foe while finally
making it to the rail leaving the three-sixteenths pole, drew clear and held clear under a drive. A IS FOR ARTIST prompted the pace outside of the winner,
continued on his left lead in the lane and settled for second best. GRANDPA LOUIE was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide, lacked a serious
rally but was along for the show. CYCLOBOMB was forced into RICHIE'S B L leaving the half-mile pole, had to steady repeatedly as the winner came in
down the backstretch, checked off that rival's heels near the three-sixteenths pole and had no further bid. THE FRANCHISE was bumped at the start, raced
two wide and never threatened. OCONEE checked just after the start, raced outside and made little impact. RICHIE'S B L was bumped early, had early
speed inside, was forced to steady off heels entering the turn and dropped back inside. The rider of CYCLOBOMB claimed foul against the winner for
interference down the backstretch and near the three-sixteenths pole but the Stewards allowed the original order of finish to stand.

Footnotes
BRIDGING THE GAP sped up between rivals to take the lead leaving the five-eighths pole, set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and just
lasted. STAR OF NIGHT was urged along between rivals early, stalked the pace two wide, drifted out in the lane, closed outside and just missed. DUBAI
WAS LIT steadied off heels entering the first turn, tracked the pace two wide, could not keep pace around the far turn but stayed on to save the show.
MALIBU SPLASH stalked the pace from the rail and came up empty. CANDYFORACAUSE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. LOVE
HAPPY chased the pace three wide and faded around the far turn. RUN ON ENERGY played no factor while racing two and three wide. QUICK ENERGY
was outrun inside. SHANGHAI JEWEL bobbled just after the start, saved ground and played no factor. The rider of DUBAI WAS LIT claimed foul against the
top two finishers for alleged interference entering the first turn but the Stewards found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
PIMM AND PROPER set a clear pace along the rail and held well clear under a drive. KATY THE CAT saved ground in range early, went three wide around
the far turn, never seriously threatened the winner but stayed on for a clear second. U R THE LUCKY ONE stalked the pace two wide, could not keep pace
with the winner around the far turn and lasted for the show. COLETTE'S SPIRIT tracked the pace three wide and lacked a rally. BEYOND PRETTY settled
off the pace two wide, angled to the rail nearing the far turn, lacked room nearing the lane and was not strongly asked once clear in the final sixteenth.
BRAHMA MOMMA saved ground and never threatened. WAKES UP HAPPY was outrun while racing four wide. PAINT ME PRETTY played no factor while
racing three and four wide. MANNA FROM HANNAH made little impact while racing three wide.

first turn, bid two wide into the far turn, stayed on willingly but was unable to reel in the winner. ROYAL BLUE settled off the pace while racing two wide,
advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. MACANAO saved ground well off the early pace, angled out to advance three and four
wide around the far turn and improved position. GEORGE JET saved ground well back and passed tiring rivals. MORE DATA chased the pace inside and
came up empty. THOMAS KNIGHT was outrun while racing three and four wide. NINETYEIGHTTWO was outrun inside. CATONSVILLE vied between the
top two finishers early but was through early. GOODBYESEEULATER got out entering the first turn, raced four wide and made little impact.

COMMCAT stalked the pace two wide, seized command turning for home and drove clear. MAKIN US LOOK GOOD had some early speed three wide but
was allowed to settle back outside around the first turn, made progress three wide around the far turn, continued on her left lead past midstretch, finally
switched leaving the sixteenth pole and rallied to gain the place in the final strides. CHEESE LOUISE was hustled to the front, set the pace along the rail,
was collared turning for home, weakened a bit and lost second late. CELIA'S PRIDE settled off the early pace three wide, advanced outside down the
backstretch, bid nearing the turn, angled to the rail entering the bend and failed to sustain. BUFF N failed to menace while racing two wide. HOW IS SHE
played no factor while racing two wide. SHOOFLY PIE was outrun while racing two and three wide. KIM'S DIAMOND played no factor while racing two and
three wide. KATALIMA was outrun while racing three and four wide. LADY LICIOUS had early speed inside, retreated and was eased.

Footnotes
PARISIAN DIVA set the pace along the rail, shrugged off a bid from the runner-up nearing the lane and readily widened under a drive. AMELIA BEDELIA
stalked the winner two wide in the clear, bid nearing the lane but was repulsed and settled for being clearly second best. CAMERON STREET settled off the
pace while saving ground throughout and rallied for the show. LUCILLE OF TROY had early speed three wide between foes, angled to the rail midway
around the first turn, angled back out three wide near the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. LIES AND SCANDALS saved ground off the early pace,
went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. RIPROARING went three wide around the first turn, saved ground thereafter and made little
impact. SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS chased the pace three wide and tired after a half. NANCY B was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
HE'S ON THE LINE vied two wide down the backstretch, cleared nearing the turn, set the pace along the rail, repulsed a bid from the runner-up and held
firm under left-handed urging. LUFTY'S KISSES had early speed inside of the winner, angled out when that foe cleared nearing the turn, re-bid two wide but
was denied. OFFICER UNBRIDLED flipped in the paddock, ran off from the post parade, was extremely reluctant to load, chased the pace three wide,
lacked a rally but held for the show. JACKLIGHTING chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally. TAKE TIME lacked speed, circled four and five wide
around the turn and passed tiring rivals. PRINCE JACOB failed to menace while racing two wide. GRECIAN ADMIRAL saved ground to no avail.
SOMETHING GREAT was outrun while racing two wide. SIENTE EL SOL unseated the rider and ran loose pre-race, was fractious in the gate then was
outrun while racing three wide. IGOTITNTHEPOCKET was never involved, pulled up in the stretch and walked off.
