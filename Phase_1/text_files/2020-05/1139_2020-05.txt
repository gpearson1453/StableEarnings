Footnotes
RUN TROUBLE RUN set the pace two wide early, cleared and angled in near the five-sixteenths pole, widened around the turn, continued on his left lead in
the lane and held well clear under a drive. ROAD GUARD POST was bumped soon after the start, advanced between foes to reach a stalking position
nearing the far turn, chased the winner two wide and finished evenly to maintain the place. RUTH LESS BLUE had early speed inside of the winner,
dropped back entering the turn, angled three wide near the three-sixteenths pole, lacked the needed rally but held third. INCENSED was in tight leaving the
chute, angled to the rail nearing the turn and could only make a mild gain. GABBI'S AMOR never threatened while racing two wide. BERN CIGARS failed to
menace while racing four wide. SLEEPING GIANT was bumped soon after the start, has some speed between foes and retreated three wide around the
turn. STARRY MESSENGER bobbled at the break then trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
BURREN ROCKS set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the far turn and held clear under a steady drive. ALEPH settled off the early pace while
racing two wide, bid three wide into the far turn, couldn't not seriously threaten the winner but was clearly second best. TIVANO was bit slow into stride,
raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and was along for the show. OCONEE stalked the pace two wide between foes and
came up empty in the lane. PROSPECT TOY tracked the pace from the rail and retreated after a half. UNBELIEVABLE STORY was bumped soon after the
start, stalked the pace three wide and was done after a half. U. S. MILLENNIUM was bumped after the start, went four wide around the first turn and was
through early. SECOND ENCORE raced without front shoes, saved ground throughout and trailed. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WOLFBLADE set a pressured pace along the rail and inched ahead under a steady drive in the lane. GIN N SPICE pressed the winner two wide to upper
stretch, could not quite keep pace with that foe in the drive but lasted for the place. SWEET LADY SUE lacked early speed, raced three wide around the
turn, angled to the far outside in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. MARY'S LISTED NEXT stalked the pace three wide in the clear, continued on his left
lead in the lane and was outkicked. WAY AHEAD OF YOU chased the pace from the rail, continued on his left lead in the drive and lacked the needed rally.
RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW went evenly inside. SMARTY DELIGHT was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start and trailed inside.

FREEDOM IS RINGING broke in a tangle, rushed up outside, advanced in the three path while appearing to try to get out around the turn, seized command
leaving the three-sixteenths pole, drew clear, drifted in through the stretch and held sway. FAREWELL TIME settled off the pace while saving ground,
continued on his left lead in the lane, rallied inside, angled out in deep stretch as the winner came in and ran out of ground. EUTAW STREET tracked the
pace two wide and finished evenly to maintain the show. WINDSOR LEGEND set the pace along the rail, was collared near the three-sixteenths pole and
weakened. TRUE HEIR trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
GREELEY AND ARIANA was bumped at the start, settled off the pace two wide, cruised up two wide around the far turn, swept to the front in upper stretch,
continued on her left lead and quickly drew off. YODEL LADY stalked the pace two wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, cleared and angled
in near the quarter pole, led to upper stretch, could not resist the winner but finished willingly to be clearly second best. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG was
devoid of speed while racing off the rail, circled four wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. CALCUTTA raced in range three wide, advanced three
wide around the far turn, angled in in upper stretch and weakened. DI COLAS COWGIRL raced two wide in midpack early, gained between rivals around
the turn then flattened out in the lane. LINE OF ROSES bumped with the winner at the start then played no further factor while racing three wide. DEAR
JOHN LETTER had early speed inside but was through early. DAM LOCKS was fractious in the gate, set a clear pace along the rail and retreated after a
half. BUCKS COUNTY was outrun inside.
