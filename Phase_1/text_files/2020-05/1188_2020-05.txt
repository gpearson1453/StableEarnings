Footnotes
JUNGLE WARFARE lagged behind the field to the turn, commenced a rally into the bend while in the four path, swung to the six path turning for home to
circle the field, rallied outside of rivals to make a bid at the furlong pole, and got up in the late stages. HEAVY ROLLER raced in the three path in midpack,
was asked to inch forward with right handed pressure passing the half mile pole, came into the lane in the three path behind the leaders before tipping out to
the four path in upper stretch, rallied between horses through the lane as JUNGLE WARFARE ranged up along side, but was outfinished by that foe in the
late stages. SUPER DUDE pressed the leading duelers from their outside, vied between horses in upper stretch, but was outkicked by his outer rivals at the
furlong pole. LUSITANO dueled two wide between horses, held a narrow margin turning for home from outer foes after putting away his inner rival at the five
sixteenths pole, but was headed at the furlong pole, then was outfinished for show. EBBEN raced far off of the pace in the two path, advanced to be behind
the leading group into the turn, patiently waited for racing room from the five sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, shifted outwards in upper stretch, but lacked
racing room between HEAVY ROLLER and JUNGLE WARFARE at the three sixteenths pole, altered course inwards at the furlong pole, but flattened out
when inside of rivals in deep stretch. FORT PECK stalked along the inside, came off of the rail to pass the weakening early leader at the five sixteenths
pole, but came up empty thereafter and weakened. CURLIN RULES dueled inside of a pair of rivals early on, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole and
subsequently faded. SHIVERMETIMBERS saved ground while far off of the pace, but weakened into the turn.

Footnotes
CAZADERO was unruly in the post parade, got hustled out of the gate to show speed, dueled inside of KNICKS FRONT into the turn while staying a bit off
of the rail through the bend, repelled that foe in upper stretch when called upon, accelerated with an imposing kick and drew off approaching the furlong
pole, then was ridden out to the wire. GYPSY KING was bumped behind early on, recovered to be forwardly placed in the three path into the turn, shifted to
the four path while advancing outside of the dueling leaders turning for home, made a place bid at the three sixteenths pole while proving no match for the
leader, then secured that position through deep stretch. MEDICINE TAIL saved ground in midpack, came into the lane in the two path, then shifted to the
three path at the furlong pole to vie for minor rewards while hanging on his left lead. NAUTILUS was outsprinted early on, saved ground while far off of the
pace, improved along the inside before shifting to the four path at the eighth pole, and offered a mild late kick. PAQUIME vied between horses early on, but
failed to keep pace at the half mile pole, chased the dueling leaders from the inside through the turn, but lacked a rally along the rail through the lane.
REALLY SLOW was coaxed along while racing off of the pace in the four path, came into the lane inthe six path, but hung on her left lead and had no rally.
SMOOTH MUSIC shifted from the three to the five path in upper stretch, but lugged in while hanging on his left lead through the lane, then shied from
NAUTILUS at the sixteenth pole. KNICKS FRONT rushed to vie three wide early on, dueled outwide of the eventual winner in the three path around the turn,
but was repelled by that foe in upper stretch and weakened. ORB OF THE BORO was bumped early and outrun. DAUER was jostled between horses early
on, then was outrun. EL CASADORA raced far off of the pace in the two to three path and was never involved.

Footnotes
HOMEVIEW was forwardly placed along the inside, surged through a wide rail opening turning for home to bid for the lead inside of the leader in upper
stretch, dueled with that rival through the lane under a long drive, and won the headbob with that foe at the wire. FLIGHT TIME (BRZ) set the pace from the
onset while staying a path or two off of the rail, dug in in upper stretch while leaving the rail open for HOMEVIEW, who made a bid for the lead turning for
home, held a slight advantage through the lane from that rival, but lost the photo for win at the wire. MOST MISCHIEF stalked three wide while in the four
path early on before inching forward to vie for the lead outside of rivals into the turn, continued to contend through the lane, but did not have enough to
catch the leader. OLD TIMER'S DAY stalked from the two path, came under a drive turning for home, shifted to the three path for racing room while right
behind the leaders and inside of MOST MISCHIEF, lacked a kick to split FIGHT TIME (BRZ) and MOST MISCHIEF in the late stages as there was ample
racing room, but saw that room close up passing the sixteenth pole, and was wrapped up late. GUSKA MON SHOES saved ground after coming under a
drive into the turn, shifted to the five path at the furlong pole, and finsihed up mildly. CHAMPSACHAMP raced in the six path around the turn while outside of
rivals, and made no impact. FRIDAYNITESTAR prompted the pace and vied between horses while in the three path, but weakened in upper stretch. RED
BLUE AND TRUE waited for racing room into the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but had no rally. MY PROPHET raced in midpack in the two
path, but weakened. LIL MATEO was bounced around between horses at the start and showed little. BUD RO raced midpack in the five path, but
weakened.

Footnotes
PADDY O'DINI saved ground while stalking right behind the leaders, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, bid the for the lead at the furlong marker, and
won going away under driving pressure. ROARING FORK prompted the pace two wide between horses, vied around the turn, forged an advantage turning
for home, but was headed by PADDY O'DINI at the furlong pole, yielded in the final sixteenth, and held place. ITS YES shifted from the two to the four path
around the turn before swinging to the six path to be outside of the leading group in upper stretch, angled back to the four path at the furlong pole as
DARREN'S FORTUNE drifted outwards, then rallied mildly inside of that foe to edge show in deep stretch. DARREN'S FORTUNE advanced to stalk the
pace four wide into the turn, made a four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with inner rivals in upper stretch, drifted outwards at the
furlong pole, and got outfinished for show. ZING ZANG trailed along the inside, shifted to the four path at the furlong pole, but was no menace. WARRIOR'S
DREAM saved ground in midpack, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and was no factor. TOM MANAGEMENT vied three wide between horses into
the turn, but weakened between horses approaching the quarter pole. FIGHTING FOR GRACE was far off of the pace in the four path and was not a factor.
COWORKER failed to make an impact from the three path. DOOLEY failed to get involved after taking the turn in the three path. VICTORY ELEMENT set
the pace early on, held an advantage inside of a trio of foes into the turn, but stopped at the quarter pole and was eased through the lane.

SHACKLEFORD'S JOY stalked the pace early, made a bid into the lane, took over command in the stretch, was under a long drive while between horses,
came out and bothered MISHKO twice then held off SUGOI in the final stages. SUGOI vied for the lead early along the inside, backed off the pace a bit
along the backstretch, was in the three path into the lane, angled back down to the rail in the stretch under a bid and a long drive but did not have enough in
the final stages. MISHKO chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid three wide in the stretch but was bothered twice and hung in
the final stages. FORTHELUVOFBOURBON raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. MEMORABLE chased
the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. SELF TAUGHT was squeezed at the start and
raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and improved position in the stretch drive. SPECIAL DAY was never a threat. AUTOMATE was
never a factor. RIVER FINN vied for the lead early while two wide, took over command along the backstretch, was off the rail into the lane and empty in the
stretch run. BAHAMA CHANNEL was through after three quarters.

clear in the final stages. RIA MUNK set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and yielded late in the stretch run. DREAMALILDREAMOFU pressed
the pace early while two wide, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch while drifting out through the drive. STRONG FLAG

stayed on the inside into the lane and faded late in the stretch. HARMONY VICTORY was in the second flight from between horses, raced off the rail into
the lane and was empty late in the stretch. TEMPERS RISING was never a threat. CHEROKEE MAIDEN was in the second flight while three wide, raced

the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. ALEX'S STRIKE trailed the field early on, was in the six path into the
lane and improved position. IRISH SPIRIT chased the pace early, was bumped entering the lane from the rail while making a bid but faded late in the
stretch. TO THE FRONT was bothered at the start, stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and was empty late. THE BIG BLUFF was
bumped at the start and no threat. ANIMATE came in at the start and was done early. UNCLE MOMO set the pace early, was bumped entering the lane and
