Footnotes
A BEAUTIFUL DAY tucked in behind the leaders for nearly six furlongs, was guided out three wide for clearance at the top of the stretch, caught HALFY
from outside a sixteenth out, and edged SUBTLE JOY to the wire. SUBTLE JOY bumped lightly with ALL AMERICAN JEWEL at the start, stayed close
between horses early, remained covered up and in some traffic nearing the quarter-pole, swung four wide and closed gamely outside the winner. BETTIN
ONNA KITTEN was outrun for six furlongs, cut the corner advancing into the lane, got steered off the rail with a furlong remaining and was gaining too late
outside the top two. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL bumped lightly with SUBTLE JOY at the start, steadied slightly inside going to the first turn, improved mildly
awaiting room on the rail around the far turn, came to the two-path straightening away, moved back to the fence and rallied through tight quarters. HALFY
pressed the pace outside SYLLABUS, took over after six furlongs, edged clear turning for home, but gave way through the late stages overrun from both
sides. NATIONALIST raced four wide into the first turn before moving in a bit, idled lacking a response three wide on the far turn, and went by tired horses
after the fact. DELIA'S PRIDE raced four wide on the turns, and lacked a rally. MALAGA raced in or near the two-path much of the way, and failed to
menace. SYLLABUS set the early pace inside, and retreated once displaced for command on the far turn. DAMA DE NOCHE was floated out to the
five-path outside NATIONALIST early, moved up on the far outside up the backstretch, and was finished after six furlongs. AMERICAN COUNTESS raced
three wide and was all done after a half-mile.

Footnotes
JUST RIGHT MIKE broke alertly and pressed the pace outside CARSON CITY KID, reached the front at the top of the stretch, and prevailed through a long
drive. CARSON CITY KID took the lead with a sharp start, lost the advantage to JUST RIGHT MIKE turning for home, but ran on stubbornly on the rail.
RESTORED ORDER advanced three wide on the turn, loomed outside the leaders after straightening away, lugged in greenly and weakened late.
GABRIELLA SUNSHINE brushed the left side of the gate and bumped with BAILEY at the start, raced three then four wide around the turn, and posed no
threat with an even finish. BAILEY steadied and was shuffled back along the rail entering the turn, moved out and could not gain on the far outside. DR
PARKER bumped with CHASING ARTIE at the start, and was outsprinted. CHASING ARTIE bumped with DR PARKER at the start, moved in putting
BAILEY in tight entering the turn, and faded steadily after a quarter-mile.

PROBABLY GRACE followed behind the leaders into the turn, slipped through on the rail to take over with a nifty move at the top of the stretch, drove clear
and was geared down 70 yards out. BLUE BLUE ICE was outrun to the stretch, found her best stride late and rallied into second outside. SIZZLING ROMA
advanced outside the leaders to loom a threat after a half-mile, but flattened out in the stretch. PEACE CONTROL had aim three wide late on the turn, but
faded through the drive. MARCHING IN vied inside MIZ CHAPLIN for a half-mile, left the rail open for the winner into the lane, and faltered through the late
stages. MIZ CHAPLIN brushed with TONG SHU and was pushed out a bit at the start, went up to vie for command outside MARCHING IN, and gave way
between horses into the stretch. TONG SHU broke out brushing with MIZ CHAPLIN at the start, and was through early four wide.

Footnotes
JEEKER JOE got bumped by OROSCOPO at the start, went along covered up for nearly six furlongs, shifted to the four-path being set down into the
stretch, ran by FAYEZ from outside with a sixteenth to go and pulled clear. MOUNTAIN BREEZE saved ground unhurried to the far turn, waited for room
past the quarter-pole and into upper stretch, found a seam approaching the furlong marker after the winner went by, and finished well too late. BELLAS
FELLA raced in the second flight from the outset, raced three wide around the far turn still well back, and rallied outside to get up for third. FAYEZ set the
pace inside, and weakened on the rail through the last eighth of a mile. OROSCOPO broke in bumping JEEKER JOE at the start, prompted the pace
outside FAYEZ, and yielded through the late stages. RAGS FOR BRITCHES dropped back after an alert beginning, came six wide off the far turn and made
no impact. SEVERUS sat behind the leaders on hold for six furlongs, and was empty inside through the stretch. ALPERES saved ground well back for six
furlongs, and checked on the rail behind SEVERUS in upper stretch. SKY'S SON bumped with MOUNTAIN BREEZE at the start, steadied in traffic
approaching the first turn, stayed close to the end of the far turn, and tired in the five-path. IMPERIAL GUARD prompted the pace three wide, and gave way
through the lane. TITERE hit the left side of the gate and was off slow, raced four wide early, and faded five wide approaching the stretch.

NEW YORK'S FINEST vied briefly outside KYLE before clearing to the lead near the turn, saved ground going comfortably to the stretch, and maintained
firm control under pressure. KYLE broke sharply and contested the early pace inside, got outsprinted to the turn and eased back to go around, gave futile
chase from outside the rest of the way and was much best of the others. CHIEF WHITE SOX raced two then three wide around the turn, and was clear of
the rest with an even finish. R BOY BODE was outsprinted for early position inside, moved out three wide before reaching the turn, and lacked a solid
response. THE ZIP ZIP MAN moved inside entering the turn, and faded after three-eighths of a mile. PHANTOM RO steadied and was shuffled back on the
rail early on the turn, and never recovered. YEAR OF THE KITTEN lacked speed inside. G Q COVERUP went to his knees stumbling badly at the start, and
jogged in well behind the field.

BARDOT pressed the pace three wide from the outset, wrested command in upper stretch and edged away, remained clear past the sixteenth-pole and had
just enough to hang on. KOZY DREAMS got shuffled back out of the leading group near the five-eighths pole, settled off the top trio shifting out four wide
after a half-mile, gained while drifting out and came up a stride short. COMMANDING LADY brushed with GRANNY BRADLEY at the start, contested the
pace between horses for a half-mile, and weakened through the stretch on the wrong lead. GRANNY BRADLEY brushed with COMMANDING LADY at the
start, vied for command inside rivals for a half, and yielded on the rail in the lane. HARMONIC THUNDER was no factor three wide. LUCY'S INTEREST was
outrun four wide. KHOZANA got shut off behind KOZY DREAMS and lost her action past the five-eighths, and dropped far back after a half. MAY DAY INFO
showed little inside, and jogged in far behind.

ENLISTING was four wide into the turn before moving in a bit, closed in outside NOTHINS FREE after six furlongs, took over in upper stretch and drew
away under pressure. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR chased outside the pacesetter into the turn, got out-moved by ENLISTING turning for home, but collared
NOTHINS FREE nearing the eighth-pole and ran on well clear for the place. NOTHINS FREE sped clear early, surrendered to ENLISTED soon after
completing six furlongs, and saved third on the rail. NIGHT WATCH raced forwardly three wide to the turn, and lacked the needed response through the
lane. KINDHEARTED KOTA bumped lightly with MYFRANCESCA at the start, lagged well back to the stretch, and passed tired horses. MYFRANCESCA
bumped lightly with KINDHEARTED KOTA at the start, and faded gradually inside. LEDECKY saved ground outrun for six furlongs, moved to the far outside
and dropped far back in the stretch. AMALUNA was finished early inside.

Footnotes
ARITHMETIC prompted the pace from close range in the two-path, moved to the rail around the far turn, bid inside BAYOU PROSPECTOR through the
furlong grounds and prevailed in a mad dash to the wire. DYNADRIVE entered the backstretch in the five-path, moved up widest to the far turn, remained
well out in the course turning for home, loomed late in the four-path and just missed between horses. CAPTAIN D was reserved toward the inside early,
moved off the rail on the far turn, shifted to the five-path rallying through the lane and was gaining between foes in a frantic finish. BAYOU PROSPECTOR
was nursed along setting a moderate pace slightly removed from the rail, stayed on with good courage but was ultimately overhauled from both flanks.
MANDATE lagged well back early inside, shifted out in the drive and was closing in from the six-path too late. DOMINATE THEMOMENT raced four wide on
the first turn, stayed in the four-path reaching a short lead turning for home, but was outkicked past the eighth-pole. MONTANA MAN saved ground under a
firm hold early, and gained some ground late without threatening. SAINT BENEVOLENCE prompted the pace three wide to the stretch, and faded through
upper stretch. LURE HIM IN lost position around the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and gained belatedly on the rail. RHYTHM SECTION fought
rating between horses in the three-path on the first turn, checked off the heels of DYNADRIVE early up the backstretch, and was empty widest in the
stretch.

Footnotes
JESUS' TEAM pressed the pace between horses, took over after six furlongs, and drew off under heavy pressure to 70 yards out. FRANK FIRST advanced
under a drive four wide approaching the stretch, was no threat to the winner but bested the others decisively. DIZZY SIGHT came under a ride inside before
reaching the turn, could not keep pace with the leaders, and plugged along late in the four-path to be a distant third. FLUTE MAKER raced three wide on the
turn, moved further out in the stretch and was up for the last major share. MATURIN came wide off the turn far back, and angled to the rail through the
furlong grounds passing tired horses. DUELLIST showed little inside. SMASH set the early pace inside, and yielded readily after five furlongs. BLUERIDGE
MOUNTAIN pressed the pace three wide, could not match strides with the winner after six furlongs, and faltered through the drive.

Footnotes
R HAPPY ENDING rushed up to get the lead after the start, showed the way inside to the stretch, and dug in late to preserve the decision. CHARMAINE'S
MIA applied pressure outside R HAPPY ENDING from the start, and stayed on stubbornly between horses. HIDDEN FACTS chased three wide all the way,
and ran on willingly outside the top two. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL raced four wide around the turn, and could not pick up any of the leading trio while
attempting to lug in through the lane. LADY GRACE raced between horses around the turn in midpack, and lacked a solid rally. ORIGINATOR was
outsprinted to the turn inside, moved out for the drive and could not make an impact. MAGIC SPELL was no factor three wide. SANITY moved out widest in
the stretch and failed to make her presence felt. NIKEE KAN stayed fairly close early, hugged the rail and faded steadily inside.

Footnotes
NOBLE ALMA settled in range of the early leaders, advanced in the two-path around the far turn, tipped to the three-path getting her cue at the top of the
lane, lugged in briefly but was corrected and stayed on task, and forged to the front outside rivals in deep stretch. QUIET COMPANY prompted the pace
outside FLORADO, wrested command in mid stretch, and fought gamely to the finish. OCEAN FIRE tucked in off the leaders for six furlongs, was boxed in
through upper stretch, moved out after NOBLE ALMA went by, and was gaining too late. FLORADO set the pace inside to the stretch, and weakened on the
rail. MISS FLYING SUN saved ground outrun for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and improved mildly. DELANCEY'S PHILLY got pushed out by
BLAZINONBAYOU into the first turn, moved up outside rivals through the middle stages, but lacked a solid finishing kick. NOBLE ENTERPRISE lacked
room behind BLAZINONBAYOU after the start, and never reached contention. COURTED raced three wide, and was finished before completing six
furlongs. BLAZINONBAYOU broke out in front of NOBLE ENTERPRISE, was hard to handle into the first turn herding out rivals, and was through early.
NATURELL (ECU) was slow into stride, and showed little. SUMMER SHORE was pushed out entering the first turn outside DELANCEY'S PHILLY, and was
never in the hunt.
