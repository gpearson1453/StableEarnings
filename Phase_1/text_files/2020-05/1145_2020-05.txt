FIFTEEN LOVE BACK went around the first turn in the two to three path, settled on the outside, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn,
rallied five wide into the stretch under a drive, closed strongly to take the lead before the furlong marker, drifted out under a left-handed whip while in front
nearing the sixteenth-pole then was straightened by the rider, went back to the left-handed whip before being switched to a right-handed whip late and
prevailed under strong handling. HARDLY SEEN SLIM was well placed on the inside, drafted behind the leader while moving into the two path on the far
turn, was blocked from the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole and checked off heels in the process, came out while trying to rally into upper stretch, bumped
soundly with SATELLITE as that foe came out nearing the furlong marker, clipped the heels of that opponent then steadied and altered course to the
outside, regained momentum into the final sixteenth and gained with good courage but missed while clear for the place in a very troubled trip. SATELLITE
leaned out at the start and was last to commence, went around the first turn in the two path, moved out near five-eighths pole then advanced while making a
middle move, was urged along while four then three wide on the far turn, made a bid just inside the five-sixteenths, took the lead into the stretch, came out
and bumped soundly with HARDLY SEEN SLIM nearing the furlong marker then had that foe clip her heels and weakened while able to get the show.
FUSAICHI FLAME veered out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, was ridden along while four to five wide
on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BANKROLL BEN moved up to take the lead, was well rated while setting the
pace, went around the far turn in the two path, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths, relinquished the lead into the stretch and gave way. RIKER
went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, dropped back after steadying nearing the
quarter-pole, came out five wide into the stretch and capitulated. KRUSIN FOR GOLD dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the
pace, was hard ridden while inside to the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. GOLD BACKED was reluctant to load, raced in the three path on the
turns and was no factor. Following the race, the stewards posted the inquiry sign and the rider of HARDLY SEEN SLIM claimed foul against FIFTEEN LOVE
BACK for alleged interference in the stretch. After the stewards' review, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
KASILOF brushed with a rival at the start while hustled, showed good speed, disputed the pace on the outside of a foe while loosely between horses, vied in
the two path on the turn, was guided with a bit of extra left-rein pressure late on that bend, kicked clear when set down in upper stretch, drifted out near the
sixteenth-pole while well in front, had the rider drop the right rein and go to a right-handed whip then was held together in the shadow of the wire while much
the best. ZBIG was urged along off the pace, raced in the four path on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch and
clearly earned the place while no match for the winner. BEAU GOSSE brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, came out three
then four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while up for the show. BATTALSTOWN was ridden along at the
rear, went four then five wide early on the turn, dropped to the three path near the quarter-pole then the two path shortly thereafter and failed to threaten.
FIST pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and tired. FLYIN' EASY was sent
hard from the start, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied inside that foe while near the rail on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and

Footnotes
TRUE CASTLE was forwardly placed on the outside, came under urging while four wide on the turn, made a bid between horses into upper stretch, led into
the final furlong and held under strong urging. SILVER CITY TRICK moved out midway down the backstretch, started the turn in the three path, moved to
four then five wide later on that bend, gained into upper stretch and finished well to just miss while clear for the place. WISHFUL QUALITY disputed the
pace on the outside, vied three then two wide on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show. AL
SHAMKHAH broke a step slow, bumped with a foe after the start, was urged along on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn and improved position for
the last spot in the superfecta. FINAL FORM reared at the start and was off slow, settled on the outside, advanced four then five wide on the turn, made a
bid into upper stretch but tired. LOOKIN SHARP contested the pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn and gave way. TAKE CHARGE
GAL bumped with a rival after the start, settled off the pace, was urged along while two then three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a strong
drive and failed to rally. LIL TATER was off slow and spotted the front many lengths, dropped well behind, rounded the turn in the two path, angled eight
wide into upper stretch and was no factor. LEMON DROP KITTY was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to respond. BIG TINY was urged along towards the back, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. BOLD
LEGEND tossed her head at the start, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and never reached contention. SPUN LINE
contested the pace between horses, dropped back leaving the backstretch and retreated.
