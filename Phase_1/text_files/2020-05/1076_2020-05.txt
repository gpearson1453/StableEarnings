Footnotes
FRIEND OF DUBAI showed the most early speed to gain inside position about the two path, drew clear into the turn and drew off in the lane under steady
handling. FASHION FACT chased the winner three wide and could not go with that one while holding position. BEHOLD DE FLAME bobbled at the break to
get away last, moved nearest the top pair into the lane then could only make a mild bid at the place horse late. WITTS LUCKY SHOES was bumped at the
start then lacked a closing bid four and five wide. SUPERSERG saved ground and lacked a rally. UN NAMEABLE STREET chased the pace two wide and
weakened. YOUNGBOY broke inward to bump with a rival and failed to threaten outside. MAGGIES PATROIT chased the leaders four wide and weakened.

HOLIDAY CLOVER showed the most early speed about the three path, shook off a bid from TEMPLE CITY DARLIN into the lane and held clear under
steady handling. TEMPLE CITY DARLIN moved along the inside to bid inside the winner turning for home but could not go with that one in the drive.
JAFMIL'S INFERNO saved ground and rallied to gain third but could not threaten the top pair. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY chased the winner three or four wide
and lacked a closing rally. FRIGIDISH chased from four wide and weakened.

CONTRABAND stumbled at the break but recovered to show in front right away, gained inside position about the two path and held safe through the lane.
COLLEGE PARTY was along the inside to get nearest the winner into the lane but could not close the gap in the drive. LANGS LEGEND hopped at the
break, chased the winner three or four wide and lacked a final closing run. PRIMARILY GOLD fanned five wide into the lane and could not threaten late.
SILIS saved ground and improved position but lacked a solid closing bid. FEARLESS KITTY was three wide in the turn, angled out into the lane and
weakened. HYPERBOLIZER was not a factor. CALL A COP was not a factor. G MAN IS IN TOWN was caught in tight between rivals racing on to the main
track and steadied and always trailed.

I'M LUCKY made the pace on a short lead about the two or three path, kicked clear through the far turn then held safe late. BRETT'S BOY rallied inside
through the far turn, moved outside the winner in the drive and slowly closed but could not reach that one. I CALL SHOTGUN tracked the pace three or four
wide and could not produce the needed late run. E LEE saved ground and moved up but could not threaten. WILLOWY DANSEUR failed to mount a serious
bid three or four wide. HEWHOFILLSMYHEART was not a threat four wide. TOBIN was always back. RAZORBACK RED lunged at the break, pressed the
early pace three wide and gave way in the turn.
