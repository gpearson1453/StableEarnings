CONEJOS broke out and bumped ROUGH PASSAGE, reserved while a bit off the rail, went two wide into the turn then tipped out leaving the bend, rallied
inside the top pair and drew clear late. ACHIEVED dueled from the inside, two wide exiting the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, inched away from FANCY
TERRACE but offered no resistance to the winner in the final sixteenth. ROUGH PASSAGE bumped at the start, stalked from the inside into and around the
turn, lost the whip at the eighth pole and edged rival for the show under hand urging. FANCY TERRACE dueled outside a rival into and around the turn,
came three wide into the lane, drifted out at the top of the stretch and weakened in the late stages. CANNES traveled outside a rival in the early going, four
wide into the turn then five wide exiting and could not rally. P TOWN TITAN tracked off the rail, raced three wide then four wide into the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN N. BARRON stalked outside the top pair, bid outside into the turn, took over from the three path entering the stretch, dug in late and prevailed.
SANTALUZ DREAMIN set the pace with company to the outside, led from the two path entering the turn, dueled with CAPTAIN N. BARRON around the turn
and down the stretch, fought gamely to the wire but and proved second best. YODELERS WAY pressed the pace outside the leader then between rivals
nearing the turn, chased the top pair four wide into the stretch and went evenly through the final furlong. VERYNSKY traveled along the inside to the stretch
and lacked the needed response. SATORI stalked from off the rail, pulled the rider from the three eighths pole to the quarter pole, lugged out around the
turn and weakened in the drive. LOST THE MINISTER raced off the rail from off the pace, went outside a rival then carried wide by that foe around the turn
and tired entering the stretch. Due to a timer malfunction the third race was hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.

CIRCULODEGANADORAS stalked, bid outside, 4wide into stretch, flattened. ROCK ALL DAY inside, bumped, checked 3/8, 3-4wide, lugged in stretch.
MIKA THE MISTRESS between, forced in, bumped 3/8, inside, weakened. There was a rider's claim of foul made by the jockey aboard ROCK ALL DAY
against the winner, TACY, alleging interference near the three-eighths pole. After a review, the Stewards ruled that although TACY intimidated MIKA THE
MISTRESS into ROCK ALL DAY, the incident did not change the outcome of the race and there would be no change.
