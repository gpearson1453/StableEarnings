Footnotes
MR. DAZZLE, outside early, advanced widest turn, rallied, took over mid stretch, drew out. STONE CARVER took a short clear lead inside early, had
outside pressure from mid turn, shook bid rival passing eighth pole, drifted out mildly, gave way mid stretch. PLENTIFUL stalked off rail, finished well
between horses. TIGER BY HIS TAIL stalked wide, was steadied in late turn when the winner went by to his outside, rallied. SHIMSHINE trailed to stretch,
rallied belatedly. CLIPBOARD MONEY pressed outside, forced issue mid turn, bid eighth pole, tired. DELVECCHIO, well placed off rail, made an inside bid
to mid stretch, tired. FINALLY GOTTCHA stalked pressured pace inside, tired stretch. The rider aboard CLIPBOARD MONEY lodged a claim of foul against
STONE CARVER for interference passing the eighth pole. The rider aboard TIGER BY HIS TAIL lodged a claim of foul against MR. DAZZLE for
interference in late turn. There was no change in either case.
