Footnotes
NOBLE MARIA raced three wide around the turn, rallied through the final furlong while drifting out, and was along outside DONA CAMILE with 70 yards
remaining. DONA CAMILE bumped with HONOLUA BAY at the start, pressed the early pace outside, took over outside MARIES MELODY late on the turn,
drew clear into the stretch, and could not hold on while drifting out. WONDER BLONDY was sluggish early, remained well back to the stretch, and rallied
between horses for a share. CULTIVATION was under a drive three wide on the turn, and shortened stride through the stretch on the wrong lead. MARIES
MELODY vied for command to late on the turn, and gave way. HONOLUA BAY stumbled at the start and bumped with DONA CAMILE, and was finished
after a half-mile. BUSINESSINDUBAI set the early pace inside, stopped on the turn, was eased up by the top of the stretch, and walked off. This race was
hand timed.

Footnotes
PALADIO moved fast three wide late on the turn, took over outside MAMBA ON THREE in upper stretch, and drove clear staying on his left lead. MAMBA
ON THREE dueled for command inside FUN LOADED, got the best of that dispute while being collared by PALADIO turning for home, and saved second
on the rail. HEAVENLY BLESSING got shuffled back inside the leaders entering the turn, moved out for the drive and offered a mild response to get up for
the show. MIDNIGHT TRAVELER briefly lost his footing at the break, chased three wide around the turn, and finished evenly on the far outside. FUN
LOADED was outdueled by MAMBA ON THREE by late on the turn, and faded in upper stretch. TURPIAL hit the left side of the gate at the start, raced two
to three wide on the turn, and could not reach contention. CATCHING FISH showed little. END ALL GET ALL was off a beat slow, and was far back
throughout.

Footnotes
MIXTECA tracked the leaders three wide, wrested command outside AERODYNAMIC turning for home, and lugged in while moving well clear past the
furlong marker. AERODYNAMIC set the pace inside, was no match for the winner through upper stretch, moved outside and ran on best of the others.
ETANA lagged well back early, swung five wide off the turn, and rallied to go clear of the rest. ELITE APPEAL pressed the pace outside AERODYNAMIC,
and gave way before completing six furlongs. BEASAICHI was crowded and bumped at the start by GENERIC MARK, raced widest up the backstretch, and
posed no threat. ABARRIO FOREVER moved up mildly after a half-mile, shifted out four wide through the turn and faded steadily. SNOW AND LILLYLYNN
leapt in the air at the start, saved ground fairly close early, and dropped far back after six furlongs. GENERIC MARK broke out bumping and crowding
BEASAICHI, dropped far back before reaching the stretch, and jogged in.

Footnotes
I'M A ROCKSTAR was innermost of several rivals vying up front early, shook off a bid from VICTORY CRUSADE turning for home, and drew off under a
drive. VICTORY CRUSADE stayed close outside early, moved menacingly to the leaders four wide after a half-mile, could not stay with I'M A ROCKSTER
into the lane, but ran on with good courage to retake second. FAST FRACTION was slow into stride, got strung out five or six wide through the turn, and
rallied outside to go clear of the rest. MIRANDA SOFIA moved up inside after a half-mile, but flattened out through the furlong grounds.
PERFECTCOMBINATION followed behind the front flight in the two-path, moved to the rail for the drive and lacked a solid bid. QUEEN LETIZIA raced three
to four wide around the turn, and was no threat. NATIONALIST faded four wide after a half. AUBURN contested the pace from the outset, but faltered
leaving the turn. SURPRISE ARRIVAL battled with the early leaders between horses, got shuffled back and steadied early on the turn, and dropped back.
MUSIC CITY WOLF broke out bumping RACK DADDY, and was outrun. RACK DADDY got sandwiched between MUSIC CITY WOLF and STORM DELITE
and steadied back at the start, and was far back inside. STORM DELITE bumped with RACK DADDY at the start, dropped back to trail after a half and
jogged in.

Footnotes
AMADORA broke to the lead, raced in the two-path being attended to from both sides on the first turn, went clear up the backstretch and moved inside,
settled into the stretch still well in command, and was all out to hang on. AWESOME ELLA got bumped by JEANIE'S ANGEL at the start, raced four wide
around the first turn within range, moved up in the three-path after six furlongs, rallied determinedly through the lane and was getting to the winner from
outside. AIZU prompted the pace inside for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late response. INDEPENDENT MISS raced forwardly early three wide, and
weakened between horses late on the far turn. JEANIE'S ANGEL broke out bumping AWESOME ELLA, was rank under restraint behind the leaders early,
drifted wide with nothing left approaching the stretch, and jogged in.

Footnotes
JOE DI BAGGIO was a step slow at the start, raced well off the early pace inside, angled to the far outside beginning to hit his best stride turning for home,
drifted out past the middle of the track and was along in time. TIP SHEET broke a step slow brushing with HE'S SMOKIN HOT, recovered to a favorable
position tracking the dueling leaders on the turn, ranged up three wide to wrest command in deep stretch, but was overhauled near the finish. KAREN'S
COVE vied for command outside HE IZ GONE from the outset, and weakened in mid stretch. HE IZ GONE battled for the lead inside KAREN'S COVE from
the start, and gave way in the late stages. MUSTANG CAT raced close up three wide early, and faded after a half-mile. HE'S SMOKIN HOT brushed with
TIP SHEET at the start, and was outrun in the two-path. FIVES WILD was outrun inside.

Footnotes
REBELDE broke out bumping GENGHIS, moved to a contending position three wide after a half-mile, took over outside ST JOE VIPER before completing
six furlongs, and drew off under a drive. GENGHIS got sandwiched at the start between REBELDE and PRINCE KHOZAN, brushed and bumped with the
latter repeatedly leaving the chute and ultimately took up plummeting from midpack to last near the three-quarter pole, split horses roused early on the turn,
advanced four wide as the only threat to REBELDE at the top of the stretch, could not get to that one and ran on clearly second best. ST JOE VIPER
contested the pace inside for nearly six furlongs, weakened into the lane but had enough to remain clear for the show. NEVERSTOPDREAMING hit the left
side of the gate and was bumped between QUALITY ON TAP and AWESOME PARTY at the start, vied between the latter and ST JOE VIPER before letting
those two go after a quarter-mile, stayed close to the end of the turn and gave way. FLUTE MAKER raced two wide and was finished after six furlongs.
PRINCE KHOZAN hit the left side of the gate coming out and bumped a few times with GENGHIS after the start, jousted with the latter brushing and
bumping repeatedly entering the main track, and was finished soon after going a half-mile. QUALITY ON TAP bumped with NEVERSTOPDREAMING at the
start, raced four to five wide around the turn, and dropped far back. AWESOME PARTY bumped with NEVERSTOPDREAMING at the start, vied outside ST
JOE VIPER, gave way before going six furlongs, and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
CRUMB BUN came away alertly and pressed FLASHING DIAMOND from outside, took over after a half-mile, drew clear through upper stretch and widened
while swapping leads a couple times late. BARGAINAIRE saved ground edging closer to the leaders around the turn, got through a tight space on the rail in
upper stretch and rallied with good courage. SKY CHASER was under a drive to stay close by the five-sixteenths, moved into second through the furlong
grounds but was outfinished for that spot. ARCHUMYBABY was slow into stride and devoid of speed to the stretch, and passed tired horses on the far
outside. MIDTOWN ROSE was right there early inside FLASHING DIAMOND and CRUMB BUN before letting them go, moved off the inside continuing up
the backstretch, wound up boxed in on the turn when SKY CHASER came along to her outside, put in a mild run when clear into the stretch, but flattened
out. FLASHING DIAMOND dueled early inside CRUMB BUN, yielded after a half, and faltered through the lane.

Footnotes
DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB slipped through on the rail quickly seizing command near the five-sixteenths, drew clear approaching the stretch and was hand
urged without an anxious moment. SHEZ STUCK UP advanced around the turn four wide, shifted in a couple paths turning for home, and remained clear for
the place. PRINCESS AVRIL raced three wide around the turn, lacked a solid bid but was best of the others. WILD ABOUT THIS got bumped by
BORROWED ANGEL just after the start, trailed to the end of the turn, angled to the far outside and improved position. FURY SONG came in for several
strides bumping BORROWED ANGEL and pushing that one into WILD ABOUT THIS, came four wide off the turn and could not gain. KHOZANA vied for
command two then three wide early, and faded steadily after three furlongs. TWINKIESANDTURNIPS was outrun inside. PARTY DRESS vied early inside
KHOZAN, got overrun from both flanks late on the turn, took up off heels trying to get out past the quarter-pole, and dropped back steadily. BORROWED
ANGEL got bumped and pushed into WILD ABOUT THIS by FURY SONG after the start, and was far back throughout. TRINNI FLOWER pressed the early
pace outside, and gave way readily on the turn.
