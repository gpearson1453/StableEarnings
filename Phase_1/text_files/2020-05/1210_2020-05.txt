Footnotes
CAN THE QUEEN broke alertly and gained a short lead inside, set a pressured pace under rating, eagerly widened when set down in upper stretch,
wandered outward a bit and was kept to a steady hand ride through the final sixteenth. END RESULT stalked the leaders two wide, shifted out four wide
past the quarter pole and closed steadily. SUNDAY RED saved ground pursuing the leaders, eased out for the drive but failed to muster up a solid finish.
BETHABARA settled off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane, stayed inside and finished with good energy. GRAND SKYLARK , away
well, disputed the pace outside the winner, drifted four wide entering the lane, corrected to keep chase to mid stretch then faded. ARBUTUS , off the pace,
raced four to five wide for most of the trip and failed to menace. UTTERLY ENCHANTING , in close at the break, raced between runners early, came four
wide for the drive and lacked a bid. EXPECT TALK , three to four wide, was not a threat. IN CLASS , off slow after being brushed, was taken wide early, got
out and was six to seven wide leaving the far turn, corrected into the lane and had belated action. RED HOT KITTEN , rank at the break and brushed with IN
CLASS, eased back while saving ground early on, was under pressure around the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TAUBER stalked four wide, cruised up and poked a head in front soon into the lane, battled outside MOSBY'S RANGER past the furlong grounds then
edged clear under a steady drive. MOSBY'S RANGER leaned in at the break, showed sharp acceleration inside of rivals and moved to a clear lead around
the far turn, set the pace towards the rail, was joined soon into the lane, dueled inside the winner leaving the three sixteenths and kept on willingly.
COMMISSIONER BIGGS had speed, rated off the leader nearing the turn, chased, dropped back a bit in upper stretch then found some more late.
HINTING , between rivals early, dropped in and edged up in hand mid turn, steadied approaching the stretch, regrouped and churned on. PARDON THE
PUN , four wide early, angled in some and moved up past the three eighths, was stalled briefly approaching the stretch, recovered and finished with interest
towards the inside. FIRST FIGHTER had speed then stalked three wide, briefly challenged between foes in upper stretch, drifted out when failing to kick on
and faded. H R H JELLYBEAN broke slowly, lagged off the pace, raced well wide in the drive and had mild action. BOLD TREK , fractious in the gate, raced
four to five wide and failed to menace. STRAITOUTA CONGTIN was lightly steadied early and lacked a response. SPANISH SKIES rated back off foes
soon after the break, circled five wide but lacked a stretch kick. TOP MANDATE saved ground and faded. ELUSIVE MOTION lost ground and gave way.

two path between horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. BUCKED TOOTH set the pace along the rail, opened up on
the turn and weakened in the drive. LOOKS GOOD , four deep on the turn, floated to the five path turning for home and failed to menace. JONATHAN MCD
lacked speed, worked between horses in upper stretch, was taken to the inner rail near the sixteenth pole and passed tired foes. CASH EXCHANGE chased
the pace two wide around the turn and gave way. I GOT THE BRAHMS saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty. ONCE
MORE EH , checked in tight quarters leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and was outrun. GREELY IS BACK , a forward factor along the rail
entering the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
IT'S THE JOURNEY prompted the early pace about five wide, moved to command three deep into the turn, kicked clear mid turn, opened up into the lane,
wandered outward from left handed rousing then was fully extended to prevail between runners. SIR DOUGLAS lagged off the pace while off the inside,
swung eight wide for the drive, made a grinding run and just missed. CAMPARI rated off the pace and removed from the inside, edged up outside foes mid
turn, angled seven wide into the lane, advanced between runners near the sixteenth marker, dove inside as the winner drifted and finished gamely. IN HIM
WITH HIM chased four wide outside rivals leaving the far turn, saw the winner get away past the three eighths, came back a bit near mid stretch but failed to
seriously follow through. PRIME TIME MAN settled off the pace about three wide, angled six wide and a made a run into the lane, chased then flattened out.
MYSTERIO , three wide between foes giving chase, angled in and lacked a bid. NARROW ESCAPE bobbled a bit at the break, regrouped to be close up,
was lightly shuffled past the five eighths, angled out mid turn but failed to threaten. TOP HAT WARRIOR prompted the pace, bid inside foes nearing the
turn, chased and gave way. A TRUE GENTLEMAN broke slowly, lagged off the pace, angled off the inside near the three sixteenths and failed to rally.
BLAME THE KIDS , inside foes chasing past the five eighths, gave way. PEP TALKING , keen between runners early, gave way. GREEK GOD rushed up to
clear early, set the pace well off the inside, dropped down nearing the turn, lost the lead after a half mile and faltered.

pace two wide, weakened and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. DID I STUTTER worked between horses in the stretch and steadied with run when caught

LUCKY , four deep on the turn, failed to be a factor. SPUN GLASS raced between horses on the turn and weakened in the drive. CODE METTLE showed
speed along the rail, disputed the pace and gave way. DANCING TIL DUSK was outrun. OUR SWEET GIRL , a forward factor along the rail for the opening

Footnotes
PRETTY EDGY was sent up between foes soon after the start, gained command near the four and a half furlong marker, briefly went clear then was joined
from her outside by MARY'S JEWEL, dueled with that one from mid turn, was headed in upper stretch, battled back under left handed rousing to regain
command a sixteenth out then edged clear late. MARY'S JEWEL broke alertly then prompted four wide, bid outside the winner leaving the far turn, sparred
on near even terms into the lane, gained a slim lead inside the three sixteenths, fought on past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. SILENT
FLUIDITY , up close inside early on, eased out and moved between foes, had aim on the leaders into the lane but went evenly in the final furlong. JUMPING
MICHELLE , five to six wide, lacked a rally. LANDING ZONE , four to five wide, failed to respond. PAISLEY SINGING had speed then eased back off the
leaders, edged up three deep mid turn, chased and faded. CAWAJA TIME vied inside, steadied in close quarters near the half mile marker, recovered to
chase towards the rail but gave way in upper stretch. PEARL GEM , towards the inside leaving the far turn, eased out and failed to menace. LADY
GEORGE , unruly behind the gate, was sluggish from the start and never got involved.

in the two path and weakened the final furlong. COURT SKY , four deep on the turn, was carried out entering the stretch and lacked a rally. PARADISE
PRIDE hugged the inner rail, chased the pace to mid stretch and weakened. BELLARMINE HALL was no factor. SKYSCANNER , four wide on the turn,
failed to rally. COMMENCE , no factor, raced four wide on the turn. GOLAZO was no factor. MINE NOT MINE was outrun. ORDER FOR PORKY hugged
the inner rail, gave way on the turn and was eased through the stretch. Due to a timing malfunction, the times were hand timed.

Footnotes
BATTLEBUS , patiently handled off the inside, steadily advanced four wide under some rating heading towards the turn, responded when put to pressure
near the three sixteenths, kept on determinedly under a drive and forged ahead of rivals in deep stretch. AXTELL tracked three to four wide, bid outside
rivals into the lane, dueled on a slim lead past the furlong grounds and continued gamely to come back for the place. MCPHERSON chased the leader, bid
between foes in upper stretch, dueled and gained a short advantage to the inside of AXTELL past the furlong grounds, continued the fight to deep stretch
then hung. TALE OF THE NILE settled off the pace outside, circled the turn four wide, moved out wider and steadily gained. NO KNOCK RAID saved
ground, eased out in the drive and offered a mild kick. FLY E DUBAI rated early, worked between rivals to advance into the angled in, bid to threaten past
mid stretch but flattened out. TOO MUCH DATA broke a step slow, settled off the pace, angled out and edged up off heels late. BEYOND SMART failed to
menace and was eased late. I AIN'T NEVER , off the pace, angled four wide into the lane but failed to generate a run. SHUDDAWUDDACUDDA quickly
went clear, set the pace off the rail into the lane, was collared soon after and faltered leaving the eighth pole.
