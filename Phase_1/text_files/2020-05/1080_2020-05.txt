Footnotes
RETROFIT came out at the break to brush with BETA CAPO SONG, bid midway of the turn inside that rival to show in front turning for home and went clear
under steady urging. FREE MUSIC was on the pace three and four wide outside rivals then could not go with the winner in the lane. BETA CAPO SONG
brushed with the winner and was shuffled back at the break, challenged five wide outside that one in the turn but could not produce the needed late run.
CLIPBOARD MONEY was along the inside, angled four wide into the lane and improved position but could not threaten late. HEIR HORSE ONE showed
speed inside rivals but was steadied entering the turn to drop back some and had no rally. SPA SHACKALACKA showed speed between rivals and
weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
SUPER CHARLIE saved ground back off the early pace, rallied to contention through the far turn, split the leaders inside the sixteenth marker and continued
with good energy to be moving clear. BE MY SHADOW stalked the pace from three wide to reel in the leader through the far turn and bid into the lane then
could not handle the winner's late charge. LOVE AT NIGHT was on the pace just off the inside while pressed by PHLASH DRIVE, put that one away in the
far turn to kick well clear midway of the bend then could not handle the top pair late. GO GOLD stalked the pace four wide in good position but lacked a solid
rally in the lane. L B GOLD failed to rally racing two and three wide. PHLASH DRIVE forced the pace outside LOVE AT NIGHT to the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
DION dueled on the early lead four wide outside rivals, responded through the lane and ran down TOPOFTHEMOUNTAIN in the closing yards.
TOPOFTHEMOUNTAIN dueled inside rivals while out from the rail, edged clear through the turn but was worn down in the lane. COUNTRY CLUB DINER
angled through the turn to rally five wide into the lane and closed with a late run to gain third. MY LADY J dueled from between rivals to midway of the turn
and came up empty. DANCE EVEN was within reach three or four wide but lacked a final closing run. FAMILY CODE failed to mount a rally three wide.
TRISTAN'S DREAM was six to seven wide through the turn into the lane and could not threaten. DRAMA COACH was five and six wide through the turn
into the lane and also could not threaten. GRAND HOGA was along the inside and failed to offer a bid.

Footnotes
MONGOL CALL saved ground in good position behind the early pace, rallied along the rail to bid turning for home and went clear under steady handling.
DOROTHE MARIE stalked the pace four wide to bid into the lane but could not handle the winner. PERSONAL CAT tracked the pace three wide to bid
outside SMART RACHEL into the far turn then could not sustain the run in the lane. HOWS MY GOLD saved ground to move up going to the far turn but
lacked a further rally. KONAWA KWEEN was back of the pack three or four wide, fanned five wide into the lane and moved up while not a serious threat.
EMMY GOT EVEN failed to produce a solid bid racing three wide. RACEY REECEY weakened three or four wide. SMART RACHEL showed the most early
speed to cross over and make the pace from the two or three path and tired in the far turn.
