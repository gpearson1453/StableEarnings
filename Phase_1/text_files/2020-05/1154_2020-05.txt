Footnotes
TAKE TIME was outsprinted early, angled out off heels nearing the first turn, raced three wide in midpack around that bend, bid between foes early on the
backstretch, checked in tight near the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out to re-bid four wide, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole, vied outside of
several rivals around the rest of the turn, continued on his left lead in the lane and drew clear under a drive. LUCKY PENGUIN settled up close two wide
early, bid between foes early on the backstretch, led near the five-sixteenths pole, vied two wide between rivals around the far turn, was no match for the
winner in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to hold the place. SHAMELESS RISK pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, settled back as rivals
made middle moves down the backstretch, angled out to re-bid five wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole, flatted out a bit in the lane and lasted for the
show. BOP MARLEY was hustled between rivals early, dropped well back at the rail around the first turn and down the backstretch, re-rallied around the far
turn, tipped out and came again between rivals in the stretch to just miss second. DOCTOR MCCOY swung out into the four path nearing the first turn,
made a big middle move widest of all, led midway down the backstretch, vied three wide between foes around the far turn and weakened. ATRANI set the
pace along the rail and tired in the drive. SUAVE JUAN steadied early, raced two wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
DUST TO DIAMONDS set a clear pace inside and held well clear while ridden out. WITCHY WINDSOR chased the pace from the rail, continued on her left
lead in the lane and finished willingly to gain the place. CATHERINES WARRIOR chased the pace two wide, lacked a rally and was outfinished for the
place. LIVE FREE lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn and improved her position. ADIOS HILLARY saved ground to no avail. THAT
TRICKY LADY failed to menace while racing two wide. ROCKET BUSTER was outrun inside. PURE ROMANCE had only brief speed four wide.
CASHMEIFUCAN had early speed between foes, was eased, pulled up short and was vanned off. RED BEAN SONDE had brief speed four wide, was
eased and walked off.

Footnotes
PHONEMYPOSSEAGAIN sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace a bit off the rail, drifted out entering the lane and held sway under steady urging.
GRAVES ISLAND chased the pace four wide, made little progress while still on the left lead in upper stretch, switched leads near the sixteenth pole and
rallied late. STRONG LIKE BULL raced closest to the winner while saving ground early, went three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. GOLD SHARK
chased the pace three wide between foes early, angled to the rail entering the turn and went evenly from there. DIONYSUS' CHALICE broke in a tangle and
bumped WIZARD OF ODDS, raced three wide and played no further factor. WIZARD OF ODDS was soundly bumped at the start, dropped far back and
never threatened while racing three wide. BLUEBLOOD was outrun while racing two wide.

HOBE SOUND settled off the pace along the rail around the first turn, advanced two wide into the far turn, came three wide into the lane, closed
determinedly and was up in deep stretch. MISTER HUMOR stalked the pace three wide, briefly drifted out entering the first turn, bid two wide nearing the far
turn, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, was turned back approaching the lane, battled on between and gained the place in the final
strides. LOVE THAT JAZZ was bumped at the start, vied two wide around the first turn, edged clear and angled in midway down the backstretch, was
immediately confronted by MISTER HUMOR, re-cleared inside of that foe nearing the lane, led to deep stretch but was swallowed up final strides. CAMGO
set the early pace along the rail, dropped back into a stalking spot inside down the backstretch and continued on evenly from there. CAVALLOTTO was
bumped at the start, raced well back two wide around both turns and rallied belatedly. GREAT BEND failed to menace while racing two and three wide.
OWIN I AM played no factor while racing two and three wide. BARNSTORM was bumped at the start, saved ground and made little impact.

Footnotes
BRIGHT DAWN dropped back to last near the seven-sixteenths pole, responded to urging, accelerated to the front three wide near the quarter pole, burst
clear and angled in near the three-sixteenths marker and was well clear while ridden out in the lane. HYPOTHESIS had speed two wide, briefly led nearing
the turn, was no match for the winner around the turn but kept on willingly to be clearly second best. FANCY CASTLE set the early pace along the rail, could
not match strides around the turn but held well enough to preserve the show. CHIEF RANDEL chased the pace inside, tipped out nearing the lane and
lacked a rally. SWING BATTER played no factor while racing four wide. MYWALKTOFREEDOM had early speed between foes and faded three wide
around the turn.

Footnotes
SUPER GARNER set the a clear pace along the rail and held sway under a drive. FIRE TIGAR was bumped at the start, dropped well back while saving
ground, made good progress inside down the backstretch, was forced to steady in tight near the quarter pole, advanced three wide around the turn, swung
widest into the lane, closed strongly and ran out of ground. PRINCE OF WINDSOR stalked the pace two wide, could not keep pace as the winner raced
clear down the backstretch, gave chase two wide around the far turn, tipped into the three path in upper stretch, rallied but was outkicked. MIGHTY BOP
lacked speed while racing three wide, moved up still three deep around the far turn, rallied behind the second and third place finishers while lacking a clear
path through the stretch. CATCH MY CABOOSE chased the pace from the rail and finished only evenly. MORNING MUSE came out and bumped FIRE
TIGAR at the start, raced four wide in midpack early, advanced menacingly down the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn then tired in the lane.
RAMBAM ROCKER was outrun while racing three wide. KATMAN QUICK failed to menace while racing two and three wide. GLEN'S CASTLE played no
factor while racing three wide.
