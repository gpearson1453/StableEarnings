TALE OF CONDUCT hustled out would pressure on lead wresting and taking a slim edge to upper stretch digging in under outside challenges prevailing
gamely. BOOMTOWN chased dueling rivals through the turn looming a threat on the outside in upper stretch angling in a bit while bidding willingly late.
SHEZAGOLDGETTER pressured the pace moving three deep through the turn into upper stretch coming up a bit short late. UNTAPPED ENERGY sent
hard pressed between horses through the turn weakening while in a touch close at the head of the lane finishing with little left. MY SWEET PAYNTER slow
early played no factor. PRETTY CHARLEE came in brushing at the break, was hustled wide through the turn giving way near mid track in upper stretch.
DOWN WITH BROWN raced a step slow through the turn fading in upper stretch. LOOPY flashed brief speed fading along the inside on the turn. AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF UNTAPPED ENERGY AGAINST THE RIDER OF TALE OF CONDUCT FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE

Footnotes
KIANA'S LOVE stalked the pace looming through the turn into upper stretch, bearing down abreast foe would need all to edge up at the end. HELL'S A
POPPIN pressured the pace taking a narrow lead on the turn edging to daylight in upper stretch, engaged from the outside late would battle ceding
grudgingly in the last strides. BOBBOBSBABY tracked evenly through the turn coming five wide down the lane lacking late surge while holding off the
others. MATT'S HONEY hard ridden early was a step slow through the turn, responded with even action down the lane improving a bit in the three path.
STEALING SUNSHINE slow early lost ground to upper stretch finishing seven wide. ZOE MY LOVE varied little in mid pack weakening from the six path the
final eighth. RUNNING CLOUD broke sharply pressing the pace through the turn wearing out on the inside in upper stretch. THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT was
always outrun. LITTLE MAXIMOVA was never involved.

Footnotes
RIP IT RYAN was crowded near the seven sixteenths pole continuing on to track through the turn, emerged off a loose leader in upper stretch using steady
surge to arrive in time. U S S COSTLY set the pace through the turn, drew off in upper stretch drifting to the rail an eighth out as the rider tried in vain to
angle with left hand urging being caught in the last yards. MONTANA GUY chased the pace laying close through the turn, dropped off the leaders in upper
stretch going evenly from mid track late to improve placing. SHESGONEMOVEON slow early raced seven wide down the lane moving past tired ones late.
ALLABOUTBIZ pressured the pace through the turn then wilted along the inside in upper stretch. SUVOROV'S HERO hustled along chased through the
turn wearing out in upper stretch. ONE SPUR MCGIRR flashed early speed then faded on the turn. CHARLIE BUCKET drifted in brushing rival steadying
near the seven sixteenths pole. RECKLESSEYEBALLING was always outrun. TATIS outrun early would tire. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT
NEAR THE SEVEN SIXTEENTHS POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGES.

Footnotes
SLEWZER prompted the pace ceding a clear lead to rival on the turn, rallied in upper stretch hooking foe being bumped outside the sixteenth pole losing no
momentum to go clear at the end. ROMAN AROUND pressed the pace shaking clear on the turn, angled out when engaged in upper stretch bumping rival
outside the sixteenth pole proving no match late. CASCABRIA tracked the pace through the turn racing three path down the lane giving solid late response.
SHAMELESSFI slow early lost ground to upper stretch improving late with an even finish in the six path. JERSEY CHASER slow early was never involved
racing seven wide through the lane. IT'S SPRINGTIME played no factor. DANEIRA varied little along the inside. AZIFORCAST had brief foot then gave way
on the turn. CYCLONE BETTY showed early speed then retreated on the turn.

Footnotes
ZIPP ON BY broke well stalking then pressing on the turn, dueling abreast rival from the eighth pole would tighten up foe edging clear late. FAIRWEATHER
FRIEND sent clear set the pace coming under pressure on the turn, dueling inside of rival was tightened up inside the eighth pole ceding grudgingly in the
late going. GLENNWOOD chased the pace angling six wide in upper stretch gaining steadily at the end. TWO BIT KID slow early raced inside to upper
stretch finishing well. NOVA BOY slow early raced seven wide down the lane. THE TABULATOR always a step slow was put to a drive on the turn with little
response. MORE THAN GOOD played no factor. KING CREED had brief speed then gave way on the turn.

MUSIC chased the pace through the turn drawing evenly abreast rival in upper stretch, dueled in close proving no match late. PRINCESS KIAH squeezed
back checked at the break, lagging through the turn came seven wide down the lane outbidding the others. BECAUSESHECANDOIT bid on the turn then
leveled off in the four path upper stretch. CAPTAIN ANNE played no factor. BOSTON CRIDER was never involved. TESSIE'S RED SOX was jammed
checking at the break recovering quickly to make the lead, set the pace through the turn then wilted in upper stretch. OYA was pulled off and walked off.
