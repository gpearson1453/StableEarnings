SON OF A QUEEN well placed behind the top trio, stalked from the inside through the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, collared the leader nearing the
sixteenth pole and won going away. SIERRA ECHO set the pace from the inside, vied with a pair of rivals around the turn while drifting out a bit, shook free
entering the stretch, received another challenge mid stretch but could not match the winner in the late stages. HEAT THINGS UP in range to the outside of
the leader, bid between foes around the turn, floated out three to four wide by SIERRA ECHO and flattened in the final furlong. SURE PROOF bumped
leaving the gate, chased outside a rival, bid three deep into the turn, floated out around the bend and came four to five wide into the lane and weakened.
BALLYCASTLE broke out and bumped rival, raced in the two path off the pace then swung six wide into the lane and lacked a rally. LAKE SHOW lacked
early speed, raced near the inside then lacked room behind rival and steadied into the stretch, angled out near the eighth pole and failed to threaten.
STARTLING settled early from the outside, angled in on the turn, took a bad step in upper stretch and weakened.

FRACTIONAL INTEREST stumbled, broke in, brushed. JESS BEAUTIFUL FIRE brushed break, outfinished. MILAN RED broke in, drifted in. LOTTA BLUE
CHROME lugged out badly. FOOL THIS KID broke thru gate, broke in, drifted out. BAR FIGHTEN forced out, steadied late. MAX PRIZE hopped start,
altered out late. The Stewards reviewed the incident between LOTTA BLUE CHROME and BAR FIGHTEN late in the race. Following a review, the
Stewards ruled that although LOTTA BLUE CHROME did lug out and interfere with BAR FIGHTEN, it did not cost BAR FIGHTEN a chance at a better
position and there would be no change in the order of finish.
