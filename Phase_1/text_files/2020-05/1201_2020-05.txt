Footnotes
NO FOOLING DUDE sprinted clear soon after the break, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail and held
sway under steady handling. JUST CHILL OUT , between horses on the turn, swung wide turning for home and rallied outside. BAYANO , loomed four deep
on the turn, raced on his left lead in the drive and weakened late. JUNIOR JUMPER , eased out to the five path for the drive, failed to menace. NIC NIC
BOOM , fractious behind the starting gate, worked between horses on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. TOP HAT
SCRUTINY hugged the inner rail on the turn and came up empty in the drive. LIAR , very wide on the turn, floated to the seven path entering the stretch.
PERFECT HEIR was outrun. GOTTAWAY , along the inner rail around the turn, was not a factor. HARP OF GOLD was outrun. SKY SOLO chased the pace
three wide to the stretch and gave way. COLD SWEAT stumbled at the break, rushed up to press the pace into the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF CAUSE leaned in at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and settled well back, edged up between foes near the far turn, angled out a
bit, circled four to five wide into the lane, closed under pressure and outside rivals leaving mid stretch, hooked the leader with a sixteenth to go then edged
clear. STIVA pulled clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was put to a drive soon into the lane, saw her lead dwindle past mid stretch, could not resist
the winner leaving the sixteenth pole, faded but lasted for second. DYNAMIC MISS settled off the pace, worked between foes leaving the far turn, continued
progression between runners in upper stretch, came in briefly brushing a foe near the three sixteenths, straightened and sustained past the sixteenth marker
but flattened out late. TROIS PONTS , off the pace while saving ground, eased out under coaxing near the quarter pole, shifted further out in mid stretch
and found her best too late. DANCING CONTESSA , taken to rate early, edged up between horses nearing the five eighths, shifted out and moved up four
wide into the lane, loomed and chased to mid stretch then failed to sustain. LAUREL LADY , brushed at the break, chased the early pace, saved ground
while under pressure into the lane, was brushed soon after and gave way. SI MAMACITA rated off the leader into the first turn, saved ground, moved up a
bit leaving the far turn while still inside, faded in upper stretch and was eased late. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ , three to four wide, failed to respond.
ANOTHER WHIM gave early pursuit three wide and faltered before going six furlongs. GIRL NEXT DOOR bore out five wide into the first turn then was
outrun.

Footnotes
LET ME ASK BOB sprinted to the early lead, hugged the rail setting a pressured pace around the turn, opened up in mid stretch and lasted. LITTLE BAY
came out leaving the starting gate, worked between horses on the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and rallied. BOURBON AGOGO saved ground around
the turn, angled out near the eighth pole and showed a nice late move. CREATED SPECIAL saved ground on the turn and offered a mild, late gain. METAL
MAGICIAN lacked speed, raced wide on the turn, was six deep in upper stretch and had a mild gain. RARE NOTION , reluctant to the load into the starting
gate, prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way in upper stretch. LEADING MAN , rated between horses down the backstretch, weakened
through the stretch. WHATS THE CHANCES , four wide leaving the backstretch, circled the turn, chased the pace to mid stretch and gave way. GET
THERE JOHN came in at the break, raced wide on the turn and gave way. SWEET ASTA , pinched back leaving the starting gate, showed late intered. YES
MAN chased the pace, faltered and was eased. CASE CROSSING , checked when shuffled back early, was outrun.

Footnotes
YLIKEDIS was nicely handled and dropped in towards the fence to rate close early on, tracked patiently then eased out past the five sixteenths, went on the
attack soon after, forged to command in upper stretch, went clear a furlong out then held firm under left handed pressure. DECIDING VOTE settled inside,
moved up while saving ground past the five sixteenths, shifted out into the lane and had aim on the leaders, kept on gamely through the final furlong and
was clear for the place. PRETTY AND FAST moved up along the rail to take command from PEACHY BETWEEN US mid way on the first turn, handled
outside pressure from that rival, spurted clear after six furlongs, failed to hold off the winner in upper stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded.
SAILINGINTOTHEWIND came away well then drafted back along the inside, remained inside advancing into the lane, angled out and closed willingly. I
HEAR YOU settled off the pace while saving some ground, edged up between foes near the far turn, awaited room near the quarter pole, angled out and
kept trying to the line. MONA LUNA , three deep advancing into the far turn, swung seven wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish. PEACHY BETWEEN
US led into the first turn, relinquished command near the three quarter pole, pressed two wide, failed to kick on under a ride past the five sixteenths and
faded. MALICEINTHEPALACE broke a step slow then steadied, swung eight wide into the lane but failed to menace. LILAH MAE , in the clear early and in
range, moved up two wide near the five sixteenths, angled out and faded. WITTY BANTER , off the pace, angled seven wide nearing the lane, steadied
when in close and failed to threaten. WHY NOT YOU was outrun. TEA IN CHINA , a bit keen when with the pace three wide, stayed in range to the far turn
then gave way.

Footnotes
STAND MY GROUND , patiently handled inside, eased out and split rivals mid way on the final turn, rolled up four wide outside rivals and took command
into the lane, eagerly kicked clear and was kept to task. STORM TOWER cleared around the first turn, set the pace towards the inside, was joined leaving
the far turn, dueled heading towards the lane and kept on willingly to be second best. CRAZY KATER had speed inside then rated off the leader, angled out
and rebid two wide into the far turn, vied outside then between foes nearing the lane, held well to about mid stretch then faded late. MY MOONSHINE broke
slowly then dropped in to settle off the pace, commenced a run leaving the half mile marker, eased out and churned on. GALLINIPPER , between foes
advancing near the half mile marker, angled out and circled five wide but lacked a solid stretch kick. YES MEANS NO , off the pace while saving ground,
eased out into the stretch but lacked a solid finish. AMERICAN COMMANDER stalked three wide, was under pressure past the quarter pole and gave way.
G MAN , in mid pack off the inside, came five wide for the drive but lacked a rally. BLADE O lacked speed, was floated very wide past the five sixteenths
and failed to menace. CREATIVE TIME , away alertly, stalked inside, lacked a response past the five sixteenths and weakened. CECIL THE LION was
outrun. DEVLIN veered out at the break, raced five wide around the first turn, moved up past the five eighths, chased and faltered.

FAN , a forward factor three deep around the turn, finished willingly. LORD SIMBA hugged the rail around the turn and finished willingly. LA MAQUINA
GRIS , fractious behind the starting gate, raced four wide on the turn. JACK STRAIGHT , caught in close quarters at the start, saved ground on the turn.
EASY RIVER , three wide leaving the turn, was not a factor. MINERS QUEST , four wide leaving the turn, was not a factor. MONTELEONE , pinched back
leaving the starting gate, was not a factor. HUNTIN'THEHOLIDAYS , no factor, raced wide on the turn. GYPSUM JOHNNY was outrun. HIGHER PURPOSE
prompted the pace outside the winner and faltered the final furlong. TAMBORA , well placed two wide on the turn, gave way.

ODE TO JOY broke a step slow, regrouped and settled about four wide, commenced a run mid turn, circled four wide outside rivals into the lane, leveled off
under left handed rousing and took aim on the duelers past mid stretch, kept on determinedly under forged ahead late under steady handling. ELLYB
prompted the pace outside A GREAT TIME, drew on near even terms into the lane, dueled then gained a slim lead near the furlong grounds, continued the
battled past the sixteenth marker, kept on gamely but just could not hold off her stablemate. A GREAT TIME broke on top, set the pace towards the rail
while taking outside pressure, fought on past the sixteenth pole then faded. DANCE OR STROLL rated outside a rival, moved up to have aim into the lane,
chased past the furlong grounds but failed to sustain. HIP HOP rated off the pace three wide, raced between foes into the lane and kept on with interest.
NOT IN JEOPARDY broke slowly, raced off the pace, was between foes into the stretch but lacked a solid kick. DENDROBIA , in close between rivals
nearing the turn, swung well wide but failed to menace. BYE BYE BERTIE was sent up between runners soon after the start, tracked the leaders while
saving ground then weakened through the final three sixteenths. BUFF'S IN LOVE flashed speed inside, drafted back off the leaders nearing the turn,
shifted out in mid stretch but came up empty.

FATHER'S LUCK lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and took the lead approaching the wire. ALLTHEWRONGREASONS , never
far back, raced between rivals throughout and closed nicely. PAID HOLIDAY sprinted to the lead, hugged the inner rail and tired late. DISTILLED SPIRIT
stumbled at the break, circled the turn some six wide and flattened out. FIVE CARD DRAW bobbled at the break, checked in tight quarters entering the turn
then showed a late gain. INDIAN GHOST raced evenly. GIANT VIKING bore out at the break, chased the pace four wide and gave way. SEVENTYSEVEN
FORCE , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was outrun and entered the stretch six wide. CHUCK'S DREAM came in at the break, chased the pace five
wide into the turn, gave way in mid stretch and was eased late. GOLDEN SPUN LAD , no factor while kept wide on the turn, was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
BOBBY G rated two wide off the early pace, edged up past the five sixteenths when put to pressure, shifted out into the lane, came in briefly when
advancing near mid stretch, corrected with the left stick, reeled in the leader a sixteenth out then drew clear while geared down in the final yards. DASHING
LOU took command inside a pair of rivals when heading towards the first turn, handled outside pressure, moved clear under a light hold near the far turn,
opened up after being asked soon into the lane, wandered outward inside the furlong grounds and continued willingly to the wire. SASSY KING settled off
the pace, circled into the lane and finished with interest to nab the show. BOWSPRIT saved ground under early rating, gained some ground nearing mid
stretch then flattened out late. MY EMINENCE , brushed at the break, saved ground while well back, eased out some in upper stretch, steadied when in
tight near mid stretch then came up empty. BELTWAY BOB , in close at the break, lagged far back early on, was under pressure while three wide past the
quarter pole and lacked a rally. BAY BRIDGE forced the pace outside DASHING LOU, was under a solid ride trying to keep pace past the five sixteenths,
remained a presence to the three sixteenths then weakened. SAPPHIRE SHILLING , three deep nearing the first turn, chased for a half mile, faltered, was
eased in upper stretch and walked off.
