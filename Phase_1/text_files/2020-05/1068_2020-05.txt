Footnotes
GROUCHO forwardly placed early while outside a rival, went two to three around the turn, angled outside the leader and took aim, reeled in rival and got up
at the wire. LOVE AND HOLD away quickly, gained control and set the pace, held command in the two path through the turn, continued clear through the
lane under right-handed urging to the sixteenth pole but got caught on the line. DAVE'S GIFT bumped from the outside leaving the gate, traveled near the
back of the field while the rider adjusted his left iron, advanced to the turn and moved over to the rail, angled out path and went around HERE I GO INDY,
then finished willingly to gain ground on the top pair. RUNAWAY INDY stumbled badly and bumped DAVE'S GIFT at the start, raced three wide around the
turn and into the stretch, and lacked the needed response. HERE I GO INDY stalked the pace three wide, angled to the rail on the turn, saved ground into
the stretch and tired. CUPID'S VICTORY raced off the pace, went four wide through the turn and weakened. RIDGE ROUTE along the inside into and
around the turn, moved off the inside entering the stretch and proved no menace.

Footnotes
SWEET SASSAFRASSY quickly assumed command, controlled the pace up the backstretch, led two to three wide and came under on the turn, responded
well and drew off under hand urging. TENGA'S JEWEL chased the leader from off the rail, went three deep into the turn, took aim leaving the bend but
faltered in the stretch while able to hold the place. VIA ALPINA bumped at the start, forced in by MONCHICHI soon after the start, tracked the pace from
inside to the stretch and flattened in the drive. MONCHICHI broke in and bumped rival, lugged in early, raced outside a rival then between foes, checked
entering the turn, entered the stretch two to three wide and finished one paced in the late stages. MIRA LOMA MADAM hit the inside part of the gate then
veered out, angled in entering the turn, saved ground to the lane and never threatened. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE raced off the rail then angled in nearing the
turn, hit the rail entering the turn, continued near the inside to the lane and came up empty.

LEEDSLIMIT dueled for command outside of STROMIN TRICK, cleared that foe around the turn and held safely in the late stages. UNCLE GOYLE
unhurried while off the rail in the beginning, went two to three wide around the turn, then closed from the inside and edged STORMIN trick for the place.
STORMIN TRICK dueled from the inside to the turn, lost contact with the leader midway through the bend then lugged out entering the stretch, chased the
winner in the lane and lost the place. GUTSY STREAK off the pace in the early going then advanced closer to the turn, swung out leaving the bend and
failed to summon the needed rally. JOHANN'S COMMAND hopped at the start, trailed the field, saved ground around the turn and never reached
contention. FANCY TERRACE stalked outside the top pair, lost ground and lugged out on the turn and retreated in the lane. Due to a timer malfunction the
half mile fraction was unavailable.
