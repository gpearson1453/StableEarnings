Footnotes
SMARTIZAR bumped with BETTIN ONNA KITTEN at the start, took control in the two-path on the first turn, rated along clear to the stretch, drifted out a bit
and had enough to hold on. SUBTLE JOY bumped with GRACIE'S DREAM at the start, prompted the early pace outside, dropped back in upper stretch,
moved further out in the track, and came on again to get the place. CALLMESENORITA followed GRACIE'S DREAM out at the start and was slow into
stride, saved ground outrun early, advanced four wide on the far turn, loomed a threat through the furlong grounds but could not sustain the rally.
NATURELL (ECU) raced close up inside from the start, briefly tried to get through inside SMARTIZAR near the half-mile pole but thought better of it, gained
clearance two wide after six furlongs, moved back inside and flattened out late. MALIBU RUN hit the left side of the gate at the start, and tired after six
furlongs. GRACIE'S DREAM was edgy in the gate prior to the start, broke out bumping SUBTLE JOY, and was finished early. BETTIN ONNA KITTEN was
edgy in the gate prior to the start, bumped with SMARTIZAR coming out, showed early speed and faltered before reaching the stretch. TAPIZAR GIRL was
never a factor and went through the lane eased up. HIGH CLASS PLAYER hit the left side of the gate at the start, was reserved early, had nothing after six
furlongs and was eased up.

Footnotes
DARLA moved up around the turn three then four wide, rallied determinedly and was up in time outside rivals. SAY CHEESE pressed the pace outside
SOPHISTICURL, challenged through the lane and finished gamely. SOPHISTICURL set the pace in the two-path around the turn, moved inside dueling with
SAY CHESSE through upper stretch, and yielded late. MY GLORY raced four wide, and lacked the needed rally. TEMPT ME gave chase inside to the
stretch, and faded. SPECIAL INCLUSION wandered out at the break spotting the field two or three lengths, raced five wide and remained well back.
EXTINQUISH moved up briefly early on the turn, and tired. KITTEN'S DREAM trailed inside.

Footnotes
COMBINATION began to move up early on the turn four wide, caught JAMAICAN from outside past the furlong marker and drew away hand urged and
shown the whip. JAMAICAN vied outside R BOY BODE early, took over around the turn, proved no match for COMBINATION through mid stretch, and ran
on best of the rest. R BOY BODE was hustled to the early lead inside, got outdueled by JAMAICAN around the turn, and was able to salvage the show.
BORDINI lagged well back four wide to the stretch, and offered a mild response outside. EARTH hit the right side of the gate at the start, chased after the
leaders three wide into the turn, and faded on the wrong lead. PHANTOM RO brushed with BUSHROD at the start, and tired inside. CHIEF WHITE SOX
retired early three wide. BUSHROD brushed with PHANTOM RO at the start, and dropped far back after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
TOFFEN took control after an alert start, rated along clear through manageable fractions, dug in when challenged late and just lasted. HURRICANE
BREEZE saved ground on the turns in easy striking range, slid out with aim in the two-path at the top of the stretch, rallied willingly outside the leader and
came up a bit short. JADES GELLY prompted the pace two to three wide to the stretch, and lacked a final bid. SUNSET PROMISE saved ground early,
moved out up the backstretch, raced four wide around the far turn, and improved without threatening. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT was no menace through an
inside trip. ITSAROLLOFTHEDICE raced three wide, was asked for a response midway on the far turn, and came up empty. FANCIFIED was within striking
distance four wide into the far turn, and moved in while weakening near the quarter-pole. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE was no factor two wide on the turns.

Footnotes
QUEEN ARELLA bumped with PRETZEL at the start, then was bumped and squeezed between that one and GO JO JO GO, took closer order four wide
approaching the stretch, caught the leaders under a drive entering the final furlong, and drew clear with the rider standing up well before the finish line.
HARA broke sharply, dueled between STEPPING FORWARD and JILL'S A HOT MESS around the turn, could not hold off the winner but held well for
second. GO JO JO GO bumped with QUEEN ARELLA after the start, was outrun four then five wide to the top of the lane, and rallied mildly for the show.
RACE DAY SPEED was no factor in the two-path. JILL'S A HOT MESS contested the pace outside STEPPING FORWARD and HARA for most of the
opening three furlongs, and weakened in the lane. STEPPING FORWARD was sent up to vie for command inside HARA and JILL'S A HOT MESS heading
to the turn, and gave way in upper stretch. PRETZEL bumped with QUEEN ARELLA at the break, then continued inward bumping that rival again and
putting her in tight alongside GO JO JO GO, and tired late on the turn four wide. ALPHA BABE dropped well back on the turn three wide. INDY FRONT was
hesitant to load, then broke out at the start to get away slowest, and dropped steadily farther behind.

Footnotes
SOVEREIGN WARRIOR grabbed the lead with an alert start, rated along clear for six furlongs, dug in along the rail when confronted by LOOKIN AT
ROSES turning for home, and held gamely while brushing with that one nearing the wire. LOOKIN AT ROSES bumped with VINCITORE at the start,
hugged the rail edging closer around the far turn, shifted to the two-path with aim outside the leader at the top of the stretch, had every chance but could not
get by while brushing in close quarters late. VINCITORE bumped with LOOKIN AT ROSES at the start, settled in the middle of the field two wide to the far
turn, cut the corner into the lane, and rallied clear of the rest. VINTAGE KITTEN raced well back two wide for six furlongs, and improved without becoming a
factor. LUCKY MIKE was forwardly placed three wide for six furlongs, and lacked the needed bid. PLEASE SIT DOWN raced in the second flight toward the
inside, and made no impact. ROAD TO PEACE saved ground on the turns, angled widest at the top of the stretch, and made no gains. POPPY'S BOYS
was three wide and always outrun. CONQUISTADOR tugged along prompting the pace outside the eventual winner, and was empty approaching the
stretch between horses.

OAK BLUFFS was unhurried early, advanced mildly inside around the turn, rallied inside the leaders through the late stages and outdueled FUEL THE
BERN to the finish. FUEL THE BERN saved ground in range for three furlongs, brushed with MEMORABLE ELECTION while moving out for room at the top
of the stretch, rallied outside and finished well. GOOD BYE GREG bumped with APACHE BRAVE at the start and again shortly after that, set a pressured
pace inside MEMORABLE ELECTION, edged away late on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and was overhauled from both sides. HONOLULU
EXPRESS broke out at the start, was outrun two wide early, bid along the rail through the furlong grounds and finished willingly. MEMORABLE ELECTION
bumped with APACHE BRAVE at the start and again shortly after that, pressed the pace outside GOOD BYE GREG, and brushed with FUEL THE BERN
while giving way at the top of the lane. R BOY EVENS tired three wide approaching the stretch. APACHE BRAVE got bumped and squeezed back between
GOOD BYE GREG and MEMORABLE ELECTION at the break, then checked more severely between those two a few strides later, recovered to striking
range two then three wide on the turn, and lugged in weakening on the wrong lead through the furlong grounds. TOWN POLICY was pushed out slightly by
HONOLULU EXPRESS at the start, was outrun to the stretch, and could not gain on the far outside. ISLAND TAP tracked outside the leaders to the end of
the turn, and faded through the drive.

FLORA FANTASY pursued outside MERSEYSIDE for a half-mile, challenged for command at the top of the stretch, and drove clear through the late stages.
MERSEYSIDE broke in bumping ASSUME CONTROL solidly at the start, went up to grab the lead inside, could not stave off the winner by upper stretch,
and had enough to save second. JEANA'S GEM was bumped by SAYONARA BABY after the start, chased inside to the turn, moved out three wide to loom
a threat near the three-sixteenths, and could not muster a final response. BOW TOWN CAT raced three wide on the turn, and had no rally. SAYONARA
BABY was bumped by ASSUME CONTROL and pushed in after the start, and tired four wide on the turn. ASSUME CONTROL absorbed a solid bump from
MERSEYSIDE and was knocked into SAYONARA BABY at the break, and tired inside. HOW SWEEP IT IS was finished early, and dropped far back
outside in the lane. This race was hand timed.

SWIRLING CANDY pressed the pace outside HAPPY LOUDON, took over outside that one after straightening away into the stretch, and drove clear.
TONY'S ROSE bumped with SHELL BEACH PARTY while in tight behind SILVER TUNES early, bumped with the latter again up the backstretch, raced
three wide into the stretch, lugged in through the furlong grounds and went clear of the others. DROP A HINT raced three then four wide around the turn,
and rallied outside for the show. HAPPY LOUDON broke sharply, battled inside SWIRLING CANDY for three furlongs, yielded in upper stretch and faded
late. POSEIDON'S PASSION broke through the gate and reared up unseating the rider prior to the start, reloaded and came away in good order, was
cautiously handled up the backstretch near several troubled opponents, moved out to the four-path for the drive, and drifted out bumping with ROYAL
JEWEL through the late stages. TWEET AWAY ROBIN broke out and bobbled at the start, steadied behind TONY'S ROSE early, steadied again
approaching the turn, was well back inside nearing the stretch, and improved without becoming a threat. SILVER TUNES came in shortly after the start
tightening up several rivals, got steered out difficult to handle approaching the turn and bumped TONY'S ROSE, saved ground into the stretch, lacked room
behind TONY'S ROSE through the furlong grounds, and gave way. ROYAL JEWEL was in tight early along the rail, came four wide off the turn in the
second flight, and was bumped by POSEIDON'S PASSION while outside that one late. SHELL BEACH PARTY was bumped between POSEIDON'S
PASSION and TONY'S ROSE shortly after the start, checked behind horses hard to handle later up the backstretch, and could not gain three wide around
the turn. TREVESS bumped solidly with SHELL BEACH PARTY soon after the start, checked along hard to handle behind horses later up the backstretch,
and dropped back.

Footnotes
WIND RIDGE settled off a trio of battling leaders up the backstretch, ranged up to join them from outside as the rider glanced back midway on the turn, took
over and pulled clear after six furlongs, and held sway under pressure. SUPERHIGHWAY was unhurried inside to the turn, began to pick up rivals shifting
four wide near the quarter-pole, and could not reach WIND RIDGE through the lane while clearly second best. NIMBLE BEAST vied outside WINTER AT
BASTOGNE and SMOKEY SONG early before backing off just a bit, rebid on the turn, dropped back through upper stretch, then ran on late outside
WINTER AT BASTOGNE to get the show. WINTER AT BASTOGNE contested a sharp pace inside SMOKEY SONG and NIMBLE BEAST, and weakened
after six furlongs. ULTRACONFIDENT raced three then four wide around the turn, and lacked a response. SMOKEY SONG vied for command between
horses early, and gave way after five furlongs.
