Footnotes
MOMENTS TO SAVER was settled last racing to the first turn racing well off the inside, was prompted to split foes after a half gathering momentum, angled
inside the pacesetter racing into the far turn, bid for command inside that foe entering upper stretch and went clear under pressure. BORN TO GROOVE
was urged clear racing just off the rail into the backstretch, met a rival's challenge after a half, then dispatched that foe racing into the far turn, held sway in
three path to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. KATIE FALOONA tracked off the second flight into the backstretch, angled four wide nearing
the lane and continued with some late interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. VUYELWA tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight racing
to the backstretch, switched out after a half while moving to terms with the leader pressing the issue into the far turn but soon gave way. TIME SHIFT
tracked the leaders in second flight between foes into the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the far turn but offered no rally. KOA KANI, urged to a forward
placing three deep tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
HOT MIST gained a position tracking just off the leaders along the rail racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide entering the bend while steadily
advancing on the leaders, was carried out slightly racing into upper stretch by BOK CHOY while challenging for command, skirmished with that foe past
midstretch but edged clear late under firm handling. BOK CHOY came through close quarters in the opening stages to gain terms with the pacesetter
prompting that rival racing into the turn, disputed the issue on a narrow advantage through the bend, shifted out nearing upper stretch while being roused to
resist the winner's challenge, shifted inwards contesting the issue grudgingly past midstretch but weakened late. SWEETOLOGY, broke slowly, then was
momentarily cut off at the start, was prompted to gain position between rivals racing into the turn, angled inside the leaders crossing over the path of FLASH
FLOOD racing into upper stretch but had no final response. FLASH FLOOD settled near the inside in early stages, saved ground on the turn, then altered
course in upper stretch when losing her path but had no closing bid. MISTY EXPRESS ducked inwards at the start, was quickly righted, then sped to the
lead while angling to the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail in the opening stages, dueled for command inside rivals into the turn and
gave way nearing the lane. REIGN SHOWERS, came through close quarters in early stages to track off the first flight between foes but steadily faded racing
into the turn. WROTE'S GIFT proved no factor. DIVINE MARTHA was urged to gain a forward placing racing four wide through the backstretch, shifted
inwards a bit entering the turn but gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SASSY MISS MARGIE was prompted to gain a forward placing stalking the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
on the far turn to lodge a bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, lost some ground to the leaders entering the lane, angled to the rail while
continuing under pressure to bid inside the pacesetter and just edged that rival on the wire in a prolonged drive under stout left handed pressure.
COMMANDER OF DEATH broke sharply, sped away to a clear advantage racing just off the rail to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin
into the far turn, staved off several challengers to edge forward racing into the stretch, grudgingly contested the lead to the end and just missed. PORT
SALERNO tracked off the second flight three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught in close quarters entering
the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the lane continued with interest to prevail for a share. DUDE'S SECRET angled to the inside stalking the
pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the backstretch, was prompted to bid for command inside foes nearing upper stretch, shifted out while
racing in close quarters through the closing stages and was outkicked for a share. DON'T FIGHT, firmly rated dropping off the second flight while shifting
outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the leaders while caught five wide racing into the far turn, came around foes to bid three
deep nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened. WEST HORIZEN tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted off the
inside to make brief progress between foes while caught in close quarters racing into the stretch and faded late. THORCERESS raced between foes, then
was reserved off the second flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. VALERIE FIRST settled last along the inside dropping well off the
field, gradually gained some position nearing the lane, was steadied avoiding tight quarters nearing midstretch and made no real impression. HEARTY
PARTY hit the gate while breaking a bit slowly, was caught four wide racing through the first turn gaining terms with the second flight, was prompted to
lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the far turn but came up empty after six furlongs.

Footnotes
VEGAS LIFE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, turned back a rival's challenge, then went clear
through the lane under firm encouragement. LEBASI tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three wide racing into
the turn, split foes in that path racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors late. COMMANDER'S INTENT tracked just off the second flight
outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into the lane but continued with an effort to gain some position while outkicked for second. THE
EQUINEST angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter three deep racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. INITFORTHELOVE settled outside
foes racing through the backstretch, swung five wide racing into the lane but made no impression. COURAGE DE LION broke slowly, pulled his way
between foes to gain a position in second flight racing into the turn and came up empty nearing upper stretch. SIDE TRACKED angled to the inside early
tracking just off the leaders but steadily faded into the stretch. EL SOLO UNO ducked out at the start, then was steadied and never gained contention.
ROBERTOS TICKET, restless in the gate, threw his head while dwelling in the gate at the start and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CATSOUTOFTHEBAG broke readily to gain terms with the pacesetter attending the pace racing to the backstretch, prompted that rival racing into the far
turn, pressed the issue into the lane, edged forward midstretch and just held WORLDS APART on the wire under firm handling. The latter was settled near
the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and produced a solid late response to split rivals just off the inside to just miss.
FORTUNATE CAT sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail to the second bend, dueled for command on the far
turn into upper stretch and weakened late. FINEST JEWEL angled to the inside stalking just off the first flight, continued along the inside to the lane, shifted
out in late stages but had no late kick. SAMMY'S TOWN tracked off the second flight outside rivals in the opening half, was forced out four wide avoiding
traffic racing into the far turn and had no final bid. EYE ON THE FINISH tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out to gain
position outside a rival tracking just off the leaders into the far turn but gave way racing into the lane. BIZNESS BEAUTY settled off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, switched out after a half, was forced five wide avoiding traffic racing into the far turn and soon gave way. TEGLA
settled along the rail racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. FEETS OF FEATHER, shuffled out of tight quarters at the break, was settled outside
foes in the last flight and proved no threat. CSILLA tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out sharply entering the
second bend and abruptly gave way.

Footnotes
BLUE CHICORY gained a forward placing three deep racing into the first turn, was rated outside a rival tracking the leaders from just out of striking position
through the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing through the far turn to gain terms with LADY BREANNA racing into upper stretch, was
carried out in the closing stages by that foe but edged forward under brisk right handed pressure in a prolonged drive to gain a clear advantage in time. The
latter came through close quarters to gain a forward placing between foes, shifted to the inside racing through the backstretch, was prompted to bid for
command along the rail racing into the far turn to gain the advantage, resisted the winner's challenge in a long drive while drifting out in late stages but came
up second best. DARLINDIVA broke readily to gain the advantage between calls outside foes racing to the first turn, conceded the lead entering that bend to
track a rival's pace into the backstretch, pressed the issue three wide between foes racing into the far turn and gave way into the stretch. DENVER settled
well off the leaders along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and made an effort to improve position. EYERISH INSPIRED settled outside a rival in
the last flight early and passed only tiring rivals. BLAZING BROOKE, urged to the lead along the rail racing into the first turn, shifted off the rail holding sway
on a clear margin to the second bend and gave way between foes nearing the lane. RACINROSEMARY tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to
the backstretch, angled inwards after a half but quickly came up empty. COTTON TOOYAH, held up avoiding close quarters racing into the first turn,
switched out racing into the backstretch, raced five wide into the far turn and soon retreated.

Footnotes
BARREL OF DESTINY was rated between rivals in second flight racing to the first turn, shifted out three wide after a half steadily gaining terms with the
pacesetter, pressed the issue in that path racing through the far turn to gain a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and held rivals to the end under firm
handling. BETTER YET, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the second flight, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide
nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to late stages to close the gap. HANIEL, reserved while angling inside early, switched out racing into the far
turn splitting foes three deep gaining position, angled to the rail leaving midstretch and continued to gain position inside the top pair to the end. SAPPHIRE
JUBILEE tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, gained some position splitting rivals nearing upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. CALLIE CALIFORNIA sped clear racing to the first turn, held sway racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, dueled for command
between entering the far turn and gave way into the stretch. ITSGOTTABEMYWAY, held up between foes off the second flight, switched outside foes racing
through the backstretch, was caught wide racing into the far turn and had no rally. ALYDARIUS, rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the
backstretch, saved ground into the lane and was taken in hand when lacking a path nearing midstretch. FONDA ROMANA broke awkwardly, was settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. PATIENT DIGNA angled to the inside leaving the chute stalking just inside the
pacesetter, was prompted to lodge a brief bid along the rail racing into the far turn but quickly came up empty. CAPE LAA DI DA settled along the inside
early and soon dropped out.
