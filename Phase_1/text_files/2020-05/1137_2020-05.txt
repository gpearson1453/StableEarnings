CANADA broke slow and trailed to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, pushed to the front in deep stretch then held off MALIBU
ALEX late. MALIBU ALEX chased the pace early, had to check off heels between rivals nearing the three eighths, swung out four wide into the stretch and
finished willingly but too late. UNCLE HAL attended the pace two wide, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the winner and finished evenly.
SUNDAY NAP had good speed, dueled from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch but was tiring in the final sixteenth. GOING AWAY PARTY was
chasing to the turn then saved ground to no avail. AALSMEER broke in the air, refused to stride out then was pulled up but walked off. The stewards
conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but did not alter the results.

Footnotes
ICE OR FIRE broke alertly and took the lead, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then pushed clear to mid stretch and held under steady urging.
DARKHAWK chased the winner from the rail to the stretch then finished willingly and was an easy second. MUSKOKA pressed the pace three wide to the
stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. BILLTOWN BANNER was also chasing early, raced three wide to the stretch, also was outrun to mid
stretch then picked off rivals without threatening. DESERT MOVIE tracked the winner to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but lacked a closing
response. CLIFTON HOLLOW was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to mid turn then swung out five deep into the stretch but did not threaten. NICKLE
SHOTS trailed to the stretch and was never a factor. DARE TO BELIEVE was outsprinted to the turn then had to circle five wide and came up emtpy.
CYBER stalked the pace three wide to the stretch then weakened. SHINER'S CODE was always outrun.

Footnotes
ELEVATE was never far away, eased off the rail and rallied three wide to the stretch, took over in mid stretch and drew clear driving. ASKIN' FOR
TROUBLE pressed the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, was collared by the winner in mid stretch but stubbornly saved second. MY
FRIEND GEORGE had no speed, settled to the second turn, swung out from the three path to the five path into the stretch then could not sustain the
needed response. ON THE WINGS OF was allowed to settle for a half mile, swung four wide on the second turn for room but could not make an impact in
the drive. FANTASTIC ARAGORN settled mid pack to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and weakened in the lane. DYNAMITE RIDE set
the pace for six furlongs then was overtaken in upper stretch and tired. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was choppy in the early going, trailed to the stretch and
was not a factor. ZIPPY GROOM tracked the pace four wide, was asked for speed three wide on the second turn but gave way in the drive.
