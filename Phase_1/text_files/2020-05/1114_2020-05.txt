Footnotes
KA'NAH chased between horses then outside a rival, came three deep into the stretch, rallied under left handed urging to the front outside foes a sixteenth
out and won clear under a hold late. RAYRAY sped to the early lead, dueled inside, fought back along the rail in the stretch and edged a rival for the place.
LANE WAY stalked early then bid three deep between horses, dueled outside the runner-up on the turn, put a head in front in the stretch, was between foes
in deep stretch and was outgamed for second. AMERICAN CODE chased off the rail or outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and bested the
others. BIG MEL had speed inside then saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch and weakened. CANADIAN LUCK hopped at the start,
settled just off the rail then outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and improved position. CANDY FURY stalked outside then bid four
wide a half mile out, tracked alongside a rival then angled in off the rail on the turn and weakened. TWIRLING DERBY angled in and bid between horses on
the backstretch then stalked a bit off the rail, found the inside on the turn and into the stretch and also weakened. NEWELL a bit slow to begin, settled
outside then alongside a rival leaving the turn and into the stretch and did not rally. GOBOLDLY a step slow into stride, saved ground chasing the pace,
continued inside on the turn and in the stretch and had little left for the drive. VALUATION refused to break out of the gate despite urging from the rider and
stood in the stall. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start before ruling VALUATION was the cause of his own trouble.
