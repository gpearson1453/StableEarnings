three-sixteenths pole and was along for the show. JACKS CITY steadied entering the first turn, raced three wide and never threatened. AWESOME BUZZ
chased the pace inside and faded around the far turn. DEPUTY DREW saved ground and failed to menace. OFFSHORE TRIP stalked the pace two wide
and tired around the far turn. FIRST TALENT saved ground to no avail. HARASAN had brief speed two wide. BAY HILL played no factor while racing three

and was up late. BAYOU BOUGIE vied between foes down the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn, drew clear leaving the three-sixteenths pole,
continued on her left lead in the lane and led past the sixteenth pole. DAFFYDILL settled off the early pace outside, raced three and four wide around the
turn and rallied for the show. GOT ANY vied three wide down the backstretch, pressed two wide around the turn then weakened in the drive. THUNDER

Footnotes
THE BETTER ONE raced well back outside early, split rivals nearing the three-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the lane, surged outside and was up
late. GOOD KARMA sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail and held to deep stretch. THISLILLIMEOFMINE chased the pace two
wide in the clear and lacked a rally. DIAMOND TRAIN saved ground to no avail. CLUBIN TILL DAWN failed to menace while racing three wide. MISS
PROBLEMATIC lagged well back inside, swung to the far outside in upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
CHERUBIM stalked the pace two wide, bid between rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, seized command near the five-sixteenths marker, drew clear
nearing the lane and held safe while ridden out. CENT COMM raced off the pace two wide, made good progress between rivals down the backstretch,
chased the winner two wide around the far turn and finished willingly to be a clear second. JAXBRADENRISHI pressed the pace two wide around the first
turn, led near the half-mile pole, was collared nearing the far turn, tried to keep pace inside the winner around that bend, weakened a bit and held well for
the show. CHARMING DEPUTY settled off the early pace three wide, made a middle move outside of the winner early on the backstretch run, could not
keep pace with that foe, chased three wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. STEPS TO GLORY was not a threat while racing three and
four wide. THE IRON BANK saved ground early, went three wide around the far turn and made little impact. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE chased the pace
inside and faded after a half. HAYNESFIELD BEST set the early pace along the rail and retreated. THE SON WIND steadied early, raced two and three
wide and played no factor. MUCHACHO DUDE was outrun inside.
