Footnotes
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT, away about a length and a half slow, raced just off the fence inside a rival into the first turn, was held up behind foes racing a
path or two removed from the rail heading up the backstretch, tipped out a bit further nearing the far turn, advanced four wide on that bend to take the lead
past the three-sixteenths, drifted out under left-handed urging and exchanged contact with a rival near the sixteenth pole while momentarily losing the lead
but dug in under vigorous hand urging thereafter to reassert and prevail. WILMAS IRISH ROVER was forwardly-positioned inside foes into the first turn,
eased back off the pacesetter still on or just off the rail, was coaxed a bit leaving the backstretch, guided out entering the far turn to be five deep by the latter
part of that bend and gaining momentum, struck a narrow lead nearing the sixteenth pole while drifting in, exchanged a bump at that juncture and was
outfinished. LONS OXBOW raced inside a foe but in the four path then briefly between runners into the first turn dropping back to trail, advanced outside
rivals leaving the backstretch entering the far turn five deep and striking the lead by the five-sixteenths while gradually shifting in through that bend once
clear, came to the top of the stretch in the two path and was overtaken and empty thereafter. KEEP ON ZENON ON caught outside foes three to four deep
into the first turn, continued to chase in behind advancing to briefly bid between rivals three furlongs from home but could not sustain the effort and came up
empty. REBACK HOME was outside runners toward the back five wide into the first turn, took closer order up the backstretch making a brief bid four wide
and between runners near the three-eighths pole but came up empty. BORTSTEIN went in about the three path through both turns racing toward the back
and was never near enough to threaten. LAYCOCK BAY set the early tempo racing off the rail and in the clear leaving the first turn, moved in a bit heading
up the backstretch and was challenged by outside rivals late up the straight, checked past the three-eighths when in a bit tight and dropped back. Following
an objection by the rider of WILMAS IRISH ROVER against SURPRSINGLYPERFECT as well as an objection by the rider of LAYCOCK BAY against KEEP
ON ZENON ON alleging interference, and upon review by the stewards, no action was taken and results to stand as is.

Footnotes
ANOTHER BROTHER settled off the leaders and in the clear, moved four wide on the turn taking the lead about the three-sixteenths then drew off in the
lane while kept to the task. AMOR N PASION pressed the pace from outside, bid three wide on the turn, kept on under urging to save the place. DEVIL'S
TEETH chased inside on or just off the rail in behind the leaders losing ground into and early on the turn, angled five wide out of that bend and ran on
belatedly to gain show honors. WHEREDOESTHECASHGO vied inside runners for the lead up the backstretch, weakened in the stretch. LORD CHARLES
broke a half-step slowly, raced well back off the inside, fanned six deep into the stretch and had no rally. DONTPREACHTO DARCY contested the early
pace outside a foe then between runners into and on the turn, was empty in the drive. STORM ON broke outwardly and awkwardly, raced at the rear off the
inside, fanned seven deep out of the turn and was never a threat. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
IMPUTED stalked from outside, moved four wide to bid for the lead on the turn taking command by five-sixteenths, drew clear turning for home and was
kept to the task with a safe margin. MY BOY ZAYN settled in the back half, advanced inside foes on the turn gaining position into upper stretch, came out
about four deep at that point and was second best while gaining in the late stages. ENROUTE bobbled just slightly at the break, raced well off the inside
mid-pack going in the four path on the turn and beginning to advance but lacked the needed late kick. VIVARO raced mid-pack moving nearer inside
heading up the backstretch, raced just off the rail into the turn before shifting four wide nearing the three-sixteenths, ran on evenly thereafter.
DOUBLEDOWN DREAMER chased the leader early, made a mild bid three wide and between runners on the turn but came up empty. WAY OFF COURSE
broke a half-step slowly then was unhurried, went in the three to four path early on the turn swinging seven wide into upper stretch and gained mildly.
SPEED BUMP stumbled at the start, raced outside rivals well back into the turn going four wide on that bend and failed to rally. FIELD GENERAL lacked
early speed racing inside rivals but just off the fence into the turn, came out a bit on that bend and was never a threat. SICULO chased the pace early,
contended briefly from between runners into the turn before steadying while dropping back near the five-sixteenths, faded thereafter. TALEGA DE ORO set
the pace moving in, raced inside on the turn then faded.

Footnotes
A ZENON NITE exchanged a bump at the break, settled into stride toward the back early then advanced into and on the turn going four to five wide and
inside a rival early on that bend making a bid for the lead between foes by the top of the stretch, took a narrow lead and held sway under a drive. SKEETER
WHO stalked the leading pair then moved up outside those three to four wide into the turn, bid between foes into upper stretch, was held at bay by the
aforementioned but was second best. QUANTICO JOE raced forwardly in behind the leaders early, went in the three to four path on the turn and put to a
drive late on that bend coming out of it five deep, advanced inside a foe in upper- to mid-stretch and bumped with that rival late. RADICAL ERUPTION was
steadied at the start when the inside rival came out, settled well back racing off the inside, began to advance five then six wide and outside rivals on the
turn, exchanged a bump with QUANTICO JOE in late stretch. BULLY RIDE exchanged contact at the start, pressed the pace from outside up the
backstretch then between runners two to three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. DRIVE THRU GARY raced toward the back early, went by
himself in the four to five path on the turn coming out a bit wider for the drive but failed to rally. RUNAWAY REGENT set a pressured pace along the inside,
was still in contention to the furlong marker then gave way and faded. TARGARYCAT was forwardly-positioned outside a foe mid-pack up the backstretch,
went three to four wide early on the turn then shifted in near the three-sixteenths, had no rally in the stretch. ICED came out at the break, chased from inside
dropping back leaving the backstretch, moved out two to three wide through the turn and failed to rally. INSOMNIA stumbled at the start, lacked speed
racing in behind, steadied slightly past the three-eights when on heels, switched out at that juncture going in the four to five path on the turn and was not a
threat.

Footnotes
EVACUEE exchanged a bump at the break, was encouraged to a more forward position early in pursuit of the leading pair heading into the turn, went four
then five wide early on that bend taking the lead at the three-sixteenths and drifting in a path, kicked clear in upper- to mid-stretch and held safe. STORMIN
FAST bobbled into a rival at the start, was allowed to settle, advanced four wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. DADDY WHAT
IF was slow to gather then encouraged along up the backstretch, advanced three to four wide on the turn drifting out six deep leaving that bend and carrying
a rival, continued to run on mildly. SEVEN SILVER COINS was bumped at the break, dueled inside a foe but off the fence going in about the two to three
path through the turn before weakening. HOLD ME ONLY bumped the outer rival at the start, had good early position in behind the leaders racing just off
the rail in the two path through the turn and into the stretch but failed to rally. INDEFINITELY broke outwardly, raced outside in the back half, went five wide
on the turn before being carried seven deep by a drifting rival out of that bend, was empty thereafter. ARCH CITY raced inside and was never a threat. F S
POSITRACK was bumped into a rival at the start, prompted the pace from outside going three to four wide into the turn, dropped back and faded. WISKEY
CROWN was bumped by the inside rival and exchanged contact with the outside foe at the start, chased the leaders going into the turn three wide and
beginning to weaken, continued to drop back. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
FORTY FIVES STORM broke inwardly, pressed the pace from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, came out just a bit leaving that bend making the
slightest of brushing contact with S S DIAMOND to his outside, edged clear of that rival in the lane. JEWEL OF NAVARONE was bumped hard into outside
rivals soon after the start and consequently far back in the early going, began to pick it up in the four path through the turn having reached striking distance
nearing the furlong marker, angled in at that juncture and ran on to gain the place over. S S DIAMOND , who broke a step slowly, altered outside an incident
soon after the break, advanced outside foes late on the turn having gone five then six wide on that bend commencing a bid by the top of the stretch but
could not sustain the effort. TSURUOKA was bumped outwardly after the break resulting in in MAIL MAN M G clipping heels, thereupon set a pressured
pace from between runners and came up empty in the stretch. CAUSING CHAOS veered out shortly after the break bumping a rival hard into outside rivals,
raced inside up th backstretch mid-pack before switching out entering the turn, went three to four deep on that bend and failed to rally. STACKING ROCKS
broke inwardly exchanging repeated light bumps with the inside foe, vied three to four wide and between foes into the turn then came up empty.
TULAROSA STORM broke slowly then steadied when in tight soon after the start, raced unhurriedly toward the back off the inside going in the three to four
path through the turn. CHET WHO was bumped hard into the outside rival after the start, vied inside, dropped back and faded. F S GOLD exchanged
repeated bumps at the break and was forced inwardly then bobbled in behind a runner perhaps clipping heels and taking up, was not hard-ridden racing off
the inside in about the three path on the turn thereafter. MAIL MAN M G exchanged bumps from between rivals at the start then clipped heels and lost the
rider soon thereafter, walked off. Following the race the stewards' held an inquiry into the incident after the start. In addition, the rider of S S DIAMOND
lodged an objection against FORTY FIVES STORM alleging interference. The objection was not allowed, but the stewards did disqualify CAUSING CHAOS
from fifth and placing him last for starting a chain reaction which resulted in MAIL MAN M G losing the rider.
