Footnotes
HOPEFUL PRINCESS prompted the pace setter two wide, inched closer to bid for the lead at the quarter pole sparking a duel with her inner foe, dueled
gamely through the lane before determinedly prevailing at the sixteenth pole. MAD MADDY set the pace along the rail through the turn, dug in gamely
turning for home as HOPEFUL PRINCESS ranged up along side, persistently held an advantage to the furlong pole, but was bested at the sixteenth pole
while well clear of show. TEQUILA QUEEN hopped at the start, recovered to achive inside stalking position from the pocket around the turn, shifted three
wide turning for home, but came up empty, hung on her left lead, and held show. PRETTYHAPPY broke a bit in and brushed the gate and a rival at the
start, raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn, cut down to the inside turning for home, squeezed through a narrow rail gap after being crowded
by DOUBLE WHOPPER at the three sixteenths pole, then stayed on mildly while on her left lead late. COOL ENOUGH tracked from the three to four path in
midpack aorund the turn, then flattened out through the lane. SHAKE IT OUT WEST took the turn in the two path, and failed to get involved. SUMMER WAR
was outsprinted after the start, saved ground far off of the pace, and never got involved. DOUBLE WHOPPER hopped at the start, chased three to four
wide, then lugged inwards while weakening in upper stretch. MY MARGARET ANNE trailed in the four, then three, path around the turn, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
RULER OF THE NILE stalked three wide while in the four path through the turn, inched forward to make a bid for the lead outside of the leaders in upper
stretch, was brushed by his inner rival passing the furlong pole, but stayed determined and prevailed under a long drive. I'M CORFU dueled outside of
BARRY LEE while staying in the three path through the turn, forged a lead turning for home, but drifted out under left handed pressure passing the furlong
pole, brushed RULER OF THE NILE, then was bested by that foe at the sixteenth pole. ZAEVION saved ground into the turn, shifted from the three to five
path turning for home, improved in upper stretch, then held show in the late the stages. T LOVES A FIGHT took the turn two to three wide, got floated to the
six path turning for home, and made a late gain to miss show without threatening the leaders. STAY HOME had a slow start, trailed through the turn, swung
to the seven path turning for home, then passed tired rivals. SHARP ART stalked from the pocket while in the two path around the turn, but lacked a kick to
split foes in upper stretch, failed to keep pace with the leaders, and weakened at the furlong pole. BARRY LEE dueled inside of IM CORFU through the turn,
but gave way turning for home. SPLASH FOR GOLD shifted from the four to two path into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

and was repelled by her inner rival late. GYPSY WIFE was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted off of the rail around the turn, then to the five path
turning for home, and held show through the lane. UNION SONG was bumped at the start and crowded between horses early on, shifted from the three to
the six path in upper stretch, and finished willingly. STYLISH ASH was bumped at the start, midpack two to three path between horses, and wasnt a factor.
MAGICALLY HONORED prompted then vied two wide between horses to upper stretch, but weakened late. ENGLISH ESCORT saved ground to no avail.
NESSUM DORMA trailed, came into the lane in the four path, and passed tired rivals. ROZAFA broke a bit in forcing rivals to bump, set the pace inside of a
trio of foes into and around the turn, but weakened turning for home. LAVALIER was far back in the four path into turn, seven path upper, weakened.
STRONG WORK was bumped at the start and squeezed back out of the gate, then took the two path around the turn and failed to factor. REVEALING
QUALITY was bumped at the start, off the pace five wide into the turn, but was eased approaching the five sixteenths pole, taken outwards, then galloped
through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SUMMER REVOLUTION prompted the pace setter two wide, took over approaching the quarter pole, was driven clear in upper stretch, then geared down in
the final sixteenth. SPIKES SHIRL was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted to the three path turning for home, but proved no match for the leader in
upper stretch, then kept on through the lane to held place. KRISTO stalked three wide, was floated to the four path turning for home, then got outfinished by
that rival for place late. ERNIE BANKS set the pace along the inside of multiple rivals into the turn, but was no match for the leader approaching the quarter
pole, then yielded through the lane. SOLO DRINK had a slow start, took the turn in the four path, then finished mildly between horses. ALL ABOUT ASHLEY
stalked four wide, but weakened when floated five wide at the quarter pole. JUNIOR GILLIAM saved ground while off of the pace through the turn, but to no
avail. SUN BROWN three to two path turn, no factor. OBTAINED trailed early on, three path turn, no factor. GET EM UP SCOUT hesitated at the start and
was off multiple lengths slowly, took the turn in the three path, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. SENOR FRIDAY vied along the inside down the
chute, but weakened after coming under a drive at the five furlong pole, was eased into the lane, then jogged across the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
FEELING IT vied along the inside early on before taking back to stalk from the pocket into the turn, shifted three wide at the five sixteenths pole to make a
bid for the lead between horses turning for home, then prevailed outside of a game foe while under a long drive. HIS GIANT dueled inside of a rival through
the turn, dug in gamely as multiple rivals made bid in upper stretch, but it was not enough to keep the winner at bay passing the furlong pole. JERSEY
AGENDA stalked three wide, was floated to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leaders passing
the three sixteenths pole, and held show to the wire. SOUTHSIDER saved ground far off of the pace, then offered a belated rail rally through the lane.
GRADE was caught, and stayed, in the six path through the turn, then stayed on mildly outside of rivals. BIG IRON took a slight bump at the start, saved
ground in midpack, shifted off of the rail turning for home, but found traffic passing the sixteenths pole before splitting rivals to improve position approaching
the wire. INTONATION broke outwards and forced a rival out, took the turn two wide between horses, then finished evenly. VINEYARD dueled two wide
around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. QUEST FOR FIRE was forced outwards at the start, took the turn in the five path, then
weakened late. COME ON VENEZUELA four path turn, weakened upper stretch. FELIPE was fractious in the gate before it opened, took the turn two wide
while in the three path, but found traffic turning for home, and lacked a rally thereafter. HORSEFEATHERS hopped when the gates opened, then was
crowded at the start, trailed throughout, swung to the six path turning for home, but was eased through the lane.
