Footnotes
HERO OF THE FUTURE bumped with GRAN OLD PARR at the start, advanced to contention after three furlongs, rallied steadily outside and drew off after
catching the leaders near the sixteenth-pole. MR. VECCHIO pressed the pace outside GRAN OLD PARR from the start, wore that rival down past the
furlong marker, but was no match for the winner late. VALID EXCHANGE eyed the battling leaders on the turn, opted to go inside and found himself boxed
in along the rail past the quarter-pole, altered course awkwardly in upper stretch and finished with good courage on the wrong lead.. GRAN OLD PARR
bumped with HERO OF THE FUTURE at the start, set a pressured pace inside, and weakened on the rail in deep stretch. NINTH OF APRIL bumped with
KING OF THE SOUTH at the start, was outrun to the lane, and could not gain outside. KING OF THE SOUTH got bumped between horses at the start and
was off slow, and never reached contention. ATAKAN stumbled badly a stride out of the gate, and was far back throughout. DIAMOND PORT bumped with
KING OF THE SOUTH at the start, dropped far back four wide approaching the stretch, got unsaddled on the gallop-out and walked off.

Footnotes
TRAVY BOY pressed the pace outside TAKE CHARGE DUDE from the start, stayed on task resolutely in the stretch, and edged away through the last
sixteenth of a mile. TAKE CHARGE DUDE broke running and grabbed the lead off the rail, fended off TRAVY BOY to deep stretch, and yielded grudgingly.
ARRIVEDERLA was outrun for a half-mile, and rallied mildly inside to go clear of the rest late. KILLA DEE eyed the leaders four wide to the lane, and lacked
the needed response on the far outside. LI'L MEATBALL lacked room between KILLA DEE and TRAVY BOY at the start, and failed to make his presence
felt.

Footnotes
GAUZY followed behind the leaders inside for six furlongs, maneuvered out for clearance three wide near the top of the stretch, wrested command outside
INEDATEQUILA turning for home and drew off under pressure. INEDATEQUILA bumped with SUNDAY SCHEMING at the start, pressed the pace outside
MADAME MOON, took over midway on the far turn, could not handle GAUZY in upper stretch but ran on best of the others. TONED UP raced three wide,
came under urging after a half-mile, lacked a solid bid and was along for the show outside. MADAME MOON set a pressured pace toward the inside,
relinquished command on the far turn, and faded in the stretch. SUNDAY SCHEMING bumped with INEDATEQUILA at the start, tracked the leaders well
out in the track for six furlongs, and came up empty. MISS CHEENY saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
ALLEGEDLY PERFECT cleared to the early lead and crossed over inside, rated along to the stretch a bit off the rail, responded when set down and was
never in jeopardy. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF gave chase outside the winner throughout, and could not menace in the stretch while best of the others.
CHARLIECANDO came three wide off the turn, and was no threat with an even finish. CARSON AND I was no factor through an inside trip. FLUENT IN
SARCASM got shuffled back between horses past the half-mile pole, moved out four wide around the turn, and made no headway. PRINCE IGOR got taken
off the inside early, went five wide around the turn and made no impact. HANDSOME GUY showed brief speed outside, and retreated before reaching the
stretch.

Footnotes
TALKTHETALK moved to contention four wide late on the turn, wrested command outside NO SE VERDE in upper stretch and drove well clear. NO SE
VENDE was hard to load and broke a beat slow, shot through inside the leaders to take over on the rail past the five-sixteenths, proved no match for the
winner after straightening away for the drive, but held second while shortening stride on the wrong lead. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN was off a step slow, cut
the corner advancing mildly turning for home, but could not sustain the rally. TOONIE LOONIE pressed the early pace, lodged a brief bid between horses on
the far turn, and flattened out. MYSTIC COMIN HOME grabbed the lead with a sharp start, got overhauled from both flanks five-sixteenths out, and dropped
back steadily. MISS MARIS chased three wide into the turn, and was finished after a half-mile. KATNISS KAN raced five wide, and dropped far back after a
half.

Footnotes
TONS OF GOLD advanced between horses midway on the turn, waited briefly in the four-path as YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN went by to his outside at the
top of the stretch, rallied steadily outside that rival through the final furlong, reached the lead nearing the wire and was out-bobbed to share the win.
YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN moved four wide to contention after six furlongs, took over outside FRIED RICE KING in upper stretch and edged clear, drifted
in through the late stages getting headed by TONS OF GOLD, and had his nose down on the line to save a split decision. BLESSED JOURNEY began
moving late on the turn, shifted out to the three-path into the lane, altered course behind the leaders past the eighth-pole and kept on gamely to the finish.
FRIED RICE KING dueled outside SWING WEST through a sharp pace, won that battle after six furlongs, but weakened through the stretch. VIPER settled
in the middle of the field early, was driven five wide approaching the stretch, but lacked the needed response. SWING WEST vied inside FRIED RICE KING
for nearly six furlongs, and faltered through the drive. SPEEDY HANS pressed the pace three wide to the end of the turn, and tired. RODEO RED was
finished after a half-mile inside.

TIME TO TWO STEP swept up four wide running by the leaders and opening daylight past the five-sixteenths, drifted in under steady pressure through the
furlong grounds, jumped back to her left lead nearing the 70-yard marker and wound up on the rail still well clear. PAOLA'S TEAM was never too far back,
moved clear of the others three wide going by the quarter-pole, but could not menace the winner late on the far outside. ABARRIO FOREVER raced three
then four wide around the turn, and lacked a bid. OHMYMY saved ground trailing to the turn, and made no impact. LIL BIT DANGEROUS chased the
pacesetter to midway on the far turn, and faltered. ANGELIC KNUGGET sped off early, yielded readily on the rail after completing a half-mile, was retreating
when she stumbled and lost the rider approaching the top of the stretch, and walked off after being apprehended. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

SOLID AS A ROCK sped to the front after the start, ambled along clear around the turn in the three-path, settled into the stretch well in command and was
kept to pressure. LOVELY LADY LEXI was outsprinted early inside, shifted out four wide leaving the turn, and was up for the place in the final strides while
not a threat to the winner. GREY JAZMINE advanced four wide around the turn, drifted in through the lane on the wrong lead and was nailed for second
late. GO GATOR GIRL GO was slow early despite being urged considerably, and never became prominent. DANCING DESTROYER gave futile chase for a
half-mile three wide, and folded up. ROYAL MISTRESS showed speed to the turn before retreating, and dropped far back in the stretch.

FRENCH QUARTER tracked from close range to the turn, took over outside SO LONG CHUCK past the three-eighths pole, entered the stretch in command
and chugged along without benefit of a lead change. SO LONG CHUCK set the pace slightly removed from the rail, was no match for the winner leaving the
turn, and ran on to hold the place. DESERT GENERAL raced three wide around the turn, and could not threaten with an even finish. SENSATIONAL RIDE
was ridden along inside around the turn, and could not advance. BIG BOY BRUNO moved inside while outrun early, passed some tired horses after six
furlongs but had nothing more. ROYALSTON was always far back. DAKOTA'S DUDE raced four wide, and was finished by the top of the stretch. MR.
CREATIVE raced far back four wide. BLAKEY was done early, and eased up through the stretch. COMETIN dropped far back on the turn, was pulled up at
the top of the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
TONALIST'S SHAPE was content to track from close range for a half-mile, took over outside CHEERMEISTER and DREAM MARIE late on the far turn, and
was driving to the finish. DREAM MARIE pressed the pace outside CHEERMEISTER, poked a head in front between horses after six furlongs, was no
match for the winner turning for home, but battled back on the rail to retake second. PLEASANT ORB saved ground forwardly placed into the first turn, lost
some position unhurried through the run up the backstretch, was roused to get going past the half-mile pole, ran up behind the leaders and steadied midway
on the far turn, shifted four wide to loom a threat outside TONALIST'S SHAPE at the top of the stretch, but flattened out and yielded second late. UP IN
SMOKE was three wide early, moved further out on the far turn and failed to menace. VIGILANTES WAY hit the left side of the gate and was off slowest,
tugged under a hold inside entering the first turn, and was empty after six furlongs. CHEERMEISTER cleared to the lead around the first turn removed from
the rail, was hounded up the backstretch from outside by DREAM MARIE, and folded up leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
THE BIG JOKER veered out causing crowding at the start, pressed the pace outside YOUREOUTOFCONTROL, took over around the turn and pulled clear,
and was kept to pressure on the wrong lead. MAQUIAVELO was bumped between AWESOME ENOUGH and MAMMOTH after the start, raced in the
second flight around the turn near the two-path, and finished well to get the place. AWESOME ENOUGH was crowded and bumped after the start by THE
BIG JOKER and bumped with MAQUIAVELO, advanced rallying into second turning for home, drifted out late and was outfinished for that spot.
YOUREOUTOFCONTROL vied inside THE BIG JOKER early, yielded around the turn, and faded on the rail through the drive. HAPPY DANZA bumped with
MAMMOTH at the start, raced four wide approaching the stretch, and tired. MAMMOTH bumped with HAPPY DANZA at the start, then bumped with
MAQUIAVELO right after that, and gave way five wide leaving the turn. SUPER INTENSE broke slowly, steadied inside past the half-mile marker, and never
reached contention. KING OF THE NORTH lunged slightly at the start and was off slow, and never became prominent. SWINGIN ON A STAR was finished
early inside.
