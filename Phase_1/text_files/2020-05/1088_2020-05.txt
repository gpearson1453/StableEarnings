Footnotes
HIFALUTIN broke readily, was prompted to gain the lead just off the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace near the inside on a narrow margin racing
into the turn, shook clear leaving the midway point of the the turn and held sway through the stretch under firm left handed encouragement. BAD PAY
tracked the leaders outside foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued with interest
while edging rivals for the place honors late. BETTERTHENYOURX, urged along the rail in pursuit of the pacesetter racing to the turn, faded nearing the
stretch. MIGHTY ELECTRICA broke readily to gain the advantage racing to the chute, continued in touch with the pacesetter attending the pace through the
backstretch, was prompted to maintain striking distance racing through the turn but gave way into the lane. DONNAMEUP angled to the inside tracking the
leaders in second flight in the opening stages, switched outside foes midway through the turn, shifted five wide entering the stretch and continued with an
even effort. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS came through tight quarters at the start to track the leaders between foes on the backstretch but retreated early.
SHE'S A FAIR CATCH came through close quarters at the start, then shifted out to race four wide off the second flight through the backstretch and failed to
menace thereafter. R D BLESSING raced wide throughout and proved no factor. MY BLONDE MARY, pinched back at the start, soon trailed.

TWO LAST WORDS was rated stalking just inside the pacesetter racing through the backstretch into the turn, switched out three wide nearing upper stretch
while advancing to challenge, wrested the advantage leaving midstretch and edged forward in time under firm left handed pressure. WICKED WARRIOR
was urged to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the turn, dispatched several challenges
to edge forward in upper stretch, shifted out while being roused to resist the winner's challenge past midstretch but proved only second best. HE'S SMOKIN
NOW was settled last tracking off the second flight, was prompted to split rivals nearing upper stretch, then shifted out four wide and continued well enough
to gain a share in the closing stages. THE GODDESS LYSSA stumbled at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing
into the turn, pressed the issue between foes nearing upper stretch but gave way entering the lane. LIBERATE, held up in close quarters racing just off the
first flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted out three wide entering the turn while being prompted to lodge a brief bid, soon gave way and was
fanned five wide into the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY JORDAN broke readily, angled to the inside racing setting the pace into the first turn, went well clear through the backstretch, shifted out entering the
lane while being roused to resist a rival's challenge and just held HONESTA to the end under brisk right handed pressure. The latter tracked the pacesetter
outside a rival in second flight while conceding position racing into the backstretch, advanced to striking distance shifting three deep nearing the lane,
moved to terms contesting the issue through the stretch but was outfinished. MOMS LOVE tracked just off the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second
flight in early stages, was prompted to bid inside the leaders entering the lane but was outkicked. SPLENDOR BEACH broke in the air while getting away
very slowly, switched out sharply racing into the first turn, advanced to contention five wide through the backstretch, continued with a steady four wide
advance to upper stretch but had no late kick. BORN TO GROOVE, held up near the inside avoiding some traffic racing to the first turn, swung out four wide
racing into the far turn and made an effort to gain some position in late stages. BIZ MAKER tracked the leaders just off the second flight racing three deep to
the backstretch and faded between foes racing through the far turn. LEGAL IN CANADA, pulling against restraint while avoiding some traffic racing to the
first turn, continued between foes off the second flight to the far turn but offered no rally. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE, caught four wide racing through the first turn
to the backstretch, retreated early. CATTLEYA tracked the pace between foes just off the second flight, then faded into upper stretch. FERLAND'S
PROSPECT was steadied avoiding traffic nearing the first turn, tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but proved
empty in the drive.

Footnotes
FLAMING INDY, forwardly placed three deep prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue in that path through the turn, forged clear racing into upper stretch
and was kept to pressure. RIDGELYSREDHOT angled to the inside prompting the pace, couldn't match the winner in the drive but proved best of the
others. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL, urged between foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage to the turn, gave way racing into upper stretch. BLAZING
DIVA tracked the first flight from out of striking distance racing in the four path into the turn, continued in that path to the lane but offered no closing bid.
LINCOLN CENTER tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and faded in late stages. SHANGHAI KIMMY, off slowly, then forced in at the
start, dropped well off the field racing to the turn and passed between tiring rivals to gain some position late. DRAMATONE retreated early. KATIE'S LAST
DANCE, a bit restless loading in the gate, raced wide throughout and proved no threat. SENA THE DUCHESS swerved in sharply at the start shutting off
SHANGHAI KIMMY, was settled along the inside racing to the turn but proved no threat.

Footnotes
PUNTSVILLE broke sharply, attended the pace three deep racing into the turn, edged forward of O'KEEFFE nearing midstretch, then held that foe to the
end under firm handling and a few right handed taps. The latter was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, grudgingly resisted
the winner to late stages but proved only second best. REDEEM MY HEART, off a step slowly, was settled along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground
through the bend, swung out four wide nearing midstretch and produced her best stride late to prevail for a share. NO MERCY PERCY tracked off the first
flight racing in the four path to the turn, briefly gained contention in that path nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. REGAL CHANT angled to the
inside tracking just off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in late stages. LADY NINA settled off the second flight near the inside early,
shifted out approaching the turn, then angled five wide racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. DEALER'S GIRL flashed brief pace between foes
contesting the lead to the turn but emptied out midway through the bend.

ROL AGAIN QUESTION broke readily to attend a rival's pace under light rating racing through the first turn to the backstretch, took over after a half to gain
a clear advantage racing into the far turn and was kept to steady pressure to hold I'M A G SIX on a safe margin to the end. The latter was rated three, then
four deep in second flight racing to the backstretch tracking the leaders out of striking distance, advanced readily on the leader three deep nearing the far
turn, then continued with a steady bid to close the gap on that foe in late stages while failing to gain even terms. OPTIC WAY, urged to dictate the pace on a
narrow advantage along the inside to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the top pair along the inside to upper stretch and prevailed for a share.
GENERAL PADDY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight in early stages, was prompted to advance while caught in close quarters approaching
the far turn, switched outside the top pair on the far turn, then shifted to the four path in the stretch but finished evenly in late stages. AFTERBURNER,
urged to a forward placing racing three deep just off the first flight into the first turn, faded between foes after a half. BLUE SKY KOWBOY bobbled slightly at
the start, angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside nearing the lane but offered no rally.

Footnotes
CHANNELEDSLONGSHOT, reserved off the second flight while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dropped out last between calls entering the far
turn, switched off the inside gathering momentum nearing upper stretch, split foes then shifted out five wide racing through upper stretch while gaining
striking distance, was carried to the seven path in late stages but continued with a steady late response to just nip BROWN ESSENCE in time under firm left
handed pressure. The latter gained a forward placing racing just outside the first flight to the backstretch, took over racing into the far turn, held sway on a
clear margin past midstretch but swerved out sharply in the final sixteenth while just failing to contain the winner. SINATRA DEVIL angled inwards to track
just off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, switched out four wide on the far turn, steadily advanced in that path between foes past
midstretch and prevailed for a share on the wire while failing to match the top pair. SPEAKERIT angled to the inside early tracking just off the first flight in
the opening half, came around a tiring foe on the far turn to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch, bid inside the leaders midstretch but was
outkicked. SKY D, caught four wide tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep between foes racing through the
far turn to upper stretch gaining contention but flattened out nearing the furlong marker. NEAT STREET tracked the leaders between foes racing to the
backstretch, angled to the rail after a half, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out while being prompted to advance between foes but lacked the
needed final kick. SILAO, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, set the pace to the far turn and gave out after six furlongs. HALEL,
reserved along the inside early, failed to menace. WICKED COURAGE, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the backstretch, was
spent after a half.

Footnotes
WILSHIRE STAR angled to the inside racing through the backstretch prompting a rival's pace, took over racing into the turn while shifting well off the rail,
then held sway on a clear margin to the end under firm encouragement. JUNCTION, forwardly placed three deep between foes attending the pace, angled
inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch while being urged to challenge but proved no match while holding well for the place honors. THE KAHN settled
between foes in the last flight early, shifted in on the turn, then gathered momentum in late stages to split foes three deep gaining position to the end.
ENGLISH LAUGHTER, fractious and reluctant loading in the gate, tracked the leaders four wide in second flight, shifted inwards nearing the lane, then
gained some position while altering course avoiding some traffic in the closing stages. VENEZUELAN WARRIOR switched off the inside early to track off
the first flight between foes, made brief progress three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but proved empty in late stages. JOSIE'S RIDDLE switched
out three deep early to track the leaders in second flight, angled inwards on the turn while being prompted to gain position between foes but faded between
rivals late. OLLIVANDER angled inside early tracking the leaders in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but came up empty in late stages.
UNSPOILED MOMENTS dropped out early. MEILLEUR, urged to a forward placing four wide prompting the leaders through the backstretch, gave way
racing into the turn. CALL ME HANDSOME vied briefly between foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, gave way once
headed entering the bend. GIANT TRICK settled outside foes in the last flight and dropped out early.

Footnotes
DOUBLY BLESSED, reserved in early stages, split foes gaining position midway through the backstretch, angled inside nearing the far turn, saved ground
to upper stretch gathering momentum, tipped out three, then four wide in the closing stages while moving to challenge for command, then wrested a narrow
advantage in time under left handed pressure and some correction from his rider to prevail in time. RELIABILITY tracked off the second flight outside foes
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide after a half, moved to challenge the leaders three deep racing into the far turn, skirmished
with BEACHWALKER racing through the stretch while exchanging repeated contact, then drifting out late but edged that foe for the place honors while
failing to contain the winner. BEACHWALKER tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted off the inside to split foes
midway through the far turn challenging for command, shifted about under pressure through the stretch while exchanging repeated contact with
RELIABILITY and was just outfinished by the top pair. IDLE TIME angled inwards to track just off the second flight between foes under rating to the
backstretch, gained some position while caught in close quarters nearing the second bend, switched out avoiding traffic midway through the far turn to race
four wide between foes into upper stretch and continued to make some mild progress late. FELIX THE FOX, pulling against restraint inside foes just behind
the second flight in the opening half, switched out of close quarters racing through the far turn, swung five wide nearing the lane and continued with a mild
bid. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail to the second bend and gave way racing
into upper stretch. U S DELTA FORCE, pulling against light rating while between foes stalking the pacesetter in second flight to the backstretch, was
steadied out of tight quarters midway through the far turn and quickly emptied out. THE HAPPY GIANT was settled last dropping well off the field to the
backstretch and failed to menace. HELLFIRE BOB, forwardly placed three deep in second flight tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, gave way after a
half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
