the rail, angled to the inside on the turn, came out in upper stretch and gained the place. TETON VALLEY had speed between horses then dueled outside
the winner, could not match that one in the stretch, lost the place in deep stretch and just held third. ALPINE THUNDER broke slowly, settled off the rail,
angled to the inside on the turn and finished with interest along the fence. TRIPP A MATIC chased off the rail then a bit off the fence on the turn, came out
into the stretch and lacked a rally. INGEST had speed three deep then stalked just off the rail, came out into the stretch and weakened. RANTANEN settled

DIVA IN CHARGE prompted the pace three deep, took the lead outside a rival on the second turn, inched clear then drew off in the stretch under a
moderate hand ride and a long hold late. MANRESA came off the rail in the run to the first turn and tugged outside a rival, continued a bit off the fence
leaving the second turn and into the stretch and clearly bested the others. NEW YEAR NEW ME had good early speed and set a pressured pace inside,
continued along the rail into the stretch and held third. MARCI THE GREAT saved ground stalking the pace, came out leaving the second turn and into the
stretch and weakened. TURKISH ANGEL between horses early, angled in on the first turn and chased inside, dropped back leaving the second turn and
also weakened. ALICIA'S PRIDE pressed the pace between horses, dropped back on the second turn, gave way and was eased in the stretch.
