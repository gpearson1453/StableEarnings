Footnotes
ELUSIVE RO broke readily to race on terms with the leaders in the opening sixteenth, was rated between foes dropping just off the first flight through the
backstretch, shifted out racing into the turn while advancing on the leaders four wide nearing upper stretch, bid for command in that path, then wrested the
advantage and went clear under firm left handed encouragement. GREELEY'S FAREWELL broke inwards at the the start, was quickly righted to track just
off the first flight outside foes racing through the backstretch, advanced three deep entering the turn to press the issue between rivals racing into upper
stretch but proved no match for the winner. SAMMY'S MINESHAFT broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn,
dueled for command between foes to upper stretch but came up empty in the closing stages. STEADY EARNER tracked off the first flight between foes
racing to the turn and faded into the stretch. TARTAN THE BULL, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way nearing the
lane. TALE OF A SONG tracked off the second flight outside foes through the backstretch, raced five wide through the turn and gave way entering the lane.
HEBGONE, shuffled a bit avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled well off the field racing to the turn and never gained contention.

Footnotes
BRYCENS GOLD broke readily to gain a position tracking the pacesetter three, then four wide as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch under
light reserve, moved to wrest command outside the pacesetter racing into the far turn, took over midway through the bend and went well clear under firm
right handed pressure. TIMELESS DI broke readily to gain a forward placing along the rail, switched outside the pacesetter on the first turn to track that foe
between rivals into the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn while being urged in pursuit of the winner to the stretch but couldn't regain terms with that foe.
IVORYSGOLDTREASURE, off a bit slowly, settled last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes gaining position racing
into the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and continued to gain position to the end. TALK NICE hustled to the lead outside a rival racing to the first
turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail on a clear margin into the far turn but gave out once headed by the winner. CHICA DIFISEL, pulling a bit against
restraint while caught in close quarters between rivals tracking just off the second flight into the backstretch, dropped out midway through the backstretch,
angled out five wide racing into the stretch and passed some tiring rivals in the closing stages. TENERIFE MOON, off a bit slowly, angled to the inside
racing into the first turn while making progress to gain terms with the second flight entering the backstretch, continued inside foes to the second bend and
emptied out. EXPLOSIVE PACKAGE, restless in the gate, tracked off the second flight three wide between rivals to the backstretch, continued in that path
through the far turn, then angled inside rivals entering the lane but quickly came up empty. ICY SWEET angled inwards tracking the pacesetter along the
inside, then between foes through the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn and was gathered up late. SPEEDY RUNNER tracked off the second
flight racing four wide to the backstretch, gave way into the far turn and was gathered up in the closing stages.

Footnotes
JACKIES DREAM broke readily to gain terms with the first flight three deep between foes racing to the first turn, was held up avoiding close quarters while
conceding some position racing through the first turn, shifted out four wide after a half while being prompted to advance, bid for command in that path racing
into the far turn, continued in a protracted skirmish outside a rival to upper stretch but edged clear late under firm right handed pressure. AND I KNOW was
rated stalking just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing through the far turn, then continued three deep into the
lane to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. RED KITTEN, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace to the backstretch, was urged to press
the issue inside the eventual winner racing through the far turn to upper stretch, couldn't match that foe in the last furlong and just missed for second.
WICKED WITCH tracked off the second flight between foes under rating to the backstretch, came through close quarters three deep racing into the far turn,
split rivals in that path to gain position racing into the lane but lacked the needed late kick. JOST DREAMY was rated off the second flight while switching
outside foes racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned five wide into the stretch
and had no late response. INCA PRINCESS settled between foes in the last flight early and never gained contention. SYZYGY, urged to join the pace four
wide racing to the first turn, shifted inwards on that bend to prompt the leaders three deep into the backstretch, continued in that path into the far turn and
soon gave way. BATI BATI veered out at the start losing position to the leaders, then raced wide throughout while proving no threat. LADY AND ME settled
along the inside racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. LITTLE NATALIA, urged to the lead from the break while angling to the inside, set
the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
CITY GUY broke readily to gain a forward placing stalking the pacesetter under firm rating racing to the first turn, pulled his way to terms with that foe on the
backstretch while remaining under firm restraint, was prompted to gain command racing into the far turn and held sway to the end under firm handling.
ESTILO PELIGROSO was held up off the second flight outside foes racing to the the first turn, steadied momentarily avoiding tight quarters entering the
backstretch, continued under light reserve outside foes to the far turn, then came out entering the lane to advance three deep on the winner but proved only
second best. TITHED switched out three deep in early stages tracking just off the leaders, gained terms with those foes between rivals racing to the far turn,
angled to the inside nearing the lane while pursuing the winner but couldn't regain terms with that foe while edging a rival for a share. LORD BYRON
tracked the pace outside rivals in second flight, shifted out four wide on the backstretch, advanced in that path racing to the far turn to lodge a brief bid
outside the winner nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. FRIO, restless in the gate, hesitated at the start, then broke in the air, was prompted
to regain position splitting foes three deep racing into the far turn but had no rally. PROUD DEPLORABLE, angled to the inside early tracking off the second
flight while pulling a bit, altered course racing into the backstretch while avoiding tight quarters, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn but never
menaced. BUMPA angled to the inside stalking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch but gave way after a half. RUBENSLEGACY sprinted to the
lead while angling to the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin for a half, dueled briefly inside foes racing into the far turn and gave way abruptly entering the
second bend. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
YABBA DABBA DUDE, forwardly placed inside foes attending the pace racing through the backstretch, conceded some position nearing the turn, shifted out
three deep nearing upper stretch while continuing with a steady bid then prevailed in the closing stages under firm handling and right handed
encouragement. C'ERA UNA VOLTA broke sharply, angled inwards to dictate the pace between foes on a narrow advantage, moved clear racing into the
turn remaining a bit off the rail, resisted the winner past midstretch but proved only second best. NOTACATBUTACARD tracked off the second flight in the
opening stages, steadied momentarily avoiding tight quarters racing past the five furlong marker, then again near the half mile marker, was urged to split
foes nearing upper stretch, swung four wide entering the lane and closed the gap on the top pair in a belated effort. WILD WIGGLIN JACK broke slowly,
switched out racing through the backstretch, was caught five wide racing through the turn to the lane and passed some tiring rivals late. KING DADDIO was
held up just off the first flight while shifting off the inside, altered course avoiding tight quarters leaving the five furlong marker, angled to the rail racing into
the turn and faded into the lane. RESIDENT tracked the leaders outside rivals in the second flight, raced four wide between foes through the turn and
steadily faded. JUST FLASHY joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the leaders to the turn and gave way. FAR FROM AWESOME
settled last along the inside in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. SPECTACULAR ROAD tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second
flight but gave way nearing the turn.

Footnotes
THREE QUARTER TIME broke readily, tracked the pacesetter under light reserve into the backstretch, moved to wrest the advantage from that foe racing
through the far turn and kicked clear through the stretch while being kept to firm encouragement. LAKE PARIMA angled to the inside tracking just off the
pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted out racing into the lane and proved best of the others. STONEY'S MONKEY tracked off the second flight in the
opening half, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and edged a rival for a share. LADY LARKO tracked the leader three deep as part of the
second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing into the far turn, then weakened in the drive. SCREEN IMAGE was prompted to a position
tracking off the second flight along the inside, switched out nearing the lane but had no rally. DATA DOLL was urged to the lead racing to the first turn, set
the pace on a clear margin to the far turn but gave way racing into the lane. TIZ HER WAY angled in to track the leaders between foes in second flight to the
far turn and gave way racing into the lane. UPSTAGING settled between foes racing to the first turn and proved no factor. CLOUDY TOO settled well off the
leaders and never menaced. SCHATZI trailed.

MISTER STORM broke outwards bumping J'S FLASHY HALO, was quickly righted to dispute the three deep between foes in the opening stages, continued
to duel for command inside a rival racing a bit off the rail, then went clear into the lane under firm encouragement. EARLY DELIGH settled inside foes racing
through the backstretch, shifted out on the turn, angled four wide racing into the stretch and prevailed for the place honors late. ONEWAYTICKET tracked
off the first flight between foes in early stages, angled to the inside on the turn and continued with a mild bid. J'S FLASHY HALO, bumped at the start while
shifting into the path of JEDI TEMPLE, was settled between rivals racing to the turn, then found some late momentum to split foes just off the inside gaining
position to the end. DANZO, urged to terms with the pacesetter four wide prompting that rival, shifted inwards racing into the turn contesting the issue and
gave way entering the lane. ACTSPECTATION tracked off the first flight four wide between foes racing to the turn but lacked a rally. JEDI TEMPLE, shuffled
out of tight quarters at the start, never gained contention. DAPPER MUN tracked the leaders five wide in second flight racing to the turn and soon gave way.
MIKADO dropped out early. SAVAGE MUSIC, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide on the turn to briefly loom outside
the leader but emptied out racing into the stretch. DRAFTABLE flashed brief pace inside the leaders but gave way early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
RIDER OF J'S FLASHY HALO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE START WHICH WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
FINE SPIRIT, reserved in hand along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch, steadily pulled his way forward
racing four wide into the far turn, shifted inwards while being roused to wrest the advantage entering the stretch, idled a bit despite firm encouragement,
then responded when headed by TETSU while exchanging bumps with that foe in the closing stages to just prevail under brisk handling. The latter was
settled off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, swung out four wide racing into the far turn, circled foes five wide racing into upper stretch to
loom outside the winner striking the front between calls while exchanging some contact late and just missed. BARREL OF STOUT was settled outside foes
in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out six wide entering the lane gathering momentum and was going well late. GEOGRAPHY tracked the
leaders outside foes in second flight, steadily gained contention three deep between foes to challenge for command in tandem while just inside the eventual
winner but lacked the needed late kick. ERIC THE SALESMAN sped to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper
stretch and, gave out late. GAMBLER'S FALLACY tracked off the second flight three deep between foes, shifted out nearing the lane to race four wide
between foes, then was prompted to make some mild progress while caught in close quarters in late stages. VINTNER, forwardly placed outside the
pacesetter prompting that rival to the far turn, gave way between foes into the lane. KING TIDE tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight
to the backstretch and gave way after a half. EMBATTLED tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way into the
lane. FLIGHT DECK was settled near the inside, was pulled up leaving the far turn, then was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
FEDERALE vied for command between foes from the outset, shook clear racing into the turn remaining a bit off the rail, steadily widened the advantage
under pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. LARGE in touch with the pacesetter four wide in early stages, tracked that rival three deep racing
into the turn, shifted inwards nearing the lane but continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. GOOD ON YA tracked off the second flight
between foes, angled out four wide racing into the lane and continued with interest to prevail for a share. DEVIL'S RULE angled inwards tracking off the
second flight racing through the backstretch, split foes racing into the lane, then angled to the rail but came up empty in late stages. BATS CHANCE settled
between foes in the last flight early, angled out five wide racing into the stretch and gained some position in an even effort. BEYOND STREETSMART,
steadied in close quarters early, angled to the inside tracking just off the second flight, saved ground on the bend and faded into the stretch. FOG
WARNING switched out four wide in early stages, continued in that path between foes racing into the turn and offered no rally. CLIFFY, forwardly placed
along the rail pursuing the leader, gave way into upper stretch. BLAME BISHOP flashed brief pace three deep between foes but gave way early. TEDDY'S
HONOR, caught five wide racing to the turn, soon dropped out. UNCLE KEVIN, restless in the gate, flashed brief pace four wide in early stages and gave
way abruptly after the opening quarter.
