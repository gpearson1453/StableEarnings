Footnotes
ALLEGIANCE, urged to the lead outside foes racing to the first turn, shifted to the inside once gaining a clear advantage, dictated the pace to the second
bend, repelled several challenges while shifting out entering the stretch and maintained a safe margin under firm right handed pressure.
SEVENTYSEVENWILOW, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, was prompted to advance in that path on the far
turn to challenge nearing upper stretch but proved no match. CROWN TO THE GOLD was prompted in early stages, tracked the leaders from well out
striking distance three deep between foes to the backstretch, continued between foes into the far turn, then angled inside the leaders entering the stretch to
edge a rival for a share. COMPLETELY BONKERS broke readily, was held up dropping off the first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while shifting out four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn but lacked the needed late kick. REIGNING WARRIOR was settled last off the
inside and passed only tiring rivals late. HONDO GUSTO, rated along the rail racing to the backstretch, never gained striking distance. MALEKITH, caught
four wide through the first turn to backstretch, never gained contention. THE WAYNE FACTOR, forwardly placed along the inside racing to the first turn,
switched outside the pacesetter prompting that foe after a half into the far turn and, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GALWAY STAR sped to the lead along the inside, kicked away to a clear advantage racing into the backstretch, was prompted to hold sway to the lane and
was kept to firm encouragement. SPLENDOR BEACH, held up between foes in the opening stages, switched outside foes racing into the first turn, shifted to
the five path entering the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes racing into the far turn while shifting inwards nearing the lane but couldn't gain
terms with the winner while holding a rival for the place honors. PADDY KAYE'S WILD, pulling a bit between foes, then steadied avoiding close quarters
leaving the chute, shifted out to race three, then four wide between rivals advancing to contention after a half, shifted nearer to the inside contesting second
into the lane but lacked the needed late kick. HONESTA, held up avoiding close quarters to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch, split foes
three wide racing into the lane to improve position. LEGAL IN CANADA, urged prompting a rival's pace racing three deep to the backstretch, steadily faded
nearing the lane. BY TH LIGHT OF DAY was settled along the inside and failed to menace. LOUIE'S BACKYARD tracked the leaders three deep between
foes as part of the second flight into the backstretch and faded nearing the far turn. MINEWELLRECEIVED came through close quarters while angling to the
inside to track off the first flight, was prompted to make brief progress through the backstretch, lost some momentum when caught behind a tiring foe along
the rail entering the far turn but quickly came up empty. BAIN TOWN WOMAN, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first turn, angled inside the
leaders racing into the backstretch and gave way early. LINCOLN CENTER dropped out early.

Footnotes
SHANGHAISWEETHEART broke readily, sped to the lead shifting a bit off the rail, widened the advantage under pressure racing into the stretch and
maintained a safe margin while racing a bit erratically in late stages. COMMANDER OF DEATH, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter, came under
pressure on the turn and weakened in the drive while proving best of the others. MEMORABLE ANGEL angled inwards tracking off the first flight unhurried
in the opening quarter, shifted off the inside entering the lane and continued evenly in late stages. ASHLIE NICOLE, off last, was settled three deep between
foes off the second flight early, shifted inwards entering the turn but passed only tiring rivals. CANDY FOR ALL tracked off the second flight racing to the
turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. ANIMAUXSELLE tracked off the second flight four wide early and soon retreated. FIDDLER proved no factor.
LEARN STORY (DOM), forwardly placed three deep between foes through the backstretch, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SNOW LION, caught four wide racing into the first turn while under rating, was prompted to advance with an early move in that path nearing the far turn to
gain terms with the first flight, struck the front disputing the issue outside rivals nearing upper stretch, then continued in a prolonged drive to narrowly prevail
in time under firm handling. INDIAN BUZZ angled to the inside racing to the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command inside foes
on the far turn into upper stretch and gamely resisted the winner to the end to just miss. YADI was rated off the second flight between rivals, split foes then
angled to the inside racing into the lane to close the gap while prevailing for a share. STREET LEGACY tracked off the second flight three wide to the
backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and made some belated progress. RIONERO, pinched back at the start, settled off the field to the
backstretch and improved position between foes late. THREENINETYTWO, in touch prompting a rival's pace in early stages, pressed the issue between
foes into the far turn and gave way into the stretch. SON OF SO tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way into
the stretch. MASPERO took up a position inside foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide in late stages but had no rally.
HUSBAND IN LAW tracked the leaders along the rail as part of the second flight and steadily faded racing into the far turn. SKY D, caught in tight quarters
at the start, was held up last and failed to menace.

FURY KAP, urged disputing the pace while angling to the inside racing to the turn, dueled inside a rival through the bend, then shook clear leaving
midstretch while being kept to firm encouragement. DR PARKER joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside the winner to
upper stretch and gave way. HALL RICH LEGACY tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted out entering the turn and continued evenly into the
stretch. LIL GREEN MACHINE, urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, gave way entering the turn. VET'S GIFT tracked the leaders
three deep between foes from out of striking distance and offered no rally. CAKE AND EAT IT TO proved no threat. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO was a brief
factor between foes racing just off the second flight but had no rally. OSMI SLEW angled to the inside early but showed little. FINANCIAL GAIN, restless in
the gate, reared at the start losing position to the field, raced wide to the turn while being urged to regain contention and dropped out early.

SUMMER ASSAULT went readily to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage under light rating to the backstretch, was roused
racing into the lane and held sway on a clear margin while shifting out under pressure. GRAVITAS angled inwards to gain a forwardly placing stalking just
off the pacesetter, moved to challenge that foe racing into the lane but proved no match. CADET CONNELLY, firmly rated off the second flight near the
inside racing to the backstretch, split foes just off the inside in late stages but was outkicked for second. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY tracked the leaders three
deep between foes in second flight, angled in nearing the lane to split foes, then shifted three wide entering the stretch and was outkicked for a share.
MECHA CORTA, caught four wide racing to the first turn tracking just off the second flight, was fanned five wide into the lane but made no impact. TAPAGE
tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid three wide on the far turn but soon gave way. MATTY'S EXPRESS
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. BUFFALO MAX proved no factor. DANZING DUNHILL tracked the leaders inside rivals
in second flight to the backstretch, was steadied out of tight quarters nearing the lane and soon gave way.

Footnotes
CLOUD CHARMER, bumped at the start, was righted to track the pacesetter three deep in second flight, made steady progress while shifting inwards a bit
nearing the lane to wrest command in late stages and go clear under firm encouragement. CAUGHT UP IN YOU, caught five wide early tracking off the
second flight, made a steady advance racing four wide into the lane and edged a rival for the place honors. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT rated between foes just
off the second flight, steadily gained position three deep between foes into the lane but was outkicked for second. PROPOSITION sped to the lead, dictated
the pace in hand racing a bit off the rail to upper stretch but faltered leaving midstretch. ALL GOOD TIMES tracked off the second flight outside foes, angled
six wide entering the lane and gained some position in an even effort. AGI'S CAIT, bumped at the start, switched outside foes, then pulled her way to a
forward placing racing to the turn but gave way into the lane. REDEEM MY HEART tracked the leaders between foes in second flight but gave way early.
MY GIRL ANNIE tracked the leaders along the rail and faded racing into the turn.

UNABRIDGED (IRE), reserved while caught four wide in the last flight racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance in that path racing into the far turn,
angled inside the leaders when presented an opening racing into upper stretch to bid for command along the rail and edged forward in time under firm
handling. STRONG GEM was settled along the rail in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the lane to split rivals just off the inside in
late stages and finished with interest to edge rivals for a share. NOBLE INTENTIONS was rated off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, swung
out five wide racing into the stretch and continued to close the gap while narrowly prevailing for a share. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY, urged to the lead outside
a rival, angled to the rail on the first turn setting the pace on a narrow margin, dueled into the far turn, drifted out carrying out GORGEOUS IN GREY
entering upper stretch and gave out late. SAMMY'S TOWN was prompted to a forward placing along the rail leaving the chute, conceded the lead to track
the leaders along the inside but faded into the stretch. CHA CHA HEELS settled between foes in the last flight and passed only tiring rivals. GORGEOUS IN
GREY, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn, was carried out entering upper stretch and
abruptly gave way. NO SNIVELING tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the backstretch and gave way into the far turn. BIG ANGEL, steadied in
close quarters racing to the first turn, shifted out five wide on the backstretch while making brief progress, came up empty entering the second bend and
was gathered up racing into the lane. SHENU SHENUME tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and steadily faded nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
IMA DAREDEVIL, urged from the break to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, forged clear into upper stretch while drifting well off the inside
but widened the advantage to the end under a hustling ride. DREAMS OF SHIRLEY tracked just off the first flight three deep racing into the turn, angled
inwards racing into the lane and edged forward to secure the place honors late. COUGAR VISION, came through close quarters at the start while being
settled between foes, was prompted to advance five wide racing into the turn and continued in that path to late stages to prevail for a share while no real
threat. MERENGUE, forwardly placed four wide tracking off the first flight outside a rival, continued in pursuit in that path to upper stretch and gave way. LA
WAPA broke outwards bumping DEESSE, angled inwards tracking just off the second flight racing into the turn and faded in late stages. BEACH LADY
tracked off the second flight four wide between foes, was fanned six wide into the lane but had no rally. KATIE'S LAST DANCE settled between foes in early
stages, angled to the rail racing into the lane but offered no rally. RUN SNIP RUN broke outwards bumping LA MAGNOLIA and never gained contention.
STRAND DE ORO, caught five, then six wide throughout, never seriously menaced. PLAY THE MAX, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace
just off the rail racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. DEESSE, bumped, then forced out at the start, never menaced thereafter. LA MAGNOLIA
was bumped at the start and trailed throughout.
