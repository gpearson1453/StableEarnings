Footnotes
INDIAN GULCH, in touch with the pacesetter attending that rival's tempo between foes racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the far turn to
gain the advantage nearing upper stretch, then kicked clear through the lane while being kept to firm encouragement. KARMA KING sped to the lead along
the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, couldn't contain the winner's bid but continued with interest to
prove best of the others. GRAN GREYFROST tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane
but lacked the needed late bid. THE KAHN tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight racing to the far turn and faded into the stretch. JIMMY D settled
well off the leaders along the inside early, shifted out racing into the stretch but never gained contention. MEILLEUR tracked just off the second flight racing
three deep to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn. BROWNS GAP, in touch with the first flight three wide racing to the backstretch,
gave way entering the far turn. SWEEPINGTHENATION settled outside a rival in the last flight and soon trailed.

Footnotes
HIGH FIVE COTTON, broke out making contact with POLLARD STAR, then was bumped lightly by MR. KISSES at the start, quickly recovered to contest
the lead between foes racing through the backstretch on a narrow advantage, continued to dispute the issue inside a rival racing off the rail through the turn,
shook clear under pressure racing into the stretch and was gathered up late once the issue was decided. PASSIONATE HACHI, shuffled a bit avoiding tight
quarters just after the start, was prompted to advance four wide nearing the turn, shifted inside the leaders approaching upper stretch, couldn't gain terms
with the winner but maintained a safe margin for the place honors. MR. KISSES broke outwards bumping the eventual winner at the start, was rated
between rivals dropping off the second flight, then split foes just off the inside in late stages to prevail for a share. FRAN'S SALSA tracked off the first flight
three wide between foes racing into the turn but offered no rally. ONE LUCKY STEP angled inwards to join the first flight three wide in early stages, pressed
the issue in that path racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. MR. OCTOBER, urged inside the leaders prompting the pace to the turn, gave
way after a half. POLLARD STAR, bumped then caught in close quarters at the start. tracked off the first flight between foes to the turn and steadily faded
nearing the lane. DREAMING OF FRANK dropped out early.

Footnotes
GIMMEABREAK, reserved last near the inside racing to the backstretch, split rivals after a half gathering momentum, advanced on the leaders shifting out
four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, was fanned five wide entering the lane but continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage
in time under firm encouragement. PROUD DEPLORABLE, caught four wide leaving the chute, was prompted to dispute the lead outside a rival racing into
the first turn, went clear racing into the backstretch while angling nearer to the inside, held sway on a safe margin to upper stretch, resisted several
challengers to late stages but couldn't contain the winner. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the
backstretch, was held up momentarily in close quarters midway through the far turn, then split rivals three wide leaving midstretch to challenge between the
top pair while just outkicked. HELLFIRE BOB, under firm reserve dropping off the second flight leaving the chute, switched outside foes racing four wide on
the first turn, tracked the leaders three deep through the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but
had no final kick. CASK broke outwards bumping at the start, angled immediately to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved
ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. HEX, urged to a forward placing while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside
the pacesetter entering the backstretch while being urged to prompt that foe racing into the far turn, gave way through upper stretch and was gathered up
late. REACHNFORASIXPACK, bumped at the start, tracked between foes, then just off the second flight racing to the backstretch but offered no rally.
FIFTH OF NOVEMBER settled along the inside early, switched outside foes nearing the backstretch but dropped out early.

Footnotes
SENSE A MILLION came through close quarters at the break to gain terms with the leaders three deep, dictated the pace on a narrow margin in that path
racing into the turn, continued to dispute issue in the two path while losing the advantage midway through the turn, but continued resolutely to regain the
advantage nearing midstretch and edged forward under firm left handed pressure to prevail. PALACES DIAMOND tracked just off the first flight three deep
between foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner while narrrowly prevailing for the
place honors. GLITTER GIRL shifted inwards tracking just off the leaders four wide in the opening stages, advanced readily to challenge for command three
deep racing into the turn, gained a clear advantage between calls nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum weakening past midstretch.
CHICA DIFISEL, reserved well off the leaders in early stages, angled inside entering the turn, shifted out six wide in upper stretch and produced a belated
response to gain position to the end. LA WAPA, urged between foes prompting the pace just inside the eventual winner into the turn, faded in late stages.
SASSY MELLY broke inwards bumping PATHALASSA, was righted to track outside foes in second flight, was fanned five wide in the stretch and finished
evenly late. SILVER NINA, urged to a forward placing along the inside, tracked the leaders along the rail to upper stretch and gave way late.
PANTHALASSA broke slowly while being bumped, angled to the inside dropping well off the leaders and never gained contention. SHE'S SO INDY, held up
avoiding close quarters in early stages, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
YEI YEI went readily to the lead, dictated the pace on a narrow margin on his own courage racing in the two path into the turn, was roused clear in upper
stretch and was taken in hand through the final sixteenth while proving clearly best. SACCO AND VANZETTI, forwardly placed five wide in the opening
stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn prompting the winner's pace, proved no match for that foe racing into the stretch but was best of the others.
GRAMMI DANCE, bumped at the start, quickly recovered, angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter between foes just off the inside racing into the turn,
couldn't match the leaders entering the bend but continued with a grudging effort to prevail for a share. RELISHMENT settled in the last flight while shifting
off the inside, angled to the rail nearing the half mile marker, saved ground on the turn, then shifted out in the closing stages to gain some position. K C
TWOSTEP tracked the leaders between foes dropping off the second flight, angled inside entering the lane and passed tiring rivals late. ROW THE BOAT,
urged along the inside pursuing the leaders into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. MOLOKAI NIGHT angled inwards to track the leaders three deep in
second flight and steadily faded into the stretch. AWESOME ROMEO, shuffled a bit avoiding close quarters at the start, raced three deep between foes
dropping off the second flight and lacked a rally. TRAVEL AGENT tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn and proved no threat. WICKED
COURAGE broke inwards bumping GRAMMI DANCE, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders three deep between foes but soon retreated. MR.
MORNINGSTAR settled last, raced wide through the backstretch and trailed the field to the lane.

Footnotes
D'CRAZINESS, off a step behind the leaders, was rated off the second flight just off the inside racing to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes
entering the far turn, angled out four wide nearing upper stretch, moved to challenge for command in that path, took over late while shifting inwards but
maintained a clear margin under firm handling. RUDIGER was settled last along the inside, swung out five wide racing into the stretch gathering late
momentum and prevailed for the place honors. BLUE PIGEON tracked the pace outside foes in second flight, angled in racing into the stretch to split foes
just off the inside midstretch challenging for command but was, outkicked by the top pair. NEW JERSEY JOHN, forwardly placed along the rail, conceded
the lead on the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch to press the issue between foes racing into the far turn, dueled into upper stretch and yielded
late. BIG MONEY MACHINE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the first turn, made a move to gain terms with the first flight three deep
nearing the far turn, pressed the issue between foes in that path to upper stretch and gave way late. NO CENTS LEFT tracked the leaders between foes off
the second flight but had no closing bid. MY COWBOY was urged to force the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, went clear into the backstretch,
dueled for command along the rail through the far turn to upper stretch, lost some ground to the leaders, then was steadied out of tight quarters leaving
midstretch. LAST PROMISE angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch and gave way after a half. WICKED BOY proved no
factor. PERP tracked the leaders between foes just off the second flight to the far turn and faded into the stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF
MY COWBOY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BLUE PIGEON ALLEGING INTERFERENCE WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
UPPER CHARLIZE DS angled inwards gaining terms with the first flight to dispute the lead between foes in the three path racing to the turn, shifted inwards
nearing the stretch while contesting the issue in a prolonged drive but edged forward late under firm right handed pressure to prevail. FOOT RUB LOVE
urged three deep between foes prompting the pace racing to the turn, shifted inwards disputing the issue between foes in an extended skirmish while
striking the front but couldn't match the winner late while prevailing for the place honors. GRANDMARY was rated just outside the first flight racing to the
turn, was prompted to bid four wide through the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch and weakened late. LET'S GO LUNA tracked off the first flight inside
rivals under light rating, shifted out nearing upper stretch, then angled back to the inside awaiting an opening, was prompted to split foes just off the inside in
late stages but steadied out of tight quarters approaching the wire late. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS switched outside foes early tracking just off the second
flight, made progress to advance on the leaders five wide racing through the turn but finished evenly late. MI TIA REGIS was settled outside foes dropping
off the second flight, was fanned six wide into the lane and gained some position but made no impact. FLATOUT SCREAMING was prompted between foes
to gain a contending position, then was held up to track just off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was floated out nearing upper stretch, shifted
about under pressure racing into the stretch and quickly came up empty. ICY SWEET tracked the leaders three deep just off the second flight, angled to the
inside nearing the lane but had no rally. MYSTIC MOON broke slowly, settled between foes and proved no factor. MAIDU tracked off the second flight along
the inside, was held up avoiding traffic nearing upper stretch and never threatened while being gathered up racing into the lane. CRACK OF DAWN, urged
to dispute the pace in the opening stages racing well off the rail, gave way after a half. LADY DENISSE proved no factor.

Footnotes
SILVERLY ENOUGH was settled inside rivals in the last flight, gathered momentum racing through the turn, steadied slightly while altering course racing
into upper stretch, split foes three wide, then angled in to bid inside the pacesetter in late stages but continued with a stout rally to wrest the advantage and
go clear in time under firm handling. ZAINO BOYZ sprinted to the lead racing through the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable margin remaining well off
the rail past midstretch but was collared late. BABY BOOMER broke inwards bumping DISCO DEANO, continued to exchange light contact while racing in
close quarters in the opening stages, swerved out sharply, then angled to the inside near the half mile marker, saved ground through the turn to upper
stretch and continued willingly inside rivals to close the gap while prevailing for a share. SKY MISCHIEF tracked the pacesetter unhurried four wide between
foes racing into the turn and made some mild progress in the closing stages. JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT, shuffled back avoiding tight quarters at the start,
settled last along the inside in the opening quarter, saved ground on the bend, shifted out entering the lane and passed some tiring rivals in late stages.
TOMATO BILL, urged pursuing the leader inside foes while shifting off the rail racing into the turn, gave way nearing midstretch. INDY RIDE was settled
outside foes in the last flight and failed to menace. DISCO DEANO, bumped at the start, was urged through tight quarters tracking the pacesetter between
foes in second flight racing into the turn and gave way into the stretch. BABY BROTHER made brief pursuit of the pacesetter racing five deep to the turn,
shifted out to the six path on the turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
JANGADA ducked out at the start, was quickly righted, angled to the inside being rated just off the first flight, shifted out on the backstretch to race between
foes just off the leaders, was prompted through close quarters entering the far turn to advance on the leaders, bid three deep racing into upper stretch, then
drifted out despite right handed pressure but went clear. PUERTO VARAS broke readily, took up a forward placing along the rail attending the pace,
conceded some position after a half to track the leaders along the inside, swung out four wide racing into the stretch and proved best of the others. DRAMA
AN VICTORY settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide entering the lane and made an effort to improve position.
HANDSOME COYOTE, forwardly placed three deep racing to the backstretch, pressed the pace between foes just off the inside racing into the far turn and
gave way in the drive. MORO DRAMA was rated off the first flight near the inside racing to the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch advancing on
the leaders four wide with an early move midway through the backstretch, bid for command in that path entering the far turn, shifted inwards pressing the
issue outside a rival to upper stretch but came up empty late. SAM'S SPIRIT, bumped at the start, recovered to gain a position just off the first flight,
commenced an early move three deep between foes foes after a half, steadied in close quarters entering the far turn and quickly came up empty. FULL
MOON RISING was settled between foes in the last flight early and failed to menace. DRILL BIT settled in the last flight along the inside, shifted out on the
far turn, angled six wide entering the lane but had no rally. MR. HAND FULL shied, bumping SAM'S SPIRIT at the start, was urged between foes disputing
the lead racing into the first turn to the backstretch but was through after a half. GLACIER PARK, FRACTIOUS AT THE GATE, DISLODGED HIS RIDER
AND WAS ORDERED TO BE SCRATCHED.
