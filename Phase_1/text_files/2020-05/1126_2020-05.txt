Footnotes
BAHAMIAN GIRL took over outside I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT leaving the backstretch, went clear around the turn in the two-path, got set down approaching
mid stretch and drew away decisively. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT broke out bumping ONEZY'S DREAM at the start, crossed over to the inside with the early
lead, deferred to BAHAMIAN GIRL into the turn, rebid along the rail in upper stretch, was no match but had enough to hold second. HOLLY HILL raced
three to four wide around the turn, and was slowly getting to the runner-up on the far outside late. ONEZY'S DREAM received a bump from I'M
PRAYINGFORTHAT at the start, chased two to three wide early, and faded after three-eighths of a mile. GOLDEN TAP was outrun in the two-path.
FOLLOW ME MOM broke outward spotting the field a couple lengths, moved inside early on the turn, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
WE CONNECTED stayed close early, came under a ride three wide midway on the turn, rallied determinedly through the lane and caught O DRISCOLL
from outside to win going away. O DRISCOLL stalked the early pace, ranged up to challenge outside BULKCARRIER midway on the turn, took over in
upper stretch, could not contain the winner but held well to best the remainder. BULKCARRIER came away alertly and took the lead inside, battled with O
DRISCOLL from the three-eighths to upper stretch, and weakened on the rail while able to salvage the show. TEMPUS stayed in range three then four wide
to the stretch, and finished one-paced outside. BAMBINO was outrun early, angled six or seven wide off the turn, and drifted out through the stretch unable
to gain late. TRINNI DANCER raced four wide, and faded through the lane. EL DUQUE raced three wide on the turn, and was no factor passing tired
horses. PRIVILEGIO was always outrun. NIT PICK was finished early inside. KING WADE bore out badly around the turn, and dropped back in the stretch.

Footnotes
R U LUCKY bumped with GRAN CASIQUE at the start, advanced two wide around the turn, loomed outside GRAN CASIQUE entering the stretch, drifted
out while forging past near the sixteenth-pole, and had enough to hold on. LIKE YOU broke out bumping PLATO at the start, attended the early pace inside
under a firm hold, was pocketed through the turn along the rail, moved out past the furlong marker and gained too late outside the winner. GRAN CASIQUE
bumped with R U LUCKY at the start, showed the way early off the rail, moved inside around the turn, yielded to the winner late, and was outfinished for
second as well. WICKED TEMPTATIONS swung four wide leaving the turn, and lacked a rally. PRINCE KHOZAN stayed in range three wide early, and
weakened after a half-mile. PLATO got bumped by LIKE YOU at the start, saved ground and faded after a half.

UNRIGHTEOUS was strung out four wide on the first turn, moved up to join the leaders from outside midway up the backstretch, outdueled PALACE
KITTEN around the far turn, and drew away under a mild drive. PALACE KITTEN pressed the early pace between horses, battled inside UNRIGHTEOUS
through the far turn, could not match strides in upper stretch, but ran on much best of the others. SCANNO was outrun early, advanced three wide after six
furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. THIS ILL DEFEND raced forwardly three wide early, and tired after six furlongs. ROCKET BLAST set a pressured
early pace inside, could not keep pace with the top two finishers past the half-mile pole, and faded steadily. BORGOBYTHESEA dropped far back around
the far turn, and was eased up through the stretch.

GEONOSIS contested the early pace innermost of several rivals, moved away from THATS ALL HE WROTE going comfortably past the three-eighths, and
coasted home a handy winner. DARDANELLOS was caught five wide improving position around the far turn, ran on willingly to go clear of the others, and
was wrapped up late with no further gains to be had. DAZZLING PROSE bumped with EXATLON at the start, improved under a drive three wide between
horses around the turn, but flattened out. RED FOG bumped lightly with THATS ALL HE WROTE a couple times after the start, stayed close four wide to the
turn, and faded approaching the stretch. EXATLON bumped with DAZZLING PROSE at the start, and dropped well back before reaching the stretch. LIL
BULL was finished early inside. THATS ALL HE WROTE bumped lightly with RED FOG twice after the start, vied outside rivals up the backstretch, could not
keep pace with GEONOSIS after five furlongs, and faltered. SILENT MISCHIEF vied for the early lead between foes, retreated after a half-mile, and was
eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
NIKO'S DREAM tugged up behind rivals midway up the backstretch, remained in striking range two then three wide as the field bunched up on the far turn,
eased out widest kicking in past the furlong marker and was up nearing the wire. HOTSY TOTSY (IRE) moved out four wide leaving the first turn, remained
out in the course taking closer order after six furlongs, loomed outside ISLA ROAD in deep stretch, and just missed between that one and the winner.
MUSIC OF LIFE was three wide in range up the backstretch, stayed in the three-path lodging a bid at the top of the stretch, edged away briefly past the
eighth-pole, moved inside and was overhauled, and saved a share of the show. ISLA ROAD waited behind the leaders late on the far turn, remained bottled
up in traffic through upper stretch, found a seam between HOTSY TOTSY and MUSIC OF LIFE in deep stretch and finished gamely. CODRINGTON lacked
room between NIKO'S DREAM and HOTSY TOTSY and steadied after the start, saved ground at the back for six furlongs, moved out late and gained
mildly. SCATNAP prompted the early pace outside KATIELEIGH, poked a head in front after six furlongs, but gave way through the final furlong.
KATIELEIGH sprinted clear early, got collared after six furlongs, and gave way through upper stretch. SWEET HITCH HIKER went along in the second flight
while reasonably close to the far turn, but tired four wide into the lane.

SNIPER SHOT stalked outside MAX K. O. up the backstretch, took over coming to the five-sixteenths pole, drew away under pressure through upper
stretch, and was hand urged the last sixteenth of a mile. LEGIT was outrun early, advanced to contention in the two-path between horses late on the turn,
moved to the rail in the stretch and prevailed in the battle for second. SQUEEZADIOS raced four wide taking closer order after six furlongs, rallied mildly into
the stretch and was nipped for the place outside. GREEN MANSIONS raced in range three wide for six furlongs, and weakened at the top of the lane.
QUENANE raced far back throughout. MAX K. O. sprinted clear early inside, could not fend off SNIPER SHOT by midway on the turn, retreated into the
stretch and was eased up.

MUSICAL HEART took command soon after the start, rated along well off the inside, built a commanding lead roused mildly turning for home, and was
being gathered up 70 yards out. NOBLE THOUGHT was urged along three wide going clear of the others after a mile, could not get near the winner and ran
on second best. PRINCE OF ARABIA saved ground on the turns, and was no menace. SHENDAM (FR) raced in closest attendance to MUSICAL HEART
for six furlongs, retreated early on the far turn, and was eased up through the lane.

JUST WHISTLE advanced four wide after six furlongs, moved out past the middle of the track turning for home, dueled outside SPINOFF through the final
furlong and took a hard-fought decision. SPINOFF bobbled at the start, prompted the pace three wide for six furlongs, drifted a couple paths further out
overtaking WIND OF CHANGE at the top of the stretch, battled inside JUST WHISTLE through a long drive and stayed on stubbornly. EYE OF A JEDI dwelt
at the start spotting the field several lengths, gradually crept closer inside after six furlongs, loomed along the rail through upper stretch, and drifted out while
weakening under heavy pressure. YOU'RE TO BLAME lagged well back for six furlongs, and passed only tired horses. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) set a
sharp pace in the two-path, got collared from both flanks past the three-sixteenths, and drifted out weakening through upper stretch. BIG DOLLAR BILL hit
the left side of the gate at the start, stayed close four wide to the far turn, and had nothing left after six furlongs.

Footnotes
HELPING LISA D saved ground tracking the early leaders, shot through on the rail to seize command inside EBULLIENT and GUACAMOLE midway on the
far turn, and skipped further away with every stride through shaken reins and hand urging. GUACAMOLE took the lead after an alert start, yielded to
EBULLIENT early up the backstretch, rebid three wide near the three-eighths, was left reeling in the wake of the top one's move under a full drive outside
the quarter-pole, and ran on best of the others. MAKEALITLEMISCHIEF was reserved early toward the inside, was roused three wide on the far turn, and
was along to wind up a distant third. EBULLIENT took over outside GUACAMOLE before going a half-mile, got overhauled from both sides midway on the
far turn, and faded steadily. ZARINA broke out at the start, and passed tired horses while never in contention. BIENVILLE STREET saved ground early in
range, moved out four wide on the far turn, and faltered after six furlongs. LA AUSTRALIANA lost her footing at the start, and dropped far back four wide
around the far turn. BRAMBLE QUEEN was finished after six furlongs, and eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
THE GREAT KATH hustled to the early lead inside STORMY NELLY and CATHARSIS, lost the advantage to the latter around the turn, battled back gamely
on the rail through the stretch and prevailed in the final strides. CATHARSIS contested the pace three wide, took over outside THE GREAT KATH going the
better of the two on the turn, could not put that one away through the lane, and was edged nearing the wire. MISS MIAMI was outpaced by the leaders
around the turn, had the two-path through the stretch and finished willingly to get the show. FREE THE BEAST was outrun early, came widest for the drive
and improved enough to land the last major share. STORMY NELLY bumped with FREE THE BEAST at the start, argued the early pace between THE
GREAT KATH and CATHARSIS, and faded near the stretch. DISTINCTLY BLUE stumbled at the start to get away slowly, and never reached contention.
TOWA faded steadily inside after a quarter-mile.
