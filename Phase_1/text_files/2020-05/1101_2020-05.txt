Footnotes
GOLD NOTE stalked the pace, gained command through the far turn, raced three wide in the stretch and was well clear late under a steady hand ride.
CROWNED LEADER stalked the pace, moved up four wide through the far turn into the lane and was no match for the winner. JOHNNY LONGBOAT was
forced six wide around the first turn, dropped near the back of the pack early, moved up three wide in the stretch and had no final response. DANZING
RIVER was slow early, raced seven wide around the first turn, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and had not enough late after experiencing a wide trip.
I'M A STAR settled off the early pace, came in just past the quarter pole and bumped hard with rival, raced three deep through the stretch and never
threatened. BLAMEITONBECKETT tracked the leader while racing two wide and gave way. CIAK settled off the early pace, raced four deep in the lane and
had no response. AUTHORATIF showed good early speed to set all the pace, begin to fade around the far turn, was bumped hard by rival just past the the
quarter pole, was taken up and weakened thereafter. HEZA SILVER HAZE was off slowly and never was a factor. NADO WILDER failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
LIL' SHOPPER stalked the early pace, raced four deep through the stretch and got up late under strong encouragement. PLENTY OF MUNNY showed
good early speed along the inside down the backstretch, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole while racing just off the inside but couldn't hold off the winner late
to finish second best. MIA PANDOWDY was slow to begin, moved up along the inside through the stretch and improved his position. LATEJANA settled off
the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no final winning bid. DARK SARCASM stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. LYNNE T raced five wide around the first turn, moved up six wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT failed to
sustain a bid. RED LINGERIE raced six wide around the first turn and never threatened. LUCK'S GOOD GIRL raced seven wide around the first turn, raced
five deep through the lane and never menaced.

turn, stalked the leader while racing three wide down the backstretch, moved up four wide through the lane and just missed in a game effort. TREBULSKI
was forced out at the break, raced four wide early, angled to the inside through the far turn into the lane and had not enough late. IKON WHO was off a step
slow, raced seven wide in the lane and never was a factor. WHISKEY FACTOR stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no rally.
DARING EGO stalked the pace from the inside and tired. SWASHBUCKLER was off slowly, raced five wide at the eighth pole and never threatened.
ASSAY dropped back early and failed to respond. ARTIES EMBLEM broke to the outside, raced six deep around the first turn, tired readily and was eased.
