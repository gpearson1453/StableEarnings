Footnotes
ENDURING HONOR, held up avoiding close quarters racing to the first turn, was reserved off the second flight while switching out entering the backstretch,
advanced on the leaders four wide racing through the far turn to challenge for command in upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm encouragement.
HIGH ROLLING DUDE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then shifted out to
split foes three deep in the lane challenging inside the winner but proved only second best. MALIO'S, in touch attending a rival's pace under light rating in
the opening half, was urged to challenge the leader racing through the far turn, continued to dispute the issue between foes into the stretch but was
outkicked by the top pair. GUERRERON tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, came through to bid for command along the rail
in upper stretch but had no final kick. WILSHIRE STAR, caught wide racing into the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch to make brief progress
four wide, then three deep between racing into the far turn but proved empty in the drive. BRANDT, reserved while angling to the inside early, never gained
contention. DAS DA ONE was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the far turn, then gave way between foes into
the lane . MULLED WINE, caught widest racing into the first turn racing five deep, tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight for a half and faded early.

MZ. FOO DO broke readily to gain a narrow advantage between foes, dictated the pace shifting off the rail racing through the backstretch, held sway on a
clear margin to upper stretch and was kept to brisk encouragement to prove best. FIRST HOOSIER was settled outside foes racing through the backstretch,
swung out five wide racing into the stretch and found her best stride late to close the gap. BURKEY'S BABE, urged three deep between rivals pursuing the
pacesetter from the outset into the turn, weakened racing into the stretch. MAMBO DANCER vied four wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the
turn and gave way. MAST COVE switched off the inside while being urged between rivals prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn,
lost ground to the leader entering the bend, angled to the inside nearing the lane and steadily faded. ADONAI LOVE settled between foes dropping well off
the leaders and failed to menace thereafter. FIDDLER broke slowly losing position at the start and failed to menace. JIMA'S GOLD angled to the inside
racing through the backstretch but retreated early. ITSAGIMME'S GIRL, urged five wide pursuing the pacesetter racing to the turn, gave way nearing upper

MILEY, forwardly placed outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter under light reserve, moved to prompt the leader after a half, was urged to press the
issue between foes racing into upper stretch and edged forward to narrowly prevail in time under firm encouragement. SMARTY CAT, urged to the lead
while angling to the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, came under pressure to maintain the advantage to upper
stretch, resisted grudgingly to late stages but proved only second best. MELISSANI rated just off the second flight along the inside racing to the first turn,
shifted a bit off the inside while pulling between foes in close quarters racing into the backstretch, was urged to split foes three deep on the far turn to gain
terms with the leaders in that path racing into upper stretch, skirmished with the top pair to late stages but was outkicked. TWEETY KITTEN tracked just off
the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned out four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn and had no late bid.
SWEEPENO, a bit rank against restraint between foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, split foes three deep racing into the lane to gain
some position late. ROSALDA was guided to the inside early dropping well off the leaders, saved ground to the lane and gained some position in an even
effort. INCA PRINCESS settled outside foes off the second flight racing three deep to the backstretch and never gained contention. PREMIUM MOTION
proved no factor. MULTITUDE was steadied avoiding tight quarters along the rail leaving the chute and never menaced thereafter. LASTING JOY, urged to
a forward placing along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter for a half, steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
TIZ APPROVED, bumped at the start, recovered quickly to gain terms with the first flight, dictated terms under light rating between foes racing into the bend,
went clear on her own courage after a half, then came under a few right handed taps and went well clear while her rider flashed his whip. ROSAS WAY,
urged to forward placing four wide, shifted in to prompt the pacesetter three wide after the opening quarter, couldn't match that foe after a half but continued
with interest to prevail for the place honors. WILL RUNAWAY tracked off the second fight inside foes in the opening half, swung out four wide racing into the
lane and continued well enough to prevail for a share. GILDED DRAMA broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was urged to prompt the pace inside
rivals through the backstretch into the turn and gave way racing into the lane. ANDREW THE BULL tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the
turn, angled out nearing upper stretch but had no rally. SHAKEM N BREAKEM, reserved in hand dropping off the second flight early, angled inwards
nearing the turn, switched out nearing upper stretch, altered course avoiding some traffic racing into the lane but had no late bid. SOUTHERN CAL settled
between foes out of striking distance early and never gained contention. GLOBAL DINNER proved no factor. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS, urged three wide
between foes, then four wide into the turn making brief pursuit of the leaders, was through after a half. FOUNTAINSTREETKID trailed.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE RYDER, off a bit slowly while exchanging some light contact at the start, was reserved off the second flight racing to the backstretch, split foes
nearing upper stretch to bid three deep entering the lane, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. BE NIMBLE tracked the
pacesetter from out of striking distance while angling to the inside racing as part of the second flight into the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leader in
tandem with a rival to bid for command between foes nearing upper stretch, gained a brief advantage but couldn't fend off the winner while just holding a
rival for the place honors. STORMY D broke a bit awkwardly, was settled off the second flight along the inside, came through close quarters nearing upper
stretch, shifted off the inside to split foes challenging inside the leaders late but just missed for second. ALYDARIUS was settled last racing to the
backstretch, shifted out entering the lane and improved position three deep between foes in the closing stages. MARNIE GIRL, forwardly placed racing to
the first turn, conceded position to the pacesetter tracking that rival out of striking distance into the backstretch under light rating, was prompted to advance
on the leader in tandem with a rival shifting three deep nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but emptied out entering the lane. FOGGY FLIGHT sprinted
clear of the field along the inside, held sway on a commanding margin racing into the far turn but gave out abruptly racing into upper stretch. PIONEEROF
NEW YORK tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BUMPA was urged to the lead shifting off the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing in the two path into the bend and
held sway to the end under brisk handling. NOT TELLING, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter in the three path racing into the turn, continued with
a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors late. ERIN GO BRAUGH tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch to lodge
a brief bid inside the winner but had no final kick. HAPPY GUY broke readily, raced off the first flight through the backstretch, shifted out five wide entering
the turn while being prompted to advance and continued with an effort to improve position. MISTER MISTER vied four wide between foes into the turn, then
faded late. IMPERIAL IVOR, restless in the gate, was off awkwardly while exchanging bumps at the start, angled to the inside racing into the turn and
continued with an effort to improve position. POZNAN tracked the leaders between foes from out of striking distance and continued evenly.
TINGSLIKEABEE raced three deep between foes dropping off the second flight and offered no rally. ARES WARRIOR proved no threat. BELUSHI
SAMURAI, bumped at the start, dropped out early. SAND BAY BREEZE made brief pursuit of the leader five wide through the backstretch and gave way
early.

TAOS, caught four wide racing into the first turn while gaining a position just off the leaders, tracked pacesetter outside foes through the backstretch, was
prompted to advance on that foe three deep on the far turn, shifted in gaining terms entering the lane, contested the issue in a prolonged drive but narrowly
prevailed in time under right handed pressure. GENTLEMAN JOE vied for the lead between foes leaving the chute, angled to the rail once gaining the
advantage entering the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled for command into the stretch, grudgingly resisted the winner's
bid and just missed. CHANNEL STUFFER angled to the inside racing to the first turn stalking just off the pacesetter, shifted out three wide in upper stretch
while being roused to challenge but had no kick. MIGHTY GHOST tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the
lane, was fanned four wide in the closing stages but made a mild gain. ROCK THE CAUSEWAY, reserved along the inside to the second bend, switched
out nearing the lane, was fanned five wide late and made no impression. BLACK PRONG, in touch with the pacesetter between rivals prompting that foe
into the backstretch, gave way nearing the lane. HEY BIG GUY settled into stride off the inside and offered no rally. MILBURN tracked outside rivals in
second flight and faded after a half.

ADONAI BLESS shifted a bit off the inside while being rated just off the second flight, shifted out on the turn to split foes three wide nearing upper stretch,
moved to wrest command under right handed pressure and was taken in hand late once the issue was decided. MONJA urged to the lead racing off the rail
through the backstretch, widened her advantage on the turn but proved no match when confronted by the winner. HER NAME IS STAR tracked off the
second flight racing five wide through the turn and continued with an effort to improve position. LONG STORY SHORT, caught in tight quarters at the start,
raced four wide off the second flight to the turn, angled nearing the lane and gained some position between foes just off the inside. ELUSIVE AURA,
forwardly placed between foes tracking just inside the pacesetter to the turn, faded in late stages. RACHIELY'S DREAM tracked off the second flight
between foes, angled inwards entering the turn but had no closing bid. BOURBON TRACE settled outside foes and never gained contention.
PROSPECTIVE MOMENT tracked the leaders three deep between foes racing into the turn and gave way late. GIFTED PATH, bumped at the start, was
urged to terms prompting the pacesetter to the turn and gave way after a half. RED KITTEN settled along the inside early and failed to menace. THEY CALL
ME LUCKY broke outwards bumping GIFTED PATH and dropped out early.

Footnotes
HIGH HEATER was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half, was prompted to advance four
wide racing into the far turn, bid for command in that path racing into upper stretch, drifted out while continuing in a protracted skirmish to late stages but
narrowly prevailed under right handed pressure. PRETENDANT tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted out racing into the far turn to bid
three deep between foes, contested the issue in a grudging effort to late stages and just missed. KID DRAMA switched outside foes racing to the first turn
tracking off the second flight, advanced to contention four wide racing into the far turn to gain a position just off the first flight nearing the lane, split rivals in
that path midstretch to challenge for command but was outkicked. CHANNELEDSLONGSHOT settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, angled
out six wide entering the lane and made some mild progress. VIOLATOR tracked off the second flight between foes, shifted out avoiding traffic racing into
upper stretch to race three deep between foes but finished evenly late. IRISH EXPECTATIONS tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, was held up
awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, came through tight quarters entering the lane but had no rally. GATOR POSSE, reserved off the second flight
along the inside, gathered momentum saving ground on the far turn, was held up, then steadied avoiding traffic racing into the stretch and had no late
response. DON H, urged to the dispute pace along the rail from the outset, dueled into the far turn and gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch. RIVER
HAWK angled inwards to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival, pressed the issue outside that foe into the far turn and gave way racing into the
lane. HIGH THRESHOLD trailed throughout.
