Footnotes
SHELL BEACH PARTY was covered up between foes behind the leaders for three furlongs, took over while easing out to the three-path turning for home,
and drove clear. NO NO NINA bumped with BLAME THE STORM at the start, moved off the rail approaching the stretch, could not menace the winner but
was up inside rivals for the place. MYFIRSTEXWIFE bumped lightly with BUSINESSINDUBAI at the start, advanced four wide on the turn, had a clear shot
outside the winner in upper stretch, but flattened out and was edged between horses for the place. BUSINESSINDUBAI bumped lightly with
MYFIRSTEXWIFE at the start, was outrun early, angled to the far outside in upper stretch and rallied mildly. EMILIA STRONG got bumped solidly by
WONDER CHARM at the start and was off slowly, trailed inside for three furlongs, and improved on the rail. ABOVE PAR stayed in range three then four
wide to the top of the lane, and faded. PARTY DRESS broke out at the start, pressed the pace outside BLAME THE STORM, reached a brief lead near the
quarter-pole, then faded steadily after straightening away for the drive. JIMMYS LASS was no factor inside. WONDER CHARM broke out bumping EMILIA
STRONG solidly, then checked behind PARTY DRESS and raced far back throughout. SILVER NINA was outrun four wide. BLAME THE STORM bumped
with NO NO NINA at the start, sprinted to the front inside, and gave way once displaced for command. TRINNI FLOWER was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
PRINCESS SECRET dashed clear inside after the start, repelled a challenge from BRIELLA around the turn and into upper stretch, and drew off under
pressure. BRIELLA brushed the left side of the gate coming out, then bumped lightly with AWESOME VIEW, rushed up outside to go after PRINCESS
SECRET into the turn, could not match strides through the lane while late changing leads, but was clearly second best. RACE DAY SPEED briefly became
edgy after being loaded, hit the left side of the gate coming out and was outrun early, saved ground into the turn, and improved position through the stretch
in the two-path. GEM THIEF raced two to three wide on the turn chasing after the leaders, and faded. LYRICAL was outsprinted in the two-path to the
stretch, moved to the rail and lacked a response. AWESOME VIEW bumped lightly with BRIELLA after the start, raced four wide around the turn, and tired.
YAFA was slow to begin, and showed little four wide. SISTER AURORA dropped back early three wide.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE AGAIN advanced while being guided out three wide after a half-mile, met no resistance running by outside MISS MAC to take over in upper
stretch, drove clear and kept STORMY BOSS at bay late. STORMY BOSS settled in the second flight early, rallied three wide off the turn, and rallied to be
clearly best of the others. MIA'S BOBTAIL saved ground outrun early, moved out for the drive and was along for the show. VARSOVIA chased outside the
winner on the turn, and gave way at the top of the stretch. MISS MAC rushed through between horses to get clear before going a quarter-mile, showed the
way slightly off the rail to the stretch, yielded readily to the winner and continued to drop back. CHIC AND SEXY showed brief speed in the two-path, and
tired. CHERORAMA chased outside MISS MAC into the turn, and was finished soon after that.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN KITTEN was allowed to settle early three wide, stayed in that path advancing after six furlongs, dueled shoulder to shoulder inside GARNER
STATE PARK through the lane and prevailed while brushing with that foe repeatedly. GARNER STATE PARK bumped lightly with FORMULA at the start,
went along in the second flight early, followed behind CARIBBEAN KITTEN and shifted outside that one turning for home, dueled and brushed with her rival
while on her left lead to the final strides, and just missed. MISSANDEI saved ground on the turns, hesitated briefly in upper stretch before squeezing through
on the fence inside a tiring SEQUAYA, and rallied mildly. SEQUAYA vied inside GOODBITOFBIZNESS to the far turn, got the best of that dispute but was
hooked from outside by VEER midway on that bend, held on to the furlong grounds and gave way. VEER ranged up three wide challenging for command
midway on the far turn, but could not sustain the bid by upper stretch. COUPLE OF NIKKIS was forwardly placed early three wide, and faded after six
furlongs. FORMULA bumped lightly with GARNER STATE PARK at the start, was at the back on the inside when she clipped heels behind
GOODBITOFBIZNESS and stumbled sharply approaching the quarter-pole, and could not recover. MUCHA SUERTE was slow into stride, and never
reached contention. GOODBITOFBIZNESS vied outside SEQUAYA early, plummeted back through the field stopping midway on the far turn, got from
clipped behind by FORMULA, and continued to drop far back.

Footnotes
BAD BEAT BRIAN took command soon after the start, loped along on an easy lead to the top of the stretch, and responded well to stay clear under clever
rating. BOURBON CURRENCY took a slight hop at the start, became rank being held up outside the pacesetter through the early going, continued outside
and could not reach the top one when roused. LUCKY MIKE was on hold while boxed in for the opening six furlongs, steadied slightly midway on the far turn
still lacking a way out, stayed on the rail and could not gain when clear.

Footnotes
GRAINGER COUNTY was sent up for the lead after the start, got hooked from outside by VICTORY TOWN after a half-mile, fought back through the stretch
while racing a bit greenly, and was edging away at the finish. VICTORY TOWN broke out solidly bumping CHAMBERLAIN at the start, pressed GRAINGER
COUNTY from outside into the turn, reached the front near the quarter-pole, could not put his rival away through upper stretch, weakened through the final
stages and drifted out sharply past the wire. HALO'S DANCE hit the left side of the gate at the start, raced well back in the two-path to the stretch, and
rallied mildly to get up for the show between horses. CARSON AND I came under a ride by midway on the turn inside, and was outfinished for third.
CHAMBERLAIN bobbled at the break and absorbed a hard bump from VICTORY TOWN, chased three wide and faded after a half-mile. OMINOUS dropped
well back four wide on the turn.

Footnotes
TRUE HEIRESS bumped and brushed with ROYALLY COOL repeatedly while outside that rival through the early going, secured ideal position off the
dueling leaders around the turn, ranged up to bid three wide at the top of the stretch, and drove clear through the last eighth of a mile. HEIR BALL dueled for
the lead inside TRIXIE'S TIME most of the way, and gamely held for the place. TRIXIE'S TIME dueled for command outside HEIR BALL, weakened
between horses in mid stretch, and just saved the show. MAJESTIC MAIARA broke alertly, chased in the two-path coming off the turn, and lacked a solid
bid. SOME SAY SO settled in the middle of the pack three wide to the top of the lane, and could not gain appreciably. FAITH N HOPE got bumped,
squeezed and checked back between horses up the backstretch, and improved mildly moving out after three furlongs. ANSWER MY CALL broke
awkwardly, and was never a factor. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE moved off the inside avoiding the early mayhem transpiring in front of her, and had nothing. DIXIE
PRINCESS bumped repeatedly with FAITH N HOPE and was taken up early on the rail to lose all chance. ROYALLY COOL hustled up after the start, got
bumped around in tight between TRIE HEIRESS and FAITH N HOPE up the backstretch, and was done after three furlongs.

Footnotes
WORTH AVENUE stayed in range early three wide, overhauled the leaders from outside entering the final furlong and drew away, remained clear past the
70-yard maker, then was all out to last. NOWITNA RIVER was outrun for a half-mile, swung to the far outside into the lane, finished fastest and just missed.
SHALL RETURN broke flat-footed and was outsprinted early, checked along the inside behind GILDA F. approaching the quarter-pole before really getting
in gear, moved out four wide to the stretch and gained late between the top two. SALSA RITA contested the early pace between horses, continued to battle
inside MEMORIZE while shifting to the rail after a half-mile, and weakened past the eighth-pole. MEMORIZE pressed the pace three wide early, continued
to fight for command outside SALSA RITA into the stretch, and weakened between horses entering the final furlong. DANCING NOELLE was no factor
inside. GILDA F. rushed up after the start to get a short lead inside SALSA RITA and MEMORIZE, checked on the rail losing her action approaching the
quarter-pole, and continued to fade away. FOUR K'S was finished early in the two-path.

AUGUSTA MOON pressed the pace outside BEAN COUNTER under a hold, challenged in earnest coming off the far turn, and edged away after a long,
hard drive. BEAN COUNTER established a slow pace inside, responded when confronted after six furlongs, and yielded grudgingly late. LIDO KEY raced in
the second flight for six furlongs, and rallied mildly to best the others. SASSY JUSTICE tugged along under a firm hold early, came three wide into the lane
and lacked a solid response. MIKE'S GIRL leapt at the start and landed awkwardly, and passed only tired horses late on the far outside. CHAMPAGNE
BLISS brushed with BIG TINA at the start, and was outrun. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON saved ground for nearly six furlongs in striking range, and came up
empty. BIG TINA brushed with CHAMPAGNE BLISS at the start, briefly loomed a threat three wide passing the quarter-pole, but gave way through the
stretch.

FLORA FANTASY was never far back, took closer order three wide after a half-mile, battled outside SAYONARA BABY through a long drive and prevailed
late. SAYONARA BABY crossed over to the early lead inside, shook off BABY ICE around the turn, clung to a short lead on the rail through mid stretch, and
held stubbornly on the wrong lead. ROYAL MEGHAN bumped with BION MAGIC at the start, raced forwardly inside for a half, tipped to the three-path in
upper stretch, and could not gain on the wrong lead. BOW TOWN CAT bumped with BION MAGIC at the start and was outsprinted early, moved off the
inside approaching the turn, and failed to menace. BABY ICE pressed SAYONARA BABY from outside early, got shaken off around the turn, and retreated.
BION MAGIC brushed the left side of the gate coming out, was relegated to the rear after being bumped between BOW TOWN CAT and ROYAL MEGHAN
after that, and continued to trail.

Footnotes
KOKO STAR bumped lightly with SEVEN CHANNELS at the start, tracked the pace three wide, wrested command and shifted in clearing to the lead in mid
stretch, and maintained control late. TWO BY TWO lagged well back early inside, got a bit closer between horses around the far turn, moved out for the
drive and finished well to narrow the gap. FAKE MUSE bumped with LUCKY STRIPE at the start, prompted the pace outside SENZAZIONE, challenged for
command between that one and KOKO STAR late on the far turn and into the stretch, steadied behind the latter a furlong out, then drifted out under
left-hand pressure and was clipped behind nearing the wire. LUCKY STRIPE got jostled around between SENZAZIONE and FAKE MUSE just after the
start, raced far back two wide on the turns, moved out for the drive and found his best stride belatedly. SEVEN CHANNELS bumped lightly with KOKO
STAR at the start, lagged well back on the rail to the stretch, angled out and was going well too late. CHAMPERS raced in range two wide for six furlongs,
flattened out through the furlong grounds and was in a bit tight between horses while not advancing. CALL BROS advanced mildly four wide after six
furlongs, got herded in through mid stretch by METCALF, and was cautiously handled to the finish. KITTEN'S CLOWN dwelt and was unruly spotting the
field six lengths or so at the break, raced out in the course and was never in the hunt. SENZAZIONE bumped with LUCKY STRIPE at the start, set the early
pace inside, got collared after six furlongs, and was tiring when taken up on the rail past the eighth-pole. UNCLE RENNY saved ground to the stretch, and
was making no headway when steadied slightly behind horses past mid stretch. METCALF swung to the far outside leaving the far turn, lugged in badly
through upper stretch under right-hand pressure, had the rider briefly take hold in deep stretch after tightening up several rivals, was urged again late and
clipped heels behind FAKE MUSE unseating the rider just before the wire. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, AND AN
OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF FAKE MUSE, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
