Footnotes
ROW THE BOAT broke readily to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace, pressed the issue in a prolonged drive through the turn to late stages and
narrowly prevailed in time under brisk left handed encouragement. PRIZED WARRIOR, urged to dispute the pace inside the eventual winner on a narrow
advantage racing into the turn, resisted grudgingly to the end and just missed. COMMANDER'S INTENT angled inwards tracking the leaders as part of the
second flight and continued evenly while shifting just off the inside racing into the stretch. IMPERIAL IVOR was settled well off the leaders early, saved
ground through the turn and continued with interest to improve position inside foes. ODESSA GOLD tracked off the second flight along the inside on the
backstretch, angled out four wide racing into the lane but offered no rally. BIBLICALPROPORTION settled last in the opening quarter, was fanned five wide
into the stretch but passed only tiring rivals. GALLEON LIGHT angled inwards in early stages to track off the first flight three deep between foes, continued
outside a rival as part of the second flight entering the turn but faded into upper stretch. PRIVILEGIO switched out five wide in the opening stages to gain
terms with the second flight but dropped out early. OLD NEWS came through close quarters while shifting out to race four wide between foes just off the
second flight on the backstretch but was through after a half.

pressed the issue entering the turn, took over nearing upper stretch to gain a clear advantage and held sway to the end under firm right handed
encouragement. EXPLOSIVE PACKAGE, bumped at the start, was urged to gain a forward placing just inside the pacesetter in the opening stages,
conceded some position into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into the stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap nearing the wire.
DARESCA broke out bumping EXPLOSIVE PACKAGE at the start, was righted to track inside rivals as part of the second flight, shifted off the rail entering
the lane and continued with interest between foes to gain a share. KOA KANI was settled between foes dropping off the second flight in the opening quarter,
angled inwards nearing the turn, saved ground through the bend, then shifted out to continued,evenly between rivals in the stretch. MI TIA REGIS, caught
five wide in the opening stages, was prompted to make some brief progress racing four wide into the turn but proved empty in the drive.

angling inside leaving the chute, dueled for command inside the eventual winner racing into the turn and gave way into the stretch. DELIGHTFULZEE'S

Footnotes
TAOS broke sharply, moved to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes racing in the three path into the backstretch while under light rating,
edged away to a clear advantage racing into the far turn and came under firm right handed pressure to maintain a safe margin to the end. DRILLOMATIC
was urged to prompt the pacesetter three deep between foes to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid into the far turn but couldn't gain terms with the
winner. LION CHARMER, forwardly placed along the rail attending the pace, was prompted to advance inside foes racing into the far turn, then weakened in
late stages. LORD DRAGON settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to split rivals entering the far turn and continued
with interest to gain position to the end. SPEAKERIT tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the first turn, shifted out entering the
backstretch while being prompted to gain some position between foes after a half but soon emptied out. HUBBA BUBBA, urged to gain a forward placing
racing on terms with the first flight while caught four wide through the first turn to the backstretch, gave way after a half. HOLD THE SPICE, off a bit slowly,
was reserved while angling inside early, but proved no threat. CHANNELEDSLONGSHOT, restless when loading in the gate, raced wide to the backstretch
and dropped out early.

dropping off the second flight, came through close quarters entering the turn to split foes, shifted in to bid between foes nearing the sixteenth marker but
was outkicked by the top pair. MY SISTER'S KEEPER sprinted clear off racing well off the rail through the backstretch, held sway to upper stretch but gave
out abruptly once headed by the winner. CHANNELED'S ANGEL made brief pursuit of a rival while shifting outside that foe after the opening quarter, raced

Footnotes
BUFFALO MAX was settled off the second flight racing a bit off the inside into the backstretch, continued under patient handling to the second bend, shifted
out to split foes three deep nearing upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage and go clear in time under firm
encouragement. ESTILO PELIGROSO, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders between rivals under rating into the
backstretch, made steady progress to challenge just outside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner's final bid. CITY GUY,
caught four wide racing into the first turn while being hustled to terms with the pacesetter, prompted that foe through the backstretch, took over racing into
the far turn to gain a clear advantage but faltered leaving midstretch. O DANNY BOY, caught widest in the last flight racing to the first turn, was reserved last
while angling inside nearing the backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn and gained some position between foes in the closing stages. K'S
FUNHOUSE, caught three deep between foes in the first flight racing to the first turn, was held up off rivals entering that bend to track the leaders three,
then four wide into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. VALUABLE PILLOW was rated inside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted
outside a tiring foe on the far turn but steadily faded into the lane. TINKER'S PAL raced wide to the backstretch and failed to menace. CONVEYED, urged to
gain the lead racing off the rail into the first turn, dueled for command on a narrow advantage to the far turn and emptied out abruptly once he was headed.

CAMBIO, restless in the gate before the start, broke readily to race on terms with the pacesetter between rivals in the opening stages, conceded some
position while shifting out three wide on the turn, then continued with a steady bid to wrest command racing into the stretch while shifting to the inside and
went clear under firm left handed pressure. LA WAPA tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper
stretch to advance on the leaders three deep and prevailed for second between foes in the closing stages. REAL WILD SOLUTION, came through close
quarters at the start to track the leaders five, then four wide between foes in the opening stages, made steady rpogress while shifting four wide nearing the
lane and continued to improve position. MERENGUE, urged along the rail prompting a rival's pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.
GLITTER GIRL joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, edged clear racing into the turn but gave out abruptly nearing midstretch. CATTLEYA,
caught six wide in early stages, never gained contention. STRAND DE ORO proved no factor. SCHEMING very restless when loading in the gate, ducked
out at the start and dropped out early.

wide entering the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, moved away to a clear advantage and held sway to the end under firm handling.
BETTER YET angled inwards in the opening stages to track off the first flight inside a rival, switched out racing into the far turn to advance four wide nearing
the lane and continued willingly to close the gap. VIVA FOREVER, forwardly placed three deep between foes prompting the pace into the first turn, angled
inwards on the backstretch while being held up off the first flight,shifted to the rail entering the far turn and continued with interest to gain position inside foes
late. CALLIE CALIFORNIA, urged inside rivals prompting the pace into the backstretch, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way into upper
stretch. COLONELS DAUGHTER settled off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch but never gained contention. IGOTTAWHITEFACE,
urged between foes racing to the first turn prompting the pace, pressed the issue to the far turn and gave way into the lane. ASHLEY'S ROSE settled
outside a rival in the last flight early but never mounted a serious challenge. SHES DYNOMITE, urged to terms with the first flight racing four wide through

Footnotes
AGI'S CAIT broke out at the start bumping FOGGY FLIGHT, was quickly collected while racing along the rail just behind the first flight into the first turn,
assumed the advantage nearing the backstretch while under light rating, moved away to a clear advantage through the backstretch, then held sway on a
commanding margin into the stretch to prove best under right handed encouragement. FOGGY FLIGHT, bumped at the start, was held up off rivals in the
second flight just off the inside racing into the backstretch, lost some position awaiting an opening racing through the far turn, came through close quarters
while angling inside nearing the lane and continued with interest to secure the place honors in the closing stages under some mild hand urging. BE NIMBLE,
caught four wide racing through the first turn while prompted to terms with the first flight, continued in pursuit of the leaders three deep between foes into the
far turn but had no closing response. DESIGNING, forwardly placed three deep between foes racing through the first turn, continued in pursuit of the leader
between rivals to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. CONNECTIVITY was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out four
wide racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance but lacked a rally. MARNIE GIRL, urged to gain a forward placing while shifting off the rail
racing into the first turn as part of the first flight, made brief pursuit of the leader but gave way after a half. VENETIAN PRINCESS settled outside foes to the
backstretch and failed to menace.
