FIREPROOF broke slowly, settled outside a rival then inside on the turn, swung three deep into the stretch, rallied under urging while drifting in to bump with
the runner-up in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. BELLA CHICA stalked three deep then outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, split
rivals past midstretch, drifted out some from the whip to bump with the winner in deep stretch and continued gamely to the end. RIDE SALLY RIDE chased
a bit off the rail then inside on the turn, came out into the stretch, split rivals in deep stretch and edged a foe for the show. LETS GET WILD sped to the early
lead, set the pace inside, fought back in deep stretch and was edged late for third. OUR ROMANCE stalked a bit off the rail then outside a rival on the turn
and into the stretch, bid outside the pacesetter into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. GIFTED TALK angled in and saved ground chasing the
pace, continued inside in the drive an did not rally. WHAT A FAMILY chased outside a rival, came out into the stretch and lacked the necessary response.
TIGER'S PRINCESS bobbled as the ground broke out behind in a slow start, settled off the pace inside, continued along the rail into the stretch and was not
a threat. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run of the top pair before ruling the runner-up contributed to the contact between them.

Footnotes
I'M LEAVING YOU pulled his way up along the inside to gain the lead, set all the pace along the rail and held on gamely under urging. FENGARI had speed
outside the winner then stalked just off the rail to the stretch and finished willingly but could not quite catch that one. PALACE PRINCE chased a bit off the
rail then inside on the second turn, came out in upper stretch and bested the others. EXHORT three deep into the first turn, angled in and chased inside, cut
the corner into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. CAMPS BAY saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and could not offer the
necessary response. NEGOTIATOR angled in and settled inside, came out leaving the second turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
COOL RUNNINGS stalked inside then a bit off the rail, swung out into the stretch and weakened. RAILSPLITTER bobbled at the start, settled inside then
just off the fence, angled in on the second turn, came out some in the stretch and was not a threat. FANTASTIC DAY chased between horses then outside a
rival on the backstretch and second turn, dropped back a bit off the inside leaving that turn and weakened.

left handed crack of the whip nearing midstretch and pulled clear under steady handling then a hold late. CURVACEOUS broke in and bumped a rival, sped
to the early lead, set the pace inside, fought back into the stretch and until just past midstretch and bested the others. POLAR ROUTE stalked four wide
between foes then between rivals on the turn and outside a foe into the stretch and held third. GOLDEN MELODIE settled off the rail then moved up three
deep into the turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. REDS TRIBAL HEART broke out and bumped a rival, had speed inside
then saved ground stalking the pace, continued along the inside in the stretch and weakened. BIG PASSION a step slow to begin, stalked between foes

LIGHTHOUSE had speed between horses then dueled inside, put a head in front on the turn, fought back while drifting out a bit under left handed urging in
the stretch and gamely prevailed. LOFTY dueled outside the winner throughout, fought back alongside that one through a long drive and continued willingly
to the wire. MEAN SOPHIA stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail on the turn and into the stretch and did not rally. KUSTOM FOR KARL saved ground
stalking the leaders, fell back some into the turn, came out into the stretch and lacked the necessary response.
