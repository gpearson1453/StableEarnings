Footnotes
HAIL TO THE CHIEF saved ground far off of the pace early on before advancing in the three path between horses through the far turn, came into the lane in
the four path with multiple lengths to make up, shifted outside of the leaders inside the final furlong as those foes drifted inwards, then kept on through deep
stretch to reach the lead approaching the wire. SAMARONTI stalked in the four, then three, path around the first turn, was put to pressure around the far
turn to make a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, grabbed a narrow advantage away from his inner foes in upper stretch, but shifted ground
inwards through deep stretch, and was outfinished by an outer oncharging rival approaching the wire. AND SEEK prompted the pace three to two wide
around the first turn while a bit keen into that bend, settled down in the backstretch, made a two wide bid for the lead into the far turn, dueled outside of
CIGAR BOX around that bend, but was met with a challenge from SMARAONTI in upper stretch, dug in between inside of that foe, but gave way late.
COMEDIAN was forwardly placed along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders at the five sixteenths pole while not coming under pressure from
the rider to do so, regained stride in upper stretch, shifted to the three path, but failed to threaten. FEVER TEMPLE trailed early on, took the far turn in the
three to four path before coming into the lane in the six path, but failed to menace. CIGAR BOX broke outwards and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace
along the inside to the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch and faded. SOUL BEAM took a hard bump from an inner foe and was pinched between
horses at the start, raced in midpack two wide before tipping to the four path into the backstretch, then weakened thereafter. JUST LIKE RICHIE raced off of
the pace in the three path, but weakened into the far turn.

BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES broke well, cleared away from other prominent rivals at the seven sixteenths pole, widened her advantage handily while shifting to
the three path at the five sixteenths pole, then was given a bit of free rein in upper stretch, responded readily, and drew off a will while under confident
handling. YOGURT shifted off of the inside to take in the turn in the two to three path in midpack, angled to the rail approaching the furlong pole to make a
bid for place inside of a trio of rivals, surged through a narrow opening, kicked clear of those foes, and finished willingly. TIZ A BIT LUCKY raced far off of
the pace in the three path through the turn, then produced a late rally commencing in midstretch, and stayed on willingly for a minor reward. BLUE GRASS
ANNA vied four wide and outside of a trio of foes early on, failed to keep pace with the leader into the turn, chased that foe from the four to five path around
the bend, but hung on her left lead through the lane and was outfinished for minor rewards. BOSSY MOMENT stalked the pace from along the inside
through the turn, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to split horses and failed to make a bid. WENDY'S FINE WINE was slow into stride,
trailed the field to upper stretch, and passed tired rivals. LONG MONDAY pressed the leader from between horses early on, but failed to keep pace into the
turn, chased that foe while being floated to the four path around the turn, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. GREAT JAZZ prompted the pace
three wide between horses early on, but was outpaced into the turn, came into the lane in the five path, and weakened. HARD TO ACCESS took the turn in
the two to six path, and was no threat. LOVE'S TAVITO raced well off of the pace in the four path through the turn, and was no factor. PAM'S AVERY ROSE
saved ground, but weakened.

Footnotes
LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE hopped at the start, raced in midpack in the three path through the first turn, inched forward to be a part of the second flight while
three wide and between horses at the half mile pole, got outmoved by her outer foe into the turn, switched out and made a four wide bid for the lead in upper
stretch, then prevailed in the late stages under a long drive. I SAW HER FIRST set the pace from along the inside, but was inexcusably taken back into the
far turn and allowed other rivals to clear off, came into the lane multiple lengths off of the pace, shifted outwards to the three path in upper stretch and
produced a stout rerally between horses at the furlong pole, fought gamely inside of the winner through deep stretch, but it was not enough. CHINA CAT
was leaning against the right side of the starting gate when it opened, causing her to stumble when it opened, which caused her to bump with her outer foe,
raced far off of the pace, swung to the four path while gaining around the far turn, made a five wide bid for the lead at the furlong pole, but hung and was
outfinished. DOUBLE OAKED trailed in the three, then two, path around the first turn, advanced to be behind the leaders around the far turn, tipped to the
six path at the furlong pole, and finished willingly, but was no threat. QUIET DAWN vied two wide while staying in the three path around the first turn, led
between horses into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with her outer foe turning for home, and weakened. GIRL FROM BERLIN stalked three wide while
staying in the four path, made a three wide bid into the far turn, grabbed an advantage in upper stretch, but yielded between horses at the furlong pole.
DIXIE MOLL was forwardly placed along the inside, but weakened into the far turn. BE AUTHENTIC bobbled a bit after a good start, was forwardly placed
two wide between horses early on, but weakened. PEPPER THEM GIRL hopped at the start then was bumped when she landed, raced far off of the pace,
swung from the three to the six path turning for home, and was no factor.

Footnotes
RAYO DE LUZ set the pace from the onset, held an advantage from a pair of rivals around the far turn, repelled those bid in upper stretch, drew off at the
furlong pole, and was kept to task to the wire. MR. UNUSUAL was caught in the five path into the first turn while far off of the pace, advanced outside of
horses in the four path around the far turn, then sustained his grinding rally to edge place away from an inner rival in the late stages. HERBIES TOYS
prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far turn after GAMBIT made a three wide bid at the half mile pole, but weakened between
horses approaching the furlong pole, then held show. GAMBIT stalked three wide before making a three wide bid at the half mile pole, vied outside of a pair
of rivals around the far turn, but drifted to the four path turning for home, and was subsequently outpaced in upper stretch, and got outfinished of minor
rewards. GOLDEN RULE HAVEN saved ground from midpack, raced under a tight hold at the five furlong pole, then made a mild rail rally through the lane.
PRIVATE BOONE pulled along the rail into the backstretch to achieve inside position just off of the pace setters, but weakened turning for home. FAST
RECOVERY hesitated at the start, raced far off of the pace in the two path before getting rank behind horses into the backstretch, then was no factor.
UNIMAGINABLE U was a bit keen while caught four wide into the first turn, took the far turn in the two to three path while in range of the leaders, but
weakened. PHARAOH'S KITTEN raced off of the pace in the two path and was never involved. RIVER STONES took the first turn in the four path and was
through after a half. BE AN INSPIRATION hesitated at the start, trailed into the first turn where he shifted off of heels from the three to the five path, was
caught four wide around the far turn, and was never involved.

Footnotes
CRAZY SEXY MUNNY stalked four wide early on, inched forward and made a three wide bid while still in the four path at the five sixteenths pole, took over
in upper stretch from, drew off approaching the furlong pole, and was geared down through the late stages. HEAVENS WHISPER inched forward inside of
the early leader to duel for the lead into the turn, put away her outer counterpart turning for home. but was no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch,
and was second best. YES I'M EVIL took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace before being brushed to the six path turning for home by URBAN
KAT, then produced a mild rally outside of tiring rivals for a minor reward. GRATS ROAD raced far off of the pace early on, shifted down from the five path
to the three path around the turn, and made a mild rally between horses in midstretch to dead heat for fourth at the wire. FLASH N' DANCE saved ground
far off of the pace, but waited for racing room while behind horses from the three furlong pole to the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the two path turning for
home, then finished evenly and got caught at the wire to dead heat for fourth. URBAN KAT failed to factor after shifting from the four to three path into the
turn. BIG BLUE MAGIC was a bit rank while behind horses leaving the chute, saved ground from midpack, but to no avail. SHE'S NO DRAMA set the pace
from the onset while staying in the two path, dueled for the lead two wide after HEAVENS WHISPER bid along the rail into the turn, but weakened turning
for home. LUCKY BE A LADY trailed along the inside, then passed tired rivals in the lane. KIMBERLEY DREAM prompted the pace three wide, but
weakened after shifting to the four path into the turn, and was eased through the lane. WEIGHTLESSNESS shifted from the three to the two path around the
turn while midpack and between horses, but weakened along the inside in upper stretch, and was eased in the late stages.
