Footnotes
FANCY CREOLE QUEEN very salty return. CONSPICUOUSLY SWEET clean trip, dueled all the way. RELENTLESS SOUL lacked a late kick. BUXS
BROOKSHIRE never fully extended. AZOLA BABAN gained experience. CORONAS JESS OK broke awkwardly. FLYING FDD PRINCESS choppy first
strides. JESS IVORY LIPS missed the break. MISS PRISSY JONES seemed unmotivated.
