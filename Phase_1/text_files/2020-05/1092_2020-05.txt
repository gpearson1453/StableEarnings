Footnotes
AMERICANO joined the pace five wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival racing in the three path through the turn and edged forward
through the stretch to go clear under firm right handed encouragement. BETWEENHEREANDCOOL, prompted to a forward placing nearest the inside, was
held up after the opening furlong, then switched off the inside, was prompted to advance racing into the turn to bid three deep between foes nearing upper
stretch but proved only second best. RED HOT LOOKS, urged disputing the pace three deep between rivals, dueled for command inside the winner racing a
bit off the rail into the turn and weakened entering the lane. J B QUICK broke slowly, was settled into stride, shifted out nearing upper stretch gaining
momentum and split rivals three wide in the closing stages to gain position in a belated effort. MR. OCTOBER switched outside the first flight in early stages,
was prompted to make brief progress racing four wide through the turn but had no closing bid. SEVENTYSEVENWILOW, shuffled a bit avoiding tight
quarters at the start, tracked the leaders four wide, then three wide to the lane but lacked a rally. RED ROSE CAT, urged prompting the pace four wide
between foes in the opening stages, gave way racing into the turn. JIFFY JOSH proved no factor. SUM OVERTURE was urged inside rivals in brief pursuit
of the first flight but was through after three furlongs.

TIZ APPROVED, pulling against firm restraint stalking just off the first flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, switched outside the pacesetter
entering the turn while moving to terms with that foe, took over racing into upper stretch and went well clear under firm right handed encouragement.
HIGHWAYTWENTYSEVEN, urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch, edged clear to a brief advantage racing into the turn, shifted out
once headed racing into upper stretch while continuing in pursuit of the winner but proved only second best. PURPLE MONSTER, restless in the gate,
gained a forward placing tracking the leaders, three, then four wide as part of the second flight racing into the turn and continued with interest to edge rivals
for a share late. EL ZEUS tracked just off the second flight five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn and continued evenly
between foes. ARCHIVERO, four wide between rivals tracking just off the second flight in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn while being
urged to lodge a brief bid, but flattened out in the drive. SINDARIUS broke inwards bumping RED NATION, was settled between rivals and proved no threat.
RED NATION, bumped at the start, was settled off the second flight racing between foes and failed to menace. GOLD DUCAT dropped out early. JUMPED
BAIL was urged prompting a rival's pace racing into the turn but soon gave way. LAMECH tracked off the second flight along the inside while climbing in the
opening quarter, continued along the rail into the turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
THE STIFLER, urged clear outside foes racing into the first turn, held sway on a comfortable margin under light rating through the backstretch, was roused
to maintain a clear advantage racing into the stretch and was gathered up nearing the wire once the issue was decided. WHISTLE ME HOME broke readily,
was rated between foes conceding some position to drop off the second flight into the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing into the far turn, shifted
out to the four path entering the stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages to close the gap while gaining the place honors. ZITMAN raced three
wide between foes in second flight to the backstretch, was prompted in that path pursuing the winner through the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. TALK TO THE MEDIA tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight and continued evenly along the inside to late stages.
HONEST TO GOODNESS, reserved last while angling to the inside early, saved ground throughout but offered no rally. SLICK AS ICE was a brief factor
between foes in second flight tracking the pacesetter but faded after a half. DOX FOLLY, caught four wide racing through the first turn while prompted to
terms with the second flight, gave way early.

Footnotes
OVERPRAISE, reserved between foes just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, gradually drew into contention three deep between foes while
racing in close quarters through the far turn, was urged to split foes four wide entering upper stretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm handling.
HAY HAY MY MY angled inwards to lead the second flight on a narrow margin between foes under light rating, was prompted to advance three deep
between foes racing into the far turn, came through close quarters to gain the advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner's final bid.
PAPA'S PLACE angled to the inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, shifted out after a half, was prompted through tight quarters just
off the inside to gain position between foes racing into the lane but was outkicked by the top pair. ATLAS MOON switched outside foes racing to the
backstretch while dropping off the second flight, was prompted to advance four wide through the backstretch into the far turn to gain terms with the leaders
midway through that bend, was fanned five wide into the stretch and failed to match terms with the leaders in late stages. MOZANO, forwardly placed
tracking just off the leaders a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival, then between foes racing into the far turn and
gave way nearing the lane. SWIFT KID settled last along the inside early, swung out five wide approaching the far turn to make some brief progress but had
no closing bid. MORO DRAMA was rated off the second flight along the inside to the first turn, made brief progress inside, then between rivals while caught
in tight entering the second bend and came up empty racing into the lane. OVERPOWER settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch
but never gained contention. MONETIZED, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival to the first turn, gained a brief advantage between calls, dueled inside
rivals racing to the far turn and soon gave way. OLD NEWS, urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the first turn, bore out entering the backstretch,
was pulled up, then walked off the course under his own power.

DO WHAT IT TAKES was rated between foes tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the turn, shifted inside the leader leaving
midstretch and found his best stride late to just edge that foe on the wire under steady right handed pressure. RATTLESNAKEROSE was urged to gain a
clear advantage dictating the pace racing in the two path into the turn, edged forward into upper stretch, held sway past the furlong marker on a comfortable
advantage but just missed. COCKTAILS OR CANDY, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter in the three path racing into the turn, continued willingly in
that path to the end but was just outkicked by the top pair. LIL B QUICK hopped at the start, switched out early to race off the second flight while caught in
tight quarters four deep between foes, conceded some position nearing the turn, was prompted to advance racing into the stretch and split foes in the
closing stages gaining position to the end. SUNSET EMPIRE switched off the inside in early stages racing just off the second flight, advanced on those
rivals in the four path racing through the turn to gain terms with the second flight but lacked the needed final kick. MZ. FOO DO tracked the leaders inside
rivals in second flight racing into the turn, shifted off the rail in upper stretch but weakened in late stages. ALLURING APPROVAL, restless in the gate, broke
in the air, dropped well off the leaders, angled to the inside racing into the turn to gain some position but made no real impression. MOONLIT SEA, off a
step slowly, was settled last and passed between tiring rivals in the closing stages. PLEASANT BUFFY tracked the leaders five wide just off the second
flight in the opening stages but quickly retreated. R SWEET EXCHANGE broke awkwardly losing position at the start, switched outside foes on the turn but
never menaced.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE RYDER was rated off the second flight racing outside foes to the backstretch, continued under light rating three deep into the second bend,
shifted out four wide midway through the far turn while being prompted to advance, moved to wrest the advantage in that path racing into upper stretch and
went clear under pressure. I DREAM OF LOIS, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to press the issue
between foes on the far turn to upper stretch, couldn't match the winner but held foes for the place honors. UNABRIDGED (IRE) sped to the lead along the
rail, dictated the pace to the far turn, dueled for command inside foes while shifting a bit off the rail into the stretch and weakened late. CROWN OF JOY
was settled outside foes dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, advanced five wide racing into the far turn, continued in that path to upper stretch
and finished with interest to gain position to the end. COLONELS DAUGHTER tracked off the second flight in the opening half, gained position between foes
on the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch while being roused to challenge inside the leaders but had no final kick. COCKTAIL SKIRT tracked the
leaders outside foes in second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief, three wide bid between foes racing into the far turn but proved empty in the drive.
THUMP settled out of striking distance early and proved no threat. ASHLEY'S ROSE tracked off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch and faded
after a half. CHOLLA was prompted to gain a position tracking just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening half but emptied out racing into the far
turn. ANDITSAFACT proved no factor.

Footnotes
EXPENSIVE STYLE angled to the inside early tracking just off the first flight, came through close quarters near the half mile marker, switched out entering
the turn to gain position between foes, moved to challenge for command in tandem with DARK WEB racing into upper stretch and went clear under brisk
handling. The latter gained a forward placing between foes stalking just off the first flight under light rating, switched out nearing the turn to advance on
those foes three deep, moved to challenge for command between foes racing into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner. PREPARE FOR GLORY,
outpaced in early stages, angled out five wide racing into the stretch and found some late response to prevail for a share. IMPRESSIVE SPEED dislodged
his rider to run loose momentarily in the chute before the start, was prompted to a forward placing tracking the leaders four wide racing into the turn,
continued in that path to the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. EVIDENCE switched out in early stages to race just off the second flight, steadied
between foes avoiding close quarters racing past the half mile marker and offered no rally. FRIED PLANTAINE was hustled outside foes forcing the pace
through the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival into the turn, drifted out well wide nearing upper stretch and soon gave way. CAPTAIN DRAKE
angled to the inside racing through the backstretch disputing the pace into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch. RUBENSLEGACY proved no factor.
TORRID ZONE came under pressure to contend between foes early and quickly dropped out.

Footnotes
R NEXT ROLL angled to the inside disputing the pace racing into the turn, forged clear racing into upper stretch and was kept to pressure. CELESTIAL
ORB, off a bit slowly, switched outside foes gathering momentum racing into the turn, advanced four wide through the bend, angled inside racing into upper
stretch and proved best of the others. TAKIN IT EASY tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and improved position inside
foes to gain a share. SOLD ON SALSA, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. KUPURI
tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in the lane and made some mild progress late. JIMA'S GOLD tracked off
the second flight racing five wide early, shifted in to race three deep between foes on the turn but faded in the drive. MI TIA CHRISTINA was settled
between foes early and failed to menace. ANIMAUXSELLE hopped at the start, dropped out last, settled into stride, was fanned five wide into the stretch but
made no impression. NONNIE CONNIE proved no factor. GET SASSY tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, continued three wide in brief
pursuit of the leaders into the turn but gave way nearing the lane. CONGRATS GOLDA angled inwards in early stages while being hustled to a contending
position in second flight but emptied out early.

Footnotes
FREEDOM LASS sped to the lead under some prompting while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light rating
through the backstretch, was urged to turn back a rival's challenge racing into the far turn and went well clear through the stretch under firm left handed
encouragement. NATOMA was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into the lane and continued with a
steady late effort to prevail for the place honors. DREAMING OF PARIS, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter to the first turn, moved to prompt that foe
through the backstretch to the far turn and gave way in the drive. ETELKA tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages, split foes making brief
progress while angling to the inside on the far turn but flattened out nearing the lane. FOREVERNOA tracked off the second flight between foes, angled out
entering the stretch but passed only tiring rivals. SIDNEY SUE settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the first turn, switched out after a half
while being prompted to advance but offered no rally. NOSTALGIA tracked the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight and gave way after a half.
WHISKEY SONG, reserved while angling inside early, never mounted a serious challenge. DYNAPOWER, urged to gain a forward placing three deep
attending the pace to the backstretch, gave way after a half. VOTING HIGH proved no factor.
