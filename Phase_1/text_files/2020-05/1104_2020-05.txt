Footnotes
EURO STEP was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and just got up in his final strides under strong encouragement. FINAL
DESIGN pressed the pace from the outside, raced three deep in the lane and finished gamely to the wire. HOBBS HOPE settled off the early pace, raced
six wide into the upper stretch and closed in on the latter stages. OKIE PRINCESS showed good speed from the inside and weakened through the lane.
LADY ABIGAIL stalked the pace while racing between rivals, took up nearing the quarter pole and had no late winning bid. Jockey filed an objection for
interference nearing the quarter pole against Final Design and it was not allowed. SARAH ELISE raced six wide through the lane and never was a factor.
SUGARSHAKING stalked the pace and weakened along the inside. ANWARA was slow early and never threatened. FLASHFLOOD WARNING failed to
have a response.

BAPTISM showed good early speed from the outside, raced two wide in the stretch and drew off to be well clear while racing in hand. ANSWER IN THE
WIND was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide into the lane and was no match for the winner. CORKY pressed the pace, raced three deep and
weakened a bit late. HEZA WILD RIDE was allowed to settle early, moved up three wide in the drive and improved his position. YOU SEXY BOY stalked the
pace, raced four wide in the stretch and weakened. RUN AWAY FLASH was off slowly, raced five wide in the lane and never was a factor. WILD AND
GOLDEN was slow early and failed to respond. NIPAWIN stalked the pace, checked near the half mile pole and tired through the drive. EL VALE settled off
the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. MY VOW IS COURAGE failed to sustain a bid. DREAMIN OF GLORY was off slowly,
raced towards the inside and never threatened. IMMAFUNNIFOLKLORE was pulled up early and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
THEYCALLHERPINKY showed good early speed, set all the pace, drifted late bothering Flying Lindy and was disqualified for interference and placed
second. FLYING LINDY stalked the pace, raced five deep at the eighth pole, moved up gamely deep and was forced out by a drifting rival. Flying Lindy was
placed first for interference in the stretch drive. FAVORITE SISTER was slow early, raced five wide at the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire.
RIVER LIBERTY stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. TRULY CLASSIC settled off the early pace, raced
towards the inside and never was a factor. SANDY CREST stalked the pace and tired while racing three wide. YOU ZIP IT failed to respond. SILVER
SPLASH saved ground and never was a factor. KICKEROO raced up closed in the early stages and tired readily.
