Footnotes
HARD LIGHTING hit the right side of the gate at the start, rallied in the two-path to collar HARPER from the inside after six furlongs, drew clear through mid
stretch, and was all out to hold on. LEADING WEST saved ground unhurried early, swung out four wide leaving the turn, rallied steadily and was getting to
the winner from outside. METCALF raced four wide and failed to menace. HARPER pressed BLOODPROF from outside early, took over midway on the turn
and briefly drew clear, was overhauled from both sides at the top of the stretch, and retreated. COURAGE brushed the left side of the gate and was away
slowly, moved up through the opening stages, but was finished before reaching the stretch. BLOODPROF set the pace well off the rail to turn, yielded to
HARPER with three furlongs remaining, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
STORMY BOSS settled in the second flight two to three wide for a half-mile, rallied through a large opening between LUXE DIAMOND and CHIC AND
SEXY in mid stretch, and drove clear. DIXIELAND HUMOR brushed with LUXE DIAMOND at the start, raced well back five wide around the turn, and
finished well on the far outside to get up for second. MYSTIC COMIN HOME steadied between the leaders passing the five-eighths pole, moved out four
wide to challenge outside CHIC AND SEXY after a half-mile, reached the front in upper stretch, but was no match for the winner entering the final furlong
and lost the place late. LUXE DIAMOND brushed with DIXIELAND HUMOR at the start, saved ground in range to the stretch, and lacked a final bid.
DISTINCTLY SASSY raced four wide on the turn, and had no rally. CHIC AND SEXY vied inside AMERICA'S QUEEN early, got clear around the turn, then
weakened in upper stretch and drifted out on her left lead. COUNTRY STRONG was a step slow at the start, and failed to become a factor inside.
SOCIALLY ASTRAY became edgy in the gate prior to the start, and was outrun. AMERICA'S QUEEN contested the early pace outside CHIC AND SEXY,
and gave way around the turn.

GRAND CRU CLASSE stayed close early inside, was guided out three wide passing the three-eighths pole, took over outside DOLL COLLECTION turning
for home, drifted out under a drive while clear through mid stretch and was geared down late. DOLL COLLECTION hustled to the front between horses after
the start, edged away on the turn, proved no match for the winner by upper stretch, and ran on second best. PUSHINGUPDAISIES broke out at the start,
raced three then four wide around the turn, and was just up outside to be a distant third. RACHEL'S WISH saved ground throughout and was never
prominent. MUMBAI pressed the pace outside DOLL COLLECTION, and was finished after a half-mile. MYCRAZYXGIRLFRIEND pressed the early pace
well out in the track, and was done after a half.

Footnotes
MAN WITH A PLAN broke to the lead and crossed over staking out the three-path, rated along moving in a bit late on the turn, drifted out while just clear of
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA in mid stretch, and held that rival safe while continuing to drift out. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA had the rider lose the whip while
being hustled along soon after the start, moved off the inside with aim outside MAN WITH A PLAN turning for home, steadied behind that one just past the
eighth-pole while being driven with goggles, moved out switching leads awkwardly and could not gain to the finish. DUBLIN TINKER saved ground outrun
for a half-mile, and rallied mildly toward the inside through the lane. QUASAR MOON hit the left side of the gate coming out, then was bumped by DON
FAGER and steadied back, came three wide off the turn far back, and improved past tired horses late. AWESOME ACTION chased outside MAN WITH A
PLAN to the top of the stretch, and faded. STRATEGIC OUTLOOK raced in the middle of the pack three wide for a half, and had no rally.
GETTININTOMISCHIEF bumped with DRAGON MOON at the start, and was no factor three wide. ENZOEXPRESS showed brief speed, and faded steadily
approaching the stretch. DICTATOR broke slowly, and was outrun in the two-path. DRAGON MOON bumped with GETTININTOMISCHIEF at the start, and
was through early four wide. DON FAGER broke out bumping QUASAR MOON, and dropped far back early. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY
THE RIDER OF LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

MANE ATTRACTION hopped slightly at the start, pressed the pace in the four-path outside HALLAJOORO and LET THEM EAT CAKE, took over readily
into the stretch and drew away hand urged. HALLAJOORI set the pace in the two-path being hounded by LET THEM EAT CAKE, was no match for the
winner turning for home, but battled back to get second. MAGGIE FITZ was urged to keep up early inside, moved out four wide late on the turn, and was
just up for the show. LET THEM EAT CAKE pressed the pace between horses in the three-path, and weakened through the late stages. SWEET BON BON
hit the left side of the gate at the start, and dropped far back after three furlongs.

the eighth-pole, and narrowly prevailed. THE QUEENS JULES vied early inside PANGO, dropped back midway on the turn, moved outside with a rebid at
the top of the stretch, challenged outside DROP KICK through the final furlong but could not get by while being floated out a bit. DEXTER ROAD advanced
four wide around the turn, altered course inside the leaders in deep stretch and was gaining gradually to the finish. PANGO contested the early pace outside
THE QUEENS JULES, was joined from outside by DROP KICK five-sixteenths out, and yielded inside nearing the eighth-pole. CONGRATS THIS brushed
the rail entering the turn, moved out for the drive and ran on evenly. BLAME THE THIEF was bumped lightly into STOCK by MR CHAPLIN at the start,
stayed in range between horses in a closely-knit group to the turn, and faded three wide before reaching the stretch. KAHRAMANI raced close up between
horses early, and gave way before completing six furlongs. STOCK bumped lightly with BLAME THE THIEF at the start, and dropped far back after a
half-mile. MR CHAPLIN broke out bumping BLAME THE THIEF lightly into STOCK, and was never in the hunt. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER
BY THE RIDER OF THE QUEENS JULES FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

R U ROYALTY set a pressured early pace inside LA RUSIA while a bit off the rail, moved further out as DAYS OF SPRING loomed alongside after six
furlongs, drifted out under left-hand pressure brushing and pushing the latter out past the eighth-pole and 70 yards out, and held on. DAYS OF SPRING
tracked outside the leaders to the turn, challenged outside R U ROYALTY late on the turn, got brushed and pushed out by that one twice in deep stretch,
and stayed on stubbornly. LADY ARCHA came widest beginning to hit her best stride past the quarter-pole, got steered inside the leaders through the
furlong grounds and finished willingly. LA RUSIA pressed the pace outside R U ROYALTY, and dropped back between that one and DAYS OF SPRING late
on the turn. LIFE ON THE EDGE eyed the leading trio entering the turn, but was empty after six furlongs. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF DAYS OF SPRING AGAINST R U ROYALTY, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST POSITION AND
PLACED SECOND FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
BLUE BUFF moved inside while unhurried early, shifted off the rail being roused past the half-mile pole, continued to build momentum four wide at the top of
the lane, lugged in moving to the lead through mid stretch despite left-hand pressure, and held for the decision with the rider tugging on the right rein.
INDIMAAJ broke out into the hind end of WAR GIANT and strode awkwardly away from the gate, gathered himself and moved up inside on the first turn,
stayed on the rail getting through past WAR GIANT to loom boldly turning for home, and ran on gamely with little maneuvering room late. COLONEL LIAM
chased after WAR GIANT three wide, closed the gap around the far turn, but faded through upper stretch. WINKING AT THEDUDE settled in the two-path
for nearly six furlongs, swung four wide at the top of the lane, and made no headway. WAR GIANT broke alertly despite being bumped by INDIMAAJ, cut a
sharp pace in the two-path for six furlongs, and yielded to challenges from both flanks into the stretch. KRACHENWAGEN raced three to four wide on the
first turn, and dropped far back after six furlongs.

PONT DU GARD went along between horses early, was strongly urged through the far turn in the three-path, stayed on task determinedly into the stretch,
and surged past DIAMONDS ENJOY to edge away late. DIAMONDS ENJOY sped clear early, rated along unbothered in the two-path to the stretch, but
could not deny the top one through the closing stages. KOKOKOMO broke a bit awkwardly and bumped lightly with DYN, was urged up the backstretch on
the far outside, had the rider lose the whip after straightening away for the drive, and went clear for the show. ALIEN INVASION faded inside after six
furlongs. DYN bumped lightly with KOKOKOMO at the start, stayed close four wide early, stopped late on the far turn and was pulled up into the stretch, and
walked off.

Footnotes
FORT KING sped clear early off the rail, came off the turn at least four paths out, and held firm under a drive. CAPTURED BY FATE broke to the lead but
was soon outsprinted by FORT KING, moved out giving chase to the stretch, could not seriously threaten but dug in to hold second. REAGAN'S HEART
rallied mildly into third while five or six wide approaching the stretch, but made no further gains. FELON raced evenly, and was no threat toward the inside.
VITA DOLCE was outrun five wide to the top of the lane, and improved position on the far outside. SLIPPY was under a busy ride away from the gate and
bumped with GATOR FIFTY TWO, and failed to menace. WELLWEST moved up inside after a sluggish start, but had nothing more after three furlongs.
FREE FLAYME was outrun three wide. GATOR FIFTY TWO bumped with SLIPPY after the start, and was outrun. LITTLE TEQUILA saved ground to no
avail. REGGAE PIRATE steadied toward the inside entering the turn, and dropped well back.
