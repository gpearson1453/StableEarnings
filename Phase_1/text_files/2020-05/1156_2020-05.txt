Footnotes
BAYONCE broke out and bumped HOPE PARKWAY then quickly assumed command, set the pace outside a pair of rivals, cleared around the turn while
drifting out, urged right-handed then widened to the wire under hand urging. INDIAS LUTE attended the pace from the inside, drifted out into the lane and
bested the rest. TENGA'S JEWEL bumped start, raced off the rail then angled in nearing the five-sixteenths marker, saved ground into the stretch and
lasted for the show. WILLOWGLADE broke awkwardly and slow to begin, saved ground around the turn, tipped out in the stretch and showed a mild
response but missed the show honors. MONCHICHI forwardly placed between rivals then chased outside a rival, lugged out around the turn and flattened in
the drive. HOPE PARKWAY stumbled and bumped by BAYONCE leaving the gate, tracked from the outside, angled inward and took the turn two wide and
weakened in the final furlong. SHARE THE VISION broke out and bumped rival, drifted out steadily up the backstretch, went four to five wide around the
turn and showed little.

Footnotes
CAT'S DESSERT dueled outside a rival, inched away on the turn from the two path, led clear past the sixteenth pole, weakened a bit late but was able to
hold on. NIGHT OF IDIOTS brushed with outside rival at the start, lacked early speed, raced along the inside into the turn, came out entering the stretch,
closed fast and reeled in the leader in deep stretch but just missed. MAIKA tracked the pace off the inside, entered the turn three wide, floated out by NIGHT
OF IDIOTS approaching the eighth pole, rallied through the lane and finished a clear third. SHE BE FIRE N ICE brushed with NIGHT OF IDIOTS at the
start, dueled with CAT'S DESSERT up the backstretch, got outpaced around the turn and chased the winner into the lane, then weakened in the final
furlong.

SEEKING PEACE chased the speedy trio from the outside, gained ground while four wide into the turn, bid four deep around the bend, assumed command
into the stretch and drew clear under mild urging. U S LAWMAN attended the pace between runners, vied two wide around the turn and into the stretch and
could not match the winner in the late stages. UNEXPECTED JOURNEY set the pace under pressure from the inside, went three deep into the turn, vied
between runners leaving the bend and was outfinished in the drive. ROCK N DOC stumbled at the start, tracked the pace, angled inward and entered the
turn along the rail, steered out into the three path and came under urging but failed to find more. CHARMING WEEKEND stalked off the rail, three wide into
the turn, came out a path into the stretch and lacked a rally. DEL MAR'S JOURNEY showed speed from the inside, lost ground around the turn and gave
way in the lane.
