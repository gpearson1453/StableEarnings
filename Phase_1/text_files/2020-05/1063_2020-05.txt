Footnotes
PROMNESIA dueled from the inside into and around the turn, shook free of NAOMI FRALEY approaching the stetch, and drew away under right-handed
urging and strong hand urging late. NAOMI FRALEY dueled for the lead outside of PROMNESIA, went three wide around the turn, could not match the
winner in the final furlong but kept on well to prove second best. FOR MY BROTHER stalked the top pair in the early going, tucked in down along the fence
and saved ground to the lane and held the show. VIDALIA tracked just off the early pacesetters, went three wide through the turn and lacked a serious bid.
TRUE TO THE TRUTH was off the pace up the backstretch, raced in the two path through the turn and never made an impact. HOPE WINS shuffled back
soon after the start, raced a bit off the rail and lacked room behind rivals on the turn, angled outside and improved position. NOBLE GIRL off the rail in the
opening stages then outside a rival into the turn, lugged out around the bend and faded out of contention. POINT RECEIVED settled early, angled to the
inside nearing the turn, saved ground and had little left for the drive. KATHIA trailed the field early, angled to the inside and also saved ground and was
always outrun.

Footnotes
SIERRA ECHO set the pace with SON OF A QUEEN applying pressure from the inside, cleared that rival and inched away around the bend, came three
wide into the stretch and held well under a drive to the line. SON OF A QUEEN prompted the pace from the inside, chased the leader into the turn, drifted
out around the turn, came back in the final sixteenth but could not reach the winner. BUMBLEBEE was outside a rival in the early going, four deep and
carried wide around the turn, and kept on willingly to hold third. WELLDIDYOUGETIT broke through the gate prior to the start, chased outside a rival, raced
three deep then carried wide on the turn, battled with BUMBLEBEE for the show but was edged for that minor reward. PIVO off the rail in the stages,
traveled between and floated out by SON OF A QUEEN on the turn, exited the turn three to four wide and had nothing left to offer. DARING WAYS chased
from the inside, steadied entering the turn, continued along the fence to the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CARACORTADA dueled with TENGS WONDER in the opening stages then challenged from the inside by TOP HAT HIGH JINKS, dueled with that rival
while two wide then came out a path entering the stretch, kicked clear in the lane and powered away. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS chased the top pair then went
up inside to dueled for the lead, challenged the winner around the turn and into the stretch but could not match strides in the lane but had enough left to hold
the place. TENGS WONDER contested the pace from the outside in the early going then chased the top pair into the turn, traveled two to three wide nearing
the eighth pole and finished evenly. SHEZA KATHY attended the pace from the outside then moved up four deep, chased four wide around the turn and
could not rally in the final furlong. TUESDAYS SUPERNOVA showed brief speed before being pulled up, eased around the turn and vanned off following the
race.
