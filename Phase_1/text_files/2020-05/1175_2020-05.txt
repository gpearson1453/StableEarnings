Footnotes
OCALA brushed the right side of the gate, then was bumped and pushed in considerably by BELLA GIANNA a stride later, moved up widest leaving the
chute, took over outside BIG BOSS LADY approaching the quarter-pole in the four-path, and held sway through the lane. LA GATA NEGRA advanced five
wide after six furlongs, had aim outside the winner through the lane, but did not have enough. GRAVEL GERTIE stayed in range four wide to the stretch,
and saved the show. MARICOPA trailed inside under urging heading to the turn, angled out past the quarter-pole and offered a mild response. BIG BOSS
LADY set a sharp pace off the rail, yielded to OCALA late on the turn, and faded steadily. BELLA GIANNA veered into OCALA at the break pushing that one
in several paths, chased the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved inside on the turn and was driven with no response.

Footnotes
BLUE BLUE ICE saved ground early and around the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied steadily while drifting out some, and was along to wear down
MARCHING IN from outside in the last 50 yards. MARCHING IN took over outside SHES ONE MAD MOMMA approaching the half-mile pole, drew clear
around the turn in the three-path, remained in command to deep stretch but could not hold on. SIZZLING ROMA was outrun two to three wide for a half,
moved to the rail for the drive and rallied mildly. MA MEATLOAF was under a drive four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed response. SHES ONE
MAD MOMMA was edgy in the gate prior to the start, broke alertly and set the early pace slightly off the inside, got headed just before completing the first
quarter, and faded. MY SEBASTIANA began to fade four then five wide around the turn.

Footnotes
NOTSOSUBTLE vied outside BEBEAU for the better part of six furlongs, took over four paths out turning for home, and drew off under a drive. BEBEAU
was off the rail dueling for command inside NOTSOSUBTLE up the backstretch and into the turn, could not match strides past the quarter-pole, and ran on
to hold the place. STILL SCHEMIN stayed in range four wide early, and faded on the wrong lead while able to salvage the show. RARE HUE saved ground
to no avail. OLE MOLE followed behind the battling leaders to the turn, and faded before reaching the stretch. JUAN BOLY was taken widest early, put in a
brief run five wide on the turn, faded in upper stretch and was eased up late.

GIBBERISH emerged into view battling for command outside ASSUME leaving the chute, put that one away around the turn, and splashed to a lengthy
score well out in the track. PRAIRIE WINGS rallied into second around the turn, and was no threat to the winner while clearly second best. ASSUME was off
the rail contesting the pace inside GIBBERISH for a half-mile, could not keep pace around the turn, and just held the show. LASTING UNION raced well out
in the track, and failed to menace. INVALUABLE dropped well back after six furlongs, and was eased up in the stretch. This race was hand timed, fractional
times unavailable due to heavy rain and poor visibility.

Footnotes
GO AWAY tracked outside the leaders early, took over four wide going by the five-sixteenths, repelled a bid from THE GREEN MO'STER through the
furlong grounds, drifted out late under left-hand pressure and held firm. THE GREEN MO'STER stayed close early inside the leaders, went around widest to
challenge GO AWAY turning for home, could not get by and was clearly second best. C C RIDER vied for command outside EXTRA EXTRA for five
furlongs, could not stave off GO AWAY by the end of the turn, and weakened. INDICIA trailed to the top of the stretch, and never reached contention.
EXTRA EXTRA battled up front inside C C RIDER early, and began to give way midway on the turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CPT. RHETT BUTLER sat perched off the early leaders three to four wide, took over outside after a half-mile, widened through the furlong grounds under a
drive, and was geared down the last 70 yards. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK contested the early pace inside rivals, was no match for the winner by upper stretch,
and held the place. MUKULWITZ came under a ride four or five wide past the five-sixteenths, and was no real threat with an even finish. FAST MAGIC
failed to menace three wide. SANDYS BLAZE was edgy in the gate prior to the start, pressed the early pace between horses, and faded after a half. IRISH
PAUL showed brief speed, and was through early. CHILL HAZE was edgy in the gate prior to the start, tossed his head and reared up spotting the field half
a dozen lengths, and came widest trailing off the turn. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE
OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
MS MESHAK advanced rapidly four wide around the turn, took over outside HY DOLLFACE and FIGHTRESS while appearing to bump with the latter at the
top of the stretch, and moved away under pressure. STILL ALIVE bumped with FIGHTRESS at the start, was outsprinted for a half-mile two or three wide,
moved well out in the track through the lane and rallied to get up for second late. FIGHTRESS was never far back, bid in the three-path between horses late
on the turn, appeared to bump with MS MESHAK near the three-sixteenths, and was overhauled for the place. FOREVER MARTA moved inside outrun to
the turn, swung back out five wide approaching the stretch, and gained mildly on the far outside. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL pressed the early pace between
horses, dropped inside around the turn and could not keep up after a half-mile. HY DOLLFACE sped clear early, got caught from outside by FIGHTRESS
and MS MESHAK just past the quarter-pole, and gave way. SHE'S PRIMO was under a drive past the midway point on the turn, had no response and
dropped far back after a half.

Footnotes
SURF SHACK bumped with CHASE RUNNER at the start and was outrun early, moved up around the turn two wide, rallied through the lane while drifting
out under left-hand pressure, and got up inside rivals. ZIPPY raced in striking range three wide for six furlongs, shifted to the middle of the track through a
long drive, and just missed outside rivals. MY POINT EXACTLY set the pace well off the rail, battled stubbornly through a long drive and was edged
between the top two. BOURBON IN MAY was well back two to three wide to the end of the turn, and rallied mildly for the last major share. DRIVEN BY
THUNDER advanced five wide approaching the stretch, and weakened outside the eighth-pole. DONJI was fairly close early, dropped back four then five
wide through the middle stages, and made no headway in the stretch. MAJESTIC LUNA was taken over to the rail up the backstretch, and lacked a solid
response after six furlongs. CHASE RUNNER bumped with SURF SHACK at the start, chased the pacesetter three wide early, and tired nearing the stretch.
This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
JETTIN OUT tracked the leaders three wide, rallied determinedly and was just up outside UNPUBLISHED at the finish. UNPUBLISHED pressed VINCENT
WILLIAM from the inside early, let that one go into the turn, rebid along the rail turning for home, edged away in deep stretch while drifting out, and was
nailed at the wire. VINCENT WILLIAM set the pace in the two-path, battled outside UNPUBLISHED through mid stretch, drifted out and gave way.
SEPTEMBERTEN raced two wide around the turn, and failed to threaten in an even effort. CHINOMADITO veered out sharply and was taken up at the
start, angled to the far outside at the top of the stretch, and improved position. JUNGLE WARRIOR hit the left side of the gate and was slow into stride,
saved ground and was no factor. TRAVELIN GAMBLER raced four wide around the turn, and gave way through the stretch. ON THE TURF was outrun
inside. GRAND MORELAND faded four wide after a half-mile.

Footnotes
SPARTANKA was unhurried well off a fast early pace, hugged the rail rocketing from last to first around the turn, drew clear after six furlongs and was kept
to pressure. JUDY'S WAY settled off the leaders near the two-path, swung out four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied into second through mid
stretch. ELUSIVE MOLLY was sent from the gate and vied inside WANDERLUST leaving the chute, deferred up the backstretch, rebid from outside after a
half-mile, opened a clear lead midway on the turn, was powerless to fend off SPARTANKA approaching the quarter-pole, and yielded second through the
furlong grounds. FIFTYSHAYS OFGREEN took closer order after a half-mile, but flattened out four wide at the top of the stretch. WANDERLUST stumbled
at the start, went up to contest the pace outside ELUSIVE MOLLY, sped off up the backstretch slightly off the rail, got collared midway on the turn with
nothing left, was eased up into the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
FREE TO FLY was outrun early, came five wide off the turn, moved out well past the middle of the track, and kicked in to overtake WORTH AVENUE from
outside in the closing yards. WORTH AVENUE raced three then four wide around the turn, rallied to get the lead outside NOT NICE about 70 yards out, but
could not hold off the top one. NOT NICE took over four wide after three-eighths of a mile, but yielded inside the top two through the late stages. GLORY
ROLL sped to the front inside, lost the advantage to NOT NICE around the turn, and faded. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE was outsprinted to the stretch, and
improved position in the two-path without threatening. MAJESTIC MAIARA pressed the pace two wide, and weakened after three furlongs. POCKET OF
CANDY stayed close inside to the end of the turn, and tired. IT'S EASY TO SAY failed to menace. TIZANILLUSION broke open the gate without going
through prior to the start, broke through the stall door after it failed to open simultaneously with the others at the start, raced wide and trailed throughout.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, TIZANILLUSION WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER DUE TO A MALFUNCTION OF THE STARTING GATE.
