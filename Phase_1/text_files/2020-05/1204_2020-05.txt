Footnotes
THE PACESETTER broke outwardly, pursued the pace from between runners going four wide into the turn and moving in a path midway on that bend,
struck the lead outside the three-sixteenths pole and held a rival at bay while being kept to the task. FIRE FLING was bumped at the break, raced outside
rivals five then four wide on the turn pressing just off the leader, could make no headway on the winner but was clear of the rest. RIO SAND DANCER
chased from outside foes early then dropped back and tucked in leaving the backstretch, went three to four deep on that bend, evened out in the lane. ALL
STEAMED UP was forwardly-positioned inside rivals just off the early pacesetter, bid three wide into the turn taking the lead at the five-sixteenths and
moving in a path soon after, was overtaken past the quarter pole and weakened some. CACTUS BELLE was bumped into the outside rival at the start then
allowed to gather while shifting near the rail, moved out two then three wide past the quarter pole four room, came out further still entering the stretch and
ran on. INDIGO SLEW was forced out bumping a rival in the process at the start, raced two wide into the turn before being carried three to four deep
midway on that bend, altered inside the aforementioned CACTUS BELLE at the top of the stretch and ran on. SHAMEFULLY SWEET was hustled forward
to set the early pace inside just off the rail, moved nearer the rail entering the turn while being over taken and dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
LAST TO BLUSH pursued the leaders from outside, advanced on those leaving the turn having going four to five wide on that bend, took a narrow lead
outside the furlong marker, forged clear in late stretch under urging. NEW ADVENTURE was encouraged forward inside rivals to press while racing just off
the rail into the turn, took the lead about the three-eighths pole continuing through the turn but coming out a further path from the rail, was overtaken by the
head of the stretch and no match but saved the place from INDIAN DIVA, who forced the early pace from between runners, continued to chase three to four
wide on the turn losing ground out of that bend, kept on in the lane to narrowly miss second. CEDE'S DREAM settled off the early leaders just off the inside,
went in the two path on the turn, continued evenly in the lane. BUCA SARABI stumbled at the start, was well back early, went in the two to three path on the
turn beginning to pick up momentum, angled six wide coming out of that bend and continued to gain late outside. RED OR GREEN chased three to four
wide into the turn, came out a path entering the stretch and had no rally. TERAS SILENCE raced off the leaders going three to four wide on the turn, went
evenly and made no bid. SUTAH WHO bobbled at the break, trailed early while removed from the inside going in the two to three path on the turn and was
not a threat. HOT N PERTY was forwardly-positioned early, dropped back and shifted in entering the turn, saved ground on that but continued to drop back
and faded. Due to a timer malfunction the five furlong fraction was unavailable.

Footnotes
MINNIE ME HA settled mid-pack racing in the clear, advanced two to three wide in behind foes early on the turn shifting five deep by the end of that bend,
continued to grind down on the leaders widest of all in the stretch and edged past late. SAMOKEN UP A STORM exchanged bumps with inside and outside
rivals at the break, tracked the leading pair outside a foe up the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, came out a bit at the top of the stretch
and exchanged a light brush with a rival, fought on gamely to share the place. SAYWARD prompted the pace from outside a rival entering the turn three
deep, had a narrow lead on that bend moving clear turning for home, drifted out a bit inside the final furlong and shared the place while outkicked for top
honors. COOL AND QUICK had bumps from both sides at the start, was outside and wide mid-division up the backstretch, continued four deep on the turn
coming out of that bend six wide, drifted in just a bit near the furlong grounds and exchanged a light brush, made a mild bid late but was outfinished.
TOWER WAGON broke outwardly exchanging some contact, was inside a rival just off the leading pair up the backstretch into the turn going in the two to
three path on that bend, dropped back turning for home and continued evenly in the stretch. RESTLESS MOVER broke out just a bit, shifted in heading up
the backstretch, went in the two path on the turn and failed to rally. OMI'S PARTY stumbled at the start, was kept well off the inside going in the four path on
the turn and was never near enough to threaten. CANCAN exchanged contact at the start while coming in a bit, prompted the pace inside a foe but off the
fence, moved nearer the rail into the turn and steadily dropped back. THREE CHIPS was not a factor racing just off the inside. Due to a timer malfunction
the five furlong fraction was unavailable.

Footnotes
CLASSIC GENT settled outside foes early going four to five wide, advanced still outside on the far turn in about the same path before swinging seven deep
turning into upper stretch, struck the lead inside the furlong marker and edged clear. SCOTTY WHO bumped the outside rival at the start, moved forward to
set the early tempo then vied inside a rival up the backstretch, continued to battle just off the rail and inside a foe on the far turn, edged away a little bit
turning for home but veered out near the sixteenth pole and bumped a rival. VICTORY LANE raced at the rear three wide and between foes on the first turn,
continued from between rivals into the far turn going three to four wide on that bend, came out a path into upper stretch, was carried out and bumped near
the sixteenth pole and continued on well. IRISH POLO settled off the leaders inside a foe but just off the fence, edged closer leaving the far turn still just
removed from the rail and evened out in the lane. MASTER RULER contested the pace from outside a rival, continued in contention into upper stretch, was
carried out and bumped into a rival near the sixteenth pole. TIZEZZY was fractious in the gate, raced in the clear mid-pack in about the four path in the early
going, continued outside rivals four wide on the far turn coming out a path late on that bend before angling in a bit, failed to rally. MOOSEWOOD was
bumped at the break, raced outside a foe off the leading pair going two to three wide on the first turn, was encouraged along three deep into the far turn
coming out a further path on that bend, failed to rally in the lane. HUNTERWOOD shifted in heading to the first turn, raced on or just off the rail, made no bid
and was not persevered with late. Following a stewards' inquiry SCOTTY WHO was disqualified from second and placed fifth behind MASTER RULER for
interference.

Footnotes
MR GOLD MAN stalked the pacesetter from outside, advanced two to three wide on the turn taking over by the quarter pole, moved clear in the lane.
DUALITAS was bumped hard from both sides at the start and steadied, advanced outside foes into the turn going five deep on that bend and moving in a bit
coming into the lane, was no match for the winner but held the place. TRY N SUCCEED broke outwardly bumping a rival hard at the start, was between
rivals three wide into the turn, checked at the quarter pole when lacking room and forced out a bit by CHAMPITO, kept on in the stretch to outfinished that
rival for the minor award. CHAMPITO was just off the leaders early, advanced inside rivals but off the fence in the two then three path early on the turn, was
within striking distance coming out of that bend but lacked the needed late kick. WISKEYS DREAMS dropped back heading up the backstretch, went
between foes in the three to four path on the turn, gained into upper stretch then evened out. THIRSTY MONKEY chased from outside early then between
foes four to five wide into the turn, came out wide for the drive and flattened out. P J'S FROG set the pace in the clear racing on or just off the rail,
weakened. BLUE BEES exchanged repeated small bumps at the start with the inside foe, raced inside rivals just off the fence through the turn, lugged out
just past the furlong marker bumping and bothering rivals. TEE BONE exchanged bumps at the start, switched out and raced in the two to three path
through the turn, was bumped and bothered past the furlong marker. IT'S MY BLISS raced outside at the rear going four to five wide on the turn, was
bumped and bothered past the eighth pole and was never a threat. Following the race the rider of TRY N SUCCEED lodged a claim of foul against both
CHAMPITO and MR GOLD MAN alleging interference. Upon review no action was taken.

Footnotes
BARONS BOY stalked from outside just off the early leaders three wide on the first turn, took over a narrow lead midway up the backstretch, moved clear on
the far turn and widened in the drive. KEATON settled mid-pack just off the inside, continued from the two path on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch
carrying out a rival and brushing that one before exchanging a harder bump late. GAME SET AND MATCH settled last but one inside a rival but off the
fence two to three deep and well back, moved out up the backstretch and advanced five deep on the far turn, was carried out a bit further in upper stretch
while lightly brushed then exchanged a bump late. ZUNI was forwardly positioned inside tracking the early pace, switched out three deep near the quarter
pole, was between rivals at the top of the stretch and lacked a late kick. PROSSER'S KITTEN was caught outside foes five wide on the first turn, edged
closer early up the backstretch run, continued four then three wide on the far turn and weakened. MAGIC CARPET RUN raced off the fence in the three to
four path up close early but weakened thereafter and came up empty. LOOKINFORAVICTORY went outside a foe toward the back three to four wide on the
first turn, continued well back and four deep on the far turn while failing to rally. C T BEACON'S HILL set the early tempo from the two path, was overtaken
midway up the backstretch, steadily dropped back and faded. Following a stewards' inquiry as well as objection by the rider of GAME SET AND MATCH
against KEATON alleging interference, the latter was disqualified from second and placed third before the former for interference in the stretch.
