NAOMI FRALEY was quickest early, controlled the pace and angled to the inside, widened the advantage around the turn, prompted with hand urging into
the drive and increased the margin further while ridden out to the wire. SEA GLASS stalked the pacesetter from the inside to the turn, moved out into the
two path and kept on one paced in the lane to finish a clear second. HOPE WINS trailed the field from the inside, came out near the eighth pole and edged
rival for the show honors. POINT RECEIVED stalked off the rail then between rivals to the turn, approached the eighth pole three wide and weakened. IN IT
FOR LIFE outside a rival up the backstretch, three deep into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and came up empty in the final furlong.

inside to the lane, vied with outside rivals gamely to the wire but was edged by the winner. STORMIN TRICK bumped both sides leaving the gate, dueled
outside of PICK ONE then vied between into the stretch, battled between foes through the final furlong and went gamely to the wire. HACK away quickly
from the gate then settled in range from ooff the rail, angled in on the turn, came out a bit in the drive and finished well but in hand late behind the top trio.

Footnotes
CIOPPINO PASADINO set the pace outside a pair, met the bid of JOE'S PASSION and turned that foe away on the turn, inched away in the two path and
stayed clear under right-handed urging. WICKED SUNSET chased outside a rival to the turn, swung four wide around the bend and finished willingly for
second place honors. JOE'S PASSION prompted the pace from between horses, collared the the leader then steadied briefly midway around the turn and
held the show. LEA'S REWARD raced along the rail into and around the bend and into the stretch but failed to rally when called upon. HELIACAL showed
speed attended the pace with a pair to the outside, chased the leader around the bend and tired in the final furlong. CHARMING ALEXIS went three wide
into the turn, four wide leaving the bend and had nothing left for the drive.
