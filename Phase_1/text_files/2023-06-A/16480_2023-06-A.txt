Footnotes
EL ORO (FR) broke well then ceded command to TIGERHON (FR) early, was cautious going up inside the leader leaving the backstretch and steadied into
the turn, moved up to challenge along the rail on the turn, put a head in front in front and got bumped in upper stretch, battled through the final furlong and
dug in to prevail. TIGERHON (FR) hit the inner side of the stall leaving the gate, moved up quickly to clear, dueled with EL ORO (FR) on the turn, lost
command in upper stretch and drifted in to bump that rival shortly after, fought gamely through the final furlong and was edged for the victory. BATTLE
CALL settled at the back early, raced along the rail into the turn, swung out past the quarter pole and into the lane, closed fast from the middle of the track
but ran out of time. GREENBOW was off slow to begin, chased while saving ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch to take aim at the top pair
but finished evenly in the late stages. J D'S RUDE BOY stalked the top pair outside a rival into the turn, chased three then two wide around the bend and
could not respond when called upon. MISSED CALL tracked two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and failed to rally.

Footnotes
TENTH STREET DON stalked off the rail up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, loomed three wide into the lane, headed the leader with a furlong
remaining, took over midstretch and inched ahead under a drive. SPIRITIST sat off the pace outside a rival, chased three deep on the turn, four wide
leaving the bend, finished well and got up for second. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING cleared quickly from inside and was rated on the front end to the
nine-sixteenths pole, inched away into the turn, led along the rail then two wide into the drive, challenged by the winner at the eighth pole, relinquished the
lead midstretch, stayed on from inside and got edged for the place. LITTLEBROTHERJOEY stalked from inside leaving the backstretch, dropped back on
the turn, kept on through the lane to whittle the gap but failed to threaten. GOLDENSPA settled off the rail, went between foes on the turn in the two path,
tipped out into the lane and lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO showed the way inside EASTERN OCEAN before clearing at the half-mile pole, set all the pace on the rail to the top of the lane, spurted
away in upper stretch and padded the lead under left-handed urging to set a new track record. JETOVATOR stalked off the rail, drew closer around the turn
and loomed three wide on the turn, was no match for the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. EASTERN OCEAN raced up close
outside the leader then chased past the half-mile pole, traveled two wide on the turn and inside into the lane, then flattened in the late stages.
COMMANDER (FR) was off a bit slow from inside, settled inside, saved ground to the lane, moved out in the drive and lacked further response. BALADI
unhurried at the back off the rail, angled to the inside still trailing on the turn and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
NO SLO MO broke head high to leave a step slow, reserved at the back on the inside, came two wide into the stretch and could not rally. SARWAR (FR)
was off a bit slow, stalked from inside through both turns, tipped out at the top of the stretch, launched a late bid in the final sixteenth but was not enough to
get by. BALLADEER broke out and bumped rival, cleared and controlled the pace, lightly coaxed with a quarter mile remaining, asked right-handed in upper
stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and held over the late charge from the runner-up. SEVEN WONDERS got bumped on both sides at the start,
stalked in the two path, roused leaving the far turn and lacked the needed late kick. RECKLESS SPIRIT took a bump from inside at the start, stalked in the
three path to the stretch and flattened out.

BOLT SUPREMACY sped clear and crossed over, met bids from a pair of rivals on the turn, shook free into the lane, drew away under right-handed urging
and held safely. WATSONVILLE got bumped from outside at the start, had to check when running up into a tight spot early, traveled between foes in the two
path on the turn, tipped out in the lane and finished willingly for the place. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid between rivals
on the turn, lost touch with the winner into the lane and churned on to hold third. CHAY'S TORNADO broke well then tracked from inside, cut the corner into
the lane and leveled off in the late stages. PETCOFF was off slow and bumped inner rival, brushed with inner rival up the backstretch, bid three deep on the
turn, chased the leader into the lane and weakened. PURE FIRE checked soon after the start, chased three deep then tried to go between rivals but was in
a bit tight at the quarter pole and could not make an impact in the stretch run. PARK CITY stalked four deep into the turn, remained wide into the lane and
faded out of contention. ROCK TO THE MUSIC jumped shadow early and dropped back, trailed on the inside into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WINDOW SHOPPING stalked between rivals early, coaxed through the far turn, angled in leaving the bend, tipped back out and bid between foes in upper
stretch, raced on even terms into deep stretch and proved best late. ANCIENT PEACE hit the gate in the beginning, recovered quickly and went up dueled
four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, put away THE ALYS LOOK at the five-sixteenths pole, jumped shadows approaching the quarter pole then
met the challenge from DOINITTHEHARDWAY, turned that rival away into the stretch, pressured by a pair of rivals entering the final furlong, resisted to the
sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly late. LILY POO got crowded between rivals prior to the first turn, chased three wide around that bend at the back, was
on the move three deep through the far turn, bid outside rivals in the lane, fought three deep into deep stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. ANYWHO
broke a step slow, tracked four wide early, remained four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. DOINITTHEHARDWAY broke well then stalked three deep,
bid three then two wide with a quarter mile left to run, failed to sustain the challenge into the stretch, suffered a mild shuffle in upper stretch but was already
starting to weaken and flattened in the late stages. THE ALYS LOOK dueled for command from inside, could not keep pace with the leader at the
five-sixteenths pole, lost positions into the stretch and weakened. AND TELL ME NOLIES got put in a bit tight then altered inward prior to the first turn,
stalked from inside, got blocked on the far turn, tipped two wide near the quarter pole and failed to rally.

steadily through the lane and got up at the wire. COMRADERY (IRE) up close three deep early and got bumped four wide into the first turn, angled to the
two path around that bend, was closest in pursuit to the far turn, bid outside the leader and cleared past the quarter pole, remain unchallenged into the final
sixteenth and got nailed on the line. OVERDUE traveled near the back in the early going, traveled two wide then between rivals on the far turn, exited that
bend three wide, looked to angle out but got hemmed in upper stretch, altered in and bumped rival inside the eight the pole, finished willingly in deep stretch
but lacked room late. MOODY JIM (IRE) settled two wide outside a rival, gained three then four deep on the far turn, chased withing range into the final
furlong but lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch. LOST IN SPACE (IRE) tracked from inside off the pace, moved into range between rivals on the
backstretch, chased two wide into the lane and failed to produce a bid. BIG BUZZ unhurried in the beginning, traveled two then three wide on the far turn,
tipped out in the lane and showed a mild response to improve position. RIJEKA (IRE) settled inside, went between foes into the far turn, angled back inside

closer in the middle stags, took aim two then three wide on the far turn, got bumped at the eighth pole and could not rally. RIP CITY prominent early then got
floated out a bit into the first turn and bumped outer rival, stalked along the inside, got put in tight at the three-eighths pole and dropped back, kept on in the
lane but lacked room at the eighth pole and could not threaten after. GROWTH ENGINE cleared and crossed over early, drifted into the first turn then
