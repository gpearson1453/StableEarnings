Footnotes
GALVASTON had a good trip three deep outside horses watching the top pair down the back straight, took closer order three wide at the quarter pole,
loomed the threat outside runners at the top of the lane and wore down his rivals through the stretch to get up for the victory. BOLD RELOAD pressed the
pace in the early going, chased the frontrunner throughout the turn, bid between runners in the two path turning for home and was outkicked in deep stretch
by the winner outside. JIBARO broke out at the start but was quickly collected was then coaxed for speed leading the field down the backstretch, was
comfortable up front setting the fractions through the turn, was headed by outside rivals at the top of the lane, battled until the sixteenth pole and gave way
to be a clear third in the end. GRAND ALLIANCE settled near the rear on the rail down the backside, put in a mild run advancing on the fence at three three
furlong pole to be in with a chance at the quarter marker but could not find more to pose a threat running on the fence to the wire. FROSTED ICING was
void of early speed trailing this compact field at the half, shifted outside to the three path turning for home but made little impression in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BONGINO was content just sitting off the pacesetter through the turn, cruised to the lead outside in upper stretch and drew away from the field when asked
in the final furlong. SECRET STORM had a good position all alone tracking the top duo in the beginning, was urged to go after the leaders at the quarter
pole and closed in for the place share picking up the early frontrunner nearing the wire. IGNITE THE STORM took command soon after the start, dictated
the pace down the backside and on the turn, was collared by the winner outside two furlongs from the wire, offered little resistance inside and tired in deep
stretch holding easily for the third money. STAR SCHOLAR travelled near the back three deep outside of horses at the half, was ridden for more entering
the stretch while angling out five wide in the straight and levelled out in the final furlong. ARAMOS was situated in the middle of the pack in the two path four
furlongs from the line, stalked on the rail to be trailing this field while saving ground at the three eighths pole, showed some late interest on the fence and
rallied to close in for a minor placing passing tired runners in the final eighth. ARNIE P was unhurried inside to trail this field down the backstretch, offered a
brief run four wide around foes at the three furlong marker and was not a presence running in the five path to the finish line in the end. KILLARY settled near
the rear on the rail in the beginning stages, made little improvement running on the turn and was empty in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
GHOUL (BRZ) was reined back to have an ideal spot behind the engaging trio down the backside, was on hold through the turn looking for a seam, found
room up the fence in upper stretch, was shut off at the eighth pole steadying sharply, regrouped outside in the two path in deep stretch and rebid to get up
nearing the wire. BIG WARDEN was away slowly to begin, assumed control inside at the five eighths marker, set the pace up front running on the turn, was
in the two path at the top of the lane, drifted inwards driving in mid stretch and was caught just before the finish line. TALL WATER was off slow at the start
to be near the back at the half, waited behind runners three wide with three eighths remaining, angled out five wide turning for home and closed well to
capture third money in the end. BOKERMIN was allowed to settle at the back trailing the field with a half left to go, offered a mild turn of foot four wide
around foes at the three furlong pole, was floated out to the six path for the drive and passed stragglers in deep stretch for a small share. DE ONLY
SOLUTION broke out at the start, chased three deep outside horses at the half, was roused three wide at the quarter pole, bid four wide turning for home
and stalled at the furlong marker. EXCEED pressed the issue between horses down the backstretch, was ridden midpoint on the turn to keep position and
gave way with rivals on either side in upper stretch.

Footnotes
COLLABORATIVE broke inwards bumping rival to begin, was well rated behind the top pack down the backside and through the turn, found room in the two
path as they straightened out for the drive, took control at the eighth pole and was edging away at the wire. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER was steadied soon
after the start to stalk near the back of the pack in the early going, rallied five wide circling horses two furlongs from home, poked his nose in front nearing
the furlong marker but needed more late to hold off the closing winner inside at the wire. STEPHEN B GOOD settled outside near the rear down the
backstretch, waited behind the dueling threesome on the turn, looked for a seam in upper stretch, finally had clear run six wide at the furlong pole and put in
a good finish to capture third in the end. BOSTON BAY was bumped at the break by his outside foe to trail the field after the start, continued to see the field
on the turn, angled out four wide at the quarter pole, shifted inwards to the rail at the furlong marker and finished well up the fence with an eighth remaining
to get up for a small share. RAGING BEAR contested for the front three wide outside challengers on the turn, was bumped while making a bid four wide
entering the stretch, narrowly holding onto the lead and faded between competitors in the final eighth. WILD CONVERSATION hounded the pace two deep
in the early going, prompted the pace between horses at the three furlong marker, bid three wide two furlongs out, was bumped by outside rival in upper
stretch and yielded in the last eighth. KINZHAL led the field down the backside on the rail, battled for the lead running inside through the turn and stopped
on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BIG EXECUTIVE travelled in the middle of the pack four wide at the half, rallied around foes midway through the turn while in hand, took over the lead five
wide in upper stretch and was kept to the task holding safe crossing the finish. CALL MY BANKER settled at the rear three wide down the backside,
followed the path of the winner circling three wide on the turn, posed the threat in the six path in upper stretch and finished to the wire on the wrong lead just
missing out in the end. HIGHLAND SOCIETY assumed the lead on the rail in a tight bunch of runners at the half, was collared outside by the winner turning
for home and was tiring on the fence running to the wire but held on determinedly to third at the line. ORPHAN HALLIE was away a bit slow to begin, moved
up to track on the rail behind the frontrunner on the turn, was scrubbed on three eights from home but to no avail, lost ground to the leaders and continued
to fight on down the stretch to rebid getting up for a minor share in the end. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ tracked the pace between foes in the two path in the
early stages of the race, was coaxed for more two furlongs from home to be in the mix three wide at the top of the lane but could not find another gear and
weakened in deep stretch. CHELSEA DAGGER settled near the rear in a close bunch of runner at the half, made little headway with horses on either side
running on the turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive to the line. M V SPEED chased the pace between foes three wide into the turn, was hard ridden
to match strides with runners at the five sixteenths pole and retreated at the quarter marker.

Footnotes
FOUR ACES HIGH hounded the pace under a snug hold down the backstretch, rated kindly just outside off the speed through the turn, took control in upper
stretch and was drawing clear in the late stages for the win. UNCLE JOE brushed the gate at the start, led the field down the backside, continued to dictate
the pace on the turn inside, was headed outside by the winner at the three sixteenths pole, could not find another gear to fend off the challenge in the
stretch drive and settle for second best at the wire. SOONER LUNAR had a good inside position while on hold behind the pacesetter running throughout the
turn, did not find a path for running room in upper stretch, finally had a seam at the sixteenth marker and got up at the wire to capture third money. POINT
TO THE STARS stalked near the rear three wide outside horses down the back straight, was roused three wide outside rivals on the turn, was in with a
chance five deep entering the stretch and finished evenly to be in the middle of a three horse photo for the minors. HUNT MASTER travelled in midpack two
deep at the half, rallied three wide to bid at the quarter pole, battled between foes for an eighth to the wire and stalled in deep stretch losing in a close photo
for third in the end. WINYAH BAY settled near the back on the rail running down the backstretch and through the turn, was asked for more while behind a
wall of runners in mid stretch, had clear run outside at the furlong marker and offered little finish. GUNS N' ROJAS trailed the field throughout, angled six
wide for the drive and could not get into contention running to the wire.

Footnotes
HULLABALOO cleared to take the field into the first turn, continued setting the pace comfortably up front at the half, was unchallenged throughout the
second turn, was headed outside turning for home and found more in the final eighth to prevail at the end. GROOM LAKE tossed his head when rating
between rivals under the wire for the first time, tracked nicely behind the leader at the half on the rail, shifted out to challenge for the lead splitting foes at the
top of the lane but could not get past a stubborn frontrunner down the stretch. ROBITAILLE brushed the gate at the break, had a good spot all alone
watching the top three leaders down the back straight, took closer through the far turn to be involved at the quarter pole for a share and offered a good finish
to hold for a non threaten third in the end. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) settled in the middle of the field down the backstretch, started to gain on rivals when
asked with three eighths remaining, continued to pick up the pace in mid stretch, drifted inwards between foes nearing the sixteenth pole when urged right
handed and settled for a small share in the end. NIKKI NOOTS was situated near the rear three deep on the first turn, could see the field down the
backstretch, saved all the ground on the final turn, began to advance on the fence in upper stretch, was steadied on the rail inside the sixteenth marker and
could not recover in time. SOCIAL JUSTICE was squeezed soon after the start trailing into the first turn, was asked on the fence midpoint on the far turn,
rallied some five wide turning for home but could not make any impression running to the finish. GRAND GIZMO prompted the pace three wide entering the
first turn, chased the frontrunning winner down the backside, was in the mix for a piece of the prize four wide turning for home and gave way in the final
furlong. MISTER MESEEKS stalked four wide outside rivals near the back into the first turn, was ridden three wide with three furlongs to go, put in a mild run
on the final turn and had nothing to give in the stretch drive. COACH ABERNATHY stalked near the back of the pack running three wide between foes into
the turn, was urged left handed at the seven sixteenths marker, offered little response, backed through the field on the far turn and was not persevered with
galloping to the wire. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #1 KODIAK MAMBA AND #9 NIKKI NOOTS INSIDE THE SIXTEENTH POLE RESULTED IN #1
KODIAK MAMBA WHO FINISHED FOURTH WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE
