Footnotes
SHESAHEATWAVE stalked the early paced, moved up along the outside to join Red Panty Raid nearing the five-eighths pole, dueled with that one from
and and prevailed in a prolonged drive. RED PANTY NIGHT hopped in the air at the start, then moved up to open a clear early lead, responded when
challenged nearing the five-eighths pole and disputed the issue to the wire but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. DANCE LADY saved ground
stalking the pace, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole but was unable to reach the top two in a steady effort. NOUMEA saved ground while being
unhurried and failed to threaten. SASSY EINSTEIN was allowed to settle in stride while racing three-wide and failed to be a factor.

TENNESSEE MOON saved ground setting the pace racing in hand and drew off to win as much the best. PISTA GIRL was bumped hard by Zeva Dee
shortly after the start, then bobbled to drop far behind the field, rallied five-wide the final quarter mile and finished strongly. ZEVA DEE broke out sharply to
bump with Pista Girl, then saved ground chasing the leader, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. OUR GIRL ASHLEY dropped back
early, came three-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. MISCHIEF MAME prompted the issue from along the outside to the stretch and tired. A
STORM TOO SOON was forwardly placed for three furlongs racing along the inside and gave way.
