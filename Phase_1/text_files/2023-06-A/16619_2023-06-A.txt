Footnotes
UNDISTURBED was prominent into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, kept attendance to LA VIKINA into the second
turn, chased that rival into the drive, responded to steady urging, wore down the runner-up in deep stretch and pushed past in the final strides to prevail. LA
VIKINA assumed command in the early running, was well handled through decent fractions into the second turn, showed the way to the quarter marker, held
UNDISTURBED at bay into mid-stretch, was asked for more approaching the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off UNDISTURBED in deep stretch and
grudgingly gave way in the final strides, while besting the rest. OCTANE (BRZ) tracked the decent early pace while outside of a rival, raced three wide into
the backstretch run, ran in pursuit while two wide along the far turn, could not make headway on the top two in the stretch and held safely in the end for
third. AGREETODISAGREE settled off of the decent early pace, steadied entering the first turn and raced two wide between rivals into the backstretch run,
tracked the decent pace while between runners into the far turn, was steered three wide into the drive, offered a mild rally in the stretch and improved
position in the final stages. A NEW PEACE had a shoe repaired prior to the race, settled three wide off of the decent early pace, tracked the pacesetter
while outside of rivals along the backstretch run, raced three wide into the far turn, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, lacked a final response in
the drive and finished evenly. BEACHGRASS settled inside of rivals in the early stages, saved ground while never far back, could not keep pace in the
stretch drive and did not threaten. SHERILINDA tracked the decent pace from the inside, lost ground on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave
way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PLAYING HARDBALL showed speed leaving the break and was sent to the early lead, was well handled through solid fractions into the turn, rated nicely
while carving quick fractions to the quarter marker, was set down in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, kept to task under steady
urging to the sixteenth-marker, was all out in deep stretch to hold off oncoming rivals, was fully extended at the finish and held on for the win. ASANO'S
BACK settled off of the fast early pace, gained ground outside of rivals on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong
marker, closed with a rush in deep stretch and just missed for the win while getting up in time to secure the place. LESSONS OF AUTISM took back off of
the quick early pace, saved ground along the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, came in tight in upper stretch and was blocked behind rivals, angled widest
at the furlong marker, rallied while widest in deep stretch and won the nod for third on the wire. SONOFAFINCH was asked to show early speed and was
prominent leaving the break, could not match strides early with PLAYING HARDBALL and pressed that rival into the turn, kept attendance to the quick pace
along the bend, lost ground in upper stretch to PLAYING HARDBALL, re-rallied in the final stages, could not muster the needed late response, was
outfinished and just missed for third. SPEED GRAZY tracked the quick early pace from the inside, gained ground along the rail on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, made a mild late bid but was outkicked in the final strides. ZIPPY BABY chased the fast early pace while three wide, gained ground on the turn,
lost position into the stretch and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, showed the way
to the quarter marker, was set down at the furlong pole, held safely to the sixteenth-marker, was all out in deep stretch to hold off oncoming rivals, was fully
extended at the finish and lasted on the wire for the win. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE settled off of the early pace while saving ground, inched closer along the
backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, made a steady gain to mid-stretch, tipped two wide inside of the furlong pole, surged in deep
stretch and just missed for the win while holding for second. ASSIGNATION was unhurried early, maintained a two wide path to the second turn while
making a steady advance, angled four wide nearing the furlong pole, finished well while widest in the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top two and was up
in the final strides to secure third. REV REE stalked the moderate early pace from a two wide path, kept attendance to NAUGHTY NADINE through the
backstretch run, chased the pacesetter along the second turn and into the drive, lacked the needed response while within aim into deep stretch, was
outfinished in the final stages and was just edged for third. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) tracked the early pace while outside of rivals, raced three wide into the
backstretch run, was well placed into the far turn, maintained that three wide path into upper stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and weakened in the
final stages.

CHICAGO SOLDIER (IRE) close up in the early stages, was well placed while two wide into the backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn, tipped
two wide for the drive, advanced on HICKORY WIND nearing the furlong pole, drew to even terms with that rival nearing the sixteenth-marker, made a final
push in deep stretch to get by the stubborn HICKORY WIND and held in a drive at the finish. EL JOY was allowed to settle, improved position on the far turn
while three wide, was roused five wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong pole, responded to urging in deep stretch and just missed for the
win in the final strides, while getting the nod on the wire for second. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, settled in
the second flight while saving ground through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the far turn, rallied at mid-stretch, closed well into deep stretch,
was outfinished in the final strides and just missed for second, while holding for third. HICKORY WIND broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well
handled through decent fractions into the backstretch run, set all of the pace to the quarter marker, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, felt pressure from
CHICAGO SOLDIER inside of the furlong pole, met that bid to deep stretch, battled stubbornly into the final stages and grudgingly gave way in the final
strides, while just missing for the minor awards. ALGERIA (IRE) was prominent in the early running, took back along the backstretch run and tracked the
decent pace to the far turn, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the drive, ran evenly to the furlong pole, mounted a late rally,
encountered traffic in deep stretch and could not muster the needed late response. RACKATAPTAP forwardly placed in the early running, raced widest into
the first turn then was forced out leaving the seven-furlong pole, recovered into the backstretch run and tracked the pace while four wide to the half-mile
pole, was steered two wide into the second turn, swung four wide into the lane, was outrun to mid-stretch, made a mild late rally in deep stretch but needed
more in the final stages. RULER OF ANGELS was allowed to settle, raced outside of a rival through the backstretch run, was coaxed along three wide into
the far turn and did not offer a response in the stretch. PORT O' CALL was content to trail early on, improved position along the backstretch run, was caught
four deep into the far turn, slipped to the two path into upper stretch and did not factor in the drive. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE settled toward the rear,
saved all of the ground to the far turn and did not threaten. YOU KIDDING ME was forwardly placed in the early stages, raced three wide between rivals into
the first turn, drifted out and impeded rivals leaving the seven-furlong marker, settled into the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace to the far turn,
kept attendance to HICKORY WIND to the quarter marker, weakened in upper stretch, came in tight heading to the sixteenth-marker, took up and was
shuffled back approaching deep stretch and gave way in the final stages. DANCE COMPANY was forwardly placed in the early running, was forced out by a
drifting YOU KIDDING ME leaving the seven-furlong marker, took back off of the decent pace and maintained a two wide path to the far turn, was asked for
run four wide into the drive and did not mount a late bid.

TIGER IN MY TANK chased from mid-pack early on, raced three wide to the quarter marker, rallied into upper stretch, took command at the furlong marker,
drew to a clear lead nearing the sixteenth-pole, came under pressure in deep stretch from HALO RANDO, kept to task in the final strides and just lasted for
the win. HALO RANDO broke in at the start, bumped DAD'S JUBILEE and was off a bit slowly, chased from the rear into the turn, gained ground while three
wide along the bend, continued that rally and loomed at the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth, pressured TIGER IN MY TANK in deep
stretch but could not get by in the final strides and missed for the win, while holding safely for second. CAPO LUIGI lost his path at the start and was off a
step slowly, chased the solid early pace from towards the rear, raced widest along the turn, swung five wide into the drive and lost ground nearing the
furlong marker, closed willingly in deep stretch, could not reel in the top pair in the final stages and was clear of the rest for third. CORAL CAT broke sharply
and sped to the early lead, set a quick pace into the turn, rated nicely along the bend and slowed the pace down nearing the quarter marker, came under
pressure approaching mid-stretch, was overtaken by TIGER IN MY TANK at the furlong pole and faltered in deep stretch. HERMELINDA'S FANCY tracked
the solid early pace while outside of rivals, gave chase while four wide along the turn, raced a bit in tight and waited approaching the top of the stretch, came
four wide into the drive, found room into upper stretch, lost a bit of ground at the furlong marker, finished evenly in the final stages and lacked a late rally.
DRUM BUNNY lost her path at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed and trailed into the turn, raced two wide along the bend, was roused six wide
into the drive, improved position in the final furlong and offered a mild late bid. DRIVE BY raced close to the solid early pace, kept attendance to CORAL
CAT along the turn, raced two wide into the drive, lost a bit of ground at mid-stretch, could not muster a late response and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
SADIE BLUEGRASS broke alertly, took back to track the fast early pace and raced outside of rivals into the turn, gained ground two wide along the bend,
was roused three deep into the stretch, advanced at mid-stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, responded to steady urging and closed well
approaching the sixteenth-marker, reeled in SASSY NATURE in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. SASSY NATURE showed good early
speed leaving the break, set a fast pace into the turn and drew to a clear lead heading into the bend, set quick fractions to the quarter marker, kept to task
while on a clear lead into the stretch, was asked for more nearing the sixteenth-pole, drifted out under firm urging approaching deep stretch, could not hold
off the oncoming winner in the final strides and held safely in the end for second. CHANCERY WAY broke out at the start and crowded BIG SIS LITTLE SIS,
chased the fast early pace into the turn, chased outside of the pacesetter along the bend and made a mild gain on SASSY NATURE nearing the quarter
pole, lost ground to that rival into upper stretch, could not muster a final response in the drive and was outfinished in deep stretch, while holding for third.
SMILING MOLLY tracked the fast pace from the inside, saved ground to the quarter marker, mounted a rail bid in upper stretch and came within aim at the
furlong marker, lacked the needed late response in the final sixteenth, was outkicked in the final stages and missed for third. BIG SIS LITTLE SIS was
crowded at the start by CHANCERY WAY and was off a step slowly, chased from the second flight in the early stages, improved position while two wide
along the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole, rallied in the final stages but needed more in deep stretch.
TAMANTARI lacked early speed, saved ground to the top of the lane, tipped two wide for the drive, showed good late interest in the stretch but was unable
to threaten. ROUSING JEWEL chased the fast early pace while outside of rivals, was steered three wide into the stretch and did not threaten.
MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN chased from the inside, saved ground to the top of the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
BOB'S BLUE MOON broke quickly and managed to avoid contact with WINNING LOVER who came over after the break, then took command of the early
pace, raced well in hand to the turn, responded when roused at the top of the stretch and drew off to an easy victory. WINNING LOVER broke inward at the
start, stalked the pacesetter to the turn, was unable to keep pace when that one quickened away but was second best. TOWN PERFORMER raced close
up while saving ground, made a move through the turn and loomed a threat at the three-sixteenths marker then could not threaten the winner and was
outfinished for the place. DINOS DIXIE squeezed after the break, was keen to go and moved to the outside for racing room and was soon part of the trio in
the tracking position, was green and a bit hard to place heading to the turn, launched an outside rally nearing the quarter marker, came into the stretch three
wide and gave way in the drive. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF broke in and was off a beat slow, raced near the rear of for the first quarter mile while saving
ground, struggled to keep up through the turn, kept to task but made little forward progress. BUY THE RUMOR broke alertly but then lagged behind the field
down the backstretch, was asked to pick up the pace while racing three wide through the turn but was unable to make an impact. WHENTHEFOGLIFTS
broke well then raced mid-pack down the backstretch, came under a ride passing the three-furlong marker and was unable to muster a rally.

Footnotes
ANITANEWMERCEDES hustled to the front and gained the early lead, maintained a slight advantage while setting modest fractions, quickened as the field
turned for home, lost the lead briefly to CAISSON in mid-stretch, came again in the final stages and surged ahead to win in a game effort. CAISSON broke
well then seized the rail going into the first turn, settled nicely just off the pace, got a dream trip on the rail through the far turn then rallied, held a brief lead
in the stretch then was out-gamed for the win, while holding for second. ONE FAST BRO made no effort to show speed from the break, was still in the back
of the pack going into the far turn, improved position while getting a good trip in the two path through the far turn, made a strong rally down the stretch but
was unable to find a clear path in deep stretch and had to settle for third. AUSPICIOUS STYLE broke well and moved into early contention while in hand,
was a constant shadow to the outside of ANITANEWMERCEDES pressing the slow pace, was set down as the field turned for and responded well but came
up a bit short. ENOS SLAUGHTER raced close up and under cover through the early going, was boxed in through the far turn, fanned four wide into the
stretch and staged a furious rally but was too late. SETTECENTO broke well, was up close but four wide and racing on the wrong lead through the
clubhouse turn, pulled the rider to within a length of the lead down the backstretch, was still wide through the far turn and came into the stretch in the stretch
five or six wide, had trouble changing leads and finished somewhat evenly to the wire. TABLE FOR TWO went three wide through the first turn, was content
to sit mid-pack down the backstretch, continued to race wide through the far turn, was set down with three furlongs but was unable to make any impact
down the stretch. SUPERMAZEL was fractious in the gate then hopped at the start and was off slowly, pulled on the rider through the first turn, raced on the
rail and behind horses through the turn, lost some position then had some response when asked turning for home but was unable to quicken enough to
make any impact. SEA OF LIBERTY trailed into the clubhouse turn, took a three wide path through the far turn, swung wide into the stretch, finished evenly
and did not factor.

Footnotes
DAWN AT LAST was hustled to the front then taken in hand, led the field through quick fractions while always traveling well, opened up the lead when
roused in the stretch and won as the rider pleased. SOO BROOKLYN lagged behind in the early going, saved ground then found some momentum heading
into the turn, got clear run between horses through the turn and into contention approaching the quarter pole, swung out to the middle of the track for racing
room then ran on well to just get up for second. SQUARE FUN broke best then settled into tracking position, was being asked to keep pace from the
nine-sixteenths pole, made up some ground on the leader through the turn while racing three wide, weakened in the drive, lost contact with DAWN AT LAST
in the final stages and nailed on the line for second, while holding safely for third. GRAZED N' CONFUSED broke well, chased the pacesetter while racing in
hand and just to the outside, made a bid approaching the quarter pole but was rebuffed, kept on but tired just past the furlong marker and was outfinished
for a minor award. STAN'S STARLET slow into stride, raced three wide and in the middle of the pack for the first quarter mile, held position through the turn
then had nothing to offer in the stretch. SOUTHERN BLESSING was bumped hard by MOJAVE PRINCESS after the break then steadied when that one
also took the path attempting to get to the rail, struggled to keep up down the backstretch despite the rider's best efforts and was done after a half. MOJAVE
PRINCESS broke inward and slammed into SOUTHERN BLESSING, angled to the rail then rushed up to better position down the backstretch, was under a
ride heading into the turn, was spent passing the three-sixteenths and faded.
