TURBO POWER broke in front and drifted outward, set all the pace and drew clear late under strong handling. MY BUDDY MICAH was restless in the gate,
pressed the pace two wide and finished second best. SOMETHING ON TAP also restless in the gate, stalked the pace into the stretch, swung wide and
went evenly near mid track. NIKAO failed to menace. AGNELLO CITY was restless in the gate, had good early speed then faded. BIG TIME FLIRT was no

Footnotes
EMERSON JONES was hustled up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and lasted under right handed urging. HELLO SWEETS
stalked the pace near the inside, shifted out to the seven path entering the stretch and was steadily gaining ground late. CROSSED UP allowed to settle,
drifted to the six path in the stretch and closed some ground late. SONNET chased the winner two wide, swung wide and lost ground. BISCAYNE BAY
hopped at the start and was no factor. FABULOUS CLOWN well placed, faded in the stretch. CHLOES ANGEL trailed.
