edged up in the final strides. SONG OF INDY chased the pace just off the rail, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the

Footnotes
THAT'S MY CAT allowed to settle, moved up inside through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, waited, came through inside when clear, then angled
three wide, made a steady gain, edged ahead and lasted. ALHAAN allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled widest into the
stretch, made a steady gain and missed. SOME KIND OF CRAZY set the pace on the inside, shook clear at the furlong marker, then was no match for the
winner and held the show. I'M HEADING EAST well placed and three wide, gained a striking position through the turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, then weakened late and held a share. LT. LYDIA tracked the pace, raced boxed through the turn, steadied waiting for room, then came through
inside and flattened out. BETHPAGE mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. LUMI stalked
the pace on the outside and faded through the turn. FREEDOM'S ALLURE mid pack, held position four wide through the turn and faded into the stretch.

HE'S A GOOD DANCER never far back, moved up inside through the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late.
ROUND OF APPLAUSE mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
SLIPPERY WHEN WET allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened, gaining the show.
UP FOR THE CHANCE stalked the pace early, tracked that one through the second turn on the two path, bid outside the leader into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. BRICK TOWN pulled to the lead through the first turn, drew off down the backstretch, then faded the final furlong. CONRADO
fractious in the gate, showed little. SAN MARCO CITY passed a tiring rival. I ONCE STOOD ALONE well placed and outside, held position three wide
through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.

PAYNTED WARRIOR rated close up and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady
gain, shook clear and held. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY mid pack, looped up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed
well for the place. MORNING MARCH well placed, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, flattened and gained the
show. EPIC LUCK mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, drifted in and improved his position. JOSH'S
HONOR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. PURE SPRING was no factor.

Footnotes
TIZ PROMISING RVF allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and drove
clear late. LIGHTNING ROUND well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. WINDY CITY GIRL unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide
into the stretch and evened out. MIDNIGHT FROST mid pack, saved ground through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, steadied, then came through
when clear, moved up to gain a short lead at the furlong marker, then weakened and held a share. BEAUTIFUL STAR mid pack, moved up two and three
wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC well placed and inside, held position on the
two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. FAST FASHION sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into
the stretch, then faded the final furlong. ANTIGONE was never invovled.
