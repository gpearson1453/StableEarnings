position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten that one and held the place. GOLDEN SODA
bumped at the start, was well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and
missed the place. BEACH HOLIDAY unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had a mild gain.
LIGHTNING CHARLIE never far back, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, closed willingly and missed the
show. ON HIS TOES well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally.

Footnotes
WHISKEYMAC tracked the pace well back, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path, gaining a short lead, then
drew off and was kept to the task. CANTSTEALMYTHUNDER set the pace off the rail, shook clear three wide through the second turn, drifted out into the
stretch, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. PAT'SSEWINGMACHINE bumped at the start, moved up on the two path through
the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. RIPKEN mid pack, looped three and four wide through the second turn,
fanned five wide into the stretch and flattened out. BLUE COSMO stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and
faded. ROENICK allowed to settle, looped four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and improved his position. QUICK QUICK WHIT
unhurried, moved up inside through the second turn, came through inside of rivals and had no rally. DR. HYDE was no factor, inside. IOLA'S BLACK mid
pack and between, was through after a half.

DREAMING OF KONA well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in, dueled with
and exchanged bumps with CLOSETHEGAME SUGAR, edged ahead of that one and held. CLOSETHEGAME SUGAR rated close up and outside, gained
a short lead on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, dueled with DREAMING OF KONA, drifted out exchanging bumps with that
one and lacked the needed late kick. WHERE IS MIKE pinched back at the start, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch,
drifted in and could not gain the final furlong. HOUSEBUILDER broke out at the start, was allowed to settle, angled out through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch and closed for a share. DANGEROUS RIDE broke in at the start, and was allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came
three wide into the stretch and evened out. PLAYING FOR KEEPS sprinted to a clear lead early, then faded through the turn. HAL tracked the pace, held
position inside through the turn, angled out into the stretch and faded. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
COURT AND SPARK unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong
marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. KEYSTONE HANK allowed to settle, looped two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the
stretch and closed well for the place. MILITARY DRILL well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
flattened out. WROTE IN STONE tracked the pace, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong.
JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, was blocked and could not gain.
GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) ran evenly, inside. STRAIGHTOUTADUTTON sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, then faded in the lane.
