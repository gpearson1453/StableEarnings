Footnotes
WEST BAY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear in
the lane. WATER TO WINE pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn and could not go with the
winner in the stretch but kept on to the finish. BURN BOSS led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the bend and was
caught entering the stretch but chased the winner home from there. HE'S CONNECTED raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening
quarter, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the lane. NOT A DANCE stalked the pacesetter between horses up the backstretch,
saved ground around the bend and faded in the stretch. FALCONITE stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to track the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and tired in the lane. FINBARFUREY pulled up shortly after leaving the gate and was vanned off after
walking onto the van. NORTHERN COCKTAIL hopped up leaving the gate, pulled up in the opening furlong and was vanned off after walking onto the van.

GYPSY WIFE saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the bend
and dueled gamely to the wire to hold the win. INTENSE COMPANY (IRE) saved ground early, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the
three path coming around the far turn and dueled in the lane but could not go by the winner. LATIN NIKKITA raced in the two path around the first turn,
trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path, began a bid while switching inside in upper stretch and gained ground late.
FALL MOON raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the three path and finished
evenly while never threatening. HURRICAIN HUNTER raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and made no bid. TOM'S GIRL saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on
the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and faded from there.
