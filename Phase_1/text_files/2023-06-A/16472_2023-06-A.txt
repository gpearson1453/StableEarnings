Footnotes
THE BEAT got away alertly, cleared the field and shifted in to set the pace, soon faced pressure from an outside foe, was challenged turning for home,
kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe. BORKAN lacked room in behind the leader and eventual winner and was put to a firm hold by the rider early, lost
ground heading into the turn, swung out for the drive, was gaining but too late. GIVE EM HECK BECK pressed the eventual winner from between runners
coming the five-eighths, dueled late on the turn, flattened out in the stretch. BODYMOOR HEATH was forwardly-placed stalking from outside, began to
weaken at the three-eighths traveling three wide, faded in the lane. CHROME KING was outpaced, swung five to six wide for the stretch run and was never
near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
DAZZLING MIST attended the pace from between runners up the backstretch, dueled outside a foe on the turn, took command about the three-sixteenths,
drew clear in mid- to late-stretch. LOAD ABROAD was urged forward inside the early leader to take over and set the pace, faced pressure into the turn
dueling late on that bend and into upper stretch, was overtaken about the three-sixteenths, weakened inside the final furlong but held second. FLORIST
settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came out a bit in mid-stretch and ran on evenly late. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE stalked from outside three to four
wide, dropped back on the turn, went evenly in the stretch.

ADRIEN'S AURORA settled off the leaders tracking inside, bid up the rail coming to the quarter pole, was in command in upper stretch and drew clear.
EXAMINER settled near the inside at the rear, came out in upper stretch, was second best. TALKIN MALICE veered out badly at the start, moved forward to
pursue the pace from outside, engaged the leader dueling outside three to four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. LET THE BOY SING was urged at
the start, chased the pace bumping a rival early while moving out a bit, went in the three to four path on the turn and weakened. JUMEIRAH COAST raced
outside at the back going about four wide into the turn, swung eight deep, was not a threat. VISION QUEST was urged forward to the lead and set the early
pace, was engaged on the turn dueling inside a foe on then just off the rail, came up empty in the stretch. NO SUPAH FOR YOU was bumped outward in
the early going, raced mid-pack three to four wide on the turn swinging seven deep for the drive, failed to menace.

Footnotes
AMUSING WAY broke sharply, dictated terms racing in the clear and off the rail, faced a mild challenge from a rival turning for home, turned back that one
in upper stretch and cleared off again then held safe. TOOL TIME was forced out just a bit at the start, settled off the leader, took closer order heading into
the turn going four to five wide on that bend, drew nearly even by the top of the stretch, lost ground on the eventual winner to mid-stretch but kept on late.
SPOT ON DUDE chased the leader from just off the fence, came out in late stretch and held show. SPORTSCARR was in a bit tight briefly up the
backstretch along the rail, was ridden along throughout but only went evenly. ESTIFRAAD chased from between runners early, moved out for the stretch run
and was carried out further in late stretch. MANFORALLSEASONS raced outside off the pace, swung six wide, made no bid. HIGH FLYIN TIGER was
outpaced and never a threat.

ASYOUBELIEVE stalked the leader from outside, moved closer three to four wide on the turn, edged past late under moderate urging. STONE CARVER set
the pace in the clear racing off the rail, was challenged in upper stretch, fought on but was simply outfinished while game in defeat. QUINTO SOL bumped
with a rival early, switched outside a rival late up the backstretch, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, was best of the rest while no match for the
top pair. MASKWECIS bumped with a rival early, chased from inside, ran on evenly. ABOVE AND BEYOND switched off the inside early up the backstretch,
raced off the rail, failed to rally.

Footnotes
ALL RUN was a bit awkward into stride while being forced in a bit, was outpaced early, advanced willingly on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch,
rallied past in late stretch. H K RAPPER attended the pace from between runners early then inside foes in the two to three path, fought on and held second.
DADDY'S PEPPER attended the pace three to four wide between runners, dueled into upper stretch, was outkicked but game in defeat. KAPTAIN
KOWBOY got away alertly, was prominent racing outside four to five wide, lacked the needed late kick. BRODY'S PAL switched off the inside midway up
the backstretch, failed to menace. ENEMY LINES was urged from the break, chased briefly inside, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
CUBAN COBRA set the pace inside, moved well clear on the turn, shortened stride late but held safe under steady handling. AMERICAN BLAZE hopped
and got away a bit slowly, raced off the pace and off the inside part of the track, was ridden along coming to the quarter pole, swung six wide, was second
best. READYTOTAPNSING stalked from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, held show honors. FLASHIN ACES lacked early speed trailing the
field well back early, put to a drive by the quarter pole, improved inside in the stretch but just missed show. MOHAMAD raced off the pace near the inside,
came out in the stretch, finished up willingly. MONEY MUNCHER exchanged a light bump at the start, swung seven wide into the stretch, failed to menace.
IT'S A FACT bumped lightly with a rival at the start, chased two to three wide, came out in upper stretch while weakening, faded.

Footnotes
FOREVER LADY steadied on heels when placed in tight quarters past the five-eighths, settled back into stride and advanced inside early on the turn, was
held up in behind coming to the quarter pole, bid up the rail in upper stretch, drew clear and was kept to the task. SASSY CINDERELLA stalked within
range, went four wide on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, had a narrow and brief lead in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but held the place. WILD
RUNNIN MAGGIE shifted in two to three wide early, dropped back heading into the turn, angled out past the three-sixteenths, kept on late to get show
honors while missing second. SAYGE'S SPIRIT was forced in coming past the five-eighths by a rival, altered outside that foe at that juncture, was ridden
along chasing in behind while off the inside, was forced out in upper stretch and ran on. JELLI broke outwardly, raced toward the back while off the inside,
improved position in the stretch. SUBLIME EUPHORIA broke inwardly, was urged forward inside to the lead after three-sixteenths, set the pace into the turn
coming off the rail a bit, weakened in the stretch. MIDNIGHT TAKE was outpaced and made no bid racing outside. ANNA'S IMAGE was never a threat
racing off the inside. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
