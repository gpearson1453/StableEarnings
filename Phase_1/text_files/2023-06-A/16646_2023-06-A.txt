STRIKING MOON was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. BE THE CHANGE set the pace but
was headed on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. DIMMI QUANDO was off the pace, moved up on the
turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. GLITTER MOUNTAIN was up close and roused on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch had no rally. CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE was hustled early but chased on the turn and was empty. CRYPTIC CREED was
unhurried early and showed little while outrun.

ONE LAST FLING was away alertly, had a clear lead on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. ONLY BELIEVE tracked the leaders
from the outside, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. SHE AINT NO JOKE stalked the early leader and
was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. FLEEKA was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but was not a
factor. ORIGINAL ME was well back and showed little in a dull effort. SAMETIMENEXTYEAR was in mid pack and saved ground on the turn but dropped
back through the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS SCHILLER was off the pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up in time. BRIENNE OF TARTH was in
touch, forced the pace on the far turn and had the lead in mid stretch but was caught late. MENAGERIE was unhurried early and a factor on the far turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. DONNARUMMA stalked the early leader and saved ground on the far turn but finished evenly.
SECRET SUNSHINE was well back and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. CHARMING AFFAIR set
the pace but was headed on the far turn and had nothing left. BELLE FEMME was in range early but trailed the field on the far turn, was outdistanced and
walked off.
