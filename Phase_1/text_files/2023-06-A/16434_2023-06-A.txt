Footnotes
SHES A SECRET vied for the early lead with NEWYEARSPRESENT, shook that one off nearing the three-eighths poled to open a clear lead and
maintained a safe advantage. ISABEL DE CLARE was allowed to settle in stride racing along the inside, moved up nearing the three-eighths pole along the
outside, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole, then drifted in slightly nearing the eighth pole and continued on well for the place while being unable to
seriously threaten the winner. NEWYEARSPRESENT vied for the early lead from along the inside, dropped back slightly on the turn, angled out nearing the
eighth pole and finished willingly. FREEFORM was reserved off the early pace, raced four-wide and lacked a rally. DOODLE DOO was unhurried early while
racing three-wide and weakened during the drive. THE RIDER OF NEWYEARSPRESENT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ISABEL DE CLARE
FOR INTERFENCE IN THE STRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS. THE HALF MILE FRACTION WAS
HAND-TIMED

Footnotes
L J'S EMMA was prominently placed early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out 4-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly
to be up in the final sixteenth. ANNA'S ARABESQUE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the three-sixteenths
pole but was unable to resist the winner late in a game try. SCATLIE saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, moved up along the inside on
the turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished full of run. SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL was up closed early while racing four-wide and lacked a rally.
FANCY CABER NEIGH saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened late. MENDED WE STAND laid off the pace, came five-wide into the
stretch and was gaining slightly late. BEACH WALKN steadied while in tight along the inside nearing the half mile pole, angled out for room, came four-wide
into the stretch and finished willingly. ROYAL BLOOD laid off the pace racing along the outside, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously
threaten. PERCEPTIVE laid off the pace and was not a serious factor. LYNNA dropped back while saving ground and failed to menace. THE PRINCESS
SAYS prompted the pace while racing two-wide and tired. MOMMY JUICE was in the middle of the pack early, gave way badly and bled.

reserved off the pace while racing three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. SHORTLIST was unhurried early, rallied
four-wide into the stretch and earned the show in a steady effort. KOUFAX saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened late. OLLIEMYBOY
settled in the middle of the pace, moved up along the inside to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out. JOHNY'S FIREBALL was
prominently placed along the inside to the stretch and tired. MOBSTER GUN was close up early while racing two-wide and gave way.

SECRET POCKET settled off the pace while saving ground, swung out to be four-wide entering the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth to win drawing
clear. TRIGGER HAPPY saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when asked but was unable to resist the winner late. GROUP HUG was
reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out during the drive. UNCLE BERLEY
prompted the pace while racing two-wide and tired. GET THROUGH dropped back early and was failed to be a factor.

MAGIC TAP saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by Mr McGregor entering the stretch and quickly drew clear. MR MCGREGOR
prompted the issue from along the inside, offered a bold bid entering the stretch but was unable to stay with the winner late while clearly second best. DR
KRINGLE was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, swung out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. EIRIK
RIDGE settled in the middle of the pack while racing two-wide from between horses and lacked a rally. GAME KEEPER was close up early racing along the
inside and weakened. FIGHT'N READY was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing four-wide and gave way. ST. JOHN'S was prominent while racing
three-wide to the stretch and stopped.

HEARTBREAKER vied with Commander Carl for the lead from along the outside, shook that one off after five furlongs, responded when challenged by
Circle Back Jack entering the stretch, opened a clear lead nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage. CIRCLE BACK JACK was forwardly
placed while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole, then dropped back nearing the eighth pole before rallying again to be gaining on the
winner late. SEVEN FLAT was unhurried early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and was along for the show in a steady effort. MADISON LUVS DUKE was
allowed to settle in stride, came five-wide into the stretch to off a bid and then went evenly late. CARNIVORE was close up early racing along the inside but
lacked a rally. MUGSY MALONE was prominently placed while racing two-wide and weakened during the drive. JEDREK dropped back early and failed to
threaten. COMMANDER CARL vied for the lead from along the inside for five furlongs and tired.

Footnotes
XIGERA stalked the pace while racing in hand, ran down Fiddle to take the lead nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gradually increased her advantage.
MISREAD saved ground while being forwardly placed, angled out for room nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly. SAND AND SEA laid off
the pace racing along the outside, was three-wide on the turn and finished in a mild rally. AIN'T BROKE was pinched back at the start, then was unhurried,
moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out during the drive and gained her best stride too late. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES was five-wide entering the
first turn, raced along the outside on the backstretch, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly. MISS PEABODY came in at the start, then settled in
the middle of the field while racing along the inside but lacked a rally. FAST AND FLIRTY laid off the pace while saving ground and failed to threaten.
CLASSIC COYNE laid off the pace while racing two-wide and failed to menace. FIDDLE saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened.
EIDIKOS (GB) was prominently placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and tired. MINT EDITION dropped back early and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SCYLLA was reserved off the pace, moved up six-wide nearing the quarter pole. surged to the front and drew off to win with something left. MAGIC
BUBBLES prompted the issue while racing three-wide, responded when asked, was no match for the winner but continued on well for the place in a steady
effort. PEACOCK LASS vied for the lead from along the inside and held on well during the drive for the show. SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY vied for the lead to
the stretch while two-wide and weakened slightly late. DIVINELY BOLT was allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining
slightly late. DESERT TEMPEST was forwardly placed while saving ground but lacked a rally. MAGICAL LUTE saved ground while being unhurried and
improved his position. PERSONAL PURSUIT raced two-wide, came out to brush with Destine to Race nearing the eighth pole and failed to threaten.
DESTINE TO RACE hopped in the air at the start to get away behind the field, split rivals on the turn, then was brushed nearing the eighth pole and finished
willingly. BOSS LADY BAILEY was forwardly placed early while racing four-wide and was brushed nearing the eighth pole while tiring. BE HERE NOW
dropped back early and was not a factor.

NIGHT EFFECT saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged and proved best under pressure. HARBOUR BRIDGE was forwardly placed
from the start while racing three-wide and finished in a mild rally. MR. KEATING prompted the pace while racing two-wide, offered a bid entering the stretch
but lacked the needed late response. STAND PROUD was allowed to settle in stride, moved up between horses on the turn, angled out five wide in the
stretch and was gaining late. ANDY CANT settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide and went evenly. GAME WARDEN was four-wide
throughout and weakened. LUNA VIEJA saved ground while being unhurried, angled out nearing the quarter pole but was unable to threaten. GETTLEMAN
was shuffled back at the start, then dropped back, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. MO HOPE came in at the start, then was
prominently placed along the inside early and gave way.
